            THIRD POVERTY REDUCTIONSUPPORT CREDIT


                CREDIT AND PROGRAM SUMMARY


Borrower:            Albania

Amount:              SDR6.9 million(about US$lO.O million equivalent)

Terms:               IDA terms with a twenty year maturity, including a grace
                     period o ften years

Objectives:          The Third Poverty Reduction Support Credit (PRSC-3) is
                     the third in a series of operations supporting the National
                     Strategy for Social and Economic Development (NSSED),
                     in line with the World Bank's strategy presented in the
                     CAS. PRSC-3 supports the implementation o f key reforms
                     aimed at promoting economic growth, strengthening public
                     sector governance, and improving social service delivery.

Benefits:            The proposed credit would help consolidate reforms in
                     public administration, public expenditure management and
                     accountability and social sector service delivery. It would
                     support the country's efforts to increase the Government's
                     accountability, responsiveness and effectiveness. Civil
                     service administration reforms would help increase the
                     professionalism o f civil servants and, together with reforms
                     aimed at improving the performance o f social sector line
                     agencies and the social insurance institute, would thus
                     improve the public sector's capacity to effectively regulate,
                     monitor and deliver services.      Reforms in the areas o f
                     public expenditure management, financial accountability
                     and    procurement     improve      transparency   and     the
                     effectiveness o fpublic spending.

Risks:               Successful implementation o f the NSSED and the PRSC
                     program depends significantly on the Government's ability
                     to strengthen institutional integrity and reduce state capture
                     and corruption.     There is a risk that the institutional
                     mechanisms and frameworks put in place to improve
                     transparency and accountability inthe public sector may at
                     times be circumvented to reap political benefits inthe run-
                     up to the mid-2005 elections.             Political economy

                         constraints could also endanger the credibility and
                         effectiveness o f reforms in public administration and
                         decentralization.    The fact that many o f the core
                         achievements underthe PRSC program have beenanchored
                         in legislation which has been enacted, however, provides
                          safeguards against unraveling o f such achievements in the
                         wake o f upcoming elections.           Furthermore,    IDA'S
                         assistance strategy has been designed to support structural
                         reforms through complimentary investment operations.
                         IDA is also strengthening the technical capacity of its
                         Tirana office to more effectively engage key players in a
                         continuous dialogue on structural reform issues. Another
                         risk stems from vulnerabilities in Albania's fiscal and
                         external balances that could arise from revenue shortfalls or
                         possible declines in privatization related foreign direct
                         investments.        The   Government's    track   record in
                         maintaining macroeconomic stability through prudentfiscal
                          and monetary policies under the IMF Poverty Reduction
                          and Growth Facility Arrangement constitutes a strong
                         mitigating factor. In addition, the support provided under
                         PRSC-3 will be followed by balance o f payments support
                          from the EC. On a longer term basis, the Government i s
                          committed to increasing budgetary revenues through
                          improvements intax administration and revenue collection
                         to help strengthenits fiscal position and external balance.

    FORA PROPOSEDTHIRD POVERTY REDUCTION SUPPORT CREDIT
                                           TO ALBANIA


                                        I.INTRODUCTION


1.       The proposed Third PovertyReductionSupport Credit (PRSC-3) to Albania
for SDR 6.9 million, an amount equivalent to US$10millionon standard IDA terms,
i s an integralpart of the Bank's Country Assistance Strategy (CAS)' to support the
implementation o f the National Strategy for Social and Economic Development (NSSED,
the Government's designation for its Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper).2 The IDA
Board approved the first annual single-tranche PRSC for Albania in June 2002, and the
second one in July 2002.3 These credits established a rolling medium-term policy
framework setting out a three-year reform program aimed at implementing the NSSED,
with specific progress benchmarks and outcome indicators defined and agreed with the
Government and other donors.

2.       The proposed credit focuses on cross-cutting issues in private sector
development, policy formulation, monitoring and evaluation, public sector
accountability and the improvement of service delivery in the social sectors. The
PRSC program was designed to: (i)draw on the best available, though still limited,
information on current living standards and priority needs for the country to develop a
comprehensive diagnosis for its development program; (ii)            identify cross-cutting themes
from the NSSED and help the Albanian authorities address a subset o f pressingsectoral
priorities related to education, health, and the need for more transparent and effective
institutions; (iii)ensure maximum ownership of the program through reliance on the
NSSED mechanisms to consult with key clients and civil society; and (iv) build up
capacity within the country to monitor and evaluate its policy agenda, with due reference
to the MillenniumDevelopment Goals (MDG).

3.       After two years of implementation,the main achievements under the PRSC
programsinclude:

         0  Maintenance o f a satisfactory macroeconomic framework, which continues to
            be supported under the IMF's Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility
            Arrangement (PRGF).




  See Republic o f Albania: Country Assistance Strategy- ReportNo. 24189-ALB, May 28,2002.
  Albania's PRSP was prepared as the Growth and Poverty Reduction Strategy and then launched in
November2001 as the National Strategy for Social andEconomic Development.
  See Albania: Poverty Reduction Support Credit - Report No. 24175-ALB (June 20,2002) and ReportNo.
25889-ALB (July 2003).

        0  Satisfactory implementation o f a pension reform package, including
           substantial increases in the statutory retirement age and other parametric
           reforms to support system sustainability.


        0  Implementation o f measures to improve the contestability of the policy
           formulation process, and to strengthenthe accountability and transparency of
           public sector operations.


        0  Significant advances inthe area o f civil service reform, with the adoption o f a
           comprehensive civil service law.


        0  Important reforms in support o f rural development (land registration, regional
           development plans).


        0  Strengthened capacity to monitor and evaluate the policy agenda, including
           institutional reforms and the implementation o f the country's national census
           and first Living Standards Measurement Survey (LSMS).

        0  Initiation o f measures to improve quality and access inthe education sector.

4.      Areas of limited progress which are the focus o f the proposed PRSC-3 and will
require continued close attention andresources inthe future include:

           Progress on fiscal accountability andthe fight against corruption.

           Reform o f the public administrationand continued depoliticization o f the civil
           service.

           Formulationand implementation o f the health sector strategy.

           Designand implementation o fthe next steps o f decentralization.

           Improvements inthe business and investment climate.

5.      Preliminary data suggest that the NSSED and the PRSC program in its
support have had a positive impact on household welfare and poverty reduction,
althoughthe full extent to which poverty has been reduced over the past three years
can not yet be reliably gauged. A full and reliable assessment o f the evolution of
poverty in Albania over the past three years will need to await the results o f the 2005
Living Standards Measurement Survey (LSMS). There are, however, initial indications
that would suggest that the program has had a positive impact on householdwelfare. Per
capita income grew at an average annual rate o f 5.5 percent between 2001 and 2003. To
the extent that poverty measures have a positive elasticity with respect to income, this
would suggest a decrease in poverty. Preliminary analysis o f the 2003 household panel
survey appears to suggest a positive trend in objective and subjective poverty at the



                                             2

national and particularly at the rural level4. Administrative data suggest an improvement
in key social indicators such as primary and secondary school enrollment and
immunization rates. Improvements are also apparent across a range of other indicators
presentedinannex 2 (policy matrix).

6.      On balance, the implementationof the program supported by PRSC-2 has
been satisfactory.Nearly all of the triggers specified inPRSC-2 have been satisfied. In
instances where the triggers were partially met, the medium-term program has been
modified, in full agreement with the Bank and other donors, in keeping with better
evaluation of capacity constraints and clarifications of existing policies in certain areas.
Overall, satisfactory progress since the approval of PRSC-2 fully warrants a move to
PRSC-3.

7.      Under the proposed PRSC-3, the Government expects to accomplish further
progress in key areas of importance to Albania's economic and social reform
program,namely:

        0    Improvingaccess to land inrural areas by completing first time registration of
             land to at least 80 percent of cadastralzones.


        0    Enacting the revised Law on Restitution and Compensation of Immovable
             Property.


        0    Consolidating the legal and regulatory framework governing civil service and
             human resource management in support of a merit based and depoliticized
             civil service, by amending the public sector human resource management-
             related elements of key laws to render them consistent with the Law on Civil
              Servants.


        0    Consolidating the legal and regulatory framework governing conflict of
             interest through amendments to the existing legislation in the area of conflict
             of interests based on a broader review and consultation process with relevant
             institutions and other interested parties.

        0    Improving transparency in budgetary execution through the production and
             publication of audited consolidated financial statements of the Government.


        0     Establishing     transparent procurement          practices     across    the public
             administration by setting comprehensive implementing regulations, standard
             bidding documents and a user's manual for the procurement of goods, works
             andservices andthe training ofconcernedcivil servants.

  The LSMS panel survey data collected during the summer of 2004 are not yet available. Panel surveys
only contain information on a sub-sample of households. Initial analysis of the 2003 panel data, which
requires further confirmation, suggests that household welfare has increased and poverty has decreased
between 2002 and 2003 based on consumption predictor models, analysis of basic needs indexes and
households' ownperception.

         0   Improving social service deliveryby:

             o Clarifying the specific responsibilities and accountability mechanisms of
                  local self-governments in the health, education and social assistance
                  sectors.

             o Improving resource allocation to priority social services through
                  increasing the share o f total public spending going to the health and
                  education sectors and protecting sector-specific priority areas through real
                  expenditure increases.

             o Providing all students with free basic education textbooks and students
                 from the poorest communities with free secondary education textbooks.

             o Increasing the financial sustainability and transparency o f the pension
                 system by implementing legislation allowing for a phased increase inthe
                 retirement age and pension reductions for early retirees, enacting and
                 implementing legislation requiring external audits o f financial statements
                 of the pension fund and instituting tri-annual performance reports o f the
                 pensionfind.

8.       The proposedPRSC-3would support sustained poverty reduction throughthe
promotion o f sustainable growth and support to private sector development,
strengtheningthe capacity to monitor and evaluate the policy agenda, improving service
delivery and social safety net effectiveness, and improving core public sector functions
and institutional arrangements.          It draws on the second Progress Report on the
implementation of the NSSEDand the related Joint Staff Assessment (JSA)' submittedto
the Boards o f the World Bank and the IMF in June 2004, as well as on recent analytical
work on Albania, including the Poverty Assessment and the Country Economic
Memorandum.         The PRSC-3 would also provide financial assistance to help Albania
close its financing gaps inboth balance o fpayments andfiscal origins.

9.       While PRSC-3 is expected to substantially help further Albania's reform
agenda in support of sustainable growth and poverty reduction, the relatively wide-
spread poverty, the fragility of external balances,the continuous need to strengthen
governance and to improve quality of and accessibility to social services will
command the Government's continuous attention beyond PRSC-3. The next
Country Assistance Strategy, to be presented to the Board in August 2005, will be
formulated around furthering the reform agenda inthese areas, with the possible support
o f a further series of programmatic operations.

economic performance and its prospects. It then elaborates on the objectives and policy
measures included in the Government's NSSED, progress in the implementation o f the
PRSC program supporting the NSSED, and actions to be supported by the PRSC-3.
Finally, the PD presents an overview o f the rationale, arrangements, benefits, and risks of
the proposed operation.

         11. RECENTECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTSAND PROSPECTS

1.MacroeconomicPerformanceandPoverty

11,    Albania witnessed high levels of economic growth over recent years. Real
GDP growth averaged 7 percent annually over the period 1999-2003. After a slowdown
in2002 caused by electricity shortages and floods, growthrecovered to 6 percent in2003
and is expected to reach the
same level in 2004.       The          Figure 1: Real GDP Growth and Inflation (%)
major contributing factor to
the growth momentum was
the gradual      increase   in
domestic             demand.
Consumption                and
investment were supported
by growing real incomes
generated by external flows
of   aid,   remittances    and                         1    -    1                   I

(FDI). The recent pick-up in
output growth also resulted        -15 1

from an      acceleration   in                -Real    GDP growth --c Inflation
merchandise exports, which
increased by 25 percent in 2001-2003, with a noted expansion in exports o f textiles and
footwear. A growing demand for Albania's exports in EU markets contributed to the
growth momentum over the last two years. Improvements in power supply resulting
from favorable weather conditions and progress inthe restructuring of the power sector
have also helpedto support output growth.

12.    Growth has been driven recently by services and non-tradables, with a
slowdown in manufacturing. In
the immediate aftermath of the
1997 crisis, growth was mainly
fueled by a strong performance
in       manufacturing
construction (see Box 1). T
sectors   receded    significantly
during 2000-01, while services
picked up. In 2002, an energy
crisis and poor weather sl
growth across the board, so that
the economy grew a mere 4.7
percent.    A recent boom in
construction, transportation and telecommunications was observed in2003.




                                            6

13.      Low inflation complemented Albania's good macroeconomic performance.
Thanks to the Bank o f Albania's tight monetary policy, the 12-month inflationrate was
brought down from its peak during the 1997-98 pyramid scheme crisis and has not
exceeded the 2-4 percent target range since 2002 (except for one month).


                  Box 1: Albania's structuraltransformationand Growth Accounting

Since 1990, Albania has experienced a significant structural transformation away from
industry and into services. A large part o f this structural transformation took place during the
early years o fthe transition: from 1990 to 1992, the share of industry inGDP fell fiom 39 percent to
20 percent, the share of agriculture increased from 23 percent to 34 percent, and the share of
services increased fiom 33 percent to 44 percent. Since 1992, the share o f industry has remained
steady around 20 percent, the share of agriculture fell back down to 25 percent in 2003, and the
share o f services rose to 54 percent in2003. Within the industrial sector, construction has expanded
dramatically throughout, fiom about 3 percent o f GDP during 1990-92 to 9.4 percent o f GDP in
2003. The substantial structural transformation suggests that transition in Albania has indeed
brought about a reallocation o f resources toward more productive activities. In addition to this
reallocation across economic sectors, the private sector's share o f GDP rose from 5 percent in 1990
to about 75 percent in2002.

In recent years the sources of growth have changed substantially. Declining Total Factor
Productivity (TFP) growth inrecent years was accompanied by a modest rise inthe contributions o f
capital and labor force growth (see Figure 3). The TFP growth rate has been lower than inthe early
 1990s: 2.66 percent for 2002-03 and 6.01 percent for 1998-2001, versus 9.66 percent for 1993-96.
This has beenaccompanied by a modest rise inthe contribution of capital growth from a negligible
0.10 percent during 1993-96 to 0.78 percent during 1998-2001 and 1.62 percent during 2002-03 (as
well as an increase in the contribution of labor, fiom -0.51 percent during 1993-96 to 0.56 percent
during 1998-2001 and 1.07 percent during 2002-03).

14.      There has been a steady appreciation of Albania's national currency. In
addition to the tight monetary policy, highvolumes o f remittances-most                                   o f which occur
in cash, outside the banking system-large                  inflows o f external financial assistance, and
foreign direct investment have contributed to the strengthening of the lek. While it i s
difficult to estimate the extent o f the appreciation o f the lek due to productivity gains,



                                                           7

because o f data limitations, preliminaryevidence from business surveys indicates that the
strengthofthe currency maybehurtingAlbania's external competitiveness.

15.     After several years of tight monetary policy that led to a stable price
environment, the Bank of Albania (BOA) has recently cut interest rates, and
momentum in banking sector reform has increased. Monetary policy had been tight
since 1997, as evidenced by highreal interest rates which stabilized the exchange rate by
creating a highdemand for lek assets and facilitated a trend o f reductioninthe velocity o f
money consistent with low inflation. The effectiveness o f the monetary policy was
limitedby several factors, however, including the spread o f the informal economy after
the liberalization. Inaddition, the authorities pursueda financial sector policy designed
to strengthen, and increase confidence in, the banking sector. This included limiting the
growth of intermediation by preventing lending (and the potential creation o f highlevels
o fnon-performing loans) by the Savings Bank, which accountedfor more than 50 percent
o f the bankingsector, until it was privatized in 2003. The Bank of Albania continues to
exercise its independent role in the implementation o f monetary policy and, since early
2003, has cut interest rates by more than 50 basis points, aiming to ease monetary
conditions.

16.     More recently, lendingto the private sector has been increasingat a healthy
rate, with a low level of non-performingloans (credit to the economy for the first six
months of 2004 was 7.4 percent, compared to 6.8 percent in 2003).          Going forward,
intermediation i s expected to expand more rapidly, with the privatization o f the Savings
Bank and the lifting o f the seven-year moratorium on its lendingactivities. Other major
banks are also expected to pursue more aggressive lending activities and new product
development. Inaddition to the banks, lendingthrough microfinance institutions and 130
Savings and Credit Associations is effective in serving those segments o f the population
that do not have easy access to bank financing.      With the recent privatization of the
Savings Bank, Albania boasts a healthy, 100 percent privately owned, competitive
banking sector poised to provide improved services to businesses and households.

17.     In parallel with these developments, the Bank of Albania has pursued
significant structural reforms aimed at consolidating the financial sector. It has
substantially strengthened its supervisory capacity through the implementation of a more
risk-based supervision process. A Deposit Insurance Agency has been established and i s
functioning properly. Substantial progress has been made in improving the payments
system. The new interbank settlement system for large payments has been filly
operational since January 2004 and the filly automated bulk clearing system i s expected
to be completed by mid-2005. In addition, efforts are under way to strengthen the legal
framework on insolvency and bankruptcy procedures. A collateral registry for movable
property has been functioning well for over three years.

18.     Albania's good fiscal track record is still overshadowed by weak revenue
mobilization capacity. Over the past five years, Albania achieved significant fiscal
consolidation as evidenced by the decline o f the budget deficit from 13.1 percent o f GDP
in 1997to 4.1 percent in2003. This reductioninthe deficit was mostly accounted for by
higherpublic savings, and was facilitatedby efforts to improve revenuecollection as well
as the decision to accelerate the privatizationprogram and to end subsidies and soft loans
to state-owned companies (with the exception o f a few companies like KESH).
However,              fiscal
sustainability     remains           Figure 4: Revenues, Expenditures and Deficit (YOof

performance.

19.     Privatization receipts have been used to substantially reduce the high stock
of public debt inherited from the collapse of the pyramid scheme. Albania's fiscal
deficit has been financed by both foreign and domestic sources. On average, foreign
donors financed about 45 percent o f the deficit, while domestic bankingand non-banking
institutions financed another 45 percent, and privatization receipts covered another 10
percent. The total public debt to GDP ratio declined from 76 percent at end 1998 to 60
percent at end 2003.        In 2004, the authorities used half of the proceeds from the
privatization o f the Savings Bank to reduce the stock o f the public debt to GDP ratio by
an additional 2 percentage points o f GDP6 With a gradual reduction in the current
account deficit and increased FDI coverage since 2001,Albania's debt indicators remain
moderate. External public debt represented about 22 percent o f GDP, while domestic
public debt amounted to 38 percent in2003.

20.     Progress has been made
towards external sustainability,                        Figure 5: Trade and Current

declining, remains at 20 percent o f GDP. Non-debt creating external financing (official
transfers, grants, and concessional loans, all averaging 4-5 percent of GDP) and foreign
direct investment (amounting to 2-3 percent o f GDP) have been important factors in
maintaining external sustainability. FDI inflows picked up in recent years on account o f
large privatizations and some greenfield investment, especially in the oil sector. While
Albania should have no difficulty in meeting its current external debt commitments, the
projected decline in concessional financing raises concerns about the financing o f its
current account. Moreover, the sustainability o f FDItrends i s fragile, as the privatization
program i s nearing completion and progress inthe improvement of the business climate
i s slower than anticipated.

21.      Despite sustained growth and macroeconomic stability, poverty in Albania
remains pervasive. Per capita income in Albania, (US$1,740 in 2003) is one of the
lowest among transition economies and countries in South Eastern Europe. Around 25
percent o f the Albanian population, or close to 780,000 individuals, fall below the
poverty line.      Furthermore, increasing the poverty line by 10 percent increases the
percentage o f poor individuals by 25 to 50 percent, depending on the poverty line used'.
Poverty inAlbania i s marked by spatial and regional dimensions, with rural areas and the
mountain region being consistently poorer than the rest o f the country.                    Per capita
consumption inrural areas, at 7,224 lek, i s about four-fifths o f the consumption levels in
urban areas. Poverty rates and depthinall other regions are around or below the national
averages (see Box 2).

22.      Unemployment is high, although it is difficult to measure precisely.
According to official labor statistics, unemployment in 2001 and 2002 was around 14
percent for men and between 19 and 20 percent for women, while population census
results indicate that in2001 unemployment rates were 19 percent for men and 29 percent
for women.         On the other hand, the 2002 LSMS, under relaxed definition, puts
unemploymentat 16 percent for men and 18 percent for women. A comparison of the
results o f the 1989 and 2001 population and housing censuses shows that employment
rates have declined dramatically during the past decade, especially for men aged 20-29
and women aged 20-39.




7 Poverty figures are based on Albania, Poverty Assessment, Report No. 26213-AL, November 5, 2003,
which utilizes 2002 LSMS data. Preliminary analysis of the 2003 panel survey, which is based on a sub-
sample of households only, suggests that poverty has decreasedbetween 2002 and 2003 nationally and in
rural areas, with somewhat ambiguous results for urbanareas. A full assessment ofthe evolution ofpoverty
since 2002 will needto await data of the planned2005 fill-sample LSMS.

r -                                     Box 2: Albania's PovertyProfile

 During the 1990s, Albania experienced profound political, social and economic changes. Transition
 towards a market economy and democratic governance led to considerable achievements, but it has also
 beenmarkedby ahigher incidenceof poverty, increasinggender inequalities inthe labor market,negative
 trends inreproductive health, a narrowing female advantage in life expectancy, and ruraVurbandisparities
 inaccessto basic social services.

 Poverty in Albania is widespread, affecting one-quarter of the population, or close to 780,000
 individuals who fall below the poverty line. Extremepoverty amounts to about 150,000 persons, or about
 5 percent of the population, who are unable to meet even the basic food requirements. A large number of
 individuals are clustered around the poverty lines, suggesting that even modest shocks could lead to a
 substantial increase in poverty. However, with a consumption-basedGini index of 0.28, inequality in
 Albania is found to be moderate.The 90/10 ratio, another measure of inequality, is moderate at 3.6.

 Poverty in Albania has spatial and regional dimensions, with rural areas and the mountain regionbeing
 consistently poorer than the rest of the country. The poverty headcount inrural areas is 66 percent higher
 than in Tirana, and 50 percent higher than in other urban areas. Sixty-six percent of the poorest quintile
 and 61 percent of the second quintile are rural households, while 34.8 percent of the rural population is
 poor (29.6 percentpoor and 5.2 percentextremepoor).

 Low levels of educational attainment and unemployment are the main demographic factors driving
 poverty. The results of multivariate analysis confirm the negative and strong correlation between
 education and poverty. Primary school enrollment rates are lower amongthe poor and lowest among the
 extreme poor. The pattern is much more pronounced for enrollment rates in secondary school. The
 incidence of poverty among adults holding a primary school diploma or less is double the poverty rate
 among individuals with a vocational diploma or higher. More than 80 percent of the poor have not
 completedsecondary school or hold a vocationalschool diploma.

 Unemployment is a also major determinant of poverty. The unemployment rate among the poor is
 almost double the rate among the non-poor. Among the extreme poor, the unemployment rate i s nearly
 three times higher than the average. A significantly higher proportion of marginal workers (those
 classifiedas discouraged, seasonal and laid offworkers) are found amongthe poor.

 Non-income dimensions of poverty are exhibited through large income and regional inequalities in
 health and education status, as well as in access to health care services, to educational facilities and to
 water and sanitation.

 Poverty affects women more than men. According to the 2002 LSMS, there is also a gender wage gap
 of 37 percent, 23 percent of which are unexplained differential. The unemployment rate for women is
 higher than for men (17.5 percent comparedto the male rate of 15.9 percent) and the female to male labor
 force participation rate i s low at 0.74.

2. Medium-TermProspects and Creditworthiness

A. MacroeconomicFramework

23.     Economic growth is projected to remain strong in the medium term, with
GDP growing at an annual rate close to 6 percent on average during 2004-07. Inflation
will be maintained in its current 2-4 percent target range through sound fiscal and
monetarypolicies. The fiscal deficit will be reducedto below 5 percent o f GDP in2007.
Provided that substantial improvements are made in the business environment, and that
the reform program underway in the energy sector i s pursued, an increase in exports and
private sector activities i s expected to sustain growth inthe next three years. Continued
implementation o fthe Action Planto remove barriersto investment and reduce factor and
input costs should sustain the private sector's willingness and ability to invest. Private
investmentis expected to increase slightly from 21.2 percent in 2003 to 22.4 percent in
2007 (see Table 3). Public investment is expected to increase as well from around 4.2
percent of GDP for 2003 to around 5.7 percent by 2007, mostly driven by NSSED
priority projects. Total investment i s expected to reach about 28 percent o f GDP in2007
(Table3).

24.     The current account deficit is expected to improve over the mediumterm. Large
public and private investment needs suggest, however, that improvements inthe current
account may come only slowly, and would mainly result from further fiscal
consolidation. Reforms aimed at enhancing the efficiency o f public expenditures and
curtailing general subsidies in the utilities sector could improve public savings and thus
reduce the savings-investment gap.         Depending on progress in governance and the
improvement o f the business climate, sustained FDI inflows would keep external debt at
moderate levels.

B. Financing Requirements

25.     Under the scenario outlined above, Albania will need substantial capital inflows
to finance its current account balance, which i s expected to improve from an estimated
7.7 percent o f GDP in 2003 to 7.2 percent of GDP in 2007. Between 2004 and 2007,
gross external financing needs are projected to amount to US$3.3 billion.              These
resources will be necessary to finance US$2.4 billion incurrent account deficits, US$383
million in increases in international reserves, and the remainder-US$5        12 million-to
fidfill debt repayment obligations. Direct foreign investmentis expected to finance about
38 percent o f these needs, driven by privatization of the remaining large enterprises to
strategic foreign investors, improvements in the investment climate, and a stable
regulatory framework.        Public resources will finance 48.5 percent o f these financial
requirements, o f which 51 percent will be obtained through loans. The remainder of the
public sector foreign financing will come from grants. Debt rescheduling and financing
from multilateral institutions (including the proposed PRSC-3) will contribute around 4
percent, It i s estimated that about 2.5 percent o f the financing needs for the period 2004-
07 will come from additional EC financial assistance anddebt rescheduling (see Table 4).

                    111.ALBANIA'S DEVELOPMENT AGENDA

1.GovernmentObjectivesandActionPlan

26.     The Government program, articulated in the National Strategy for Social
and Economic Development, is organized around two pillars: public sector
governance and strong economic growth. It emphasizes policy interventions to
improve education, healthcare, and infrastructure, to address the key non-income
dimensions o f poverty, and to provide a sound basis for long-term growth and
competitiveness.   It also recognizes the need for stronger public accountability and
increased public participation in decision making to empower the poor. The second
NSSEDprogress report, approved by the Council o fMinisters inJune 2004, validates the
Government's strategy of focusing on economic growth to foster demand for labor as a
key to broader participation inthe benefits of economic growth. Itunderlinesthe needto
promote private sector development by improving the investment climate and
strengtheninggovernance structures. Specifically, itunderlines the following key priority
areas for the Government's 2004-07 program in support o f economic growth and
employment creation: (i)strengthening the legal and institutional framework to foster
private sector growth; (ii)accelerating privatization in strategic sectors; (iii)
                                                                                stepping up
infrastructure investments; (iv) deepening financial sector reforms; and (v) accelerating
reforms in tax and customs administration. Concomitant with this, the NSSED progress
report underlines the need to continue structural reforms aimed at improving service
delivery inthe social sectors, so as to facilitate lower income groups' access to education,
healthcare and social assistance services.

27.     The NSSEDprogress report sets the following key targets for the 2004-07 period:

        0  Achieving real GDP growth o f about 18 percent.
        0  Reducing the number o f people living in poverty, particularly extreme
           poverty.
        0  Making tangible improvements in infrastructure and related services, such as
           electric power, potable water supply, and sewerage, and increasing access to
           these services to the poor.
        0  Reducing infant and maternal mortality rates and the incidence o f infectious
           diseases.
        0  Increasing elementary and secondary school enrollment rates and the average
           schooling period.

2. Implementationof the NSSED

28.     The NSSED was launched in November 2001 and, as pointed out in the first
Bank-FundJoint Staff Assessment, represented an impressive and unprecedented effort
to develop a national strategy through a participatory process.         Owing to political
divisions which resulted in three changes o f government in 2002, implementation o f the
NSSED got off to a slow start. In late 2002, the Government began efforts to put the
NSSED back on track, paving the way for the Bank's support to the program under


                                               14

PRSC-2. Encouraging progress was made on a number o f fronts during the first half o f
2003. However, the reform program slowed down again duringthe second half o f 2003,
owing to political instability which culminated ina new Government inJanuary 2004.

29.     I n 2004, the new Government has undertaken significant steps to bring
NSSED implementation back on track and further the participatory process of
NSSED formulation. The main achievements include: (i) continuous improvement
                                                              the
o f macro-economic performance; (ii)the establishment o f monitoring and evaluation
functions in 16 line agencies and the institutionalization o f NSSED monitoring plans in
these agencies; (iii) improvements in data availability and the capacity to monitor the
impact o f reforms through the completion o f annual panel surveys as follow-up to the
first representative LSMS o f 2002, together with the completion o f a national poverty
map and the utilization of LSMS data to carry out topic-specific evaluations; (iv)
advances inthe implementation o f land reform, including the registration o f property, in
support o f rural development; (v) the establishment o f an institutional framework and
processes to increase the professionalism and transparency o f the civil service
administration; (vi) the completion o f privatization in the financial sector; and (vii) the
deepeningo freforms inthe pension system andrevisionsto the social assistancesystem.

30.     Overall, as the third Joint Staff Assessment pointsout, the implementationof
the NSSED during its second year has been broadly satisfactory. Continued
successful implementation o f the NSSED will hinge to a significant extent on the
Government's ability to strengthen institutional integrity and reduce state capture and
corruption, to successfully advance the decentralization agenda, to gain broad support for
envisaged reforms inthe social sectors (particularly health), to improve domestic revenue
collection, andto further align donor support with NSSED priorities.

31.     In parallel with the NSSED, Albania is engaged in a Stabilization and
AssociationProcess (SAP) with the European Union. To this effect negotiations on a
Stabilization and Association Agreement (SAA) were officially initiated in February
2003. Key outstanding issues remaining to be addressed in the context o f the SAP
include macroeconomic stabilization, security, governance, and law enforcement.
Primary aspects o f the SAP dialogue include provisions to support internal and external
security, regional cooperation (Le., through enhanced trade with bordering states),
reduced barriers to trade and external investment in Albania, strengthened financial
infrastructure, and approximation o f Albanian legislation to EU legislation in a wide
range o f areas. EC assistance to Albania has recently been concentrated on: (i)the
strengthening o f the state and the rule o f law (including customs, police and judiciary),
democracy, and human rights; (ii)    large infrastructure (roads, water and ports, airport);
(iii)agriculture and local community development; (iv) education; and (v) humanitarian
assistance.    The next round of assistance under the Community Assistance for
Reconstruction, Development and Stabilization (CARDS) program will focus on public
administration reform and the rule o f law (judiciary, customs, police, and statistics), and
economic development. Significant efforts have been undertaken by the Government to
more closely integrate NSSED priorities and SAP goals for Albania duringthe process o f
preparingthe secondNSSEDprogress report.

                                IV. THE PRSCPROGRAM


1.Objectiveand Components of the PRSCProgram

32.     Within the broader NSSED,the objective of the PRSC programis to develop
and implement policies and structural reforms that improve transparency and the
effectiveness o f public sector management, improve the effectiveness and equity in
access to social services with a highpoverty impact, support sustainable growth through
private sector development, particularly in rural areas, and develop capacity in the
Government to monitor and evaluate policy implementation and feed results back to
policymakers to help inform their decision making process. To this effect the program
has been structured around four components and has been envisaged as a three year
support program, with yearly operations expected to provide budgetary support. The
program's four components are:


        0  Promoting sustainable growth and supporting private sector development,
        0  Strengtheningthe capacity to monitor and evaluate the policy agenda.
        0  Improving service delivery and social safety net effectiveness.
        0  Improving core public sector functions and institutional arrangements.


2. Assessment of ProgramImplementation

A. Main Achievements

33.     On balance, performance under the PRSC program to date has been
satisfactory. Significant advances have beenmade inthe areas o f civil service reform,
social protection (particularly pension reform) and reforms in support o f rural
development (land registration, regional development plans) and, more recently,
education.    Progress has been more limited in the areas o f public expenditure
management and fiscal accountability and has also been modest in the health sector.
Encouraging progress has been made in introducing monitoring and evaluation functions
into essentially all 16 line agencies and developing a more credible data base to evaluate
the effectiveness o f NSSED-promoted policies for socioeconomic development and
poverty alleviation. After the approval o f PRSC-2, progress on most fronts slowed down
owing to political instability, which resultedinchanges inseveral key cabinet positions in
January 2004. Over the past few months, however, the Government has shown renewed
commitment to furthering the reform agenda on most fronts, and further support by IDA
under PRSC-3 is warranted. The remainder o f this section presents the adjustment made
to the rolling framework o f the PRSC program and provides an assessment o f the
achievements under each component to date. In an effort to strengthen the focus o f the
proposed operation, only a subset o f originally defined triggers has been retained as core

Board inthe context ofthe PRSC-2documentation has beenclosely monitored.

C.Evaluation of Each Componentof thePRSCProgram

Component1:PromotingSustainableGrowthandSupportingPrivateSector
Development

MacroeconomicStabilization

34.     Issues: The NSSED considers strong growth to be the main component of
Albania's poverty reduction strategy. Prior to the PRSC program, the Albanian
economy had largely recovered from the negative implications of the 1997 pyramid
scheme crisis and the 1999 Kosovo War. Growth picked up in 1998 and averaged 8.3
percent in 1999-2001. However, the country's overall macroeconomic outlook was still
uncertain. With large import needs amounting to about 30 percent o f GDP, Albania's
exports only amounted to about 18 percent o f GDP, with the large trade deficit financed
by private transfers (remittances).    The current account deficit was high at about 8
percent o f GDP.     Furthermore, the Government's fiscal deficit was high (around 8
percent o f GDP) and expenditures in priority sectors such as education and health were
compressed. Inaddition, Albaniahad a highlevel of domestic debt (almost 40 percent o f
GDP) and relied on inflows o f foreign capital to finance almost all public investment.

35.     A major contingent liability was the status of the pension system: the annual
deficit o f the pension system was about 1 percent o f GDP (effectively financed by the
state budget) and projections indicated that the situation would worsen over time unless
reforms were implemented. While pensions played an important role as a social safety
net for the elderly in rural areas, compliance was low, and high social insurance
contribution rates discouraged willing participation in formal employment and in the
pension scheme.

36.     Reform Program: A stable macroeconomic environment is a prerequisite to
growthandto successfulstructuraland sectoralreforms.Macroeconomic policies for
2004-07 aimto support robust GDP growth while maintaining low inflation and ensuring
financial viability.  To sustain an annual GDP growth o f around 6 percent over the
mediumterm, the authorities intendto accelerate structural reforms, improve governance,
and maintain sound macroeconomic policies. Fiscal policy will include a continued
strengtheningof revenue collection, thus allowing simultaneously for increased spending
in priority areas and a steady decline in the deficit. A comprehensive reform program
aiming at ensuringthe fiscal sustainability o f the pension system was launched (see paras
74-76). Monetary policy will aim at maintaining inflation within a target range o f 2-4
percent. Reserve coverage i s envisaged to remain at a comfortable level, at or above four
and one half months of imports o f goods and services, which is prudent given the
dependence o f the balance of payments on potentially volatile workers' remittances and
official transfers, andthe decline of privatization receipts over the medium term.

37.     Performance under PRSC-1 and PRSC-2: Albania has made considerable
progress in achievingmacroeconomic stability andfinancialsustainability,as well as
inmoving toward a market-based economy. Notwithstanding an often adverse regional



                                              23

environment and episodes o f political instability, output growth has been strong, inflation
has remained under control, and the external reserves position has improved markedly.
Key elements underlying this performance include enhanced fiscal management, wide-
ranging structural reforms, and the Bank o f Albania's (BOA)pursuit o f price stability.
Real GDP growth averaged more than 6 percent in 2001-03 and inflation remained low.
The fiscal deficit (excluding grants) was reduced from 8.2 percent o f GDP to 4.1 percent,
while the current account deficit declined slightly to 7.6 percent o f GDP, down from 9
percent in 2002.           While Albania has been successful in maintaining overall
macroeconomic stability over recent years, further efforts are needed with respect to
fiscal consolidation and external sustainability.

Private Sector Development

38.     Issues: Prior to PRSC-1, critical issues in private sector development were
related to the administrative barriers to business development', the design of an
adequate legal and policy framework, the completion of the privatization program,
and the strengthening and monitoring of the financial sector. While Albania had
started to attract high volumes o f foreign direct investment (FDI), these were mainly
associated with the privatization process; other FDI remains below levels elsewhere in
transition economies. Furthermore, the political and administrative changes inmid-2002
temporarily slowed down foreign and domestic investment as well as reform efforts
directed at strengthening governance and increasing private sector growth. Concerns
about continued weak governance and the poor business climate were further supported
by recent data from the second Business Environment and Enterprise Performance
Survey (BEEPS), covering the period 1999-2002, which showed an increase inperceived
administrative corruption and state capture in Albania compared to the first BEEPS,
which covered the period 1996-99.

39.     Reform Program: Improving governance in general, and fighting corruption
in particular, are the key priorities of the Government's strategy for supporting
private sector activity and economic growth. In this context, policies have been
developed in consultations with the World Bank and the EU. These include: (i) to            efforts
enhance the professionalism and motivation o f public sector personnel; (ii)             measures to
limit the scope for corruption by reducing discretion and ensuring clear and consistent
regulations; (iii)the setting o f high standards for public sector workers; and (iv) the
application o f credible and resolute action against abuse. A major initiative has been
launched to remove administrative barriers to investment.                This presents a unique
opportunity to significantly improve the business climate, strengthen the export sector,
and attract foreign and domestic investors. To create better conditions inthe agricultural
sector, the authorities have introduced a law to regulate land ownership and establish
offices for landinevery district. They also planto improve credit provisioning through a



  Key barriers identified by FIAS include arduous licensing and tax procedures, lack of transparency in
policy implementation, abuse of power by officials, and weak law enforcement. An action plan was
developedin2003 to implementremedial policies supportedby measurable indicators.



                                                 24

new accounting law for enterprises and through improvements in the registry for
collateral.

40.     The privatization process for large enterprises has been accelerated, andfollowing
the successful privatization o f the Savings Bank in 2003, is concentrating mainly on
Albtelekom, and INSIG. Improving the provision o f electricity i s also considered key to
promoting private sector growth. For this goal, and to help ensure that import subsidies
can be held to lek 1.5 billion in 2004 before being phased out completely in 2005, the
Government i s committed to meeting the performance targets o f the sectoral action plan
agreed with donors for 2004-05.

41.     Financial sector reform i s aimed at improving the transparency and efficiency o f
financial markets and the continued strengthening o f the regulatory and supervisory
framework. The sale o f Treasury bills to the general public, includingthrough Albapost,
i s being promoted by exploring various options, including the possibility o f selling
smaller denominations. The use o f the banking system for payments, particularly
salaries, i s also being promoted through a publicity campaign.        Furthermore, as o f
September 2004, over 10 percent o f government employees are receiving their salary
through the banking system. The credit guarantee scheme and plan for providing soft
loans to small and medium-size enterprises will be discussed with the World Bank and
the IMF before adoption, and the authorities plan to request an official sovereign rating
by the end o f 2004.

42.     Performance under PRSC-1 and PRSC-2: Under PRSC-1, the privatization
agenda focused on harmonization of the bankruptcy framework in support of
financial sector reform and the ongoing FSAC. Under PRSC-2, the Government
made a commitmentto implementthe recommendationsof the FIASAdministrative
Barriers Study. The Government establishedan inter-ministerial task force to address
administrative barriers and completed an action plan for the removal o f administrative
barriersto investment. The licensing requirementsinthe non-food sector were abolished,
which i s expected to improve business entry. To improve governance, the authorities
have established and funded the Office o f Asset Declaration, which has begun
implementingthe law on asset declaration. They also strengthened tax appeal procedures
and reviewed and strengthened anti-money laundering legislation.           To improve tax
administration, a new excise law was enacted; the responsibility for the collection o f
social insurance contributions for large taxpayers was transferred to the General
Directorate of Taxation (GDT); the Social Insurance Institute (SII) has assigned social
insurance numbers for all employees for the firms registered inthe Large Taxpayer Unit;
and a new computer system for profits tax was brought on line. The authorities have also
separated the internal audit services and the internal investigation services o f the GDT
into two distinct structures. The GDT has started to provide monthly reports on total
VAT refundspaid.

43.     Major reformsand organizationalchanges within the GeneralDirectorateof
Customs (GDC) have been implemented. The GDC has continued to preparequarterly
reports on corrective measures to deal with problems identified by the internal audit



                                             25

function. The post-clearance control unit o f the GDC was established inJuly 2003, fully
empowered with the legal competence to perform its functions and conduct off-site
audits. Inthe area o f valuation, there has been some progress, as the ASYCUDA system
i s now functioning at Tirana and Durres, and a new valuation system i s being developed
which should greatly reduce the dependence on reference prices. A working group inthe
Ministry ofEconomy has also beenmakingprogress inreducingsamplingprocedures for
transit goods, and specific recommendations on next steps are forthcoming.

44.     The Government has made notable progress towards improving the
enforcement of civil courts' decisions in support of contract enforcement. Albanian
banks are now more comfortable working with bailiffs' offices after gaining confidence
innew procedures andpolicies for the enforcement o f court decisions. Additionally, the
Government has made progress in creating a more secure environment for the private
sector to engage in contracts by creating alternative (out o f court) and expedient dispute
resolution mechanisms for commercial disputes. A new law on mediation was enacted
by the President in June 2003, and a new regime for commercial arbitration is being
finalized.   The Ministry o f Justice is working with the Ministries o f Finance and
Economy and the Chamber o f Commerce to reach agreement on the draft Arbitration
Law. However, the process o f adopting the legal framework on arbitration services is
progressing slowly.

45.     Progress notwithstanding, the private sector reform agenda, particularly on
the investment climate front, remains unfinished and warrants continued decisive
action beyond the PRSC-3 agenda. Sustained efforts will need to be made to continue
to improve the investment climate by further enhancing public sector governance and
consolidating the rule o f law. Administrative barriers to investments will need to be
further reduced, tax administration will need to be further streamlined and reforms to
improve public sector accountability and transparency will require continued decisive
implementation.

Rural Developmentand NaturalResources

46.     Issues: Agriculture has been a major force behind Albania's growth since
transition and continues to be important - accounting for about 25.3 percent o f GDP
in2003. Around 50 percent o f Albania's population (455,764 small farms families) and
four out o f five poor people live in rural space. The Government has helped to foster a
conducive environment for the development o f the rural sector through a rural
development program that included a comprehensive program o f land reform (ongoing),
infrastructure rehabilitation (notably irrigation), banking sector reform, and trade and
price liberalization. Despite the impressive achievements, however, there are still many
problems with respect to Albanian agriculture and rural life. Production systems remain
basic, yields are low, many farms are too small and fragmented to be viable, physical
infrastructure is in poor condition, and private sector activity has yet to fully fill the
vacuum left by defunct state processing and marketing agencies. O f equal concern i s the
severe environmental degradation o f Albania's natural resources resulting, among other
factors, from weak land and water resource planning and illegal logging and fishing.



                                             26

Moreover, the poorest rural regions in the country - Kukes, Dibra and Elbasan - are
receiving little support.

47.    Reform Program: The key pillars of reform are strengtheningproperty rights
and improving access to credit. Albania has perhaps moved further than any other
country inthe region to introduce sweeping land reforms as a necessary precursor to the
development o f land markets. As a result o f this reform, the rural landscape has been
dramatically transformed since 1990 with all collective farms disbanded, and
approximately 98 percent o f agricultural land (546,000 ha) distributed to smallholders.
This has transformed farming from a collectivized, command structure to a fully private
sector with smallholder families farming small and fragmented plots for their own
consumption and the market. Pasture land and forests have mostly not been part o f the
privatizationprocess. Only recently has state ownership been transferred to communities
andprivatepersons.

48.    In recent years, key elements of the land reform have included: (i)the
development o f a comprehensive legal and regulatory framework for land administration
and land market development; (ii)the establishment o f an Immovable Property
Registration System (IPRS) for real property titling and registration; and (iii)a
comprehensive, donor-supported program to provide first time registration to new land
owners. Key actions include completing the first time registration o f land and putting
standardized measures in place to resolve property ownership disputes; finalizing the
draft law on Recognition, Restitution and Compensation o f Immovable Property; and
improving the immovable property registration system and the security o f property titles.
Related actions include reducingtaxes and fees on landtransactions inorder to encourage
landconsolidation. Additional important areas o f reform include the restructuring of the
agricultural research and extension system to meet local needs and systematic land use
planning, especially inareas with highvalue coastal and agricultural resources.

49.    Performance under PRSC-1 and PRSC-2: The performance of the rural sector
under PRSC-1 and PRSC-2 has been strong. Agricultural output has consistently
increased, largely owing to investments in greenhouses, fruit trees, and the processing
industry. Inaddition, there has beena decrease inagricultural imports and an increase in
exports to Macedonia, Kosovo, Montenegro, Italy and Greece.

50.    Structural reforms aimed at promoting growth in the agricultural sector and
reducing rural poverty were wide-ranging and were focused on consolidating
property rights, developing the land market and facilitating access to finance.
Significant advances have been made on completing first time registration o f land. On
strengtheningproperty rights, analytic work was completed on alternative models for
landrestitution and financial compensation and on the potential benefits o f reducing land
transaction costs.    The existing land legislation was reviewed and the Law on
Recognition, Restitution and Compensation o f Immovable Property was drafted.           A
request has beensubmitted to the Cabinet o f Ministers to reduce notary fees and taxes on
land transactions in order to encourage the development o f the rural land market.
Moreover, access to rural finance has been improved pursuant to the enactment and



                                           27

implementation o f the Law on Savings and Credit Associations (SCAs), the creation o f
the union o f savings and credit associations and the strengthening of the supervisory
capacity o f the Central Bank. The number o f SCAs and commercial lending for
agriculture have been increasing steadily since 2001.

51.     Additional efforts have included the restructuring o f the agricultural research
system and landuse planning. Research i s being combined with extension to better meet
local needs, and eleven scientific research institutes were restructured into five national
institutes and five research centers (in addition to two small institutes for Fisheries and
Forestry directly linked to the MoAF). Regional Development initiatives were launched
as the Council o f Ministers established in July 2003 an Inter-Ministerial Committee on
Rural Development in charge o f preparing Regional Development Plans in coordination
withthe regional Qarks.

52.     The management o f water resources and the preservation o f the environment have
also been addressed. In addition to active support for the development o f water user
associations, pilot Drainage Boards were established in the Districts o f Kavaja and
Lushnja inJune 2003 to implementthe Government's policies on flood protection. More
recently, Drainage Boards directly involving local stakeholders (farmers,              local
governments, and businessmen) have been established in each region to identify and
carry out priority investments in flood protection. The presence o f these boards promises
to increase the efficiency and transparency o f the state fund use for drainage and flood
protection. On the environment, a task force has been created and is implementing an
action plan (including surprise police inspections) to stop illegal logging activities. The
MoAF has launched a publicity campaign to raise awareness o f illegal logging and forest
fires. The Law on Protected Areas and two Council o f Ministers Decrees on the
Management and Administration o f Protected Areas have been approved. The transfer o f
user rights o f forests to the communes has beenproceeding as part o f the decentralization
process. Taxes on packaging and on carbon fuel have been approved and the national
strategy on forests has been approved and i s under implementation.

Component2: StrengtheningEfforts to Monitor and Evaluate the Policy Agenda

53.     Issues:. At the outset of the PRSC period, the Albanian Government lacked
the information and data required to develop and monitor policy and had very
limited capacity to evaluate information to strengthenthe strategic orientationof its
overall policy agenda. Line ministries did not fully appreciate the importance and
usefulness o f statistical information to policy and program development and
implementation.     When statistical information was available, there was little internal
expertise and inter-agency coordination available to undertake the requisite analysis.
Finally, the ultimate intended beneficiaries o f public policies and programs were rarely
significantly involved in providing feedback on the implementation and impacts o f those
policies and programs.

54.     Reform Program: The main objective of the PRSC program in this area is to
support the development and implementation of new policy initiatives through



                                            28

improved and policy-relevant monitoring of the impact and effectiveness of
Government programs.            This requires both: (i)the development o f institutional
arrangements and practices that facilitate agreement among key stakeholders regarding
which impacts should be monitored and how; and (ii)      the development o f the capacity to
collect, analyze and disseminate reliable, useful and timely statistical and other data to
monitor and evaluate the effectiveness o f the Government's policy agenda. Specifically,
the PRSC program has focused on supporting the Government's efforts to produce and
analyze reliable statistical information on a regular basis inorder to measure and monitor
poverty, inequality and other key social indicators through the following actions: (i)   the
completion o f Living Standard Measurement Surveys; (ii)the piloting o f qualitative
surveys and service report card systems; (iii) establishment o f policy and planning
                                                  the
units in core ministries; and (iv) the development of a system to regularly monitor and
evaluate progress made against goals set out under the NSSED.

55.     Performance under PRSC-1 and PRSC-2:                   Over the past three years
significant progress has been made in improving the availability and reliability of
data to monitor and evaluate the policy agenda, as well as in institutionalizing the
monitoring and evaluation functions across line agencies. This process has been
driven by a continued commitment of the Government to strengthenthe monitoring and
evaluation o f the NSSED through an increasingly broadening participatory process
coordinated by the NSSED Department at the Ministry o f Finance. In 2002 INSTAT,
with technical assistanceprovided by DfID andthe World Bank, designedand completed
an LSMS -the first o f what is expected to be a regular system o f household-level data
collection. The 2002 LSMS was followed inthe summer o f 2003 by the first scheduled
annual panel survey on a sub-sample o f households and a second panel survey in the
summer o f 2004.

56.     The Data User Group, formed during the preparation o f the 2002 LSMS with the
participation o f several line ministries and research institutions, has helpedto enhance the
relevance o f the information to be collected, to strengthen analytical capacity among
potential users and to improve cooperation among the different institutions. Based on
information obtained during the 2001 census and the 2002 LSMS, INSTAT has
completed a poverty profile and has recently produced poverty maps which will be used
to guide resource allocation and assess the impact o f Government programs and budgets.
In collaboration with internal and external partners, INSTAT has also drawn on census
andhousehold survey data to complete several sectoral studiesinthe areas o f labor force,
gender, inequality and migration. These achievements notwithstanding, the extent to
which line ministries regularly draw on the growing wealth o f data producedby INSTAT
still remains limited and requires further strengthening.

57.     The Government has also piloted a qualitative survey o f access and inequality in
the health sector in the Tirana region with IDA support, and is in the process of
expandingthe exercise to selected other regions with fundingfrom the Poverty Reduction
Strategy Trust Fund, implemented by the Ministry o f Finance. The Tirana pilot survey
has provided valuable insights into issues o f quality and access afflicting the health sector
and was received with great interest by stakeholders across the sector, including



                                               29

policymakers. The Government has also successfully completed a citizen report card
system to encourage greater transparency and accountability in local service delivery
betweenthe Tirana municipality and its citizens. Under this project, citizen report cards
completed by way o f a multi-house survey measured the efficiency, effectiveness, and
results o f public services provided by the municipality. These report cards provided
elected officials and managers with feedback on their policies and program decisions.
The information received also formed the basidrationale for the 2004 budget priorities
and resource allocation decisions.          The process was considered so useful that the
February 2004 Municipal Budget Council Meeting agreed that report cards would be
used again to regularly track, measure, and report service delivery improvement "or
decline" across services over time, andthat management decisions would be made on that
basis. The Tirana Transparency Project has since been replicated by four other local
governments using representative samples of 500 inhabitants to ascertain the views of
citizens on the quality o f services they are receiving.

58.     The Government has signaled an increasedcommitment to monitoringand
evaluatingthe impact of its policies. InSeptember 2002, the Prime Minister issuedan
order2 which required each o f the 12 NSSED ministries to establish a monitoring and
evaluation function. The Technical Secretariat within the Ministry o f Finance was
elevated to a larger Department with overall responsibility for coordinating and
monitoring the implementation o f the NSSED. The NSSEDDepartment, which has been
fully staffed since fall 2003, has the role of helping to establish a sustainable capacity
throughout the public administration for policy-relevant monitoring and evaluation.
Also, inJune 2003 the Prime Minister issueda further order (No. 87), which requiredthat
the remaining 6 sectoral ministries and the 2 state ministries (effectively all ministries)
establish monitoring and evaluation units. Since then, all ministries have established a
monitoring and evaluation function although the actual capacity o f these ministries to
identify key indicators and to monitor progress against them varies greatly, with some
ministries (especially some of those included for the first time in the revised Prime
Ministerorder ofJune 2003) being further behind. Inall, 16ministriedagencies prepared
M&E matrices for the 2003 NSSED progress report -a significant achievement which
would not have been considered possible as little as two years ago. While the move to
introduce a new format and to standardize the information presented in the matrices
represents an improvement compared to last year, issues remain regarding the need to
include targets inthe tables andto make explicit links between the indicators and NSSED
goals.

59.     Several line ministries have established, or are in the process o f establishing,
policy units that are responsible for developing sectoral policies. Some o f these have
incorporated the policy monitoring and evaluation functions into the sectoral policy
formulation units. To strengthen its capacity to monitor and evaluate poverty, the
Government has established a "Poverty and Statistics Monitoring Unit" within the
Ministryof Labor and Social Affairs (MoLSA) which is responsible for the analysis and
dissemination o f information for the poverty monitoring and evaluation o f social

 Order No. 251 "Setting up the leading structures on the implementation, assessment and monitoring of
theNational Strategv of Social and Economic Development. ''


                                                 30

programs. The unit has been working closely with INSTAT to utilize the wealth o f data
from LSMS. Thus, while there have been significant improvements in the degree to
which Government agencies are gathering and presenting data to monitor policy
developments, the ability to truly analyze the data so as to have a meaningful input into
the policymaking process i s still underdeveloped inmost ministries. The effectiveness o f
the NSSED and the related legislative agenda still depends critically on further
strengthening o f the monitoring and evaluation and policy development capacity within
Government.

Component 3. Improving;Service Deliverv and Social Safe@ Net Effectiveness

60.     The restructuring and reform of basic social services remains a priority
element of poverty reduction inAlbania. The country's ability to ensure the health and
welfare o f its population has been compromised by a weak physical infrastructure, major
shifts in demography including significant population movements, internal and regional
instability, limited governance capacity, poor resource management and weak technical
capabilities.

Education

61.     Issues: The primary issues in the education sector are (i)a decline in gross
enrollment rates at the basic and secondary levels of education, especially in the
rural and peri-urban areas;          (ii) inadequate sectoral financing;      (iii)weak
management capacity; and (iv) lack of transparency in the sectoral decision making
process. Albania has witnessed significant declines in gross school enrollment rates
since the onset o f transition, particularly at the secondary education level. Schooling
expectancy for an average 6 year old child was 9.5 years in 1998, 2 years less than in
1989, and 6 years less than the OECD average. The Bank's Poverty Assessment has
shown that educational attainment i s an important determinant o f poverty. LSMS data
show that while net enrollment rates in basic education do not significantly differ by
poverty, gender, or residential location, poverty and residential location significantly
affect secondary enrollment rates.

62.     Over the past ten years, spending on education in Albania averaged about 3.2 o f
GDP, with major dips in 1998, 2000 and 2002, and was a relatively low 10.4 percent o f
total public expenditure. This compares unfavorably with many countries in the region
and has been insufficient inthe face o f Albania's substantial needs to upgrade education
quality and infrastructure. To contain costs while adjusting to declining enrollments, the
education sector in the 1990s allowed teachers' salaries to erode, while reducing the
number of schools, classes and teachers. Unguided by policy or data, these reductions
resulted in large disparities in access to schools, school programs and studentkeacher
ratios, dependingon location.

63.     At the outset of the PRSC program, the Ministry o f Education and Science
(MoES) faced major problems in structure, skill mix, information systems, and decision-
makingprocesses. Its role relative to other levels of government and players was poorly



                                            31

defined. Improving the central leadership and management o f the sector took on greater
significance, given the anticipated decentralization o f selected functions in the sector.
International experience indicatedthat those functions that should stay at the center were
exactly those that the MoES performed poorly-for           example, setting academic and
administrative standards, monitoring performance o f the system, intervening to correct
major problems, and curriculum design. Social assessmentsshowed that beneficiaries and
other stakeholders at community levels distrusted decisions in the education sector. The
alienation o f the public from the sector undermined the demand for education and
families' participation in the provision and financing o f education that could strengthen
students' school attendance and learningoutcomes.

64.     Reform Program: The Government's strategy to address these issues during
the PRSC period has focused on strengthening the sectoral management and
transparency of decision making and on improving the sectoral financing,
affordability and quality of education. Efforts to improve sectoral management are
centered around building the capacity for policy analysis, planning, monitoring, financial
and human resource management and textbook management. These efforts have been
supported by measures to improve the transparency o f sectoral decision making so as to
strengthenthe population's trust inthe education system. Inan effort to improve sectoral
financing, the Government's strategy called for an increase in education spending guided
by credible planning and costing o f key improvement programs and an increase in
recurrent expenditures to allow for the correction o f previously seriously eroded teacher
salaries. Efforts to improve the affordability and quality o f basic and secondary education
are aimed at raising the demand for education, particularly among the more
disadvantaged groups and inrural areas.

65.     Performance under PRSC-1 and PRSC-2: Performance under the first two
PRSCs was mixed. Although education is a priority sector under NSSED, limited
progress has been made in closing the gap with OECD countries in terms o f education
spendingas a share o f GDP. The latter dropped from 3.2 percent in2000 to 2.8 percent in
2003, although the 2004 budget targets a substantial improvement. Due to a need for a
fiscal realignment in2002, the spending targets for education were not met under the first
PRSC. In particular, the targeted real increase in recurrent expenditures, driven by a
planned increase in the wage bill to raise teacher's salaries, did not materialize in 2002.
However, corrective action was taken in 2003 so as to allow for a real increase in the
wage bill and thus the adjustment o f teacher salaries, particularly in rural areas. The
Government has reaffirmed its commitment to targeting public sector resources towards
NSSED priority sectors. The approved budget for 2004 includes a real increase of 22
percent in public education spending relative to 2003, with the education sector
accounting for 11 percent o f total public sector spending compared to 9.9 percent in
2002. (The OECD average i s 12.4 percent.)

66.     Education sector management: The MoES has made some progress on issues o f
structure, skill mix and performance accountability. The ministry has been restructured,
staff have beenreassigned to better match skills and tasks, and recruitment i s now carried
out competitively. A policy and planning unit has been established. The MoES has



                                             32

institutedannual performance audits which are being utilized to diagnose key sources of
its performance problems, with the first audit focusing on internal barriers to more
effective operations, such as lack o f job-specific skills training and effective use o f
information systems. This year's performance audit i s focusing on performance and
output standards for the 11 regional education directorates. MoES failed to develop a
humanresources management planunder PRSC-2, primarilybecause of serious skillmix
problems inthe humanresources unit. This issue has now been resolved, and progress on
this front is expected over the coming year. Significant progress was made on the
adoption and implementation o f an improvedtextbook management policy, including the
introduction o f competitive biddingfor the publicationand printingo f textbooks.

67.     Improving gross enrollment and completion rates: PRSC-supported measures in
this area were designed to raise the demand for education. Increasing enrollment rates,
particularlyfor secondary education, will be a long-term process. However, progress has
been made towards improving the environment for increased education demand,
particularly from lower income groups and in rural areas. The Government has
introduced a policy o f providing free textbooks to all students in basic education and to
the 80 poorest communes in secondary education. In 2003, teacher salaries were
increased, particularly in rural areas, with the objective o f gradually attracting and
retaining better qualified teachers. The qualifications required to teach have been raised
and have gone into effect for the cohort starting tertiary education in 2004-05. A
legislative framework to allow for the establishment o f vocational programs that reflect
labor market needs has been adopted and an agreement has been signed with MoLSA to
share vocation education and training (VET) facilities, thus increasing the resources
available for secondary VET. With EUsupportthe Government has also initiated reforms
to strengthen the VET system. Furthermore the CoM approved an MoES request to
implementthe NSSED objective of extendingcompulsory education through grade nine.
The policy will be introduced inthe 2008-09 school year, the first year inwhich the new
curriculum for grade 9 takes effect. This policy i s designedto reduce the gap inyears o f
education completed betweenAlbania and other nations inthe region and inthe EU.

68.     Increased transparency of decision making: In2004, the MoES publishedits first
Annual Statistical Report on Education. The report includes data on changes in gross
enrollment and completion rates and the distribution of investment funds by level o f
education and district. However, potentially the most radical step towards increased
transparency i s the decision to decentralize a number of functions to local governments
and schools. If service standards are established and publicly monitored, stakeholders
will have the information to hold public officials accountable for the sector's
performance.

Health

69.     Issues: The performance of the health sector has been afflicted by relatively
low and highly fragmented sectoral spending, weak sectoral stewardship capacity,
lack of a strategic framework to guide investment decisions, the poor quality of
service delivery, and physical and financial access barriers to health care. Public



                                            33

expenditure on health care remains low by regional and international standards. Public
financing o f the sector i s highly fragmented and provider payments are still largely input
rather than output based, providing little incentive for the efficient utilization o f scarce
resources. Investment decisions in the health sector, including those to be financed
externally, are generally not made within an overall strategic framework for the sector,
which results in duplication o f effort and in investment decisions that are unjustifiedon
economic or health grounds. Infrastructure development i s far from complete and has in
some places worsened due to reduced spending on operations and maintenance. Physical
and financial barriers to health care remain a reality, particularly inrural areas. Excessive
fragmentation of sector financing has provided ample room for abuse, and informal
payments have proliferated, with substantial impacts on the poor. According to the 2003
Poverty Assessment, Albania's poverty incidence increases from 25 to 34 percent, if out-
of-pocket health expenditure i s subtracted from incomes. Progress toward the MDGs i s
uncertain, with the MDGs for Under-Five Mortality, Infant Mortality and Maternal
Mortality unlikely to be reached under current circumstances. The country's preparedness
for HIV/AIDS (an epidemic for which it i s at highrisk inview o f its young and sexually
active population, its location on drug and human trafficking routes and its low rates o f
contraceptive prevalence) needs strengthening. The ability of the Ministry o f Health
(MoH) to formulate policy reforms and then effectively translate them into action plans
which are consistently implemented remains extremely limited and the sector continues
to suffer from an unclear definition o f roles and o f the respective responsibilities o f the
central and local governments regardingfinancing and service delivery.

70.     Reform Program:         Although the Government had developed a sectoral
strategy document during the early years of the PRSC program, the latter did not
go much beyond a situation analysis and a setting out of broad goals for the sector.
Under the NSSED the Government identified three strategic approaches to start
addressing these problems: (i)   improving efficiency o f the system through better planning
and resource allocation; (ii)investing in a priority health delivery system to improve
access to care and quality of services; and (iii)    targeting public resources for priority
public health programs that have the greatest impact on health outcomes. The PRSC
program was designed to support a series o f initial actions to support these objectives.

71.     Performance under PRS-1 and PRSC-2: Performance on the health sector
reform front has been modest. The need for fiscal realignment in 2002 prevented the
expected rise in health spending as a proportion o f GDP; but even increases as a
proportion o f total public expenditure were modest during the first two years o f PRSC.
Little progress has been made instreamliningthe health finance system, andperformance
inprotecting primary and public health financing was poor: spending fell by around 70
percent in the first round after operations and maintenance budgets were devolved to
local governments as part o f unconditional grants, while spending remained around 35
percent lower than budgeted in the second round even after a PRSC-2 condition that
should have rendered these funds conditional and therefore protected. The background
work necessary to plan reforms in health financing and to rationalize staff and facilities
was given inadequate attention, and task forces and coordinating committees on road
safety and national health accounting were formed in a perfunctory way with little



                                             34

evidence o f subsequent activity. On a more positive note, good progress was made on
the public health front, with the development and adoption of health promotion and
HIV/AIDS strategies, improvements in the financial sustainability of immunization and
continued satisfactory immunization coverage. Overall, the lack o f progress incore areas
where reforms are called for was largely due to the lack o f a well-formulated and broadly
accepted Government strategy for the sector. Over the past six months, however,
significant progress has been made inthe formulation o f a health sector strategy that i s o f
considerably higher quality and more comprehensive than any inthe past.

Social Protection

72.     Issues: When the discussion of PRSC-1 began, Albanian pension authorities
could point to a record of major achievements as well as a series of remaining
vulnerabilities. Since 1992, the Government had reformed the basic structure o f the
pension system by establishing a social insurance system that included distinct pension
schemes for employees, urban self-employed workers, and rural self-employed workers
(farmers). The Government had also established both an organization (Social Insurance
Institute - SII) to manage this and a payroll tax base to support it; developed transparent
supplementary budget financing through explicit, intentional cross-subsidies; increased
retirement ages by five years to 55 for women and 60 for men; lengthened the
contributory period required for full pension eligibility; steadily reduced SI1 outlays as a
share o f GDP, reflecting growth; achieved manageable urban replacement rates for age
pensions o f around 40 percent; and induced many more self-employed farmers to
contribute.

73.     Nevertheless, the pension system at that time remained vulnerable to a variety o f
pressures. The pension system's annual deficit, although declining, was about 1 percent
o f GDP or 20 percent o f the overall deficit. Rural pensions were largely financed by
budget subsidies and contributed to this deficit, while the majority o fthe rural population
failed to make contributions. Social insurance contribution rates were so high that both
voluntary participation and formal employment had been discouraged, with a resulting
low contribution base. Only 1 out o f every 7 or 8 lek o f SI1 revenues came from private
sector contributions. There were more pensioners than contributors - an extraordinary
situation for a pay-as-you-go system in a demographically young country. The share o f
the retired population covered by the pension system was projected to drop substantially
in the longer term (30 years) because a large part of the current workforce did not
contribute. That would create political pressure to expand coverage or assistance for
retirees who did not contribute, puttingfurther pressure on the system's finances. At the
same time there were concerns about the purchasing power o f existing pensions. The
operational capacity o f SI1required strengthening.

74.     The status of the social safety net program gave rise to several concerns.
Anecdotal reports suggested that in some geographic areas finds for income-tested cash
social assistance were targeted ineffectively. These funds are provided by the national
government through a conditional grant to local governments. Related to this was a lack
o f clarity about whether the distribution o f these funds conformed with nationally



                                            35

legislated eligibility criteria inthis core anti-poverty program. There was also a concern
that the benefit structure created an incentive for recipients to conceal resources and
income, making accurate administration difficult, as well as creating a disincentive for
recipients to increase their income. At the same time, benefits were inadequate for
families with no other resources. The system o f social services was underdeveloped and,
partly for that reason, poorly coordinated with cashassistance.

75.     Reform Program: To address the issues facing the sustainability of the
pension system, pensionpolicymakerspursued a reform program centered around
introducing parametric changes to the system, improving the effectiveness and
efficiency of SI1 operations, and developing and introducing a comprehensive
package of pension reforms that would address the overall longer term problems of
coverage, affordability, equity and access. PRSC support to improve the effectiveness o f
the social assistance system centered around developing and launching the
implementation o f a framework for a social assistance system that i s better targeted and
administered more effectively, and that assures better coordination between cash social
assistance and social services programs.

76.     Performance under PRSC-1 and PRSC-2: Accomplishmentsunder PRSC-1
and PRSC-2 were major in relation to pensions and more limited in relation to
social safety nets. Duringthis period, second-round reforms within the pension system
included the adoption o f legislation for a further phased 5-year increase in retirement
ages for men and women; higher ceilings on contributory incomes; a reduction o f 4
percentage points in payroll contribution rates; initial steps in the transfer o f
responsibility for social insurance collections from SI1to GTD with the aim o f improving
the efficiency of collections; and decisions to initiate both triennial reports and periodic

also eliminated price-compensation elements o f pensions in excess o f EU guidelines;
improved performance in collecting pension contributions owed to SII; narrowed the gap
inpension levels for self-employed rural and urban workers; and increased rural pension
levels inreal terms.

77.     Over the same         period, the MoLSA undertook systematic policy and
administrative reviews of: (i)    the geographic distribution o f social assistance spending
relative to the corresponding distribution o f poverty; (ii)  the continuing eligibility o f all
recipients o f income-tested cash social assistance benefits; and (iii)   the administrative
processes followed within these programs. The MoLSA also began to examine the
potential feasibility and benefits o f conditioning income-tested cash assistance on the
availability o f household heads for work at specified times. Progress was quite limited,
however, in implementing the IDA-supported Social Services Delivery Project, which
was designed to develop a policy framework and a sustainable financing system for
restructuring the provision of social services in Albania and to support an expansion o f
the availability of these services within this new framework. Moreover, delays in the
availability o f clean household data from the Albanian LSMS also delayed the
availability o f analyses examining the impact o f Albanian social insurance and social

households.

ComDonent 4: ImDrovingCorePublicSector FunctionsandInstitutional
Arrangements

78.      The promotion of growth and poverty reduction requires strong public and
privatesector institutionsthat operatein a transparentand accountablefashionand
are accessible to all, includingthe poor. During the 1 9 9 0 Albania's development and
                                                                  ~ ~
growth was constrained by weak institutional capacity and by a lack o f transparent and
accountable public admini~tration.~These same factors also contributed to corruption in
Albania.     Therefore, policy development, human resource management, financial
management and accountability, and public sector performance measurement are among
the core institutional capacities that need to be strengthened so that the Government's
programs for poverty reduction can be effectively implemented.

Policyformulation andperformancemanagement

79.     Issues: Policy formulation and performancemanagementcapacitiesare key
to designingsound policies and ensuring their effective implementation. Since the
1997 crisis, progress had been made in building a framework for improved and
transparent public organizations. The Government had taken a number o f actions aimed
at enhancing the inclusiveness and citizen-responsiveness o f Albania's public institutions.
These have included establishing a fully functional People's Advocate (ombudsman),
establishing a Civil Service Commission, and appointing a Central Elections Commission
as well as launching systematic consultations with the citizenry as part o f its NSSED
process. The Medium Term Budget Program (MTBP) and the NSSED process helpedto
develop initial policy formulation and performance management capacities; but these
initiatives needed to be complemented, reinforced and better integrated. They needed to
be supported by procedures and organizational structures and arrangements that would
institutionalize key aspects o f the NSSED process and enhance the contestability o f the
policy formulation process. There was a continuing need to create capacities and
incentives for the management o f public programs, policies and services that focus
managers and their staffs on results.

80.     Reform Program: Reforms in policy formulation and performance
management focus on (i)improvingline agencies' capacity to prepare sound policy
proposals,(ii)establishingmechanisms to support informeddecision makingby the
CoM, and (iii)establishing Parliamentary capacity to analyze the substance of
policy proposals and subsequently assess their implementation impact.                   Actions
have beendesignedto put inplace systems and mechanisms which will help improve line
ministries' capacities to prepare policy proposals based on clear objectives and on well
conceived and carefully analyzed sectoral strategies. Strategies must put in place
mechanisms which generate systematic, probative information on the outputs and
outcomes o f their implementation. To support informed decision making by the CoM,

efforts are centered around establishing at the center o f government the authority and
capacity to ensure that policy proposals forwarded to the CoM provide the supporting
analysis and documentation required to facilitate informed deliberation.

81.     Performance under PRSC-1 and PRSC-2: Duringthe first two years of the
PRSC programprogress was made in strengtheningthe legal frameworkfor policy
formulation, improving transparency, and enhancing Parliamentary oversight
capacity. The law on the organization and functioning of the CoM was enacted and
established a more supportive legal framework for a contestable policy formulation
process. The Government adopted and initiated the implementation o f a strategy and an
action planinits support. The CoM issued regulations which provided a good foundation
for ongoing improvements o f the policy, legal and decision-making processes inAlbania
and established at the center o f government the authority and capacity to ensure that
policy proposals forwarded to the CoM provide the supporting analysis and
documentation required to facilitate informed CoM decision making. In particular, the
strategy requiredthat concerned ministriesand central authorities coordinate their actions
inpolicy designprior to submitting proposals to the CoM and that policy and financial
analyses be preparedon a timely basis to accompany draft legislation. It also established
a Monitoring Information System and prepared a Procedures Manual as tools to improve
the effectiveness o f the Department o f Policy Development and Coordination (DPDC).
The strategy and action plan to strengthen Parliamentary oversight capacity has been
successfully im~lemented.~        Workshops on the MTBP organized in 2003 by the
Parliament and the MoF helped form a consensus that the Parliament should have a
formal role inreviewingthe NSSED, its annual progress report, andthe MTBP.

HumanResourceDevelopment

82.     Issues: To ensure that institutionalreforms achieve their objectives, Albania
needs qualified and motivatedcivil servants working under a merit-basedsystem.
The Law on the Status o f the Civil Servant (CS Law) was enacted in November 1999.
The Government followed that up with the adoption o f considerable subsidiary
legislationwhich, among other things, detailed procedures governingjob descriptions and
valuations, recruitment and selection procedures and performance appraisal processes.
Substantial progress has been made in the implementation of the new legal framework,
but important challenges remain. The implementation of the CS Law revealed some
serious flaws and inconsistencies in the overall legal framework governing public
employment management.5 In addition, there have been attempts by some officials to


 The fust reportpreparedby the Departmentof Legaland ConstitutionalIssues, on TheBudget Process in
the Albanian Parliament: A Comparative Approach with Other Countries, served as a basis for the
recommendations by the Economy and Finance Commission (EFC) during the 2004 budget formulation
process. OSCE is providing assistance to further strengthenEFC's capacity to prepare reports, revise the
organicbudget law andsupportthe commission's moreproactiverole inbudgetpreparation.

 Examples include a Law on the Membersof Parliament (November 1999)which guaranteedcivil service
positions to all former Members of Parliament; a decree (Decree #469 dated August 14, 1995) which
contradicted important provisions of the CS Law by providing that appointments and dismissals of
directorsinministriesandother central institutions are madeby the PrimeMinister,etc.


                                                   38

circumvent provisions o f the CS Law and its subsidiary legislation. Difficulties have also
emerged in establishing productive working relationships between the politically
appointed staffs within line ministries and civil servants. There are also several instances
o f difficult relationships between the highest civil servant ineach ministry, the Secretary
General, and ministers.

83.      Reform Program: The Government's human resource management reform
strategy is centered around three pillars: (i) ensuring increased understanding of
and commitment to human resource management reform objectives,requirements
and implications within the Government; (ii)harmonizing the legal framework
pertaining to public employment management; and (iii) enhancing the
attractivenessof civil service careers. To eliminate ambiguities inthe legal framework
pertainingto humanresource management inthe public sector, the Departmento f Public
Administration (DoPA), with support from the IDA and the EU, i s carrying out a
systematic review o f the relevant legislation and its compliance with the Civil Service
Law. Legal acts which contradict the Civil Service Law will be systematically amended.
To enhance the attractiveness o f civil service careers, the civil service salary structure
will be systematically reviewed for its competitiveness. Furthermore, efforts will be made
to ensure that due process requirements o f the merit-based civil service system are
systematically observed. The Government i s also establishing feedback mechanisms to
allow for the effective monitoring o f the civil service reforms. This includes the
monitoring o f key indicators o f the reform impacts and completion o f a central personnel
registry by DoPA.

84.      Performance under PRSC-1 and PRSC-2: Considerableprogress was made
in adopting subsidiary legislation to the Civil Service Law and in implementing
transparent and competitive recruitment and selection procedures in the public
sector. A key achievement was the establishment of the post of Secretary General, the
highest civil servant position, and the open, competitive recruitment o f Secretaries
General in all line ministries. In support o f competitive recruitment for civil service
posts, the DoPA now publishes information on civil servant positions in the central
administration in its newsletter and some newspapers. The process of ensuring
consistency o f public sector human resources related legislation with the CS Law was
initiatedwith the amendmento f several legal acts. Overall progress i s also confirmed by
the fact that civil servants are more aware of the CS law and their rights; recruitment
procedures are generally known and implementedby institutions inpublic administration
(apart from some problems in local government).                      DoPA and the Civil Service
Commission continue to play an important role as advisory and supervisory bodies. At
least two behavioral changes make clear that significant progress has been achieved in
institutionalizing meritocratic civil service management practices within Albania's
central administration. First, civil servants now regularly avail themselves o f key due
process protections o f the CS Law (e.g., the right to appeal a dismissal decision, first to
the Civil Service Commission, and ifnecessary, to the courts), inorder to preventmisuse


 Key legal acts which were amended include the Law on the Status of Members of Parliament, removing
the rightof Parliamentariansto a civil service position, and a government decree (#469) which repealed the
Prime Minister's rightto appoint and dismiss Directors inMinistries and other central institutions.

or abuse o f civil service managerial authority.          Thus, civil servants themselves have
become a new voice capable o f exerting pressure to ensure that the CS Law i s
implemented as intended. Second, the Civil Service Commission, despite an inauspicious
beginning, has, over time, become more respected as an independent arbiter o f disputes
regardingthe fair application o fthe due process protections accorded under the CS Law.

Public Expenditure Management

85.     Issues: The effective delivery of public services requires not only well-
designed macroeconomic and fiscal policies, but also well-functioning institutions,
including rules, procedures and organizational arrangements that govern the
budget process and shape the incentivesthat influencethe size, allocation, and use of
budgetary resources. Duringmost o f the 1990s, Government efforts focused more on
maintaining aggregate fiscal discipline and less on establishing institutional arrangements
to bring a more strategic focus to budgetary processes. In 2000, the introduction o f a
Medium Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF - now called Medium-Term Budget
Program, MTBP) that operates on a three-year rolling cycle was an important first step
towards a more strategic and policy-focused budget process. The MTBP beganto address
the significant shortcomings in the budget management process: (i) preparation budget
was based on outdated budget norms; (ii)        policy, programming, and budgetingfunctions
inline ministrieswere not fully integrated; (iii) was little policy debate on spending
                                                      there
decisions; and (iv) budget monitoring paid little attention to the implementation o f the
budget program and activities. Budget performance was also hampered by the separate
investmentand recurrent budgetplanningprocesses.Furthermore, budget cuts ledto low
levels o f public spending on key social services. Inadequate spending on operations and
maintenance ledto the rapid depreciation o f existing capital assets.

86.     Reform Program: The Government has made the MTBP framework the
centerpiece of its budget formulation process to prioritize expenditures more
efficiently and to strengthen the linkages between policy objectives and budget
planning. In parallel, the Government is introducing processes and procedures to
streamline budget preparation, management and execution across Government agencies.

87.     Performance under PRSC-1 and PRSC-2: The government has increasingly
been using the MTBP as the core vehicle to prioritize public expenditures and
strengthen linkages betweenpolicy objectives, budget planning and execution, while
introducing a number of procedures to strengthen public expenditure management.
The MOF prepared a draft manual of procedures for program budgeting and started
testing these new budget procedures.'         A database on public investment projects, both
domestically and externally financed, was established in all line ministries. Procedures
and guidelines for recording disbursement and expenditures on all foreign financed
projects, including those financed by grants, were               finalized and issued.       Several
measures were taken to strengthen the oversight capacity o f Parliament in the budget

formulation and execution process.8 Inaddition, the MoF initiated preparation o f a New
Organic Budget Law (NOBL) with technical assistance from DFID.                            Progress
notwithstanding, there i s a continuous needto further strengthen the linkages betweenthe
NSSED, the MTBP and the annual budget cycle, so as to allow for the effective
translation o f priorities identified through the NSSED into concrete expenditure
programs.

PublicSector Accountability

88.     Issues: The 2002 Country Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA)
Report' highlighted a number of areas that required attention in order to
strengthenthe public accountabilityarrangements.Although Albania hadestablished
a legislative and institutional framework for public financial accountability, many o f the
accountability institutions were recent and lacked exposure to best practices intheir area
o f operations. The Parliament lacked the capacity to analyze audit reports and to verify
that the Government was taking appropriate action to address the issues raised in audit
reports. In addition, there were some systemic issues: inadequate cash management
practices; absence o f a mechanism to identify and enforce compliance with the existing
rules and procedures; lack o f consolidated financial statements for the government as a
whole; and weak external audit capacity. Furthermore, a sound cash management system
to ensure fiscal sustainability was lacking. Regular reconciliation o f Treasury data and
data from the agent banks and the Central Bank was not carried out to contain the risk o f
float with the agent banks. Consolidated financial statements that could provide useful
management information such as accumulated liabilities were not prepared. For the High
State Control (supreme audit institution), maintaining independence and avoiding
politicization was a major challenge.

89.     The accountability mechanisms in place for public officials are not yet
performing adequately. The 2002 Business Environment and Enterprise Performance
Survey (BEEPS II), EBRD-World Bank survey of over 6,000 firms in 27 transition
                        an
countries, pointed to a perceived increase in both administrative corruption and state
capture inAlbania since the first BEEPS in 1999. Albania stood insharp contrast to many
other transition countries, where firms perceived a decrease in corruption. Increasing
transparency and improving public sector accountability have thus become key priorities.
Prior to the PRSC program, all line ministries had their own internal audit units, but the
general internal audit system was not fully functioning. Internal audit was always ex-
post. Performance audits, value for money audits, or internal control reviews were not
carried out. This was mainly due to the lack o f technical skills on the part o f the internal
audit staff."   The High State Control had a well-established legal base and functional

independence to perform the audits.        However, its use o f appropriate international
auditing standards andperformance auditing was not fully developed.l1

90.     Reform Program: The Government's efforts to improve accountabilityinthe
public sector are focused on three areas: (i)increasing the accountability of high-
level public officials; (ii)improving public financial accountability; and (iii)
establishingtransparent procurement practices.The objectives o f this program are to
increase transparency, control waste and combat corruption. In the face o f BEEPS 2
results, the Government recognized that the anti-corruptionprogram needed to be stepped
up. Transparency through public scrutiny has proven to be one of the most powerful
forms o f monitoring public officials. Inorder to undertake such closer public scrutiny, the
Government enacted a revised Asset Declaration Law.. A high level working group,
chaired by the Minister o f Finance and including senior officials, was set up to monitor
progress inthe implementation o f CFAA recommendations inthe areas o f internal audits
and controls, the production o f consolidated government financial statements, cash
management, Treasury controls, and the strengthening o f the High State Control's
technical capacity. Reforms inthe area o f public procurement focus around introducing
mandatory public procurement procedures, opening the competitiveness o f procurement
transactions conducted by public institutions to public scrutiny, and strengthening the
capacity o f the staff o f the Public Procurement Agency and the High State Control in
public procurement monitoring.

91.     Performance under PRSC-1 and PRSC-2; Accountability of Public Officials.
The Government undertook bold measures to improve the transparency and
accountability of public officials through public scrutiny by enacting the Law on
Verification of Declaration of Assets in May 2003, and establishing the High
Inspectorate for Verification of Declaration of Assets in September 2003. The law
requires that all senior public officials declare their assets and that their declarations be
verified by an independent inspection unit and then made public.                The verification
process has progressed significantly over the past year. As a prelude to the
implementation o f the Law on Asset Declaration, the Government published on the
CoM's website the financial disclosure statements o f Cabinet members, ahead o f the
deadline set by the law. Furthermore, the Parliament approved and the Government
enactedthe Code o f Ethics.

92.     Public Financial Accountability: To strengthen internal audits and controls,
the Government enacted the Law on Internal Audit, initiated an inventory of
internal control gaps, produced consolidated financial statements and introduced
measures to strengthen cash management and Treasury controls. The Ministry o f
Finance (MoF) initiated the implementation o f the Law on Internal Audit by adopting
internal audit standards, developing a comprehensive audit manual, establishing a
directorate o f internal audit in line ministries, establishing criteria for the selection o f
internal audit staff, and establishing a national internal audit committee. To strengthen

peer review, providing an expert advisor and training of auditors in modern audit procedures and
techniques.

the internal control framework, the Government also compiled aninventory ofall internal
controls, identifying internal control gaps and identifying corrective measures. In the
areas o f cash management and Treasury controls, the Treasury Department, under the
Bank-financed Public Administration Reform project, initiated the establishment o f a
modern information system which will facilitate cash management.           The MoF also
established agreements with all agent banks to improve the reconciliation o f financial
transfers.

93.     Procurement: Key achievements in the area of public procurement included
the amendment of the public procurement law to introduce transparency and
competitiveness in the public procurement process and to bring the staff of the
Public Procurement Agency (PPA) under the umbrella of the Civil Service Law.
Under PRSC-1,following the recommendations of the Country Procurement Assessment
Report (CPAR), the staffing o f the PPA, was brought up to full strength. Under PRSC-2,
the Government enacted an amendment to the Law on Public Procurement which
remedied the key weaknesses o f the law and added improvements in transparency,
particularly by introducing a requirement that bids for public contracts be evaluated on
the basis of objective, quantifiable criteria which must be disclosed to the bidders in
advance o f submission o f their bids. Transparency o f the public procurement process
was further increased though by the PPA's bi-weekly Public Procurement Bulletin,
which publishes quantitative indicators o f the actual performance o f public procurement,
covering both central and local government levels. The indicators report on expenditures
on procurement by different levels o f government and break down those expenditures by
procurement method (Open Tendering, Restricted Tendering, Request for Quotations,
Direct Contracting) for each procuring entity. This has helped open procurement
transactions conducted by public institutions to scrutiny. The risks o f the PPA being
subject to political interference were reduced through amendments to the Procurement
Law that bring its management and staff under the scope of the application o f the Civil
Service Law, thus affording them the protection offered by that law. These achievements
notwithstanding, concerns remain about apparent inconsistent application o f the
improved legal framework, especially with respect to large public infrastructure
investment contracts and with supervision o f contract implementation..


Decentralization

94.     Issues:     At the outset of the PRSC program, the Government's
decentralizationstrategy was at a crossroads and the increased allocative efficiency,
transparency, and accountability of public service delivery (including social
services) targeted through decentralization were at stake. The 1998 Constitution o f
Albania definedlocal self-government as founded upon the principle o f decentralization.
The Constitution also established that the relationship between the state, the regions and
the local governments i s based on autonomy, legality and cooperation. Accordingly, the
law on the organization and functioning o f local self-government (July 2000) established
that the relationship between levels o f government will be based on the principle o f




                                             43

subsidiarity, which proposes that public functions should be assigned to the lowest
possible level o f government whenever no compelling reason would suggest otherwise.

95.     In 2000, a new law on administrative-territorial organization was adopted,
confirming the existing municipalities and communes and creating the concept o f regions
as a second level o f local self-government.               Although prefectures (state regional
coordinating structures) were retained, the previous concept o f districts as an
administrative body was abandoned.                  The Government also adopted a Strategy of
Decentralization and Local Autonomy and set up the National Committee for
Decentralization (NCD,             an inter-ministerial committee)         to   deliberate   on the
implementation o f the decentralization strategy, advised by a technical secretariat called
the Group ofExpertson Decentralization(GED).

96.     The NCD initially took several important decisions on the immediate divesture of
state functions and assets, mainly pertainin to local governments' exclusive functions
and property rights as specified by the law." For instance, the "block grant" introduced
in 1998 to cover "operations and maintenance" of the education andhealth care facilities
was in 2002 transformed into "unconditional transfers" to the local government budgets.
Also, a number o f exclusive functions o f local governments that until 2001 had been
financed through conditional grants from the line ministry budgets were transferred in
2002 to the budgetso f local governments unconditionally.

97.     Despite these initial fundamental regulatory and institutional achievements, it
soon became clear that further implementation o f the Government's decentralization
strategy was jeopardized, due to (i)           the fragmented structure o f the local administrative
units; (ii)the weak administrative capacity (both local and central); (iii)                 remaining
uncertainties in the assignment o f responsibilities and competences to the local
authorities (vis-a-vis the prefects, as well as the line ministries); (iv) the absence o f clear
standards o f services and measurement criteria o f performance in service delivery; and
(v) aninadequate degree o frevenue autonomy and predictability.

98.     Reform Program: The Government's objective was to break the deadlock on
the decentralization strategy and to move ahead, taking into account political
circumstances, limited capacities and institutional weaknesses.                    Supporting these
objectives, the PRSC reform program targeted key decentralization measures, focusing
on the following strategic policy areas: (i)          completion o f the basic legislative framework
on the territorial administration; (ii)         implementation o f the existing regulation on local
government property rights; (iii)        assignment o f specific responsibilities and authorities to
local governments-including            those concerning shared functions (e.g., education, health
and social assistance); (iv) assignment o f an adequate degree o f revenue autonomy to
local authorities, and establishment o f an equalization transfer mechanism which couldbe
immune to bureaucratic and political influences; and (v) adoption of a training strategy
for local public officials and authorities on a nationally uniform system o f accounting,
reporting and management.

  The Law on Local Self-Government generically defines areas of exclusive, shared (or jointly), and
delegated responsibilities to the local authorities.


                                                      44

99.      Performance under PRSC-1 and PRSC-2: The main reform achievements under
PRSC-1 included (i) adoption o f a new Law on Prefects which circumscribed and
                           the
clarified the role o f the prefect exclusively as coordinator o f the regional state agencies in
the territory (consistent with the Statuso fthe Civil Servant) and supervisor ofthe legality
o f the Local Council decisions;            (ii)the preparation ofanactionplanfor thenewly
created Agency for Inventory and Transfer o f Public Properties (AITPP), including the
listing o f State assets to be transferred to local self-governments; and an explicit
budgetary provision for training.

100.     Under PRSC-2, three decentralization benchmarks were successfully completed:
(i) adoptionbytheCoMandtheimplementationoftheactionplanfortheAITPP; (ii)
   the
the adoption oftax reform laws-effective since January 2003;13 and (iii) adoption of  the
a training strategy and the adoption o f a budgetary provision for training local
governments. The government has launched a debate on designing a National Strategy
for Training Local Government, and i s drafting a law on a training agency for local
government officials.

 101.    While on balance, performance on improving public sector functions and
governance has been satisfactory under PRSC-1and PRSC-2, the agenda remains
unfinishedand will warrant continued decisive action even beyondPRSC-3. This is
true in all five o f the major governance reform areas: policy management, public
expenditure management, civil service management, decentralization, as well as legal and
judicial reform. Further consolidation o f the public sector reform agenda, including
strengthening o f the governance system, will remain crucial to improve the investment
climate and social service delivery and to better align public expenditures with
Government priorities as outlined inthe NSSED and sectoral strategies.




D. Policy MeasuresSupportedby PRSC-3

 102.    The detailed reform program associated with this credit is outlined below and set
out in the Letter o f Development Policy (annex 1) and the policy matrix (annex 2) .
Specific actions o f the PRSC program and the triggers and performance benchmarks
draw from and elaborate on the NSSED. The stage for this operation has been set by a
number o f important decisions already taken and fully implemented prior to Board
presentation to demonstrate the Government's commitment to moving forward with its
medium-term development agenda.                    These decisions affect actions in the four
components o fthe reform program supported by the PRSC:

Component1: PromotingSustainableGrowthandSupportingPrivateSector
Development

103.   The objectives of this component are to help Albania sustain satisfactory
macroeconomic performance, with continued real GDP growth around 6 percent, and low
levels of inflation (inthe 2-4 percent range); to remove administrative barriers to private
sector development and increase the registration of new businesses and foreign ventures;
and to consolidate property rights through land registration and the establishment of
mechanisms to address property registration disputes in a standardized way. Specific
measures supportedby PRSC-3 include: (Core conditions are inbold)

Component 2: StrengtheningEfforts to Monitor and Evaluate the Policy Agenda

104.   The main objective o f this component is to support the development and
implementation o f new policy initiatives through improved and policy-relevant
monitoring o f the impact and effectiveness o f government programs. To this effect, the
Government has agreed to undertake actions in three key areas under PRSC-3: (i)
completing the NSSED progress report, (ii)strengthening the capacity to develop,
monitor and evaluate the Government's policy agenda, and (iii)    improving the quality o f
information provided to policymakers. Specific actions include:

           Completion o f the Second NSSED Progress Report: The Government has
           completed the second annual NSSED progress report and submitted it to the
           IMF and Bank Boards in June 2004. Significant efforts have been made to
           develop a strategy which i s more clearly prioritized and focused, costed and
           based on a narrower set o f key outcome indicators, though the extent to which
           this hasbeen achievedvaries greatly across sectors.

           implementationofthe second annual panelsurvey.

           Completion o f selected sectoral studies insupport o f poverty monitoring.


Component 3. Improving Service Deliverv and Social Safetv Net Effectiveness

105.   The Government's program to improve social service delivery is reflected inthe
NSSEDand the 2004-2006 MTBP. The PRSC focuses on key social sector measuresthat
have been identified as priorities in these documents and is supporting line ministries in
their implementation o f the new framework. The objective o f the component is to assist
the Government with follow-through ofMTBPpriorities incritical social service sectors.

Education

106.   The Government's strategy to strengthen service delivery in the education sector
during the PRSC period i s focused around four core areas: (i)improving sectoral
management through the establishment o f core capacities, including policy, planning and
monitoring,   financial management, human resource management and textbook


                                            47

management; (ii)improving sectoral financing; (iii)improving the quality and
affordability of basic and secondary education; and (iv) increasing the transparency o f
sectoral decisions. Specific measures supported by PRSC-3 include:

        0  An increase in the share of the budget allocation for the education sector
           in 2004, with a real increase in staff and non-salary recurrent
           expendituresin2004 relative to 2003.

        0  Completion o f a public expenditure tracking survey to assess how a sample o f
           local governments i s using their block grants to fund education functions
           under their jurisdiction, what share of local government allocations for
           education intended for schools reaches them and how effectively schools use
           these funds.


        0  Preparation and adoption of a policy paper through transparent,
           participatory and technically supported dialogue among key stakeholders
           which outlines respective roles and responsibilities of central and local
           governments inpre-tertiary education (cross-condition with component 4).

        0  Implementation of a satisfactory policy on free textbooks for basic
           education during the school years 2003-2004 and 2004-05 and start

           against Assessment Guidelines for EFA FTIapplications.

Health

107.    As describedabove, implementation progress inthe health sector reform program
has been modest, chiefly due to the lack o f a well-accepted overall reform strategy,
disagreement among key stakeholders about the respectives role and responsibilities o f
central and local governments on service delivery, frequent changes in ministerial
leadership and continued weak technical capacity inthe MoH. The ministry has recently
completed a more comprehensive and strategically oriented sectoral reform strategy,
which, if properly supported by key players inside and outside the sector, will present a
significantly stronger basis for much needed structural reforms. The focus o f PRSC-3 in
the health sector i s thus principally centered around paving the way for broader
acceptance o f the reforms proposed by the MoH, while ensuring that sectoral
expenditures are utilized more effectively to help stem the continuous deterioration in
service delivery. PRSC-3 protects priority expenditures such as targeted public health


                                           48

programs and operations and maintenance for primary health care and requires
clarification o fthe respective roles o f central and local government as well as consistency
between the emerging health sector strategy and the decentralization strategy. Policy
measuresunder PRSC-3 include:

            Increasing the share of budget allocation for the health sector in 2004
            with a real increase relative to FY2003 in funding for (a) targeted public
            health programs and (b) operations and maintenance expenditures for
            primary care which shall have been: (i)transferred to local governments
            as conditional grant; or (ii)funded through alternative mechanisms
            acceptable to IDA, ensuring thereby appropriate funding for primary
            health care operations.

            Demonstrating satisfactory progress on the health sector budget tracking
            survey, focusing on flow o f funds to health facilities under different models o f
            health care financing (funding through health authority, funding through
            MoH, funding through HII).

            Completing and adopting a financial sustainability plan for immunization and
            incorporating funding requirements for MMR and Hepatitis vaccination into
            MoH's 2005 budget proposal and MoH's MTEF for 2005-2007.

            Adopting an HIV/AIDs strategy and launching the campaign to raise
            HIV/AIDsawareness.

            Completing and adopting a policy paper that defines the current and
            future role of central and local governments in the health sector,

           will be monitored (cross-conditionality with component 4).

Component 4: Improving Core Public Sector Functions and Institutional
Arrangements

110.   The objectives o f this component are: (i) help the Government establish a more

                       V. THE PROPOSEDCREDIT (PRSC-3)


1.Links with the Country Assistance Strategy

111.   The proposed credit, with its focus on promoting sustainable growth and private
sector development, strengthening the capacity to monitor and evaluate the policy
agenda, improving service delivery and social safety net effectiveness, and improving
core public functions and institutional arrangements, i s fully consistent with the Bank's
Country Assistance Strategy, considered by the Board inJune 2002.




                                            53

112.   The CAS is designed with an overarching objective o f reducing poverty by
supporting the NSSED, leveraging the remaining reform agenda and moving Albania
towards financial sustainability necessary for creditworthiness. In line with the NSSED,
the CAS hasthree specific objectives:

           To improve governance and strengthen institutions: build efficient and
           inclusive public institutions; increase transparency and accountability at all
           levels; strengthen monitoring and evaluation; and use community-based
           approachesthat buildinstitutions fiom the bottom-up.

           To promote sustainable private sector growth: maintain macroeconomic
           stability; improve the investment environment; continue to reform the
           financial sector and complete enterprise privatization; sustain agricultural
           growth and foster broad basedrural growth; improveinfrastructure, especially
           through community or private sector participation; and promote environmental
           sustainability and sustainable use o f natural resources.

           Tofoster human development: improve access to and quality o f education and
           healthcare in both urban and rural areas, with sector-specific reforms
           coordinated with the country's public sector and decentralization reform
           programs; strengthen the sustainability and equity o f the social insurance
           system; and improve the targeting and efficacy o f social assistance and
           community social services.

113.   The CAS allocates up to US$131millionof IDA resources to Albania for the base
case, consisting of about four operations per year, including the three phase PRSC
program and up to ten possible investmentprojects, o f which five have been approved to
date. A low case scenario, not to exceed US$70 million, would be triggered by poor
macroeconomic performance, failure to implement the NSSED, failure to improve
efficiency and transparency o f public spending, or a sustained decline in portfolio
performance.    The proposed credit would anchor the Bank's lending program, help
maintain the NSSED momentum and support key cross-cutting and thematic policy
reforms in line with the Government's NSSED priorities. The proposed credit would be
complementary and reinforcing to key sectoral investment projects inthe social sectors as
well as inpublic sector management and rural development. The proposed PRSC would
support reforms crucial for these investmentprojects, while the latter are helping to build
the capacity neededto implementreforms.


2. Coordinationwith the IMF and Other Donors

Coordinationwith IMF

114.   The proposed PRSC is beingprepared inparallel with the IMF's three-year PRGF
program, approved by the Board in June 2002 and subsequent program reviews in
February and October 2003 and April and August 2004. The objective is to ensure the



                                            54

consistency o f the macroeconomic and structural policy package supported by both
programs and to ensure the coordination o f the contents o f PRSC and PRGF. The IMF
continues to take the lead in assisting Albania to maintain macroeconomic stability and
financial sustainability through setting quantitative targets within the framework o f its
PRGF. Inaddition, the IMF's structural conditionality focuses on three main categories:
fiscal management and control; payments discipline; and privatization. The Bank leads
the policy dialogue in financial sector reforms, power sector reforms, social sector and
pension reforms, as well as public expenditure management and public administration
reform, and collaborates closely with the IMF on implementation.

Coordination with Other Donors

115.    The work on PRSC is also being coordinated with the activities o f the other
donors in Albania, to minimize the overlap in our programs, to reduce the likelihood o f
critical gaps, and to identify areas o f comparative advantage in providing support to the
Government. The PRSC team has beenmeetingregularly with key donor counterparts to
exchange information on our respective programs and to finds ways to support the
Government with the implementationo f its poverty reduction strategy.

116.    Overall, donor coordination in Albania has received renewed impetus with the
establishment o f the so-called Donor Coordination Architecture. A donor technical
secretariat has been established with representation o f the four major multilateral
agencies, the EU, the OSCE, UNDP and the Bank. Through this secretariat, multilateral
agencies have been designated to take the lead indonor coordination inclose cooperation
with the Government as follows: (i) Economic Development
                                       Socio -                          - World Bank; (ii)
rule o f law and security - EU; (iii)    democratization and human rights   - OSCE; (iv)
governance and capacity building - UNDP. Concurrently, the Government has issued a
CoM order tasking representatives o f the Ministry o f Finance, the Ministryo f Economy,
the Ministry of European Integration and the State Minister with the preparation of a
comprehensive external assistance framework.

3. AnalyticalUnderpinnings

117.    The analytical underpinnings for the PRSC program are based on a series of
analytical and fiduciary pieces as outlined inFigure 6.

4. Poverty, Gender and SocialImpact Analysis

Poverty Category

118.   The PRSC-3 program is designed to have a beneficial impact on medium-term
poverty trends inAlbania by:

       0   Strengthening the Government's capacity to monitor and evaluate poverty
           trends inAlbania, andto formulate effective policy responses.
       0   Enhancing the access to and quality o f key social services currently in crisis,
           especially education and health.
       0   Improvingthe sustainability and adequacy o f social insuranceprograms.
       0   Strengtheningthe prospects for private sector development and growth.
       0   Improving the targeting efficiency and impact o f social assistance and social
           care services.

Gender

119.   Gender issues have been considered during PRSC preparation, given their
importance to growth and poverty reduction. It i s expected that this operation will address
a range of gender issues through activities such as:

       0   Ensuring that education and health policy provides equal access across
           genders.
       0   Improving the provision of reproductive and family health services under the
           health care reform.
       0   Reviewing the equity o f the pensionsystem, including the gender dimension.
       0   Providing support to the social services policy, incoordination with the SSDP,
           including ensuring a policy framework conducive to alleviating abuse o f
           women and children and towards providing services to those suffering
           physical or other domestic abuse.
       0   Strengthening the participation o f women's groups in the political process
           through continued development o f the participatory frameworks initiated
           under the NSSED.

Poverty and SocialImpactAnalyses

120.    The NSSED and the PRSC program are helping to develop much needed local
capacity to undertake analyses o f program-related policy impacts on social groups
through support of the 2002 LSMS and subsequent annual panel surveys. INSTAT, in
cooperation with relevant line agencies and donors, has undertaken a series o f topical
studies based the 2002 LSMS data. These include studies on the labor force, gender,
inequality, immigration and population projections, monetary and non-monetary
dimensions o f poverty, and local area poverty calculations. In addition, INSTAT has
recently completed Albania's first poverty map. The Bank's policy dialogue on poverty
alleviation has been spearheaded by the recently completed Poverty Assessment (FY03).


                                             57

Several social impact analyses that have contributed to the design o f the PRSC with
respect to sectoral diagnoses and strategies include an Energy Sector Poverty and Social
Impact Analysis, which helped inform the recently adopted structure for new electricity
price subsidies for certain groups o f low-income families, and an ongoing PSIA on the
poverty impact o f public expenditures in education. LSMS data have also been utilized
to evaluate the effectiveness o f the Albania Development Fund. The Bank's ongoing
Social Safety Net Effectiveness Review has helped guide the dialogue on PRSC-
supportedreforms ontargeted cash social assistancebenefits.

5. Implementationand Monitoring

121.    The Government has appointed the Minister of Finance as National NSSED
Coordinator to manage the overall implementation o f the PRSC. The MoF has recently
elevated the NSSED Technical Secretariat to an NSSED Department inthe MoF, with a
Director and a small group o f technical staff. The primary implementing line agencies
will be the Ministry o f Finance, the Ministry o f Economic Cooperation and Trade, the
MinistryofEducation and Science, the Ministry ofAgriculture andFood, the Ministryof
Health, INSTAT, the Department o f Public Administration, and the Ministry o f Labor
and Social Affairs.

122.    Overall monitoring of the program has been taking place through reviews in
collaboration with the NSSED Department. The NSSED includes a monitoring planthat
summarizes the principal indicators to be tracked during the program, the related data
sources, and the responsible parties. Simple input/output indicators are largely tracked
through administrative information and program reviews.              Outcome and impact
indicators are being tracked through survey data, especially through LSMS survey data.
The status o f outcome indicators agreedupon during PRSC-1 and PRSC-2 i s presentedin
the Policy Matrix (Annex 2). The overall monitoring plan was discussed with the
Government during appraisal.

6. Borrowerand Credit Amount

123.    The proposed credit would be made to the Government o f Albania, represented by
the Ministry of Finance. The credit, o f SDR 6.9 million (US$lO million equivalent)
would be released in a single tranche.       The credit would be on a 20 year maturity
including a 10 year grace period.

7. Disbursements,Accounts, Audits and Closing Date

124.    In accordance with the Operational Directive on the Simplification of
Disbursement Rules under Structural Adjustment and Sectoral Adjustment Loans
(February 8, 1996), disbursements will not be linked to specific purchases, and there will
therefore be no procurement requirements. Disbursements o f the Credit will be subject to
a standardnegative list of ineligible goods and countries o f origin. Disbursementswill be
made by payments to a deposit account o f the Ministry o f Finance inthe National Bank
o f the Republic o f Albania. If, after deposit inthis account, the Credit proceeds are used



                                              58

for ineligible purposes, the Association will require the Borrower to either (i) that
                                                                                 return
amount to the account for use for eligible purposes; or (ii)  return that amount directly to
IDA, inwhich case IDA will cancel an equivalent undisbursed amount ofthe credit.

125.    The Borrower will provide, on a quarterly basis, a statement o f payments into and
from the deposit account. The CY2003 audits o f the most recent IDA adjustment credits
to Albania, PRSC-2 and Financial Sector Adjustment Credit, were received inJuly 2004.
The auditors issued an unqualified opinion on the Statement o f Sources and Uses of
Funds, Statement o f Expenditures Withdrawal Schedule, and Statement of the Special
Account for the year 2003.

8. EnvironmentalImpact

126.    The proposed operation has been rated a Structural Adjustment Credit governed
under Operational Directive 8.60, and does not require an environmental assessment
rating.

9. BenefitsandRisks

127.    Benefits: The proposed credit will help consolidate reforms in public
administration, public expenditure management, public sector accountability and social
sector service delivery. It will support the country's efforts to increase the Government's
accountability, responsiveness and effectiveness. Civil service administration reforms
will help increase the professionalism of civil servants and, together with reforms aimed
at improving the performance o f social sector line agencies and the social insurance
institute,would thus improve the public sector's capacity to effectively regulate, monitor
and deliver services. Reforms in the areas o f public expenditure management, financial
accountability and        procurement would help spur transparency and more effective
utilization o f public resources. Social service delivery would be improved through the
clear assignment o f competencies to various government levels and the development o f a
clear accountability framework. Pension reforms would help improve the effectiveness
and fiscal sustainability of the pensionsystem, while social assistance would be rendered
more effective through the improved targeting o f cash benefits. In the education and
healthsectors, the allocation o fpublic funds would be more strategically directed towards
priority areas inline with the NSSED objectives.

128.    The Government's overall capacity to monitor the effectiveness o f policy
formulation and implementation and evaluation would be enhanced, particularly in
sectors with a major fiscal and social impact (education, health, social protection and
rural development). The growing inclusive nature o f the NSSED formulation and
monitoring process allows for greater transparency and a stronger voice o f civil society
andthe business community, thus reducingroomfor state capture and corruption.

129.    R i s k s : Successful implementation o f the NSSED and the PRSC program depends
significantly on the Government's ability to strengthen institutional integrity and reduce
state capture and corruption. There i s a risk that the institutional mechanisms and



                                              59

frameworks put inplace to improve transparency and accountability in the public sector
may at times be circumvented to reap political benefits in the run-up to the mid-2005
elections. Political economy constraints could also endanger the credibility and
effectiveness o f reforms inpublic administrationand decentralization.

130.    The multi-sectoral nature o f the operation also presents implementation risks to
the extent that it will require close cooperation among concerned line agencies, which
may be hampered by high turnover and limited implementation capacity in core line
ministries.

131.    To reduce these risks, IDA i s upgrading the capacity o f its Tirana Office and
decentralizing core functional responsibilities for project and program management. This
will allow for more continuous engagement with the Government, Parliament and the
wider community on structural reform issues. Several o f IDA'S current investment
operations are designed to support the implementation o f key structural reforms
supported under the proposed credit. Subsequent IDA operations would Whermore be
designed to sustain and deepen the reforms initiated under the PRSC program, while
ensuring reinforcement between programmatic and investment operations. It must also
be noted that the core achievements under the PRSC program have been anchored in
legislationthat has been enacted andthat therefore provides strong safeguards against the
unraveling o f achievements in the wake o f forthcoming elections. In addition, IDA will
continue to support the Government's efforts to coordinate programs o f other donors to
ensure increased alignment o f key donor programs with the NSSED. As concessional
external financing declines in the medium term, donor programs will need to be more
closely coordinated and aligned with the NSSEDto ensure effective implementation.

132.    The burden o f some possible contingent liabilities, such as the budgetary impact
o f the proposed restitution and compensation o f former landowners and the politically
prosecuted, together with possible shortfalls in revenue collection, may put at risk the
country's macro-economic stability. A further risk stems from vulnerabilities in
Albania's external position. Albania's dependence on concessional financing to help
cover its current account and budget deficits and the expected decline in privatization
related FDIcould undermine Albania's external sustainability and its ability to maintain a
stable macroeconomic framework. The Government's track record in maintaining
macroeconomic stability through prudent fiscal and monetary policies under the IMF
PRGF program and their commitment to maintain this policy stance in the future
constitute a strong mitigating factor. In addition, the support provided under PRSC-3 i s
expected to be followed by balance o f payments support from the EC. O n a longer term
basis, the Government i s       committed to increase budgetary revenues through
improvements intax administration and revenue collectionto help mitigate these risks.

Dear Mr.Wolfensohn,

This letter reports on recent achievements and further actions which the Government of
Albania has committed to implement under the PRSC program which was developed in
cooperation with IDA to support our National Strategy o f Socio-Economic Development.
The PRSC program is focused around formulating and implement policies and structural
reforms infour priority areas, including:


      0   Promotion o f sustainable growth and support for private sector development
      0   Strengthening efforts to monitor and evaluate the policy agenda
      0   Improvement o f service delivery and efficiency o fthe social safety net
      0   Improving core public sector functions and institutional arrangements.

We herewith also request IDA'Ssupport for a credit o f US$10 million equivalent for the
third PRSC which, as the last one of the first PRSC series, constitutes a significant
milestone inour collaboration.




                                           61

Annex 1


OBJECTIVE 1: PROMOTING A SUSTAINABLE ECONOMIC GROWTH AND SUPPORTING THE
PRIVATE SECTOR

MacroeconomicStability

Issues and Achievements under the PRSC Program: Prior to the PRSC program, the
Albanian economy had largely recovered from the negative implications of the 1997
pyramidscheme crisis andthe 1999 Kosovo War with real GDP growth averaging 8.3 %
in 1999-2001. However, the country's overall macroeconomic outlook was still uncertain
with a current account deficit and a budget deficit standing at about 8 of GDP and
expenditures inpriority sectors like education and health being compressed. Inaddition,
Albania had a high level o f domestic debt (almost 40% o f GDP) and relied on inflows o f
foreign capital to finance almost all public investment.

Under PRSC 1 and 2, Albania has consolidated progress in achieving macroeconomic
stability   and accelerated     its   transformation   into  a    market-based  economy.
Notwithstanding an often adverse regional environment and episodes o f political
instability, output growth has been strong, inflation has remained under control, and the
external reserves position has improved markedly. Real GDP growth has averaged more
than 6% in 2001-2003 and inflation has remained low. The fiscal deficit (excluding
grants) was reduced from 8.2% of GDP to 4.7% , while the current account deficit
declined slightly at 7.6% of GDP, downfrom 9% in2002. Key elements underlyingthis
performance included improved fiscal management, the implementation o f wide-ranging
structural reforms, and prudentmonetary policy.

Efforts are continuing to progressively mitigate the adverse impact o f the power sector
crisis on Albania's macroeconomic performance and its economic growth and poverty
alleviation prospects. Significant progress has been made inaddressing these issues as a
result o f the implementationo f a Power Sector Action Plan. Electricity losses have been
reduced, tariffs rationalized and collections improved. The budgetary subsidy for imports
has been reduced and i s expected to be eliminated by the end o f 2004. The Government
has also adopted and commenced implementation o f a Power Sector Policy Statement
that sets out the main elements o f the power sector reform program. However, the crisis
inthe sector has not yet been fully overcome and significant further improvements are
required as domestic supply is insufficient, transmission constraints limit imports,
electricity losses are still high and collection rates require further improvements. Thus,
additional investmentsneedto be mobilized, and continued successful implementation o f
the Action Planand ofthe Power Sector Policy Statement is imperative.

Actions under PRSC3: Under PRSC3 the Government has maintained a stable
macroeconomic environment as a pre-requisite to growth and to successful structural and
sectoral reforms. In July 2004, the Government and IMF agreed to proceed with the
implementation o f the PRGF program measures and to continue their cooperation beyond
the successful completion of the program. The Government seeks to achieve the same
macroeconomic objectives o f an annual GDP growth rate o f around 6%, to keep inflation
within the range of 2-4%, and to ensure that reserves coverage equals 4-5 months of



                                              62

                                                                                  Annex 1


imports. Inthat context, the Government o f Albania has adopted a fiscal policy aimed at
continued strengthening o f revenue collection, thus allowing simultaneously for increased
spending in priority areas and a steady decline in the deficit. A comprehensive reform
program aiming at ensuring fiscal sustainability o f the pension system is being
implemented,along withbetter management ofpublic expenditures.

Future Reforms: While Albania has been successful in maintaining overall
macroeconomic stability over recent years, further efforts are needed with respect to
fiscal consolidation and external sustainability. Prudent monetary and fiscal policies will
continue to promote macroeconomic stability and growth. The Government's
macroeconomic objectives for the medium term aim at supporting robust GDP growth,
while maintaining low inflation and ensuring external financial viability. Fiscal policy
will focus on strengthening revenue collection, thus allowing simultaneously for
increased spending in priority areas and a steady decline in the deficit. We will also
implement a comprehensive reform program aiming at ensuring fiscal sustainability of
the pension system. Monetary policy will aim at keeping inflation within atarget range of
2-4%, and maintaining an adequate level o f reserves at or above 4% months o f imports of
goods and services. We are also committed to supporting the integrity o f our monetary
framework and the independence o f the Central Bank.

To sustain annual GDP growth o f around 6% over the medium term, we also intendto
accelerate structural reforms and improve governance. The Government will focus its
efforts on strengthening institutions and fighting corruption. Structural reform aimed at
increasing budgetary revenues will help furthering fiscal consolidation, while allowing to
increase investments in priority sectors, reducing the deficit, and limiting Albania's
dependence on nodconcessional grants and loans.

The Government medium-termprogram also aims at improving power supply through
new investments in this sector, both for additional domestic generation and for
rehabilitation and augmenting o f the transmission and distribution networks. The 2003
Energy Sector Study estimated that investments o f US$ 1.1 billion are required for the
power sector up to 2015. This will require attracting private sector financing in addition
to continued donor support and improved financial performance by KESH so that it can
contribute a reasonable share o f the financing required from its own resources. The
Government intends to support these efforts by implementation o f the reforms envisaged
inthe Power Sector Policy Statement and improving sector performance by continuing
implementationo f the Power Sector Action Plan. An Equalizing Fundis being created by
KESHin which profits resulting from favorable hydrology would be set aside to cover
additional costs for imports necessary during periods o f adverse hydrology, thereby
avoiding the need for budgetary subsidies.        The Government is also implementing
measures to mitigate the impact o f electricity tariff increases on the socially vulnerable
groups.

Annex 1


PrivateSector Development

Issues and Achievements under the PRSC Program:At the beginning of the PRSC
program, Albania's private sector development faced several important challenges related
to the existence o f administrative barriers to business development, the lack o f an
adequate legal and policy framework, the slow pace o f the privatization program, and the
weakness and inadequate supervision and monitoring o f the financial sector. Other key
barriers identified by FIAS in 2001 included arduous licensing and tax procedures, lack
o f transparency in policy implementation, abuse o f power by officials, and weak law
enforcement. While Albania had started to attract high volumes o f foreign direct
investment (FDI), these were mainly associated with the privatization process; other FDI
remained below levels elsewhere in transition economies. Furthermore, the political and
administrative changes in mid 2002 temporarily slowed down foreign and domestic
investment as well as reform efforts directed at strengthening governance and increasing
private sector growth.

Under PRSCl and 2, the government has made progress on improving the business
environment. An action plan for the removal o f administrative barriers was adopted in
2003 and has beenunder implementation. The dialogue betweenpublic and private sector
has improved, and the authorities have taken measures to improve governance. Among
several key measures, the licensing requirements in the non-food sector were abolished,
which i s expected to improve business entry into this important sector.

Albania has made progress in drafting and implementing an advanced fiscal legislation.
A new excise law was enacted. The responsibility for the collection of social insurance
contributions for large taxpayers was transferred to the General Directorate o f Taxation
(GDT) to improve tax administration. The Social Insurance Institute (SSI) has assigned
social insurance numbers for all employees for the firms registered inthe Large Taxpayer
Unit; and a new computer system for profits tax was brought on line. Based on this
legislation, progress was also made inreimbursing VAT for exporters and investors. The
government will continue to strictly apply the law and correctly reimburse the VAT. To
this end, a special account was opened to ensure full transparency. Despite some
difficulties, reimbursements are made upon request.

Major reforms and organizational changes have been implemented within the General
Directorate o f Customs (GDC) aiming at reducing samplingprocedures for transit goods.
In addition, the government has made notable progress towards improving the
enforcement o f commercial courts' decisions. Albanian banks are now more comfortable
working with bailiffs after gaining confidence in the Department's new procedures and
policies. Additionally, by creating alternative (out o f court) and expedient dispute
resolution mechanisms for commercial disputes, A new law on mediation was enacted
by the President on June 2003 and a new regime for commercial arbitration is being
finalized.

In highly competitive environments, firm entry and exit are not overly cumbersome,
public or private monopolies do not crowd out private investment, and firms are all



                                           64

                                                                                  Annex 1


treated equally with respect to concessions, finance, licenses. The Government has
responded to concerns over the competitive environment by creating a Competition
Authority, based on the Law on Competition Protection (July 2003), which i s based on
European laws on competition. The purpose o f the authority i s to act as a regulatory
entity, that is capable o f conducting independent investigations. The immediate task of
the commission will be to review and revise the existing legal framework governing
competition (approximately 20 laws) and to formulate a national competition policy.

The privatization o f Savings Bank in 2004 marked the total privatization o f all the
second-tier banks operating inAlbania. The partial privatization o f INSIG and paving the
way for the sale o f state-owned shares will create a better environment and a more
efficient system in the financial sector. By putting in operation the RTGS system, the
Bank of Albania aims to improve the payment system. Likewise, the Albanian
Government has taken the necessary steps recently to deliver the payments o f public
sector workers through the banking system, aiming at reducing the circulation o f money
in`cash' inthe economy.

Actions under PRSC3: Under the PRSC3, and based on the "study o f administrative
barriers" conducted by FIAS, the government has prepared a program which will help
implement measures for the reduction and elimination o f specific administrative barriers,
including addressing non-food licensing issues and sampling regulations in customs
administration. The government has pursued efforts for rigorous enforcement o f the law
and the rapid and efficient reimbursement o f VAT to exporters and investors. In the
context o f preparing the fiscal package for the year 2004, the law "On income tax" has
been reviewed to specify the extension o f deadline for exemption from prepayment o f
income tax for manufacturing subjects from 6 months to 1 year. The Government has
also taken measures to improve tax administration affecting business by addressing the
weaknesses inherent to the incentives within the GDT for tax officials to properly apply
the tax code.

Specific policy measures adopted underthe credit include:


    0   Ensure consistent VAT refunding to exporters, including provisions to refund
        VAT arrears.

    0   Reduce fiscal evasion and create transparency between the private sector and
        GDT by: (a) Making internal procedures and sub-legal acts with respect to the
        new status o f GDT staff as civil servants, consistent with the tax procedures law,
        and (b) launching a managed development program for the tax department
        information technology resource to improve the ability o f the GDT staff to collect
        and analyze information

    0   Minimize discretion and arbitrariness in Customs decisions by: (i)      developing
        simplified export and transit samplingprocedures, and (ii)   developing and testing
        clear rules and criteria for invoice valuation




                                              65

Annex 1


FutureReforms: Inthe medium term growth is expected to become more export driven,
and increasingly sustained by rising levels of foreign and domestic investments, rather
than aid flows, which are expected to decline in both volume and degree of
concessionality over the longer-term. To meet this objective, the Government will pursue
sustained efforts to enhance the investmentclimate. External trade policy will be geared
to preserve Albania's liberal trade regime, We will continue negotiations with the
European Commission towards concluding a Stabilization and Association Agreement
with the EUaimed at establishing a free trade area betweenAlbania andthe EUmember
countries.

The Government will continue the implementation o f reforms aimed at reducing
administrative barriers, expanding the formal economic sector by adequate incentives so
that private companies have no incentive to remain in the informal sector. To continue
progress on reduction o f barriers to investment, the government is working with FIAS to
conduct a second round o f the Administrative and Regulatory Costs (ARC) surveys,
which will measure overall quality o f the business environment, as well as progress on
specific policy issues. In addition to the firm level survey, FIAS i s working with the
government to undertake a Self-Assessment exercise, with a focus on reviewing
administrative requirements for businesses. The output from the exercise will review
how the government i s doing on issues o f process, such as cooperation among agencies,
reporting, monitoring, and will provide recommendations to the GOAfor improving
regulatory processes. The second output will be the report on the results o f the second
round ARC, which will highlight overall progress, and identify specific policies that are
problematic for the business sector.

We will also involve the private sector in the design o f public policies and trade
legislation. Inthis respect, continued efforts will be made on curbing regulatory barriers,
improving tax administration,        and strengthening competition policy. On tax
administration, the government will work to encourage the private sector to operate
transparently and formally by focusing on enforcement o f legislation, reducing cases o f
ad hoc and arbitrary application o f procedures, especially with regard to VAT. The
Government will continue to work to build the capacity o f GDT staff so that they are
correctly and consistently applying policies and procedures to businesses, particularly on
the audit andenforcement functions.

The Government will prepare Albtelekom for its prompt privatization. We will fully
divest our interest in NSIG, two oil sector companies, and remaining minority positions
in two commercial banks over the next 18 months. As was the case with the Savings
Bank, we will use the proceeds o fthe sale o f Albtelekom, remaining stake inNSIG and
other future large privatizations to retire public debt; and the remaining revenues to
finance priority investments. We will also continue the implementation o f the reform
program to develop financial markets; and strengthen and improve the supervision o f the
banking system structures. We are committed to continuing the reform program specified
inthe credit for supportingthe financial sector (FSAC).

RuralDevelopment

Issues and Achievements under the PRSC Program: The Government has helped to
foster a conducive environment for the development o f the rural sector through a
comprehensive rural development program. Despite the impressive achievements, there
are still many problems with respect to Albanian agriculture and rural life. Production
systems remain basic, yields are low, many farms are too small and fragmented to be
viable, physical infrastructure i s poor, and private sector activity has yet to fully fill the
vacuum left by defunct state processing and marketing agencies. O f equal concern i s the
severe environmental degradation o f Albania's natural resources.

Under the existing PRSC program emphasis has been placed on the implementation of
laws and regulations that would strengthen property rights. Poorly defined property rights
and uncertainty regarding ownership or lack of ownership o f titles are major obstacles for
business as they prevent access to financing on competitive terms. The Government has
made good strides in trying to complete the first time registration o f land and put
measures in place to solve registration disputes in a standardized way. It has also made
efforts to reduce the costs and fees associated with land transactions as well as the
information flows, which are serving as a deterrent to formal landtransactions.

Furthermore, the Government elaborated the roles and responsibilities o f the various
governmental levels inthe decentralization process through by-laws and inter-ministerial
working groups. Task Force for Rural Development prepared two regional development
plans. The Government also restructured the agriculture research system to an applied
system fulfilling the needs and requirements of small holder farmers, extension service
more client oriented and sustainably run through gradual transfer to private sector.
Council o f Science established determining the research orientation o f the research center
and establish the development plan for the research stations. Finally problems associated
with access to financial services in rural areas has been facilitated through enacting the
law on Savings and Credit Associations (SCAs), creating a union o f savings and credit
associations and the strengthening supervisory capacity o f the central Bank. The number
o f SCAs and commercial lendingfor agriculture has beenincreasing steadily since 2001.

Actions under PRSC3: The main actions on the rural sector under PRSC3 are the
completion o f first time registration cadastre zones and the continued implementation o f
legal measures to end disputes on first time registration. The continuation o f the
registration process beyond the PRSC3 target i s currently being financed by additional
funds from the 2004 budget. Given the important development impact of land
registration, the Government will seek additional donor funding and allocate budgetary
resources to allow for completion of the outstanding registrations in due course. The
Government will also take measures to develop the land market by reducing land
transaction cost and encouraging land registration and titling, through the reduction o f
fees and taxes on land registration. The Council o f Ministers is currently reviewing
proposals in this area. In parallel, the Ministry o f Justice to reduce notary fees on land
transactions (both barter and purchase). The government aims also at progressing in the
area o f property recognition, restitution and compensation, necessary for consolidating



                                              67

Annex 1


property rights in Albania. The selected form o f compensation will be transparent and
rules based and will avoid generating budgetary obligations. The government aims at
intensifying research activities in agriculture and extension services to better meet the
farmers' needs and improving the transfer o f applied technologies to small farms as well
as improving management o f natural resources.

Inthe contexto fthe PRSC-3, the Government ofAlbania commits itselfto:

        Complete a first time registrationof land in eighty (80 %) of its cadastral
        zones; and implementmeasuresto resolve any potentialdisputes with regard
        to any landregisteredfor the first timeinthe Albanianterritory.

        Plan for the implementation o f the law on Restitution and Compensation o f
        Immovable Property ina fiscally sustainable manner.

        Reduce fees and taxes related to landregistration.

        Prepare at least three Regional Development Plans for approval by the National
        Task Force on Rural Development..

        Implement the Law on Saving and Credit Associations (SCA), create business
        associations and a union o f SCAs

        Develop and implement a Plan for agricultural food crop research center and
        extension service.

Future reforms: In the years beyond PRSC3, we intend to further rural sector
development through a concerted effort to support increased incomes and employment
for reduction o f poverty in rural areas. A major challenge ahead is the upgrading o f the
agriculture sector's capacity to meet the requirements o f future trade and economic
integration with the EU. More specifically,     the government shall aim at promoting
growth o f the agricultural sector through supporting the establishment o f an enabling
environment for new investments and modernisation initiatives to increase the
competitiveness o f agricultural exports in EUand neighboring markets. The Government
also intends to address the increasing problem o f illegal construction in peri-urbanand
rural areas which result in an unplanned and uncontrolled development o f potentially
high value areas i.e. in the coastal zones or limit productivity improvement o f the
agricultural sector. Further improvements in the development o f the rural economy will
be key to foster growth, reduce poverty reduction and to encourage sustainable resource       I


use.

                                            TO            AND             THE
AGENDA

Issues and Achievements under PRSC Program: The Government appreciates that
effective policy formulation needs to be based on a system o f data collection, analysis
and stakeholder consultation which allows it to assess the social and economic impact of


                                             68

policy decisions and feeds the results o f evaluation back into further policy decisions.
Therefore, the Government has been committed to establish the institutional structures
and develop the capacity necessary to collect, analyze and disseminate reliable, useful
and timely statistical and other data to monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of the
Government's policy agenda. Specifically, we have undertaken efforts to produce and
analyze reliable statistical information on a regular basis to monitor poverty, inequality
and other key social indicators through the completion o f a Living Standards
Measurement Survey and regular follow-up panel surveys; the piloting o f qualitative
surveys and the introduction o f service report card systems inthe Tirana region and more
recently in four other local government units. We have completed a national poverty
profile and poverty maps which will be used to guide resource allocation decisions. We
have established monitoring and evaluation functions in all core line Ministries and two
State Ministries and established the NSSED Secretariat inthe Ministry o f Finance whose
function it i s to coordinate and monitor implementationo f the NSSED. To strengthen its
capacity to monitor and evaluate poverty, the Government has also set up a Poverty and
Statistics Monitoring Unit within MoLSA which is responsible for the analysis and
dissemination o f information for poverty monitoring and evaluation o f social programs.
For the first time in 2004, all line Ministries have prepared monitoring and evaluation
matrices for the NSSED progress report.         Thus, while there have been significant
improvements in the degree to which Government agencies are gathering and presenting
data to monitor policy developments, we recognize that the ability to truly analyze the
data so as to have a meaningful input into policy makingprocess i s still under-developed
inmost Ministries. The effectiveness of the NSSED and related legislative agenda still
critically depends on further strengthening o f the monitoring and evaluation and policy
development capacity within Government.

Actions under PRSC3: Under PRSC3 the Government is committed to adequately staff
and finance INSTATto allow for effective completion o f the household survey programs;
to successfully carry out the second annual panel survey to allow for monitoring o f non-
income poverty and other social indicators, to establish and maintain policy and planning
units inthe Ministries o f Health, Education, Agriculture and Labor and Social Protection,
to carry household survey based topical studies in support o f poverty monitoring and
disseminate their findings, to fully staff the NSSED secretariat as our core agency to
coordinate monitoring and evaluation o f our NSSED, as well as to take the lead in stake
holder consultation as we further progress with the updating o f our national strategy. We
have also successfully completed and submittedto the IMF and IDA Boards our second
annual NSSED progress report. The latter was developed through extensive consultation
with stakeholders across the country andkey external fundingpartners.

Future Program: Beyond PRSC3, we will focus on further strengtheningline agencies'
capacity to request, analyze and utilize information required to make informed policy
decisions, encourage greater interaction between line Ministries on M&E methodology
and implementation, and review regularly the appropriateness o f indicators and targets,
paying particular attention to strengthening the monitoring and evaluation capacity in
those ministrieswhich have only recently introducedthese functions; strive for improved
integration o f our NSSED, MDG and CARDSmonitoring and evaluation systems; carry

out another full living standards survey in 2005 in view o f updating our poverty profile
and evaluating the poverty alleviation impact o f our NSSED; further strengthening
collaboration between INSTAT and line agencies through the data user group and
carrying out o f joint topical evaluations based on LSMS to guide future policy
formulation in priority sectors and further streamline our NSSED monitoring and
evaluation system by introducing a consistent format o f monitoring and evaluation
reports inall line agencies.

OBJECTIVE 3: IMPROVING SERVICE DELIVERY                AND EFFICIENCYOF THE SOCIAL
SAFETY NET:

Restructuring o f social service delivery so as to enhance the quality, effectiveness and
lower income groups' access to social services i s a key priority o f the Government's
National Strategy for Socio Economic Development.

Education

Issues and Achievements und PRSC Program: The primary issues in the education
sector are (a) declining gross enrollment rates at the basic and secondary levels of
education, especially inthe rural and peri-urbanareas; (b) inadequate sectoral financing;
(c) weak management capacity and (d) lack o f transparency in the sectoral decision
making process. Household survey data indicate that educational attainment is a key
determinant o f poverty, which in turn makes it imperative that we undertake steps to
increase lower income groups' demand for education by making education more
accessible and relevant, while ensuring adequate sectoral governance and effective
resources allocation and utilization.

The Government's strategy to address these issues with the support o fthe PRSC program
focuses on: (i) improving sectoral management by buildingcapacity for policy analysis,
planning, monitoring, financial andhumanresource andtextbook management; (ii)
improving sectoral financing through an increase ineducation spending to be guided by
credible planningand costing to fund key improvement programs and an increase in
recurrent expenditures to allow for correction o f seriously eroded teacher salaries; (iii)
increasing affordability and quality o f basic and secondary educationinview o f raising
demandfor education, particularly among the more disadvantaged groups and inrural
areas; (iv) improving the transparency o f sectoral decision making so as to strengthenthe
population's trust inthe education system. Our main achievements under the PRSC
program inthis respect have been:


 0   progress on issues o f structure, skill mix, systems, policy frameworks, and
     performance accountability. For example, the MoES obtained approval o f DOPA,
     MoF, and the Council o f Ministers for the structure and staffing implications o f its
     reorganization, as advised by international consultants. It i s gradually replacing low
     performance with more qualified staff. It has also usedthe first performance audit to
     diagnose important sources o f its performance problems, such as the need for clear




                                              70

      job descriptions and performance contracts with job holders or the need for job-
      specific skills training and is taking action to follow up on these issues.

      Council o f Ministers approved a policy to provide all basic education students with
      free textbooks and we have moved to procuring all textbooks under competitive
      bidding procedures. We have also introduced significant improvements in the
      specifications for textbook printing to support a four year life for textbooks.

      The Council o f Ministers' has approved an increase if compulsory education from 8
      to 9 years.

Actions under PRSC3:Under PRSC3 the Government has further increased the share of
public spending going to education from 10.6% in 2003 to 11% in 2004 with a real
increase in both salary and non-salary recurrent expenditures. We have carried out a
sector expenditure tracking survey to identify sectoral control gaps in an effort to
improve sectoral accountability and spending effectiveness. We are implementing our
new textbook policy by providing free textbooks to all children in basic education and,
starting with the current school year, we are also making available free textbooks to
secondary education students in eighty poor communities, so as to ease the financial
burden of education and encourage increased enrollment by lower income groups. We
have completed and publishedfor the first time Albania's Annual Statistical Report Card
on Educationwhich makes public the data on school enrollments and completion and will
henceforth be utilized on an annual basis to monitor progress on achieving our targets for
universal enrollment and completion in basic education and increased enrollment and
completion in secondary education, particularly also inrural areas. As a first step towards
careful implementation planning o f the Government's new policy to expand basic
education from eight to nine years, we have completed a full cost estimate for the latter.
In view of further enhancing accountability for improved service delivery, we are also
clearly assigning the roles and responsibilities o f various levels o f government and other
key players (e.g. school boards) in pre-university education and adopting a program of
phased decentralization for pre-university education. Cornerstones o f the latter will
include the establishment and pilot testing o f clear performance indicators, monitoring
and evaluation mechanisms and an overall accountability system to ensure adequate
service delivery o f those functions that will be gradually decentralized to local
Government. Capital budgets for pre-university education will be decentralized through
conditional block grants, with investments ineducational facilities requiringthe approval
o f the Ministry o f Education according to transparent and public criteria, including our
national education facilities development map. We see national oversight o f local
decisions to invest in facilities as critical to assuring equitable and efficient provision of
educational services across the country.

Future reforms: In the years beyond PRSC3, we intend to further education sector
reforms through a concerted effort to completely revise our basic education curricula and
expand basic education from eight to nine years for those students who have benefited
from the new curriculum; introduce measures to improve financial accountability in line
with the findings of the just-completed public expenditure tracking survey, pilot test and

evaluate the decentralization o f education functions as part o f our efforts to gradually
expand the role and responsibilities o f local governments, school boards and schools in
the delivery of higher quality education services at the pre-university level, and
substantially reform our vocational training system in cooperation with the European
Union. A major challenge ahead for us i s to design a transparent and fair capitation
funding formula for financing education services in order to minimize the horizontal and
vertical imbalances that can emerge under decentralization

Health

Issues and Achievements under PRSC program: The key issues which have been
afflicting the performance o f our health sector include physical and financial access
barriers, low public sector spending compared to the sector's needs and to international
and regional standards, fragmentation of public sector financing, poor preparedness for
HIV/AIDS, low service quality and unclear division of responsibilities between various
levels o f Government and institutions with respect to financing and service delivery. To
start addressing these issues our NSSED identifies three strategic approaches for the
sector: (a) improving efficiency o f the system through better planning and resource
allocation; (b) investing in priority health delivery system to improve access to care and
quality o f services; and (c) targeting public resources for priority public health programs
that have the most impact on health outcomes. Under the PRSC program we have taken
initial actions to support these objectives, including work on the first regional health
master plan for the Tirana region, piloting o f a single provider payment system for
primary care inthe Tirana region and a regional hospital, development and adoption of a
national health promotion strategy and steps to improve the financial sustainability o f our
vaccination program to maintain our record o f good vaccination coverage as donor
funding reduces.

Actions under PRSC3: The Government has been reaffirming its commitment to the
health sector by increasing the share o f total budgetary spending going to the health
sector from 7.1% in 2003 to 8.6% and ensuring a real increase in spending in priority
areas, including operation and maintenance and key public health programs. The funding
o f operations and maintenance for primary health care is flowing through the Ministryo f
Health and will gradually be unifiedunder the Health Insurance Institute as we progress
with the wider introduction of a single payer model for primary and subsequently also
secondary care. We have clearly assigned the respective responsibilities o f local and
central Governments in the health sector, aiming at transferring ownership o f primary
care facilities to local Governments and making them responsible for their physical
maintenance, while funding o f actual service provision will remain the responsibility o f
the Ministry of Health until the Health Insurance Institute will become the single payer
who contracts for primary care services country wide. Capital budgets for investments in
primary care facilities will be decentralized through conditional block grants, with
investmentsinhealth facilities requiring the approval o f the Ministryo f Health according
to transparentand public criteria, including a national health facilities map which we will
need to develop. We see national oversight o f local decisions to invest in facilities as
important to assuring equitable,     efficient and fiscally sustainable provision o f health

services across the country. We are carrying out a budget tracking survey in view o f
identifying control gaps and enhancing accountability mechanisms. To provide a more
strategic direction to our sectoral reforms inthe years to come, the Government has also
recently completed and adopted a comprehensive health sector reform strategy. We have
furthermore completed and launched our national HIV/AIDS strategy and completed the
financial sustainability plan for vaccination. We are committed to allocating the
incremental resources needed to fully finance priority vaccines such MMR and Hepatitis
B from the national budget as of 2005 so as to ensure continued high coverage of
vaccination as donor funds for this purpose are reduced.

Future Outlook: Our recently adopted health sector reform strategy spells out the
sectoral priorities which we intendto focus on inthe coming years. Key among them are
the streamlining and unification of health sector financing, accompanied by payment
systems reforms to increase accountability o f service providers and efforts to root out
informal payments. We also plan on developing a national health services map to help
guide sectoral capital investments, including those which will be delegated to local
Governments. We will needto develop service standards and accountability mechanisms
to accompany the decentralization o f facilities ownership and maintenance requirements
to local Governments. We will continue to make health sector spending a priority, with
particular focus on expenditures that can help increase quality o f and low income groups'
access to essential health care services.


Social Protection

Pensions:

Issues and Achievements under PRSC program: The Government's key objective in
the area of pension reform is to improve the fiscal sustainability, coverage, affordability
and equity in access o f the pension system. Accordingly , the Government's reform
program, supported through PRSC, has focused on introducing parametric changes to the
pension system, measures to enhance the operational effectiveness and transparency o f
the Social Insurance Institute, and measures to improve collection of contributions. In
particular, we have enacted legislation to phase in a further increase o f five years in the
retirement age to 65 for men and 60 for women and, for those with full contributory
histories, to provide an option for early retirement with a significantly reduced pension at
ages 62 and 57 respectively.      We have reduced payroll tax contributions for social
insurance by four age points and eliminated compensation payments in excess o f EU
guidelines for past increases in consumer prices. We have also reduced the gap between
rural and urban workers inbothpension contributions andpension levels.

Under PRSC3, the Government is taking further steps to strengthen the operational
capacity and effectiveness o f the Social Insurance Institute and improve the fiscal
sustainability o f the pension system. Specifically, we are implementing the policies o f a
step-wise retirement age increase and a reduction inbenefits for those retiring early; we
have enacted and are implementing legislation to have the Social Insurance Institute's



                                              73

Annex 1


financial statements audited by qualified external auditors; and are gradually transferring
the collection o f most payroll tax contributions from SI1to the General Tax Directorate o f
the Ministry of Finance in an effort to improve contribution collections. Inaddition, SI1
i s piloting the automation o f periodic processing o f pension payments; it has prepared
and will make public a triannual performance report and SII's Boardhas for the first time
adopted a three year work and investment program aimed at improving the Institute's
effectiveness.

Future Outlook: The Government recognizes the needto make further reductions inthe
overall social insurance contribution payroll tax burden in the medium term so as to
ensure labor market competitiveness and to encourage contribution collection. To ensure
that such contribution reductions will not further endanger the fiscal sustainability o f the
social insurance schemes, we will defer related decisions until we have undertaken
appropriate medium- and long- term projections and careful analysis o f the fiscal impact
o f such reductions. To this effect, we are committed to expanding our capacity to carry
out such analysis and subsequently to adopt a schedule o f contribution reductions and
reallocations within the insurance system inthe medium term. Until such time as we will
be able to make an informed decision in this respect, the Government i s committed to
refraining from raising the overall combined payroll tax contribution burden for social
and health insurance contributions. The expansion o fmodeling and simulation capacities
will constitute one element of a process to strengthen and reorganize policy-making
processes for social insurance and other social protectionprograms and to strengthen the
administrative systems to implementthe social insurance programs.

Social Assistance:

Issues and Achievements under PRSC: The key policy issues that have needed to be
addressed in the social assistance area have been to improve targeting o f cash social
assistance benefits so as to reduce errors o f exclusion and inclusion, to discourage false
income declarations by beneficiaries, and to strengthen the legislative, operational and
funding framework for social services. During earlier phases o f the PRSC program, our
efforts have focused on identifying new mechanisms to improve targeting o f cash social
assistance benefits and preparing revised legislation that establishes an improved legal
framework for the functioning o f our social assistance and social services programs.

Actions under PRSC3: The Government has prepared and made public a policy paper
on cash social assistance and social care services in the Republic o f Albania which
describes policies and changes incorporated in a Government package o f related
legislation and which summarizes explicitly the role o f authorities at various level o f
government, as well as a process through which the effectiveness o f the division o f roles
will be monitored and if necessary modified. Onthis basis, the Government has adopted,
and submittedto Parliament, legislation (i) improve the social safety net's impact on
                                               to
poverty reduction in a fiscally sustainable way while increasing accountability and (ii)   to
strengthen the legislative, administrative and funding framework for the system of
supportive social services.    The new framework law on social assistance and social
services redefines the broad structure within which the relevant programs will function



                                              74

                                                                                     Annex 1


and the respective roles o f implementing bodies at the national and local levels. Funding
for social services will be made available to local governments through an extension of
current grant arrangements and local governments will then have responsibility for
financing service provision through arrangements with local service providers. The law
constitutes part o f the Government's decentralization program. As related measures, the
Government has strengthened its social safety net programs, or has launched initiatives to
do so, during the last year to improve the targeting o f social assistance and the overall
effectiveness o fthese programs. Inparticular:


    0   Under the ndihma ekonomike programof income-tested cash social assistance,the
        Republican and local governments are piloting, innine districts, a new provision
        that makes receipt o f benefits conditional on the availability for local work o f
        most household heads receiving these cash benefits. The pilot also offers wages
        that are higher than the current benefit rates for participants who accept work
        through the revised program. This initiative i s expected to reduce the number o f
        families receiving benefits while concealing the work activities o f family
        members and to release program funds that will be usedto pay higher benefits to
        eligible recipients. The Government will monitor and evaluate the initial
        experience with this initiative and, if satisfactory, will extend it nationwide.


    0   There has been evidence from growing caseloads o f instances of unsatisfactory
        determination o f eligibility for the program o f cash assistance for those with
        disabilities that are congenital or acquired before adulthood.        To address this
        problem, the Government i s introducing within the program a new level o f
        medical review at the national level for compliance o f local authorities'

    0   Energy subsidies have been introduced for defined categories o f eligible low-
        income households. The Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs i s responsible for
        managing the process o f identifying a non-duplicative list o f eligible households
        that are KESH customers. These households receive a subsidy on electricity
        consumption below a threshold level. KESH bills eligible households at the
        discounted rate and Ministry o f Finance pays KESH for the aggregate amount o f
        discounts from energy bills. Parameters for the scheme were chosen to comply
        with a budgetaryceiling for the subsidies.

Future Program and Actions: Now that our recent initiatives have addressed the
challenges we faced, we will: (i)       monitor and evaluate their impact to gauge their
effectiveness and make adjustments if necessary; (ii)      reassess maximum benefit levels,
program eligibility rules, and the impact o f small amounts o f private earnings on the
benefit level under the ndihma ekonomike program to see whether the proportion o f poor
families assisted through the program and its impact in reducing poverty could be
increased without significantly discouraging work effort; consider whether additional
programmatic changes could usefully complement our recent social assistance changes;
and take advantage of the new legal framework to build a stronger network of social

OBJECTIVE 4: IMPROVING CORE FUNCTIONS PUBLIC SECTOR AND INSTITUTIONAL

RELATIONS

Improving the functioning o f the public sector and the use o f resources to deliver public
services more efficiently i s key objective o f the government public sector reform agenda.
Therefore, policy formulation and monitoring, human resource management, public
expenditure management, financial accountability, and fiscal decentralization are among
the core capacities that need to be strengthened so that the Government's programs o f
poverty reduction can be effectively implemented.

Public Sector Management

Issues and Achievements und PRSC Program: During the 1990s, Albania's
development and growth was constrained by weak institutional capacity and by a lack o f
transparent and accountable public administration. These same factors also contributed
to corruption in Albania. Therefore, policy development, human resource management,
financial management and accountability, and public sector performance measurement
were among the core institutional capacities that needed to be strengthened so that the
Government's programs o f poverty reduction can be effectively implemented.

Policy Formulation: During most o f the 1990s, Government efforts had focused on
maintaining aggregate fiscal discipline and less on establishing institutional arrangements
to bring a more strategic focus to budgetary processes. In 2000, the introduction o f a
MediumTerm Expenditure Framework (MTEF -now changed to MediumTerm Budget
Program -MTBP) that operates on a three-year rolling cycle was an important first step
towards a more strategic and policy-focused budgetprocess. The MTBP beganto address
the significant shortcomings inthe budget management process: budget preparation was
based on outdated budget norms; policy, programming, and budgeting functions in line
ministries were not fully integrated; there was little policy debate on spending decisions;
and budget monitoring paid little attention to the implementation o f the budget program
and activities. Budget performance was also hampered by the separate investment and
recurrent budget planningprocesses.

Human Resource Develoument: In order to achieve its development objectives, Albania
needs qualified, motivated civil servants with a merit-based management system to do the
public service work - analyze policy options, prepare budgets, manage finances,
undertake audits, deliver social services, etc. The Law on the Status o f the Civil Servant
(CSL) enacted in November o f 1999, required to be followed up with considerable
subsidiarylegislation establishing, among other things, detailed procedures governingjob
descriptions and valuations, recruitment and selection procedures, performance appraisal
processes, etc. Inaddition, it was necessary to extend the spirit o f CSL to other important
sectors within public administration, and to amend other laws, which were inconsistent
with key provisions o fthe CSL.

Financial accountabilitv. To be effective, the MTBP process required a strong support
and transparent financial control mechanisms. The internal control framework inAlbania
was comprised o f controls exercised by the budget department, the treasury, internal audit
units within the line ministries and the central internal financial control department. In
addition, the Supreme Audit Institution (SAI) was carrying out independent external
audits o f the budget execution. All line ministries had their own internal audit units, but
overall the internal audit system was not fully functioning. Because o f the lack o f
technical skills performance audits, value for money audits, or internal control reviews
that would assist the management in improving their performance and strengthening the
control framework, were not carried out. The accountability mechanisms were not in
place.

Public Procurement practices were also weak and lacked transparency. The findings o f
the Country Procurement Assessment Report (CPAR) on Albania, indicated that, while
the Law on Public Procurement (which governs expenditures by public institutions on the
acquisition o f goods and services) was fairly comprehensive, enforcement o f the law was
being undermined by the absence of detailed implementing regulations-these
regulations are neededto define the specific procedures to be followed inthe application
o f the procurement law. High-quality standard procurement documents and forms o f
contract, which are needed to introduce uniformity o f interpretation and application and
to provide a reliable contractual basis on which public purchasers may award contracts
were missingand the procurement system was not transparent.There was little awareness
among public officials o f the legislation governing public procurement and bidders, both
local and foreign, complained about the difficulty to find information about contract
opportunities and awards.

Accountabilitv of High Public Officials. With assistance from the World Bank, the
Government developed in 1998 the first Anti-Comption Plan. Despite the progress made
towards implementingthe action plan, the perception o f corruption was still high among
public officials.

Against that background, the Government set as its objectives under the public sector
component of the PRSC program to achieve the following: A more contestable policy
formulation process that over time will show policy formulation and implementation
practices that take into account important policy issues and proposals made by
stakeholders; A budget formulation and implementation process based on a medium term
financing plan and sector programs, which will make the budget an efficient policy tool
for the Government ;A larger cadre o f civil servants as measured by an increased share
o f civil service positions vis-a-vis contract employees; Increased transparency and
accountability in the management o f public resources as reflected in improved quality
and coverage of audits, enforcement o f improved public procurement practices, and
enhanced transparent reporting and recording o f financial statements; and Increased
accountability o fpublic officials

Annex 1


Under the PRSC 1 and 2, significant progress was made towards the implementation of
the reform agenda.

Improving Policv Formulation Process: Over the past years progress was made towards
improving the legal framework, increasing transparency and strengthening parliament
oversight capacities to monitor the policy formulation and implementation process. The
main achievements include: (i)The enactment o f the Law on organization and
functioning o f the Council o f Ministers (CoM) designedto establish a legal framework
more supportive o f a contestable policy formulation process; (ii) establishment o f a
                                                                              The
unified civil-service-staffed departmental structure with responsibility for effecting this
function; (iii) preparation o f the strategy and action plan for developing a contestable
                 The
policy formulation process. The CoM issueda regulation setting out procedures on steps
taken by ministries and central authorities in advance o f review by the CoM are
effectively coordinated, and that policy and financial analysis accompanying the draft
laws are issued'. A Monitoring Information System was established and a Procedures
Manual for Monitoring the Implementation Progress o f Government Priority Actions as a
tool to improve the function o f the Department of Policy Development and Coordination
(DPDC) was prepared. The functions o f the "central institutions" within the CoM were
reviewed according to recommendations o f the World Bank. The strategy and action
planto strengthenParliamentary oversight capacity was successfully implemented.

Human resources development: Under PRSC 1 and 2, the government worked to
implement the CSL and its regulations. A key achievement in this effort was the
establishment o f the post o f Secretary General, the highest civil servant position, and the
recruitment o f Secretaries General ineach o fthe line Ministries. All civil service posts in
central ministries were defined and subsequently filled through a competitive process
defined by the CSL and its subsidiary legislation. Parliament approved the law on
Competencies on setting o f salaries, putting the Department of Public Administration
(DoPA) in charge as the responsible institution on setting salaries. DoPA started to
regularly publishinits News Letter and some newspapers quarterly indicators presenting
the progress made in areas such as recruitments, performance evaluations, turnover of
staff, etc. The published indicators also served for analyzing various civil service issues.
In order to ensure compatibility o f the laws, we also took action to review relevant
legislations which were inconflict or requiredrevision2.

Public Expenditure Management: The MTBP has now become the centerpiece o f our
budget formulation process to prioritize expenditures more efficiently and to strengthen
the linkages between policy objectives and budget planning and execution. Close
attention i s paid to the need to ensure consistency between the NSSED and the MTBP.
Under PRSC 1 and 2, the MOF prepared a draft program budgeting procedures manual


  The regulation provides a good foundation for ongoing improvement of the policy, legal and decision-
making processes in Albania and establishes at the center of government the authority and capacity to
ensure that policy proposals forwarded to the Council of Ministers provide the supporting analysis and
*documentationrequired on the
                       to facilitate informed, rational deliberationsby the Council of Ministers.
  Article 22 of the Law        Status of the Member of Parliament and the decree #469 (14 August 1995)
were repealed; A decree on the role of SG was issued.

and dedicated significant work to testing budget procedures3. A database on public
investment projects, both domestically and externally financed, was established in the
MoF. Procedures and guidelines for recording disbursement and expenditures on all
foreign financed projects, including those financed by grants, were finalized and issued.
Inorder to improve the reporting ofbudgetary commitments, guidelines to line ministries
were issued as well. Several measures were taken to strengthen the oversight capacity o f
Parliament inthe budget formulation and execution process4.


   0   Accountability of Public OfJicials, Several measures were taken to improve
       transparency and accountability o f public officials through public scrutiny: (i)         the
       Law on Verification o f Declaration o f Assets was enacted in May 2003; (ii)              the
       High Inspectorate for Verification of Declaration o f Assets was established in
        September 2003; (iii)the financial disclosure statements o f Cabinet members
       were published on the CoM's website soon after the enactment o f the Law on
       Declaration o f Assets took place and (iv) the Code o f Ethics was adopted by the
       parliament andprovided to all civil servant.


   0   Internal Audit and Internal Controls. Over the past two years, the following
       activities were carried out ; (i)      the Law on Internal Audit was enacted; (ii)the
       Ministry o f Finance started to implement the law by adopting internal audit
        standards; it developed a comprehensive audit manual and a code of ethics of
        internal auditors, established a directorate o f internal audit in line ministries, and
        defined the criteria for selecting internal audit staff. A national internal audit
        committee was also established. In order to strengthen the internal control
        framework, an inventory o f all internal controls was carried out ; gaps in internal
        controls were identified recommendations for addressing these gaps were
        prepared.


    0   Financial accountability: The consolidated financial statements were prepared
        and publishedfor the years 2001 and 2002. With support from the World Bank-
        financed Public Administration Reform project, progress was made towards
        establishing a modern information systems. The system will facilitate efficient
        cash management. The MoF has established agreements with all agent
        commercial banks to improve the reconciliation o f financial transfers. Inorder to
        address the issues o f low skills and lack o f exposure to modern external audit
        techniques, twinning arrangements betweenthe BritishNational Audit Office and
        the High State Council were established so that Government staff can learn latest
        techniques inrisk-based auditing.


    0   Procurement. Under the PRSC-1,following the recommendations o f the Country
        Procurement Assessment Report (CPAR), the staffing o f the Public Procurement


  A test was carried out in pilot ministries: Ministry of Agriculture and Food, Ministry of Health and
MinistryofEducation
 A conferenceon the 2003 annualbudgettook place inNovember 2002 and an workshop on the Medium

         Agency (PPA) was brought up to full strength. Quantitative indicators5of actual
        performance on public procurement (at both central and local government levels)
         are now published in the Public Procurement Bulletin. This development
         represents a major improvement in transparency, as it opens procurement
         transactions conducted by public institutions to public scrutiny. Under PRSC-2,
        the Law on Public Procurement was amended. The amendment remediedthe key
         weaknesses o f the law and added improvements in transparency, particularly by
         introducing a requirement that bids for public contracts be evaluated on the basis
         o f objective, quantifiable criteria which must be disclosed to the bidders in
         advance o f submission o f their bids. The risks o f the Public Procurement Agency
         (PPA) to being subject to political interference has also been reduced by
         amendingthe procurement law to bringits management and staff withinthe scope
         o f application o f the Civil Service Law, those affording them the protection
         offered by that law.

Actions underPRSC3:

Improving Policv Formulation: Progress has continued in the implementation o f the
policy formulation strategy and the action plan, and with implementation o f a strategy
and action plan to strengthen the oversight capacities o f the Parliament. The CoM has
also approved a decision requiring Ministries to prepare a plan which would integrate
NSSED, MTBP and the policy formulation process. The CoM has established the
Technical Secretariat for Coordination o f Donors which aims at coordinating policy
planning and assistance. With OSCE assistance, progress has also been made in
strengthening analytical capacity inParliament.

Developing Human Resources. An update o f existing laws governin!                       the public
administration was made to ensure consistency with the spirit o f the CSL             . In addition,
DoPA is revising the CSL with the following objectives: (i)          reducing the cost and time o f
advertising vacancies; (ii)  improving test procedures; and(iii)       improving the performance
evaluation process. DoPA also continues to monitor the implementation o f the CSL and
provides assistance to line ministries human resource management departments.
Monitoring indicators agreed as part o f Public Administration Reform Project continue to
be tracked and posted on the website (ww.pad.gov.al). A decree on roles, responsibilities
and functions o f General Secretaries (Nr. 325 dated May 23, 2003) and the Code o f
Ethics are being implemented satisfactory. DoPA has also completed the inventory o f

Future reforms: The Government's objectives in the years beyond PRSC3 are as
follows:


    0  Develop better mechanisms to streamline the various planning frameworks
       (NSSED, EU Integration, Government Action Plan) and ensure that they are
       linked appropriately to the MTBP process. A priority-setting process, linked to
       the macroeconomic strategy needs to be established. This will require that the
       Council o f Ministers agrees on a set o f strategic priorities within a fiscal plan, and
       ensures that subsequent ministry MTBP plans and budgets reflect these strategic
       priorities. Line ministries must undertake the organizational changes to ensure
       that the NSSED, MTBP, EU integration, and the Government Action Plan are
       fully coordinated.


    0  Address the challenges arising from the implementation o f the public
       administration reform. This will imply: (a) adjusting the number and composition
       o f civil servants to meet high standards o f performance; (b) improving
       management capacities within the civil service.


    0  Improve budget management and the consistency between long-term strategies,
       the MTBI?, annual budgets; strengthen the links between the expected
       computerized treasury system and a number o f stand-alone databases to create a
       dynamic e-government solution in line with international standards for increased
       public participation.


    0  Improve efficiency in the use o f public funds through better procurement
       practices, more transparent reporting, and increased participation o f beneficiaries
       o fpublic services.


    0  Adopt a new organic budget law to take into account improvements in budget
       management, transparent reporting, and strengthened internal financial controls.

Decentralization

Issues and Achievements under the PRSC Program:The 1998 Constitution defined
Albania as a unitary State, founded upon the principle o f decentralization and governed
by a central government and local self-governments. A basic institutional framework for
the implementation of decentralization was put in place by the National Assembly in
1999 with the approval o f the "Strategy o f Decentralization and Local Autonomy," the
inter-ministerial "National Committee for Decentralization (NCD) and it advisory
technical secretariat, the "Group of Experts on Decentralization (GED)." In 2000 new
laws were adopted on the "Organization and Functioning o f Local Self-Government"-in
line with the European Charter of Local Self-Government-and           on the "Administrative-
Territorial Organization",    confirming the existing municipalities and communes,
adopting the concept o f Regions and discontinuing the previous Districts.

Despite these initial regulatory and institutional achievements, it soon became clear that
further steps on an effective Government's decentralization strategy was at jeopardy,
owing to: (i)the fragmented structure o f the local administrative units; (ii)the
weaknesses o f administrative capacity (both local and central); (iii)the still blurry
assignment o f responsibilities and competences to the local authorities (vis-&vis the
Prefects, as well as the line Ministries); (iv) the absence o f clear standards o f services and
measurement criteria o f performance in service delivery; and (v) an inadequate degree o f
revenueautonomy and predictability. The Government's decentralization strategy was at
a crossroad, and the envisaged increased allocative efficiency, transparency, and
accountability on public service delivery (including social services) were at stake.

The government's objective under the PRSC program was to break the deadlock on the
decentralization strategy and to move ahead, taking into account political circumstances,
limited capacities and institutional weaknesses. Thus, the PRSC reform program targeted
key decentralization measures, focusing on the following strategic policy areas: (i)
completion o f the basic legislative framework on the territorial administration; (ii)
implementation o f the existing regulation on local government property rights; (iii)
assignment o f specific responsibilities and authorities to local governments-including
those concerning shared-functions (e.g., education, health and social assistance); (iv)
assignment o f adequate degree o f revenue autonomy to local authorities, and
consolidation o f an equalization transfer mechanism which could be immune of
bureaucratic and political influences; and (v) adoption o f a training strategy for local
public officials and authorities on a nationally uniform system o f accounting, reporting
and management. The PRSC decentralization component was supported by the Bank's
contemporaneous report "Albania: Fiscal DecentralizationinTransition."

Under PRSC-1 and PRSC-2, the Government enacted complementary legislation,
prepared and adopted action plans on properties rights, revised local tax regulation,

consolidated training programs, and secured some budgetary provision for capacity
building. Key policy decisions included:

       0   The adoption of a new Law on Prefects which circumscribed and clarified the
           role of the Prefects exclusively as: (i)a coordinator of the regional State

           Officials to Parliament; and

       0   The adoption of budgetary provisions for training local government.

The Government has also opened a public debate on a re-mapping the territorial-
administrative structure of the country. Although this is a sensitive political issue, we
have made strides in this direction. In this regard, there is already a draft law under
consideration in the Parliament, which aims at rationalizing the current administrative
units (especially the small non-viable rural Communes) by promoting(through voluntary
and/or compulsory means) associatiordamalgamationfor pooling resources together and
joint provisionof services.

Actions under PRSC3: A number of important decisions has been implementedprior to
Boardpresentation of the PRSC3, which demonstrate the Government's commitment to
moving forward with the medium-termdevelopment agenda on decentralization. They
include:




 The tax reform introduced the following innovations to increase local revenue autonomy: (i)the Land
Tax was reinstated as a local tax; (ii)    the former Small Business Tax was split into the Local Small
BusinessTax (LSBT) andthe Simplified Profit Tax (SPT), andboth became local own taxes; (iii) "lawthe
on local taxes and fees" was reviewed and amended; and (iv) the local turnover tax (on restaurants, discos,
hotels, and cafks and bars) was revoked. Also the 2002 provisional formula for the distribution o f State
unconditional transfers to the local self-governments was revised in2003.

      0   The completion o f the Inventory o f State properties, the submission to NCD o f
          the list of properties to be transferred to local governments, and the
          implementation o fthe transfers.

          The adoption by the CoM o f policy papers (and technical annexes) which
          elaborate local governments' specific responsibilities on shared functions in
          health, education and social assistance, including those on capital investments,
          and the establishment of an action planto set basic minimumnational standards
          and performance indicators to evaluate services deliveredby local governments;

      0   The approval o f a multi-year training program (in coordination with donors and
          DOPA) for local government capacity building and the establishment of
          appropriate mechanism to enable local governments to assume this
          responsibility as soon as possible.

Future reforms: Despite considerable progress in implementing decentralization under
the PRSCprogram, major implementation challenges remains, owing to: (i)fragmented
                                                                                a
structure o f local administrative units; (ii)a weak administrative capacity (both local and
central); (iii) absence o f well defined standards o f services and o f measurement
                the
criteria for the performance o f service delivery; (iv) a weak accountability framework;
and (v) an inadequate degree o f local revenue autonomy and predictability. Also, from
the demand side, there is still a sense of neglect and insufficient participation of the civil
society inthe decision makingprocess.

Addressing these issues under hard budget constraints remains a critical development
challenge to sustain economic growth in Albania,                since properly conducted
decentralization can increase allocative efficiency, reduce waste and un-provision o f
essential services, while maintaining macroeconomic stability.           In this regard, a
participatory decision-making approach may complement the current top down
decentralization reforms, as a method for ensuring awareness, transparency and
accountability.   Such an integrated approach will encourage the involvement o f civil
society and the private sector in the management, provision and financing o f public
services, local infrastructures and utilities-which  would expand the possibilities o f local
investment and growth. Nevertheless, the Government is committed to moving the
decentralization process forward at the extent and speed which are practically feasible in
each particular sector, given the current political circumstances, as well as capacity and
institutional building possibilities. Moreover, the principle that resources follow
responsibilities will be ensured, and responsibilities and competences shall be assigned
asymmetrically to local authorities according their respective capacity to deliver. Piloting
decentralization measures shall be adopted whenever possible.

Strategic directions in this area will focus on: (i) further clarification o f the role of the
Regions and o f the specific responsibilities and competencies o f local self-governments;
(ii)re-designingthe intergovernmental fiscal relation system, on the basis o f a closed
system o f local government finance, that factors in (besides well-regulated access to
borrowing) shared national taxes and explicit rules for the determination o f the size and

distribution o f transfers (both conditional and unconditional); (iii) implementationo f
                                                                    the
a financially sustainable national training strategy for local government; and (iv)
strengthened central coordination o fthe decentralization strategy.




Finally let me assure you that my Government i s determined and committed to continue
with the necessary actions and reform to improve the performance inpriority areas such
as health, education, infrastructure, improve governance and give a new impetus to
private sector development aiming to deliver a higher quality o f services to Albanian
citizens, ensuring a sustained growth perspective for the country.     Iamsurethatmy
country can rely on the continuous support of the World Bank and yours personally,

                               Annex 7: FundRelations Note

The Executive Board o f the International Monetary Fund (IMF) completed the fourth
review o f Albania's economic performance under the Poverty Reduction and Growth
Facility Arrangement on July 14, 2004. The decision enabled the release o f an amount
equivalent to SDR 4 million (about US$6 million), bringingtotal disbursementsunder its
current PRGF arrangement to SDR 20 million (about US$30 million). The three-year
PRGF arrangement was approved on June 21, 2002 for a total o f SDR 28 million (about
US$42 million). The financial position o f the Fundi s presented inTable 1.

On July 14, 2004, the IMF Executive Board also completed the financing assurances
review and granted the authorities' request to waive the nonobservance of an end-March
structural performance criterion, regarding the implementation o f the ASYCUDA
customs data management system and the initiation o f an integrity audit. The system
implementationwas subsequently carried out.

Following the Executive Board discussion, Anne Krueger, First Deputy Managing
Director and Acting Chair, said:

"Albania's performance during the second year o f the PRGF-supported program has been
satisfactory overall, with growth remaining strong, the external current account
improving, and reserves accumulating in excess o f program targets. Skillful management
o f liquidity by the Bank o f Albania, and ongoing fiscal consolidation and debt reduction,
contributed to a recovery in confidence, a strengthening o f the currency, and the
maintenance o f low inflation. However, fiscal revenue shortfalls relative to the budget
persisted, requiring significant expenditure reductions in 2003 to meet program targets.
Implementation o f structural reforms improved since the last review, and include the
finalization o f the sale o f Savings Bank, administrative reforms o f fiscal institutions, and
actions to remove investment barriers.

"The proposed program includes fiscal adjustment measures in response to a
reassessment o f the revenue forecast for 2004; and the authorities' decision on the use o f
the Savings Bank privatization revenues-half        o f which will be spent on investment
projects in priority areas, while the remainder will be used for debt reduction. The
program also includes revenue-enhancing tax policy measures; and further structural
reforms to improve the management o f fiscal institutions, governance, and transparency,
and to support central bank independence and foster greater financial intermediation.

"Over the medium term, maintaining growth and external sustainability will require
continuing on the path o f fiscal consolidation, as well as further structural reforms to
improve the business climate and attract export-generating foreign investment. Therefore,
the structural reform agenda appropriately focuses on improving budget revenue
mobilization and the efficiency o f the public sector-including  inthe deliveryofpoverty-
alleviating programs-as       well as on strengthening governance and the rule of law, and
removing administrative barriers to investment," Ms.Krueger said.
