Civil service administration reforms would\n            help increase professionalism among civil servants, and,\n            together with reforms aimed at improving the performance of\n            social sector line agencies, and the social insurance\n            institute, would thus improve the public sector's\n            capacity to effectively regulate, monitor, and deliver\n            services. Reforms in the areas of public expenditure\n            management, financial accountability, and procurement,\n            improve transparency and the effectiveness of public\n            spending. There is however, the risk that the institutional\n            mechanisms and frameworks put in place to improve\n            transparency, and accountability in the public sector, may\n            at times be circumvented to reap political benefits in the\n            run- up to the mid-2005 elections. Nonetheless, the\n            Government's track record in maintaining macroeconomic\n            stability through prudent fiscal, and monetary policies,\n            constitutes a strong mitigating factor. In addition, the\n            support provided under this project will be followed by\n            balance of payments support from the European Community. On\n            a longer term basis, the Government is committed to\n            increasing budgetary revenues, through improvements in tax\n            administration, and revenue collection, to help strengthen\n            its fiscal position, and external balance."}, "docdt": "2004-11-03T00:00:00Z"}
