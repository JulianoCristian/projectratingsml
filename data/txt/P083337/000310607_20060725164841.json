         Reduction Support Credit Project in Albania was\n            satisfactory, with a likely sustainability, substantial\n            institutional development impact, and satisfactory\n            performances by both the Bank and Borrower.  Lessons learned\n            include: the broad-based operation did allow flexibility to\n            seize opportunities where both development impact and\n            likelihood of implementation were high; it is recommended\n            that future policy-based loans take a more focused view,\n            pursuing a core theme in each leg of the overall operation,\n            even while maintaining an integrated approach to the larger\n            agenda, given the long-term nature of most reforms; at the\n            end of the day, lack of ownership cannot be substituted by\n            more conditionality; monitoring indicators need to be given\n            as much care as the conditions themselves; the National\n            Strategy for Social and Economic Development's close\n            link with the World Bank reduced donor buy-in in some cases;\n            donor coordination pays strong dividends when successful;\n            complementarity with investment operations should continue\n            to be pursued; future lending should try to ensure that\n            policy-based operations receive a significant share of\n            overall lending, and are strategically tied to the\n            investment lending agenda; much of the agenda is long-term,\n            and needs persistence, and sustainability cannot be defined\n            independently of development community support; analytical\n            work should continue through the program; the contrast\n            between health and education speaks to the importance of\n            seeing the big picture at the outset of the program, and is\n            echoed in the business environment; the partnership between\n            the Bank and the IMF has been a fruitful one."}, "docdt": "2006-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
