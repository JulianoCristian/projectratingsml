The\n            project will facilitate the implementation of the\n            medium-term macroeconomic adjustment program introduced in\n            1990.  The strategy to sustain institutional development\n            includes:  (a) ensuring adequate legislative and\n            administrative rules in targeted institutions; (b) revising\n            existing procedures and adopting new ones for\n            resource/budgetary use in those institutions; and (c)\n            beginning to build national capacity to plan, manage, and\n            communicate resource management issues, through training\n            Burkinabe, rather than through widespread long-term\n            technical assistance.  Specifically, the project will:  (a)\n            reinforce information and budgetary management functions in\n            the  Administrative and Finance Departments and the Research\n            and Planning Departments of four priority ministries\n            (Finance, Health, Education, and Civil Service); (b) finance\n            a civil service census and introduce new procedures for\n            civil service management and training; (c) support an\n            updating of Burkina's public procurement code,\n            legislation, and procedures; (d) through legal, procedural\n            reforms, and training, assist in creating a favorable\n            business climate with appropriate commercial laws, judicial\n            practices and personnel; and (e) finance the training of\n            Burkinabe journalists in economic journalism so as to\n            improve the quality of analysis and reporting of economic policies."}, "docdt": "1992-05-12T00:00:00Z"}
