MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE
INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMhNT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO BURKINA FASO
FOR A PUBLIC INSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.           I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation on a
proposed credit to Burkina Faso for the equivalent of SDR 11 million (US$15 million equivalent), to help
finance a Public Institutional Development Project. The credit would be on standard IDA terms, with
a maturity of 40 years. Norway, has agreed to provide the project with joint co-financing of about
US$300,000 equivalent.
2.           Background: The Government of Burkina Faso (GOB) has undertaken a program of
structural reforms supported by an IMF first year SAF (March 1991) and an IDA SAL of SDR 60 million
(June 1991). The adjustment program was prepared by the GOB over a two year period (1989-90) in
response to a sharp deterioration in economic performance and the recognition that the relatively good
performance during the first part of the 1980s was no longer sustainable. The rapid growth of public
consumption during these early years of the decade - financed to a great extent by the accumulation of
arrears and forced lending by the banking system - resulted in GDP stagnation in 1989 and 1990, a
serious budgetary impasse largely fueled by uncontrolled growth in the cost of the civil service, a growing
deficit in the current account (17% of GDP in 1989), and serious deterioration in the performance of
banks and public enterprises.
3.           In the face of these developments, the GOB is seeking to transform the structure of
Burkina's economy from one dominated by an all-encompassing public sector in which Government was
to be directly responsible for productive activities, into one in which the initiative for productive activities
is given to the private sector. In parallel, it is also introducing a political process with free multi-party
elections and the creation of new representative institutions. The GOB knows that, to succeed in this
wide ranging program of reform, it will need to be more efficient in its management of scarce public
resources. It also realizes that the structure and competence of the administration, as well as certain
aspects of the legal environment, will need to be reinforced if the medium term economic program is to
be fully implemented. Burkina's ingrained administrative culture grounded in the notion of 'the providor
state", its relatively expensive civil service, as well as very limited financial resources, present serious
constraints to institutional improvements. Although the SAL supports creation of the policy framework
for transforming the economy, it is not intended to reform institutions. It underlines the need to do so
however.
4.           In May 1991, the GOB presented its adjustment program to a Roundtable of Donors. At
t14 same time, it described its ongoing effort to prepare a comprehensive framework on technical
cooperation and institutional development (TA/ID). As part of the effort, a National Technical
Cooperation Assessment and Program (NATCAP) survey launched by UNDP has produced preliminary
results which recommend that: (i) technical cooperation be used in the future to build national capacity
rather than just providing technical skills through foreign TA; (ii) TA, where it is necessary, be used
increasingly in the priority sectors only (eg. Primary Education, Health, Infrastructure); and (iii) the use
of technical assistance and cooperation be better managed and coordinated.
5.           Objectives: The central objective of the proposed project is to support the GOB's
program to bring about sustained and equitable economic growth, through reinforcing the major public
institutions charged with economic and sector management. The IDA credit will finance a select number



2
of activities over a four-year v.riod. These activities constitute part of a larger program of institutional
development to which a nu ir of other donors are providing or planning to provide financial and
technical support. The Proje, .ill also serve as a vehicle around which the Government of Burkina can
more effectively coordinate otazer TA for economic managernent institutions, specifically from France's
Ministry of Cooperation, the UNDP, the AFDB and the 3overnment of Germany.
6.           Proec Descrition The proposed project will finance a four year time-slice of the
GOB's larger institutional reform program based on its policy framework for technical assistance and
cooperation. The project components are limited to actions which can be effectively completed during
the project period, and which will result in lasting improvement in key areas of civil service and
administrative behavior through the introduction of greater effectiveness, accountability, and transparency.
Total project costs are estimated at US$16.9 million equivalent, of which US$11.9 million are foreign
costs. The IDA Credit of US$15.0 million would finance about 97 percent of foreign costs and 89
percent of total costs. Norway will provide US$300,000 equivalent, financing about 3 percent of foreign
costs. Government's contribution of US$1.6 million equivalent would finance almost 9 percent of total
costs. A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods
of procurement and of disbursements, and the disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B. A
timetable of key project processing events and the status of Bank Group operations in Burkina Faso are
given in Schedules C and D respectively. An action plan for accelerating disbursements is attached in
Schedule E. More detailed information on the proposed project is provided in the Staff Appraisal Report
No. P-10332-BUR, including a detailed Implementation Manual (Volume II of SAR). The project
components are all considered essential to the success of the structural adjustment program. Specifically,
the project will consist of the following components:
(a)    Support to strengthen Information and Budgetary Management (US$8.6 million). Th¢
credit wil' finance short-term TA, training, computers and civil works to strengthen the
information and budgetary management functions in the Administrative and Finance
Departments (DAAF) and the Research and Planning Departments (DEP) of four priority
ministries (Finance, Health, Education, and Civil Service) as well as the capacity to
produce arl analyze statistical information in the National Institute of Statistics (INSD);
(b) Support to Improve Public Procurement (US$100.000). Through financing short-term
TA, and equipment, the credit will assist the Government in preparing new legislation
and strengthening institutional procedures to improve the public procuremert process;
(c)    Strengthening Civil Service Management and Services (US$3.4 million). Support will
include financing a civil service census and studies, as well as introducing training and
new service quality techniques to improve the management of the public sector wage bill
and the civil service in general;
(d)    Reforms to the Legal and Judicial System (US$2.8 millionl. Support will include
financing specialized assistance, training and civil works necessary to undertake the
formulation, conmmunication, and application of new commercial and business laws and
practices; and
(e)    Training of Economic Journalists (US$90.000). The credit will finance training of
Burkinabejournalists so as to improve the communication of economic policy and reform
measures to the public at large.
7.           PrJct Implem tation: The program of actions for each component has been largely
formulated and will be implemented by the Ministries and agencies to benefit from the project. Overall
responsibility for project coordination and administration will lie with the newly oriented Ministry of Civil



3
Service and Administrative Reform (MCSAR). The Director General of Administrative Reforms
(DOAR), supported by his staff, would coordinat.e project activities. Each of the three implementing
Ministries would designate someone from its staff to liaise with the DGAR and ensure that documentation
and reporting on project implememuation is provided as necessary. To enhance flexibility in planning and
implementation, the project will be carried out on the basis of annual work programs for each component,
including project related procurement. Coordination of donor support for the government's overall
program of TA/1D will be done by a Coordinating Commission created under the project, consisting of
Government and donor representatives, chaired by Government with UNDP as Secretary.
8.           Project Sustainability: Because management of the Project's individual components will
be carried out by the Ministries directly concerned rather than by an ephemeral management unit, and
because the womponents themselves conform to the overall strategy for administrative reform issued by
the Government, the design is expected to have a lasting impact on the development of key public
institutions in Burkina. It will also strengthen the role of the newly redesigned Ministry of Civil Service
and Administrative Reform in overall management of the civil service.
9.           Lessons Learned form Previous Bank Experience: Though IDA has not financed any
free-standing TA/D projects in Burkina before, key lessons learned from other TA operations in Africa
(including operations in Mali, Senegal and Niger) include: (i) the importance of a link between the degree
of Government commitment to the TA project in question and to a parallel adjustment operation; (ii)
defining as early as possible in-country training programs based on borrower needs and resources and
a well-defined strategy and eligibility criteria, thereby strengthening national training capacities and
limiting overseas training to justifiable exceptions; (iii) the importance of clearly defining the
responsibilities of any project management unit established and ensuring it does not take on a life of its
own during or after project completion; (iv) providing systematic and adequate supervision, with
appropriate technical expertise, both from headquarters and from the Resilent Mission; (v) limiting and
closely monitoring unallocated funds to ensure that financing requests are in line with project priorities;
and (vi) minimizing the financing of recurrent costs. .dentified as equally important on the basis of past
experience, is the need to allow for greater flexibility during implementation, rather than setting up a
rigid 'blueprint approach' more suited to capital investment projects. These lessons resulted in the
adoption of the following principles in designing the proposed project: (i) taking into account the changing
role of the state and its administration under economic adjustment and a political transition; (ii) critically
examining the concepts underlying existing or proposed public sector institutions; (iii) excluding from the
project what cannot be carried out and managed by the administration itself, and (iv) limiting project
activities to a finite time frame, within a clearly defined conceptual framework.
10.          Rationale for IDA Involvement:  Because IDA  is a privileged partner in the
macroeconomic and sector policy dialogue concerned with helping to improve economic management,
and because the sustainability of the adjustment reforms depends on the capacity of the GOB to implement
the SAL supported measures, IDA is well placed to extend its dialogue to institutional and process
reform. Experience from Burkina and elsewhere in the Sahel, as well as IDA's comparative advantage
in mobilizing and coordinating ir,ternational support for structural adjustment, will also help the GOB
better coordinate its overall program of institutional development in economic management, albeit
ensuring that other donors continue to support those activities for which they have a clear comparative
advantage.
11.          Agred Actions: Prior to negotiations, agreement was reached on the administrative
arrangements for: (i) coordinating support for the GOB's overall program of TA/ID; (ii) project
management; and (iii) the legal and judicial reforms specifically . During negotiations, agreement was
reached on: (i) TORs for all major consultant contracts to be financed under the credit; (ii) an action plan
for the dissolution of the National Procurement Office (ONMP) and related commissions with a new
system to go into effect as of January 1, 1994; (iii) the first year work program for the project; and (iv)



4
the Committee to review project procurement carried out with IDA financing. Prior to ciedit
effectiveness, the GOB would inter alia adopt legislation creating separate corimercial courts in
Ouagadougou and Bobo Dioulasso. It was also agreed that a number of actions related to the legal and
judicial component would be completed prior to credit disbursement against the legal component.
12.          Environmental Aspects: The project has no direct environmental impact and has been
categorized C.
13.          Pmgram ObWective Cate#ries: Though not focussed directly on poverty alleviation,
the project is intended to enable Government to more effectively and efficiently implement its program
of economic reforms, through improving the quality of Government services to the public at large. The
transparency of several key administrative functions and the accountability of those involved in managing
them will be enhanced. Through the legal and procurement reform components specifically, the project
is also expected to markedly improve the climate for private sector activity, and ultimately employment
prospects.
14.          Project Benerits and Risks: The main benefit from the project would be to facilitate and
accelerate implementation of Burkina's economic reform program, including management of the long-term
growth of the civil service. It would also serve as a vehicle for greater coordination of TA amongst the
donor agencies, thereby minimizing the often disparate nature of past TA. Although Burkina's trained
manpower base is relatively small, it is strong by Sahelian standards and it is therefore expected that new
guidelines and procedures will be mastered rapidly by the Burkinabe, resulting in lasting improvements
in economic management. The establishment of new procurement laws and procedures will also increase
transparency in an important area of Government spending. The main risk associated with the project
is the possible weakening of the Government's commitment to the economic reform program under a
niewly elected parliamentary regime. The ambitious and innovative nature of the program could also tax
the Government's capacity to implement it effectively. These risks are mitigated by the politically neutral
nature of the project, which should enjoy broad support. Also, although the MCSAR is newly
reorganized, the GOB has a strong commitment to building national capacity, has on its own taken the
initiative to produce a strategy framework and policy guidelines on TA/ID, and has been relatively
effective to date in managing donor financed projects, including a complex SAL. In addition, the GOB's
strategy of deconcentrating management and integrating implementation of each component into the line
ministry concerned, should minimize the complexity of managing multiple components. The project will
be implemented over a 4-year period in accordance with independently defined work programs which
permit flexibility and mid-course adjustments as necessary.
15.          Recommendation: I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Association and recommend that the Executive Directors approve it.
