While the performance by the Borrower is\n            satisfactory, despite the uneven, overall implementation,\n            until corrective measures were taken in late 1996-early\n            1997, the Bank's performance is unsatisfactory, given\n            the inappropriate implementation arrangements, and highly\n            inadequate supervision in the early years, with changes in\n            project objectives not adequately documented. Lessons\n            highlight that critical public sector reforms are possible\n            in a politically fragile environment, as proven by the\n            success of the public finance reform, which was internalized\n            because there was consensus for an improved budget\n            management, otherwise government activities would have been\n            suspended. However, idiosyncracy changes, could have\n            fostered the well prepared, though sensitive civil service\n            reform, which has yet to be implemented. Similarly,\n            institutional development is uncertain, and requires a\n            sustained engagement on the part of both the Government, and\n            the Bank. Conversely, information technology can be\n            successfully introduced in a poorly developed human resource\n            environment, provided external assistance, close attention\n            to technology transfer, and training programs are in place.\n            Finally, minimizing the financing of recurrent costs, was\n            paramount for project sustainability, while donor\n            coordination would have served better, under one influential\n            leadership role in a specific area of the national program."}, "docdt": "2001-05-29T00:00:00Z"}
