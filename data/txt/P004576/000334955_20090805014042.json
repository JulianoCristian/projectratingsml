Issues stemming from the\n            local political economy need to be addressed at project\n            entry because they strongly influence local ownership and\n            the ease of implementation. While well-intentioned and\n            useful in building client ownership, participatory processes\n            (usually associated with social and environmental\n            safeguards) require substantial up-front time which needs to\n            be built into implementation planning. Complex sub-projects\n            such as private sector contracts for water supply or solid\n            waste landfills require borrower expertise beyond\n            procurement and financial management; thus, adequate\n            provisions should be made for the significant technical\n            assistance requirements of local borrowers, including\n            monitoring and reporting on subproject outcomes."}, "docdt": "2009-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
