Some lessons learned included: In the absence\n            of an effective regulatory framework, the replication of\n            public assessment of water services (PAWS) for utilities\n            outside Metro Manila is unlikely to happen. Metropolitan\n            Waterworks and Sewerage System (MWSS) has succeeded in\n            securing sustainable financing for PAWS through the\n            concessionaires- replicating the PAWS system outside Manila\n            will depend on the extent to which the conditions for\n            sustaining it can be created. Given the difficulties faced\n            by National Water Regulatory Board (NWRB) in assuming a\n            broader regulatory mandate as proposed under executive order\n            (EO) 279, the expansion of PAWS outside Manila would require\n            Government of the Philippines (GOP) action to revive the\n            stalled reform process and make available adequate\n            resources. The planned Local Government Support for Regional\n            and Local Water Supply project will study the possibilities\n            of expanding PAWS outside Metro Manila. When designing,\n            implementing and managing complex sub-projects (such as\n            private sector contracts for water supply or solid waste\n            landfills), local government units (LGUs) often require\n            specialized technical assistance and capacity building\n            support from national government or the private sector. This\n            support goes beyond routine capacity building in areas such\n            as procurement, financial management and includes the\n            participatory methodology, design of affordable tariffs, and\n            establishment of regulatory frameworks. As most LGUs and\n            Government Financial Institutions (GFIs) are unlikely to\n            have this expertise in house, the borrower or implementing\n            agency should ensure that the design of on-lending programs\n            takes into account these technical assistance requirements.\n            GFIs may also consider designing special financing\n            instruments for special purpose subprojects."}, "docdt": "2007-06-28T00:00:00Z"}
