INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTTvE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE REPUBLIC OF CHILE FOR A
TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a
proposed loan to the Republic of Chile for the equivalent of $5.25
million to help finance a technical assistance project. The loan
would have a term of 20 years, including 5 years of grace, with
interest at 7-1/4 percent per annum.
PARI' I - THE ECONOMY
2.        The economy of Chile is dealt with in paragraphs 3-11 of
the President's Memorandum dated August 7, 1973 on Amendments to the
Loan Agreements for the Fifth Power and Second Highway Maintenance
Projects (Loans 479-CH and 558-CH) (R73-201). These paragraphs are
attached as Annex I, which also includes a Country Data Sheet.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN CHILE
3.        Starting with the very first development loan in its
history, the Bank has made 18 loans to Chile for a total, net of
cancellations, of $233 million and IDA has made one credit of
$19 million. Of the total Bank and IDA lending 54 percent has been
for electric power, 14 percent for roads and the remainder for
highways, agriculture and education. IFC commitments to date have
been $19 million - of which $15 million were in mining and the
remainder in industry - and >12 million are held by the Corporation.
A statement on Bank loans and IFC investments as at July 31, 1973,
and notes on ongoing projects are attached as Annex II. Bank Group
loans to, or guaranteed by, Chile constitute about 6 percent of
Chile's total outstanding debt, including undisbursed, and in 1972
accounted for about 4 percent of the country's scheduled debt
service obligations.
PART III - THE PROJECT
4.        Although the present Government in Chile has been
preoccupied with short-run economic and financial problems, it has
also recognized the great importance of carrying out a program of
preinvestment studies designed to build a pipeline of future development



- 2 -
projects. Many of these studies will require foreign exchange
expenditures for imported goods and consultants' services and Bank finan-
cing at this time would be particularly useful in covering some of
these requirements. The preinvestment studies to be financed by the
Bank should lead to the formulation of important development projects
for eventual loans from the Bank or other external lenders.
5.        The United Nations Development Program (UNDP) continues
to be the most important source of multilateral technical assistance
for Chile. Under the 1972-76 UNDP program of $20 million, $L.5 million
of aid was provided in 1972 and 5 million are expected to be utilized
during 1973. The main thrust of UNiDP assis-tance has been on manpower
training and institution building and only a very minor proportion has
been allocated for pre-investment studies. Chile has also been
receiving technical assistance from bilateral sources, with about
36.5 million equivalent obtained in 19(2. The continuing pattern of
these bilateral programs is to provide technical expertise for the
commodity producing sectors (e.g. agriculture, mining, industry,
fisheries), to offer fellowships to Chilean students to study abroad,
to provide a limited amount of equipment tied to purchases in the
donor country, andi to provide assistance to Chilean universities and
for vocational training programs. In two subsectors, forestry and
ship-building, technical assistance has been provided for pre-invest-
ment studies.  The project summarized below takes into account the
limited amount of pre-investmert work now proceeding in Chile,
utilizing a combination of outside technical su-oort and the country's
own resources, and would concentrate on additional studies of priority
importance  for Chile's economic and social developmeni.
Project Description
6.        The proceeds of the proposed loan would be allocated, by
mutual agreement bet-ween the Borrower and the Bank to individual sub-
projects  which are expected to be in the sectors of mining, metallurgy
and manufacturing; nutrition and fisheries; transportation; and water
planning. A Project Summary is attached as Annex III. Followiing
practice on previous loans of this type,the draft Loan Agreement
provides for considerable flexibility in the use of the proposed
loan. But discussions with the Chilean authorities have already
proceeded to the point where it is likely that most of the proposed
loan will be used as outlined below ancd described in mnore detail in
Annex IV.
a. Mining, Metal]urgy and Manufacturing.    Emphasis would
be on studies needed for the rational ex-pansion of copper production
and related activities,since Chile remains heavily dependent on its
copper mining industry for its foreign exchange earnings and the State-
owned copper corporation, CODELCO, is in need of assistance to plan
paths of future development.  Pre-investment studies relating to
mining production would be complemented by study projects involving
the leaching and recovery of copper from large dumps at the Chuquicamata



3-
mine, planning strategy for the El Teniente mine, recovery of selenium
on a pilot basis, and molybdenum and rhenium market studies, the latter
in the context of a national strategy aimed at market diversification.
In manufacturing, studies would be concentrated on expanding Chile's
productive capacity for domestic consumption and export in fabricated
copper products and in spare parts for mining machinery. Principal
export markets envisaged for these products are those of the Andean
Pact countries, and Eastern and Western Europe.
b. Nutrition and Fisheries. Most of the studies would be
aimed at correcting nutritional deficiencies and, in doing so, replacing
food imports with low-cost domestic products. A substantial number of
nutrition activities are under way in Chile and much innovative work has
been done. The successful conclusion of the studies could yield
significant results for export as well as for dcmestic nutritional needs,
and have important demonstration effects for other countries. Closely
inter-related with both nutrition and export expansion are two sub-
projects in the field. of fisheries.  One is for the exploration and
development of shrimp-like fish called krill, which are abundant between
the Southern part of Chile and the Antarctic region, and the other for
a research fishing vessel to aid in planning the more efficient exploit-
ation of Chile's extensive fishing resources.
c. Transportation. Sub-projects presently planned consist of
a regional road study in the Province of Valdivia, where there are rich
forestry reserves and important tourist potential, feasibility and
design studies for a much needed cargo terminal at the country's
international airport,and maintenance facilities for the national
commercial airline.
d. Water Planning. Studies are planned relating to water
use in the Santiago region, including the optimum phasing of major
works in the short and medium-term to meet both urban water requirements
and irrigational needs, as well as the subsequent steps needed in
project preparation.
Financing and Procurement
7.        The total estijitated cost of the tentative list of pre-invest-
ment activities to be financed under the loan is $10.5 million, including
a foreign exchange component of '5.25 million. Both consultants'
services and equipment required for the project have been divided between
those components expected to be obtained abroad and those expected to be
obtained locally. A substantial portion of the consultants' services
would be provided from local resources since considerable domestic
consulting capability exists in such fields as mining engineering,
construction engineering, industrial planning and administration, and
market and feasibility studies. The Bank loan would be earmarked to
finance consultants' services and equipment for the project which are



presently expected to be supplied from abroad, as well as a limited
amount of overseas studies by government persornel and overseas testing
services. The Bank loan would finance the foreign exchange cost
(estimated at about 70 percent of total cost) of work performed by
foreign consultants; if it turns out that Chilean firms prove better
fitted to perform consultant services of the types now expected to be
obtained abroad - whether they are hired directly or as sub-consultants -
the Bank would finance 70 percent of the cost of such contracts. The
draft Loan Agreement provides for retroactive financing of up to
.A100,000 for expenditures after August 1, 1973 to cover initial contractual
services under the project.
8.        The Bank's usual guidelines for the procurement of equiDment
by the borrower would be followed. For purposes of bid comparison and
award of contracts for equipment, Chilean manufactured goods will be
granted a preference of 15 percent or the applicable level. of import
taxes, whichever is lower. Goods manufactured in other member countries
of the Latin American Free Trade Association and the Andean Group
(Cartagena Agreement) will be granted a preference over goods manufactured
in countries outside those regional organizations equal to 15 percent
or the difference in the level of the respective import taxes actually
payable by Chilean agencies, whichever is lower.
9.        Various agencies of the Chilean Government will be responsible
for the execution of the sub-projects included in the Project, as
indicated in Annex IV. They will prepare terms of reference for the
studies, prequalify consulting firms, evaluate their proposals, enter
into contracts with them, and supervise their work, all. in cooperation
and agreement with the Bank. Since there will] be some 12 such agencies
involved, there is need for a coordinating agency and central channel of
comnunication. This function will be carried out by the Division of
Investment Financing and Control (Gerencia de Financiamiento y Control
de Inversiones) of the Central Bank. This unit was established at the
beginning of 197a to centralize and exercise control over all public
sector investments. It acts as a secretariat to ensure compliance with
policies formulated by an inter-ministerial and inter-agency National
Investment Committee (lomite Nacional de Inversiones).
PART IV - LEGAL INISTRWMENTS AND AUTHORITY
10.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Republic of Chile and
the Bank, the Report of the Committee provided for in Article III,
Section h(iii) of the Articles of Agreement and the text of a draft
resolution approving the proposed Loan are being distributed to the
Executive Directors separately.
11.       I am satisfied that the proposed Loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank.

EXCERPTS FROM PRESIDENT'S MEMORANDUM
DATED AUGUST 7, 1973 ON AMENDMENTS
TO THE LOAN AGREEMENTS FIFTH POWER
AND SECOND HIGHWAY MAINTENANCE PROJBCTS
(479-CH and 558-CH) (R73-201)
"3.        A report entitled "Current Economic Position and Prospects of
Chile" (WH-202b) was circulated to the Ececutive Directors on September
10, 1970. A small economic mission visited Chile in the fall of 1971,
and more recent information has been obtained from an IMF mission report
dated June 14, 1973 and a supplement dated July 5.
"4.        The present Government took office November 1970 and succeeded
during its first year in reaching its objectives of raising output and
employment and increasing workers' real wages. These achievements were
accompanied, however, by a reduction in investment, the buildup of severe
inflationary pressures and a sharp decline in foreign exchange reserves.
"5.        In 1972, Chile suffered serious economic and financial set-
backs. After substantial growth in 1971, GDP showed only a modest
increase (2.6 percent compared with 8.3 percent in 1971), as agricultural
production declined and manufacturing and construction activity slowed
down, while the mining sector stagnated. With a continued rapid rise in
aggregate demand, inflation reached record proportions and the balance
of payments came under heavy pressure. Despite the suspension and re-
scheduling of service payments on most of its external debt, Chile
suffered a major loss of external reserves.
" 6.        Real GDP is not expected to show any significant increase in
1973 and may even contract somewhat. With continuing large wage adjust-
ments and a substantial increase in the deficit of the public sector,
inflation is expected to accelerate further. Despite a recovery and
extraordinary rise of copper prices, balance of payments pressures are
expected to Gontinue as still unresolved technical problems and strikes
affect copper production.
" 7.        In the past two years, the Government has proceeded to imple-
ment important structural changes, including: nationalization of big
copper and iron mines; State control over coal and nitrate production;
State ownership of a large segment of the bahking system; the transfer
to "social property" of large enterprises in industry and commerce;
substantial acceleration of the agrarian reform; and State control of

Page L of 3
foreign trade. Most of the intended changes in the structure of the
economy have now been completed.  However, at least in the short-term,
the economy's reaction was negative as output in agriculture declined,
expected increases in copper production failed to materialize, organ-
izational and managerial problems became acute. anid public investment
was unable to offset the lack of private investment, thereby eroding
the basis for future growth.  The Government has become increasingly
aware of the urgent need for measures to resolve existing conflicts
between production, income distribution, and stabilization goals, and
some price and exchange rate adjiustments were introduced during June
and July of 1073.
N8.        The public sector deficit has increased considerably during
the last two years.  Tax revenues, in real terms, rose in 1971 by 3
percent and suffered in 1972 a 14 percent decline, after several years
of sustained growth.  Redistribution of income in favor of wage earners
reduced income tax collection and maintenance of low official prices
led to lagging indirect tax collection, while Government proposals for
tax increases were to a 'Large extent rejected by Congress. In parallel,
Central Government current expenditures (in real terms) in 1972 were 61
percent higher than in 1970, while capital expenditures declined by 5 per-
cent during the same period.  During the last twD years, while the rate
of inflation has accelerated rapidly, controlled prices have not been
adjusted in line with the increase in production costs. This price
policy has contributed to a critical deterioration in the financial
performance of the public enterprises which abide by the official
prices more strictly than private enterprises.
t9.        Exchange rate adjustments have not kept pace with changes in
relative production costs since the authorities abandoned a flexible
exchange rate policy in mid-1970.  The complicated system of multiple
exchange rates which is now in existence and a number' of payment
restrictions have considerably impaired the effectiveness of the
exchange rate as an instrument of' balance of payments management. The
Government is in the process of simplifying the exchange rate structure
and adjusting exchange rates on a selective basis.
"10.        After several years of steady improvement Chilets balance of
payments situation deteriorated sharply in 1971 and 1972.   In 1971, the
international reserves of the banking system declined by $305 million,
notwithstanding the suspension of external debt service payments amount-
ing to $5L million in the last two months of the year. The situation
further worsened in 1972, when net international reEerves dropped by
another $328 million despite debt relief of $361 million resulting
from the suspension and rescheduling of service payments on most of
the country's external debt. As of March 1973 short-term foreign
liabilities of the banking system ($445 million) exceeded short-term
foreign assets ($236 million) by $209 million as the banking system
has increasingly relied on short-term foreign borrowing to finance imports.



ANNEX I
Page 5 of 5
"11.       Despite somewhat improved prospects for exports, no reversal
is expected in the overall balance of payments situation in 1973, with
the overall deficit presently projected at some $630 million compared
with $700 million in 1972 prior to debt relief. With regard to debt
service payments, the Chilean authorities have requested that major
creditors reschedule some $260 million due in 1973. A meeting of the
creditors was held in Paris on July 12-13 to consider this request but
action was deferred pending the preparation of an economic recovery
program by the Chilean Government and its review by the IMF. An IMF
mission is scheduled to visit Chile in September to review the Govern-
ment's plans, and a further meeting of Chile and its creditors is
envisaged for late October. In the meanwhile the service on most of
Chile's external debt remains in suspense. Chile has arranged for the
postponement of some $30 million of payments to various U.S. banks and
firms during 1973, but even if it succeeds further in rescheduling the
$260 million due to major creditors this year, the estimated balance
of payments gap would still amount to some $340 million. A substantial
increase in short-term liabilities may therefore be unavoidable and in
addition Chile may well have to reduce imports and accept a reduction in
industrial production, consumption and investment."

C.  PROJECTS IN EXECUTION
Loan No. 479-CH - Fifth Power Project; $60.0 million Loan of December 23,
1960; Closing Date:  December 31, 1973; Undisbursed
Balance on June 30, 1973, $1.3 million.
EKecution of the project has generally been satisfactory and on
schedule.  Installation of the remaining 20OMW of the 1OOMW of generating
units in the project is expected to be completed at the end of 1973 and
the 220kV transmission system early in 1974. A brief extension would be
made in the closing date as a part of the Amendments to the Loan Agreement
for 479-CH and 558-CH recently recommended relating to the coverage of
interest and other charges during construction (R73-201).
Total project costs, expressed in U.S. dollars, are expected to
be within the original estimate, although individual cost items have
changed and the list of goods had to be revised twice. Tariffs were
increased at the end of 1971, but due to the rapid inflationary increase
in operating costs the rate of return on assets in operation fell below
the level provided in the Loan Agreement. In order to compensate for
the rising costs, the Government is considering a substantial increase
in ENDESA's power tariffs.
Loan No. 558-CH - Second Highway Maintenance Project; $11.6 million Loan of
September 19, 1965; Closing Date: December 31, 1973;
Undisbursed Balance on June 30, 1973, $3.7 million.
International bids for the purchase of equipment were invited in
early 1969 and contracts amounting to $6.5 million were awarded for a major
portion of the agreed equipmnent list. The equipment was received and was
put into operation immediately, thus contributing to the improvement of
highway maintenance.   In late 1971, international bids were opened for the
purchase of additional maintenance equipment and spare parts. Contracts
for only a portion of this bidding have been awarded and, because of
delays in deciding on the awards due to cumbersome administrative pro-
cedures, many items have been rebid.   Completion of procurement is now
expected by mid-197l. On the whole, because of the shortage of personnel
and of maintenance funds, progress has been only modest on the improvement
of maintenance operations in general. The workshop rehabilitation program

progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report any pro-
blems which are being encountered, and the action being taken to remedy
them. They should be read in this sense, and with the understanding that
they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of strengths and
weaknesses in project execution.

which started in 1968 has been progressing slowly because of the limited
availability of local funds. The training of highway personnel which was
being carried out by the IECO continued at a slower pace under Vialidad's
direct supervision; the proposed training of engineers and supervisors
abroad as originally contemplated did not materialize because of the
shortage of Vialidad personnel. For advice on transport coordination and
investment planning the Ministry of Public Works engaged two independent
French experts, who worked intermittently in Chile between late 1969 and
mid-1971. Because of the lack of continuity of the expert's services,
unsatisfactory quality of the final report, and the numerous changes of
personnel within the Ministry of Public Works,transport planning in Chile
has so far shown only limited improvement. In spite of these shortcomings,
the project has contributed to a general improvement of maintenance opera-
tions in Chile and the Government is appreciative of these results and
intends to continue the program. The closing date would be extended to
December 31, 1974 as a part of the Amendments to the Loan Agreement for
479-CH and 558-CH recently recommended relatIng to the coverage of interest
and other charges during construction (R73-201).
Loan No. 666-CH - Second Vocational Training Project; $1.5 million Loan of
April 23, 1970; Closing Date: December 31, 1973; Undis-
bursed Balance on June 30, 1973, $0.6 million.
Considerable time was lost initially due mainly to lack of local
funds and changes in the location of some training centers. However,
disbursements finally got underway in the second quarter of 1972 when
funds were made available for the civil works, and some equipment contracts
were let (mainly equipment for the agricultural and fisheries programs).
We have been informed that the contract for construction of a fishing
vessel (for training purposes) had to be cancelled, and rebidding seems
to be required. We are waiting for further information on the matter.
One of the training centers has been completed and a second is approaching
completion; work has not started on the remaining three. A major part
($224,ooo) of the undisbursed funds corresponds to the unallocated category.
The remainder is shared between equipment ($158,000), furniture ($12,000),
and construction ($168,000). No problems are anticipated in the procure-
ment of the remaining equipment, but further progress in the civil works
(the loan finances 15 percent of construction costs) will be subject to
the continued availability of counterpart funds.
Loan No. 668-CH - Third Education Project; $7.0 million Loan of May 7, 1970;
Closing Date: June 30, 1975; Undisbursed Balance on
June 30, 1973, $7.0 million.
Initially the main problems of this project had to do with organizing
the Project Unit and with shortages of counterpart funds. In recent months,
however, the major difficulties have been with contracting under usual Bank
procedures.  Invitations to bid for the first phase schools drew no response



ANNEX II
Page 4 of 4
due to the increasing difficulties of private contractors in obtaining
equipment, materials and finance. In view of this situation, the Bank
agreed to let the Project Unit award contracts for the first phase schools
by the system of "administracion delegada"t (cost-plus-fixed-fee). Under
this system, all materials and equipment are provided by the Ministry of
Education; contractors provide only their services.   Work is progressing
on phase I schools and invitations for bids on construction and equipment
for phase IT are presently being prepared. It is estimated that civil
works implementation is about 18 months behind schedule. The Bank is
discussing with the Government suitable measures to accelerate project
implementation.
Loan No. 668-CH - Second Highway Construction Project; $10.8 million Loan
of June 10, 1970; Closing Date: September 30, 1974;
Undisbursed Balance on June 30, 1973, $10.3 million.
Construction of a major road section (Loncoiilla-Consuitucion,
67 km), for which $1.8 million is allocated in the Loan, began late in
1971 but owing first to legal difficulties by the Chilean-Spanish joint
venture which won the contract, and later d*ue to the financial problems
of the Chilean partner, work proceeded very slowly, and so far only about
25 percent of construction work has been completed. Bidding for a second
road section (Santiago-San Antonio, 26 km), is stalled as no bidders re-
sponded to the call for tenders last September due to the same type of
contracting problems as those encountered under the education project
(Loan 668-CH).  The Bank subsequently agreed in principle to the Govern-
ment's proposals for divioing the work of the Santiago-San Antonio High-
way into six sections. The Bank also agreed that improvement of the
highly congested first 3 km of the road between Padre Hurtado and
Talagante, which is part of the Santiago-San Antonio Highway, be under-
taken by negotiated contract. Work on the latter is now well underway.
Only one contractor responded to the invitation to tenders for the
remaining sections at a cost much higher than anticipated. In view
of this second unsuccessful attempt, the Ministry has proposed to
undertake the remaining work on the Santiago-San Antonio Highway also
by negotiated contract. Discussions have been recently conducted in
Chile between Bank and Chilean staff concerning the amendments needed
in the Loan Agreement.

TENTATIVE SECTORAL COMPOSITION OF THE PROJECT
1.        The tentative sectoral distribution of the preinvestment studies
to be financed by the Bank loan is summarized in the table below.    The
individual studies envisaged in each sector are discussed in some detail
in the respective section on the sector, which explains the nature of the
sectoral program of studies and its significance to the economy.    out-
lined for each study are its purpose, scope, and expected result; and the
respective responsible executing agency, and probable manner of execution.
2.        A principal sector is mining and metallurgy, coupled with manu-
facturing projects which are closely linked to mining and include fabrica-
tion of metal-based products.   Nutrition and fisheries account for another
large prospective allocation of the Bank loan.    The transportation sector
is represented by a study of a regional highways complex, and two studies
in the field of civil aviation.   A water planning study completes the
envisaged program.

3.        Copper exports in Chile account for about 80 percent of mer-
chandise exports, and two mine-mill-smelter complexes (Chuquicamata and El
Teniente) account for 60 percent of total copper production in the country.
These two and three other large mines (El Salvador, Exotica, and Andina),
comprising the sector known as Gran ]MLineria, account for over 80 percent of
all copper production.   These mines were formally nationalized on July 11,
1971 and are now operated by CODELCO, the Corporacion del Cobre or State
Copper Corporation.
4.        Unquestionably, Chile possesses major reserves of copper (both
proven and potential).    The major strength of the sector lies in the opera-
ting facilities of the large mines and in the potential reserves.    The
weaknesses of the sector, as currently evident, stem largely from the
political history - not only of the recent past, but over the last 15-20
years, during which time political uncertainty affected corporate strategy.
From the mid-1950's till 1965, the major companies were not re-investing
significantly and output was static.    In 1965 an agreement was reached in
which the major companies, in exchange for various concessions, agreed to
an investment program aimed at nearly doubling output by 1972 (1965 -
479,000 metric tons, planned for 1972 - 880,000 metric tons).    By the time
of nationalization about $650 million had been invested and the expansion
program had been nearly completed.    However, production from Gran Mineria
was only 571,000 metric tons in 1971 and 593,000 tons in 1972; the total
for all copper mining was 699,000 tons in 1971 and 718,000 tons in 1972.
Total production in 1973 may fall below 700, 000 tons, compared to the target
of 1,100,000 tons for this year set in 1969.    At the time of nationaliza-
tion all expatriate personnel left, which led to great operating difficulties.
CODELCO is attempting to overcome difficulties stemming from lack of tech-
nical and managerial experience, continuing labor unrest, and technical
problems.
5.        The Government has not developed a comprehensive analysis and
definition of development priorities and capital requirements in the mining
and metallurgical sector.   A total of 13 potential pre-investment study
projects submitted by the Government was re-defined jointly by Bank staff
and  Government officials in the light of priority requirements in the
sector, and reduced to 5, as presented in the accompanying table.
The focus of the projects is on assuring future production of copper
(Projects A, B and C ), recovery of a by-product metal from copper production
(ProjectD ), and diversification (Project E).
6.        From the point of view of both immediate and long-term benefits
to the economy, ProjectA - studies related to development and expansion
strategy for large-scale copper mining, ranks highest in priority; if a



ANNEX IV
Page 4 of 2L pages
very significant input into CODELCG corporate planning is not rapidly made,
there is considerable danger to both profits and production.    Project B -
leaching of Chuquicamata dumps, Project C - El Teniente future planning,
and Project D - selenium recovery, also rank high in priority due to their
direct relationship to output.    Project E - molybdenum and rhenium market
studies - reflects priorities in the context of a long-r3nge strategy of
market and product diversification.
7.        The objective of the studies in the manufacturing sector is to
investigate the feasibility of expanding existing capacity,particularly
for export, and to some extent for domestic consumption as well.    The
studies cover spare parts for mining machinery in one case, and fabricated
copper and copper-alloy products in the other three cases.
8.        Among the Andean pact countries, Chile has already been assigned
the production of industrial valves and also some spare parts for heavy
mining equipmen'.   As regards country allocations under the pact, the
ability of a member country to produce goods quickly and efficiently will
be largely influential in determining the future supply patterns in the
Andean market.   PossibilLities also exist for exporting copper and copper-
alloy products to Western and Eastern European markets.
9.        Both domestic and external demand for these products is expected
to increase significantly, especially for drainage pipes, pipes for potable
water, and in the construction industry.    Copper has several important
advantages over plastic and iron products, having a higher heat-transfer
capability than plastic or iron and not being as susceptible as iron to
oxidation or corrosion.
10.       Slippage of projects in this or other sectors could permit other
high priority projects to be accormodated: e.g. a molybdenum processing
pilot plant; an increased budget for studies related to development and
expansion strategy for large-scale copper mining; studies and experiments
related to development of domestic self-sufficiency in coking coal and
coke; and formulation of a development strategy for the small and medium
mining sector.

A. Studies Related to Development and Expansion Strategy
of Large-Scale Copper Mining
11.       The studies would deal with high priority problems for which
expertise is currently not available in Chile.    The major copper mines
continue to operate as a result of considerable competence shown by tech-
nical staff.   However, the current situation resembles a company with
virtually no head office management and several relatively independent
operating units.   CODELCO, the State agency responsible for operating
the major mines, is in the process of building up technical and managerial
competence.   There are a great number of urgent problems to be solved
in planning future expansion and the development of new deposits.
12.       CODELCO stresses the need for foreign expertise, with work
conducted on a team basis with its own personnel, thus providing train-
ing in planning for CODELCO staff.
13.       The cost estimate of $250,000 equivalent in foreign exchange
and $50,000 equivalent in local currency is a conservative estimate of
what could usefully be spent during the loan disbursement period.
B. Experiments on Copper Leaching from Chuguicamata Waste Dumps
14.       The objective is to develop an economic method of recovering
copper from the waste dumps at Chuquicamata.    The project, in its first
phase, would require some laboratory equipment and a leaching expert
who would direct the program, which would include full-scale "heap leach"
and other tests.
15.       At Chuquicamata, after over 50 years of mining, there are accu-
mulated on surface some 800 million tons of "waste"l material, with a
copper content ranging from 0.3-1.0 percent.    Recovery of copper by
leaching techniques has been practised in the United States for some
years now, and material containing as little as 0.2 percent copper is
being leached. Thus, the Chuqui dumps constitute a major future source
of copper at a relatively low capital investment.    Essentially, all
that is required is to apply the most suitable techniques through a
program of test work.   Anaconda did initial test work in the period
1967-1971.
16.       An expert has been engaged by CLMM for one month and will make
a preliminary examination in Oztober 1973.    Further work could be launched
by about December 1973.



ANNEX IV
Page 8 of 24 page;
C. Studies Related to Future Operations at El Teniente Copper Mine
17.       To ensure the long-term economic viability of the mine and to
prepare for future expansion, the studies would focus on developing a new
mining method and on assessing the implications of proposed changes on
the overall operations of the mine-mill-smelter complex.
18.       The El Teniente mine is the largest underground mine in the
world and has about 50 percent of the currently proven copper reserves
in Chile.   A major aspect of its successful operation in the past has
been the relatively friable rock which has facilitated mining.    However,
this type of material is nearly exhausted and future operations will
have to be conducted in a much harder rock.    A totally new mining system
has to be developed with considerable speed, since within five years,
nearly 50 percent of the production will have to come from such new
areas.   Programs for this were drawn up in 1969, but little has been
done since.
19.       The proposed study program will require a considerable local
commitment, particularly in the preparation of experimental stopes for
testing and training purposes.    Foreign consultants would cooperate on
a team basis with Chi:lean staff.
20.       Of the estimated foreign exchange cost of $320,000 equivalent,
$200,000 would be required for long-hole drilling equipment and instru-
mentation.   The $820,000 equivalent in local currency would be orimarily
for experimental stope preparation.
D. Selenium Pilot Plant
21.       The project involves the construction and operation of a pilot
plant for the recovery of selenium metal.    It would include the establish-
ment of final criteria for scaling up the pillot plant to full scale pro-
duction.
22.       Selenium is a by-product metal associated with copper in the
relationship of about 1 part selenium to 15,000 parts copper.    It is
not now recovered at ('huquicamata but is sold in the electrolytic slimes
and in the Dor6 furnace slags.   Annual recoverable value is in the order
of $300,000 and the objective is to increase the domestic value added
and revenue by recovery from the slags and sale of the pure metal.    In
CIMM there are currently two experts with extensive selenium recovery
experience in Canada, and the proposal is based on their expertise. The
proposed pilot plant scale would be 9 tons per year and this would be
up-graded at a later stage to full capacity of 35 tons per year. Initial
test work has been completed and an optimum process selected.    The
CD4MCODELCJO objective is not to purchase a turnkey plant but to econo-
mize and gain domestic know-how by purchasing components and assembling.



AINEX IV
Page 9 of 24 pages
23.       The success of the project depends on the continuing availability
of the experts for at least two years. The project is ready to be launched,
and start-up of the pilot plant could be 10 months after commitment,
according to a CIMM est±mate.  ChIMM would be responsible for technical
expertise and CODELCO for engineering.
2)4.      The estimate for the pilot plant phase is $660,000 equivalent
(including working capital and contingency allowance).  The foreign exchange
requirement would be $270,000 and would make allowance for external travel
as well as providing a reserve for external advice; the local currency
component would be $390,000, the amount believed to be necessary to complete
the pilot plant phase.
E. Study of Markets and Marketing S-trategy for Rhenium and Molybdenum
25.       The project envisages two market studies which would focus on
current market requirements, barriers to entry, possible marketing strategy,
and future trends in end-uses. The objective is to indicate an optimum
market strategy, thereby specifying what end-product lines should be devel-
oped in a plant which is due to be constructed in San Antonio. The plant
will process molybdenite concentrates (MoS2) producing technical grade
molybdic oxide (MoO3) and recovering rhenium as ammonium perrhenate (and in
another form). The process was developed by Hazen Research and patents are
held by the Compania de Acero del Pacifico, the State steel enterprise.
26.       Most international trade is currently in the form of molybdenite
concentrates and technical grade. Tariff barriers and relatively narrowqly-
held processing know-how have dissuaded major producers like Canada from
further processing. The Chilean strategy is theoretically sound, but one
which will require major inputs of capital, time and technical effort.
The risk, in the technical assistance context, is that something ambitious
will be launched which it may subsequently be difficult to sustain. The
major profit potential ln molybdenum is up to the technical grade product,
with the value added in subsequent steps being capital and know-how
intensive, and with profit margins, in addition, being narrow. It is
expected that a decision regarding a possible pilot plant for the further
processing of molybdenum would be dependent on the findings of this project.
The estimated foreign exchange requirement of $150,000 includles an alloca-
tion of $50,000 for off-shore laboratory research on new applications for
rhenium.
F. Spare Parts for Heavy Machinery, primarily Mining Equipment
27.       The objective is to determine whether to construct a new plant
for the manufacture of standardized spare parts for heavy machinery,
primarily in the mining sector, and/or to expand present manufacturing
capacity. The markets envisaged are both domestic and those of the
Andean Pact countries.



A,NNEX IV
Page 10 of 24 nages
28.      Although a study of the Chilean marKet is available, the scope
of this study is very limited;   another study, undertaken by a foreign
consulting firm, is now out-of-date.     The terms of reference for the
feasibility study would be defined on the basis of the findings of the
market study.    It is expected that both phases of the study would be
completed within 12-15 months.
29.      It is expected that the market study would be carried out by
a foreign consulting firm with limited participation of local consul-
tants.   The feasibility study would probably also be undertaken by a
foreign consulting firm but in close collaboration with local consultants.
G. Copper and Copper-Alloy Fittings
30.      The products involved are industrial valves, fittings and pipe
joints for export markets, primarily within the Andean pact countries,
though in Eastern European countries and some Western European countries
as well.   One important question to be examined is whether to expand
the capacity of the existing plant, NIBSA (now under CORFO), or whether
to construct a completely new plant.    The present factory has many
deficiencies and its products supply only the Chilean market.
31.       A study, completed in October 1971, contains preliminary market
projections and examines the possibility of installing a copper fittings
plant in Chile.    The study was sponsored by CIIEC j1, and its conclu-
sions call for a detailed market study of the Andean region, and a more
detailed technical feasibility study.     It is anticipated that both the
market study and the feasibility study could be completed within 12
months.
~2.       It is expected that the market study would be undertaken by a
foreign consulting firm, with participation by one Chilean consultant;
and that a Chilean consulting firm wzould have major responsibility for
the feasibility study, with the assistance of one foreign specialist.
H.   Power and Telecomnunication Cables
33.       The objective is to examine the feasibility of manufacturing
power and telecommunication cables in Chile for export markets.      The
power cables would be manufactured from electrolytically-refined copper
for medium voltages (above one kV).     Various materials would be used
for insulation, e.g. plastic, rubber aiid lead-coating.    There would be
a detailed study of international markets, including possible markets in
East Germany and the Soviet lJnion, where specific interest in purchasing
these products has been expressed.    The feasibility study would examine

governmental Council of Copper Exporting Countries).

the possible construction of a new plant, the expansion of present
capacity, the kind of product to be manufactured, and the quality of
the insulating material being produced in Chile at present.
34.       Two companies in Chile, MADECO  and Cobre Cerrillosk'with
plants in Santiago and Antofogasta, already manufacture electric-power
and telecommunication cables.   Considerable expertise already exists
in Chile regarding the manufacture of these products, and some previous
feasibility studies are available.   Chile also has some experience in
marketing these products abroad.   The market study and the feasibility
study should be completed with 10-12 months.
I.    Tubes, Plates and Strips, of Copper and Copper-Alloys
35.      The objective is to examine the feasibility of expanding pro-
duction of tubes, plates and strips of copper and copper-alloys for
export markets in the Andean region, Eastern and Western Europe.   The
major manufacturer of these products in Chile is AADECO.  IMADECO has
supplied primarily the Chilean market but has also exported to the
United States, Europe and South America.   Both parts of these studies
should be completed within a period of 10-12 months.
NUTRITION AND FISHERIES
36.      The Government of Chile ranks nutrition among its high priorities
and is committed to improving the nutritional status of its population,
particularly the nutritionally vulnerable groups (children; pregnant
and lactating women).   A substantial number of nutrition activities --
both experimental and operational -- are under way.   The National Milk
Program, which provides half-a-liter of free milk a day to 3.6 million
beneficiaries (80% of the population in the vulnerable groups), may be
the most comprehensive such effort undertaken in a low-income coun'try.
37.      The basis of concern is the high degree of malnutrition-related
mortality and debilitating effects of malnutrition on the survivors.
Children under five years of age constitute 12% of the Chilean population
but account for 32% of all deaths (compared to a common range of 3% to
6% in industrially-developed countries).   Nutritional deficiencies
are identified as the underlying or associated cause of 24% of the deaths
among children in Santiago;  36% in rural areas.   Protein-calorie mal-
nutrition has been identified as the major nutritional problem in Chilean
j   Manufacturas de Cobre S.A.   Both MADECO and Cobre Cerrillos are
state-owned enterprises under CORFO.



ANNEX IV

children, affecting both physical and mental growth.   Much of the
pioneering research o01 the relationship of malnutrition to mental devel-
opment has been eonducted in Chile. and the .disturbinp findings of the
studies there are partly responsible for the high degree of goverrnent
interest in the subject. VitamirL A deficiency and nutriticnal anemias
are other forms of child malnutrition common-Ly found in Chile.
38.       Meeting nutritional needs through government programs that
use milk, meat and other traditional foods is generally an expensive
means of attacking the problem.    In Chile, the costs are greater as a
result of heavy dependence on food imports.    Agricultural imports in
1972 were $450 million. a third higher than those of 1971 and nearly
double those of 1970.    Agricultural imports for 1973 are expected to
be $50G-$Y00 million.    Relatedly, the prices of foods on the interna-
tional market have increased markedly.    Chile paid $450 a ton for
imported dry milk in l1971; $860 in 1972.
39.        It is against this backdrop -- a recognition of the malnutri-
tion problem, a commi-tment to do something about it, the generally high
cost of meeting the need with traditional foods, scarcity of domestically-
produced foods, and inadequate foreign exchange to meet the increasing
food prices on the international market -- that the Government has planned
a major nutrition ini-tiative with the dual aim of improving the diet with
inexpensive foods and reducing food imports.    Present difficulties in the
agriculture sector have helped to generate the pressures to undertake
projects for short-term purposes, but a continuing need exists in Chile
both to expand meat and dairy production and to develop other less expen-
sive foods, using ava:ilable local resources, to meet the country's nutri-
tion problem.  IMuch of the emphasis to date in the field of nutrition
has been on the development of low-cost processed foods made largely from
indigenous raw materials, and it is within this context that the nutrit-ion
component of the technical assistance loan is presented.     The Production
Development Corporation (CORYFO) informed Bank staff of the existence of
19 nutrition project investment possibilities, estimated to have a total
cost of $15 to $20 million, for which pre-investment studies should be
carried out.   Preliminary screening by Bank staff resulted in a narrowing
down of the proposals to those which are especially attractive, on both
nutritional and economic (import substitution and, in some cases, export
potential) grounds.
40.       The government agency in Chile responsible for research in con-
nection with the extensive fisheries resources of the country is IFOP, the
Instituto de Fomento Pesquero (Ins-titute for Fisheries Development), which
is a dependency of CORFO.    IFOP has an ongoing program of fisheries
research financed by its regular budget.    This comprehensive research
program is closely interrelated with the research work of Chilean univer-
sities, particularly Catholic University, which has an outstanding Oceano-
graphic itesearch Institute built up with extensive aid from the Rockefeller
Foundation.   In connection with this activity, which is of high priority
for improved commercial fishing operations and for development of the con-
siderable potential in the sector, a research vessel is needed.



ANNEX IV
Page 13 of 24 pages
41.        The Chilean Government desires to obtain such a vessel under
conditions of international competitive bidding, which would permit its
acquisition under the most favorable conditions, as in the case of other
equipment financed by the loan. Its estimate of the cost is US$1.5 mil-
lion equivalent, which is believed to be reasonable for a vessel of
the specifications cited (a purse-seiner and trawler, 30 meters long,
1,000 H.P. motor, 10-ton hydraulic winch, automatic navigation equipment,
fish freezing and storage facilities, oceanographic and biological
laboratories, equipment for fish detection).
42.     As in the case of the other sectors, the following table
provides an indication of the kinds of work that might be appropriately
financed under the nutrition and fisheries component of the loan. The
list is presented as illustrative and does not preclude variations or
other possibilities in the same area that the Government may wish to
present for Bank consideration.

A. Central Protein Institute (CPI) Projects
b3.       CPI is a central research and development agency, started in
1971 to develop new foods for malnourished children.   The institute is
responsible to CORFO.
h4. (i) FTL (Formula Trigo-Leche)
FTL is an instant dried milk extender or substitute, made from
wheat protein concentrate (a byproduct of wastes from wheat processing),
dry milk and vegetable oil.   Without flavoring, this product is a cream-
colored power (similar to powdered milk) that is soluble and in most
aspects has characteristics similar to those of milk.   FTL has a slight
astringent taste, disguised by the addition of flavoring.
L6.       The milk-like product can be produced in the 14 dairy drying
plants, now largely idle during winter months.   Preliminary estimates
are that the product cost would be as much as 40 percent less than dried
milk.   An estimated potential production of 20,000 tons of FTL (doubling
current dry milk production) could save a reported $14 million a year of
imports.
h6.       Preliminary production tests and acceptability trials have been
successfully conducted using one facility.   Needs are for market and
feasibility studies and a test industrial scale production that would
provide both product and information required for the above studies.
47.       Foreign exchange is required for equipment (enzyme reactor,
pilot reconstituting unit, quality control laboratory, sterilizing unit),
imported raw materials for the tests (soy, chemicals, milk, flavoring,
packaging), three man-months of foreign consulting time (food engineering
and marketing), and contracts for foreign nutritional and chemical analyses.
L8.       The studies, which are expected to be completed in six months,
would provide, inter alia, data on acceptability of several formulations
of FTL, a marketing design, and an understanding of what specific changes
are needed in the dairy industry for maxiinum production of FTL.
)49. (ii) Fish (Hake) Protein Complex
CPI envisions a series of three protein complexes designed to
produce a variety of products from a variety of raw materials, the actual
mix being dependent at any given time on local commodity availability and
prices on the international market.   The major product will be a powdered
milk analog, estimated to be approximately half the cost of milk, based
on a new Chilean-developed fish processing technology that uses hake.
The product is a white soluble powder with similar appearance and texture



ANNEX IV
Page 16 of 2L pages
to milk;  the smell or taste of fish cannot be cietected.    The fish
offals are used to make a milk replacement for calves, with the purpose
of increasing the to-tal milk supply.   (Currently, 180,000 calves a
year are slaughtereci because Chile cannot afford to divert cow's milk
from human to animal use).    The calf feeder is 30 percent less costly
than currently imported (approximately $2 million a year) commercial
brands.   The same facility would produce hake pulp to substitute for
meat in sausages (a practice common in Japan), at a foreign exchange
saving of 42 percent and at a lower cost than producing meat in the
country.   Chile now imports yearly about $32 million of meat for sau-
sages production.   Also,several other intermediate and final products
for both human and animal foods would be produced.
50.       Needs are for feasibility and marketing studies for a chain
of three protein complexes (feasibility studies have been carried out
for the first plant in Talcahuano; other sites are Iquique and Valdivia)
and test production runs designed to determine optimization of production.
The studies will require a small-scale pilot plant and added equipment to
an already-established semi-industrial experimental plant.     Equipment
needs include tanks, pasteurizers, evaporators, reactors for enzyme hydcro-
lysis, and laboratory instruments.    Certain imported raw materials and
ten consulting months (food engineer, marketing specialist, fish economist,
naval architect) are also required.    Three months will be required for
production tests and six months for market     testing.    The feasibility
studies are expected to take six months.    Successful completion of the
studies would lead to specific investment plans for the protein complexes.
51. (iii) Krill
Of special interest in Chile is the potential of krill, a trans-
parent but otherwise shrimp-like shellfish found in abundance between the
southern part of Chile and the Antarctic region.    Very approximate esti-
mates suggest a total of 100-200 million tons in the Antarctic region and
a possible catch of 50 million tons a year.    To date, only the Russians
and Japanese have fished for krill, using it both for human consumption
(as a fish paste, a cheese-like food, and a filler added to other shell-
fish dishes) and animal feed.    In addition to the nutritional value of
krill (a 50-million ton catch woulcd yield 7-million tons of high-quality
protein), a resource of this magnitude has obvious major potential impli-
cations for the economy.    For purposes of comparison, the anchovy catch
off the coast of Peru in a normal year totals 10 million tons.
Because of its nearness to the resource, Chile has a clear com-
parative advantage in trying to exploi-t the krill.   (Whereas krill probably
could be fished within one day of Chile, Russian and Japanese ships must



ANNEX IV
Page 17 of 24i pages
be equipped for a 45-day voyage).   However, the Antarctic region where
the fishing would take place and the southernmost region of Chile where
additional settlement may be necessary for the project are difficult
areas in which to live and work.    (Fishing would be limited to five
months a year).   Also the know-how in catching krill is yet to be
developed in Chile and may constitute a difficult step.
53.       The technical assistance loan could provide funding for a team
of experts to study the situation and help plan a strategy and work plan
for approaching the krill opportunity 'the team including a marine re-
sources specialist to judge the size and movement of the schools; a fish
technologist to advise whether nets, pumps, or other devices are the best
means of catching the krill; a marketing expert to advise on export
potential; a shellfish processing technologist to advise on product
development; and a naval architect to advise on the type of fishing
craft needed for the Antarctic area).
B. Fish Oil
5b.       A recently developed Chilean process (now patented in a dozen
other countries) has produced on a small scale an edible fish oil that
reportedly could substitute for two-thirds of the 65,000 tons of imported
edible oil.   After being treated in the traditional way, the fish oil
under the new process is hydrogenated and separated into liquid and solid
fractions which are used as raw materials for shortening and margarine
(the liquid fraction is deodorized and then blended with vegetable oils).
55.       Estimated timing for the tests and studies is six months.
Technical studies and the beginnings of a pilot plant are underway. Funds
from the technical assistance loan could make available imported equipment
required to complete the pilot plant (compressors, centrifuge for crys-
tallization), needed chemical engineering consultants, and travel to Norway
and Denmark to study other fish oil facilities.    Such funding is expected
to produce the required knowledge in 4-5 months to design an operational
plant.
C. Extruded Protein Products (primarily soy)
56.       Chile has adapted an oil extrusion technology to produce on an
experimental scale a low-cost, oilseed-based meat substitute known as TVP
or textured vegetable protein.    The technology is versatile, though the
protein source in the experimental work thus far has been soybean, a crop
now being successfully introduced at economic cost into Chilean agricul-
ture.   TVP can be designed both as a simulated meat or as a meat extender
(the latter normally adding 30 percent).    Chile's TVP is of high quality,
in processed form indistinguishable from ground meat.    (An estimated
$10 million of meat is annually imported for use in ground form, besides
the $32 million of meat for sausage mentioned above; much of this is said
to be replaceable with the new product).



ANNEX IV
Page 18 of 2.1 pages
57.       The proposed facility and equipment that could produce the
meat-like products could also make extruded soy-based baby foods, a
protein-rich flour, and several other soy-based products.    To maximize
the returns, the sponsors, INTEC/CORFO, envisaged a protein complex with
the flexibility to produce a variety of foods.
58.       A feasibility study for the complex is near completion.    The
needs that could be met from the technical assistance loan are an engineer-
ing study, market testing, and imported equipment (e.g., extruder, dryer)
to produce larger scale quantities of the various products needed for
market testing.   An estimated six months is required for the tests which
should result in a comprehenSive investment proposal for the extrusion
protein complex.
D. Nutrition Education
59.       Chile has an active nutrition education campaign, primarily in
conjunction with its National Milk Program.    Wide use has been made, for
example, of mass media directed toward proper use of government-distributed
powdered milk and toward encouraging a longer period of breastfeeding
(premature weaning being a major nutrition problem in Chile).    The
National Health Service, which runs the milk program and much of the
related nutrition education, is now interested in a systematic evaluation
of the messages it has been communicating and in testing and evaluating
alternative messages and media, especially encouraging proper use of new
products described above. With an understanding of the relative effective-
ness of messages and various media that can be expected to emerge from this
study, the Government should be in a better position to plan and conduct a
more systematic nutrition education effort, and thus establish a better base
'or investment planning.
60.       Expected time of study is four months.    Funding has been
requested for equipment and supplies and one month of foreign consultancy
by a mass media nutrition education expert.
E. Fisheries
61.       The fisheries activity to be financed has been described above
(paras. 40-41).
TRUANSPORTATION
(Highways and Aviation)
62.       Because of the country's elongated shape (4,250 km long, but on
the average less than 200 km wide), its low non-uniform population density
(about half of the population lives within a 160 km radius of Santiago),
and the concentration of economic activity in vastly separated regions,
transportation in Chile has traditionally been both crucial and costly.



ANNEX IV
Page 19 of 24 pages
63.       Apart from mining, which takes place in the northern and central
regions, most economic activity is concentrated in the central and southern
regions.   An extended road and rail transportation system, stretching from
the northern border with Peru to the southern tip of the continent, ade-
quately links all the major productive areas.    Little additional expansion
of the trunk network seems warranted at present.    Nevertheless, secondary
and feeder roads in some areas require improvement.    Also, there are zones
of economic potential still undeveloped due to lack of access roads. Such
is the case in the eastern part of the Province of Valdivia, where there
are rich forestry reserves and important tourist potential.    A study of
four proposed roads in that area has been included in the project.
6h.       Due to the geographic situation of Chile, physically separated
from its neighbouring countries by the massive barrier of the Andes, and
separated by considerable distance from the world industrial centers, air
communications are of exceptional importance for the country.    To facili-
tate the access to Chile of new, larger types of aircraft and to meet the
existing and future expected demand for international travel, the Govern-
ment began in the 1960Us the development of a modern international airport
at Pudahuel, near Santiago.   A master plan for the development of various
facilities was prepared, but detailed feasibility and engineering studies
for a number of major components are still lacking.    The project would
help in carrying out such studies for two of the main components of the
new airport, namely the construction of a cargo terminal, and the planning
and construction of maintenance facilities for the national airline
(Lineas Aereas Nacionales de Chile - LAN).

A. Highways in Valdivia Province
65.       The Direcci6n de Vialidad of M4OPT has proposed to carry out
feasibility studies and preliminary engineering for the following four
new roads located on the eastern side of Valdivia Province, close to the
Argentinian border (see map):
(i)   Panguipulli-Choshuenco (33 km);
(ii)   Riflihue-Enco-Choshuenco (40 km);
(iii)  Puerto Maihue-Huilo Huilo-Puerto Fuy (60 km); and
(iv)   Choshuenco-Puerto Fuy-Pirihueico-Huahun (65 km).
66.       These roads aim at opening up new areas for forestry development,
agriculture, and tourism; one of them (No. iv above) is expected to
establish year-round traffic with Argentina through the Huahun Pass (alti-
tide 64o km), which is practically the only pass between the two countries
which is not closed by snow during the winter season.    These new roads
will link the well-known Argentine tourist areas north of Bariloche with
several lakes of important tourist potential in Valdivia Province.    Via-
lidad has also mentioned the possibility of Argentina's exporting fruits
on the future road through Huahun via Choshuenco-Rin^ihue to the Chilean
ports of Valdivia or Puerto Montt.    This possibility would be explored
during the feasibility study.
67.       Vialidad, through a contract with a German specialized firm
(Salzgitter Industriebau), carried out in 1971 and 1972 aerophotographic
studies of about 3,000 km of roads in several parts of the country, inclu-
ding 43 km in the area of Panguipulli and Pirihueico.    For the route selec-
tion and preliminary engineering of one of the proposed roads (Puerto
Maihue-Huilo Huilo-Puerto Fuy), additional aerial photography of about
6,o00 hectares is required.
68.       The execution period of the feasibility studies has been estimated
at six months; the only limiting factor is the period for taking the aerial
photographs which, because of weather conditions, have to be taken between
October and March.
69.       The studies are expected to be carried out by local consultants
assisted by or associated with foreign consultants, under the supervision
of the experienced Direccion de Vialidad.    It is estimated that foreign
agricultural and transport economists would be required for a total of
about 7 to 8 man-months.   The aerial photographs would be taken by the
Chilean Air Force and processed (aerophotogrammetric restitution) by the
University of Chile.
70.       Cost estimates were prepared on the basis of man-months needed
for carrying out the feasibility studies and on an average cost per km for
the preliminary engineering based on recent Chilean experience in similar
studies.   The list and cost of equipment required for this study, to be
purchased under the proposed loan, was prepared by Vialidad and comprises
items such as transits, levels, soils laboratory equipment, vehicles, cal-
culating machines, etc., and appears reasonable.

B. Cargo Terminal at Pudahuel Airport
71.       The construction of Pudahuel airport, which began around 1965,
was based on a staged mast;er plan to develop an international airport near
Santiago, to meet the country's demands for international travel during
the seventies and eighties.    The Government has completed the construction
of the first stage of runways and aprons and is planning to start the
construction of a passenger terminal in the near future.    Within Puadahuelvs
master plan, an area of about 10,000 m2 was allocated for the construc-
tion of a new cargo terminal, but the planning for the development of
cargo handling and cargo terminal was never carried out in detail.
Temporary facilities were erected. when the new airport began operating
in 1967, but the very high growth of cargo traffic (27 percent per annum
between 1968 and 1972) rapidly exceeded the availa1ble facilities.    The
total airfreight arriving at Pudahuel during the 1970-72 period averaged
10,000 tons per year, while the outgoing airfreight averaged 6,ooo tons
during the same period.    At present, part of the airfreight is stock-
piled in open areas where it is difficult to control the movement of the
stocked goods, security is cdifficult to enforce and the goods may be
spoiled during the sometines long periods needed for customs clearance.
These factors have resulted in a slowing down of the demand for airfreight,
which could be substantially increased if adequate facilities are provided.
72.        The proposed study would comprise a feasibility study and a
master plan for the cargo terminal and recommendations for its operation,
as well as a management and operations research study on the proper hand-
ling of airfreight through the airport complex.     The study would not
comprise detailed designs, which would be carried out later directly by
the Direccion de Aeropuertos of MOPT.
73.       One of the main problems to be faced by the management stuAdy
concerns the functions and activities of several government organizations
which intervene in the operations of airports:
(i)   The Direcci6n de Aeropuertos, which designs, builds and
maintains airports;
(ii)   The Direcci6n de AeronAutica, which controls airport
operations; ar(i
(iii)   Tne Junta de Aeronautica Civil, which sets policies for
civil aviation, and is responsible for tariffs and traffic
regulation.
In addition, other authorities such as customs, immigration, health and
police security forces, as well as air carriers, also intervene in various
aspects of airport operations.    T'he coordination of activities of all the
above mentioned authorities to facilitate freight movement and dispatch,
and to minimize the investment cost of the cargo terminal should be one
of the objectives of the study.



ANNEX IV
Page 23 of 24 pages
74.       The study would be carried out by foreign consultants assisted
by, or in joint venture with, local consultants. The execution period
has been estimated at about eight months and the total cost estimate of
about US$200,000 has been prepared on the basis of approximate man-months
required for the various aspects of the study.
C.  Aircraft Maintenance Facilities at Pudahuel Airport
75.       Since Pudahuel airport began operations, the Chilean National
Airline (LAN) has been facing a problem for the maintenance of its equip-
ment.  At present LAN's aircraft maintenance facilities are located in
the old Cerrillos airport (now used for domestic traffic) while a major
portion of LAN traffic (mainly international) operates through Pudahuel.
Minor repairs are carried out at Pudahuel, where a small workshop is
located, while major repairs are carried out at Cerrillos, for which the
planes have to be ferried back and forth from Pudahuel. The permanent
flow of spare parts and mechanics from Cerrillos to Pudahuel and vice-
versa, the simultaneous operation of two maintenance facilities, and
the short flights for repairs between the two airports are clearly
uneconomic operations and create an unnecessary hazard for civil aviation
in the area.
76.       Since 1965 LAN has been planning to move its repair facilities
to Pudahuel, and an area of 42.5 hectares has been reserved in the air-
port's master plan for the maintenance facilities. In fact, in 1966 LAN
carried out some drainage and urbanization works as well as the construc-
tion of an apron of about 90,000 m2 for aircraft parking in the reserved
area. A study of the required maintenance facilities, taking into
account the existing and expected new types of aircraft, is consequently
needed and the Government attaches high priority to it. The study would
comprise:
(i) A feasibility study of alternative solutions; and
(ii) A master plan.
It is expected that the study could be carried out in about six months
by a joint venture of local and foreign consulting firms.
77.       LAN, the executing agency, has prepared reports on the proposed
study which show that they are well acquainted with the problem and
capable of carrying out and supervising the study. Should there be any
slippage in any one of the items to be financed by the loan it would be
possible to enlarge the study to include detailed design.

WAT&R PLANN1ING
78.       To provide for the continual growth of urban water demand for
the Santiago region and, at the same time, not to reduce and possibly to
expand the extent of the adjacent irrigated zones, additional sources of
water must be found and, more effective use made of existing supplies.
Various alternatives are being considered as possible solutions.    The pro-
posed water planning study is now needed as a basis for decisions regarding
the nature and phasing of major works, phasing of later detailed studies,
and policy matters such as institutional arrangements and water charges.
The study has high priority in view of prospective water shortages and the
need to resolve conflicts affecting urban and agricultural uses.     Tts
scope would include flood control, sewerage, and recreational use, besides
human consumption and irrigation.
79.       Plans for the study, including terms of reference and phasing
of the components, have been developed by the responsible agency in this
field, the Direcci6n General de Aguas (DGA) of the Ministry of Public
Works and Transportation.    It is expected that the stucdy would be completed
by the end of 1974.   Decisions based on the conclusions of the study
would be taken by DGA and higher-level bodies in the Chilean Government.
80.       The cost of the study is estimated at   $610,000 in foreign
exchange, with the local cost component estimated to be equivalent to
$975,000.   The foreign exchange cost is composed of $350,000 for equip-
ment (for such items as surveying and meteorological instruments, vehicles
and standard office machines) and $260,000 for foreign consultant services,
which will be needed in view of the complexity of the study.     The most
likely source of foreign expertise would be a consulting firm, or possibly
a joint venture of two consulting firms, rather than individual experts.
