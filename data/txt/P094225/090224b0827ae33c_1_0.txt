                         The closing date of the Third Additional Financing has been extended from June 30, 2014 to March 31, 2015 in order to provide additional time for the implementation of several

                         closing date with all the project activities successfully completed. The distribution of the micro-projects under the Third Additional Financing so far is as follows: 42.6% for micro-
                         projects in the most vulnerable communities, 39.2% for micro-projects in vulnerable communities and 18.2% for micro-projects in least vulnerable communities.

                         The local government financial management training for 201 local community officials of the communities that have implemented ASIF III micro-projects was successfully carried out
                         after a delay and completed in August 2014.

                         The Government of Armenia approved the ASIF’s evolution/transformation strategy in March 2014. The World Bank and the Government of Armenia initiated the preparation of a new
                         World Bank project, Social Investment and Local Development (SILD) project, to support the implementation of the ASIF’s evolution/transformation strategy with a US$30 million loan.
                         The preparation of the new project is at a pre-appraisal stage and is expected be appraised in November and approved by the World Bank’s Board of Executive Directors in February
                         2015.

                         The Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC) has provided a $303,000 grant to the ASIF to support the preparation of the SILD and to facilitate ASIF’s transition into a
                         Territorial Development Fund, which according to the Government’s current timetable is scheduled for January 2015.
