INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT

for the year ended 31 December 2015
To the Management of the Armenian Territorial Development Fund
We have audited the accompanying financial statements of the Armenian Territorial
Development Fund (the ATDF) which comprise the statement of financial position as at 31
December 2015, the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income, statement of
changes in equity and statement of cash flows for the year then ended and a summary of
significant accounting policies and other explanatory notes.
Management's Responsibility for the Financial Statements
The ATDF's Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these
financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards, as issued
by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) within the International Federation
of Accountants (IFAC), and for such internal control as management determines is necessary
to enable the preparation of special purpose financial statements that are free from material
misstatements, whether due to fraud or error.
Auditor's Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit.
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing as issued by
International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board (IAASB) within the IFAC. Those
Standards require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance whether the financial statements are free from material
misstatement.
An audit involves performing procedures to obtain reasonable audit evidence about the
amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the
auditor's judgment including the assessment of the risk of material misstatement of the
financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those assessments, the auditor
considers internal control relevant to the entity's preparation and fair presentation of the
financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the
circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the
entity's internal control. An audit also includes the appropriateness of accounting policies
used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements.
