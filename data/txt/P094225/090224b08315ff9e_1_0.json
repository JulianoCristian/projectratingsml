outcome was moderate,\n            the Bank performance was moderately satisfactory, and the\n            Borrower performance was satisfactory. Some lessons learned\n            included: the report made several recommendations on\n            improving operations and maintenance, including: (a) adding\n            additional criteria for review before approval of project\n            proposals, including separate items or annexes to show\n            operation, maintenance, and sustainability costs for assets;\n            (b) giving priority to and encouraging applicants who\n            conduct operations and maintenance on existing assets at an\n            appropriate quality and level; (c) evaluating the operation\n            and maintenance of assets previously improved by the ASIF in\n            the case of communities that are applying for additional\n            ASIF funding after receiving a project in the past; and (d)\n            providing enhanced training on operations and maintenance.\n            These recommendations translated into inclusion of more\n            strict requirements in the follow-up operation (SILD). Being\n            a country with high seismic risk and vast, high mountainous\n            areas (where the winters are long and cold), Armenia has\n            some specificities that have to be taken into account at the\n            technical design phase. The technical design, complying with\n            high seismic safety standards, and subsequent delivery of\n            good quality and cost-effective community works projects\n            were important factors for ensuring affordable\n            sustainability costs both with regard to infrastructure\n            maintenance and functioning (mainly heating costs) and for\n            obtaining beneficiaries\u2019 satisfaction for the services delivered."}, "docdt": "2015-09-30T22:34:03Z"}
