                         The objective of the Project is to support the Government's policy to raise the living standards of the poor and vulnerable groups through: (i) improving the quality and
                         access, and increasing the coverage of community infrastructure and services in poor communities, and for the most vulnerable groups in response to critical needs; (ii)
                         promoting complementary institutional capacity building at the community and municipal level so as to improve the quality and sustainability of community investments
                         and service delivery, increase accountability, and enhance greater stakeholder empowerment at the local level; and (iii) creation of employment associatedwith the
                         provision of community infrastructure and services.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project remains on track to achieve its development objectives, with PDO targets met or on track for being met. By December 2013, 283 micro-projects were completed and
                         another 24 ongoing. Strong implementation progress is also reflected in the disbursement figures, with: ASIF III original credit fully disbursed and closed; First Additional Financing

                         projects, however several larger micro-projects will require additional time to complete and the Government submitted on January 8, 2014 a project closing date extension request to

                         enable successful completion of all micro-projects and full credit disbursement. The distribution of the micro-projects under the Third Additional Financing so far is as follows: 41% for
                         micro-projects in the most vulnerable communities, 39% for micro-projects in vulnerable communities and 20 percent for micro-projects in least vulnerable communities.

                         The local government financial management training for 200 local community officials of the communities that have implemented ASIF III micro-projects has still not started. This is
                         due to a negative response from the Prime Minister's Office to ASIF’s request to authorize the initiation of this activity with the originally envisioned budget. After considering several
                         options on how to proceed within the approved budget, the ASIF decided to reduce the training duration and the number of training modules while keeping the planned number of
                         trained officials in order to reach the PDO target.

                         After initial delays in starting the work on ASIF’s evolution/transformation strategy, the strategy has been successfully developed. It is expected to be approved by the Government in
                         January 2014.

                         The Government of Armenia and the World Bank have reached agreement on a new World Bank project to support the implementation of the ASIF’s evolution/transformation strategy
                         to be supported with a US$30 million loan. The preparation of the new project will be initiated as soon as the ASIF’s strategy has been approved by the Government.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The ASIF evolution strategy should be approved by the Government. Local government financial management training for 200 local community officials should be initiated. The final
                         allocation of AF3 credit funds should meet the requirement to have at least 40% of the loan proceeds be allocated for MPs in the poorest communities and not more than 20% of the
                         loan proceeds be allocated for MPs in the richest communities. The project closing date extension request should be processed for World Bank management's consideration.
