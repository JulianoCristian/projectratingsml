F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)

The objective of the project is to support the Government's policy to raise the living standards of
the poor and vulnerable groups through: (a) improving the quality and access, and increasing the
coverage of community infrastructure and services in poor communities and for the most
vulnerable groups in response to critical emerging needs; and (b) promoting complementary
institutional capacity building at the community and municipal levels so as to improve the quality
and sustainability of service delivery and municipal investments, increase accountability, and
enhance greater stakeholder empowerment at the local level.

Revised Project Development Objectives (as approved by original approving authority)

The objective of the project is to support the Government's policy to raise the living standards of
the poor and vulnerable groups through: (a) improving the quality and access, and increasing the
coverage of community infrastructure and services in poor communities and for the most
vulnerable groups in response to critical emerging needs; (b) promoting complementary
institutional capacity building at the community and municipal levels so as to improve the quality
and sustainability of service delivery and municipal investments, increase accountability, and
enhance greater stakeholder empowerment at the local level; and (c) creation of employment
associated with the provision of community infrastructure and services.

The Project Development Objective (PDO) was revised with the First Additional Financing (1st
AF) (approved by the Board on February 24, 2009, on an emergency basis) to reflect the objective
of creating temporary employment during a time of economic stress.

1.     Project Context, Development Objectives, and Design

1.     The Armenia Social Investment Fund (ASIF) III Project (Main Credit) was approved by
the World Bank’s Board of Executive Directors on October 26, 2006; became effective on
December 20, 2006; and was closed on March 31, 2012. It was followed by three Additional
Financings (AFs) approved as follows: 1st AF on February 24, 2009; 2nd AF on February 25,
2010; and 3rd AF on February 14, 2012, the latter being closed on March 31, 2015.

1.1    Context at Appraisal

2.      Armenia is a small, landlocked, mountainous country in the Caucasus Region, with limited
natural resources and an estimated population of 3.2 million (at the time of appraisal). The poverty
rate decreased from 56.1 percent in 1998/1999 to 34.6 percent in 2004 and the severity of poverty
decreased from 7.2 percent to 2.4 percent over the same period. In absolute numbers, almost
700,000 people were lifted out of poverty, in the five years preceding project preparation.

3.      However, still over 1 million people were living in poverty—including vulnerable groups
such as orphans, refugees, and disabled persons—and among them, 200,000 were considered very
poor. Although the registered unemployment rates stood at around 10 percent of the labor force,
some survey data indicated rates three times higher. At the same time, regional disparities in
income suggested that the benefits of growth did not reach some of the regions, and around 145
communities living in high mountainous areas continued to lack basic social and economic
infrastructure as well as key social services.

4.     Among the Government’s development programs, improvement of the social sectors
became a medium- and long-term priority with particular focus on three main subsectors: health,
education, and social services. Each of these subsectors witnessed significant progress during the
years before appraisal, but further challenges remained.

5.      Health sector. High priority has been assigned to primary health care (PHC) as reflected
in the Government’s ‘2003–2008 Strategy for Primary Health Care of the Population of Republic
of Armenia’. However, better access to quality health care services for the poor remained a
challenge due to shortage of funds, which prevented proper maintenance of medical facilities and
the replacement of outdated medical equipment. The shift in focus to PHC supported by increased
health expenditures relative to gross domestic product and improved access to drinking water
became important priorities. The Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper envisaged achieving 24-hour
water supply from centralized services to 98 percent of the urban population and 70 percent of the
rural population by 2015.

6.      Education sector. The main goals of the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper were to ensure
the availability of education facilities and to improve the quality of education while prioritizing
the area of general education. To meet these goals, public expenditures on education were
significantly raised during 2003–2005, also supporting the increase in teacher salaries and the
improvement of school facilities. Despite these achievements, further efforts were needed for
improving school heating systems and for the proper endowment of better furniture, teaching
materials, science laboratories, and libraries. Another perceived need was related to special


                                                 1
furniture for children entering elementary schools at the age of five and a half years. Also, in the
area of early childhood education, increasing the number of kindergartens was identified as a
priority to cover the increased demand for such services.

7.      Social services. A wide variety of social services were mostly provided by local, national,
and international non-governmental organizations (NGOs), being supported in certain areas of the
country by public funds, sometimes in partnership with local governments. Small communities
were virtually unable to provide social services apart from occasional ad hoc support. Although
the communities had the legal power to provide social services, the state was not able to adequately
provide the necessary funding.

8.      Among the vulnerable groups identified as being in need of social services, the following
groups were considered to be of priority: (a) the elderly and disabled; (b) children at risk; and (c)
internally displaced persons and refugees. Several local initiatives were launched with donor
financial and technical support in partnership with the Government by establishing integrated
social service centers (including ‘one-stop’ shops) and social assistance centers for beneficiaries
from these vulnerable groups. The promising results of these initiatives paved the way for further
increased support in the development and provision of social services on a sustainable basis.

9.      Institutional capacity. The territorial administrative organization of Armenia comprises
10 regions (marzes). Yerevan, the capital, also has the status of a marz in addition to the other 10.
Marzes are further subdivided into 930 communities or local self-Government units. Although
specific legislation was enacted by the Government through the Law on Local Self-Government
(2002 and subsequent amendments in 2004) to advance the decentralization process, its
effectiveness was still in the early stages at the time of appraisal. A new Law on Municipal Service
(2005) brought more transparent provisions regarding the hiring, qualifications, terms of reference,
and security of tenure for municipal employees. These laws opened the doors for enhancing
decentralization but the effectiveness and efficiency of the process depended on the institutional
capacity of the local administrative units to properly implement the legal, functional, and financial
aspects of their daily duties, which were still limited at that time.

10.     The delivery and provision of social services depended on the institutional capacity
available at the local Government and community levels, which continued to be a major issue at
the time of project appraisal as they were inadequate. In broad terms, institutional capacity at the
local levels was negatively affected by: (a) institutionally weak local Governments with limited
financial resources and skills needed for the decentralized management of service delivery; (b)
inadequate systems of accounting, financial planning, and budgeting at the local level; (c) lack of
effective partnerships at the local level; and (d) inadequate involvement of local institutions,
village councils, and citizens in the decision-making process and in service provision.

11.    Armenian Social Investment Fund (ASIF). The ASIF was selected as implementing
agency for ASIF III project given its experience acquired since its establishment in 1996, good
performance in implementing its predecessor Bank financed projects (ASIF I and ASIF II) and its
demonstrated ability to reach out remote, isolated and vulnerable communities, obtain their
residents’ consensus on development priorities and help mobilizing collaborative efforts to
implement them. ASIF’s activities complemented those of the Government, as the Government
was not involved in small and medium-scale infrastructure works. Thus, ASIF was mandated with


                                                 2
the task of supporting the Government’s efforts to improve the living conditions of the poor and
improve their access to basic social services in rural and isolated vulnerable communities.

12.      ASIF’s institutional framework went through several transformational phases during its
life. Initially ASIF was established an autonomous organization through a Government Decree.
After close to three years in operation ASIF got the status of a regular project implementation unit
for projects financed by the Bank with the status of Closed Joint Stock Company. Beginning with
the ASIF II project (2000), ASIF was established as Fund operating as an autonomous entity
governed by a Board, with full authority to manage and administer its program in accordance with
the operating guidelines and procedures agreed with the Bank.

13.     For the purpose of ASIF III project, ASIF maintained the status of an autonomous public
organization, and improved its organizational structure and procedures to properly cope with the
emerging implementation requirements of the new project. ASIF continued to be governed by a
Board, chaired by the Prime Minister. At the time of project appraisal, the Board included: (i)
representatives of the line ministries (Finance and Economy, Territorial Administration and
Infrastructure Operation, Urban Development, Education and Science, Labor and Social Issues (ii)
the Mayor of Yerevan; (iii) representatives from NGOs; and (iv) the Executive Director of ASIF.
ASIF’s activity is financed from the Bank’s loan/credit, Government transfers, and contributions
of the beneficiary communities, and from other bilateral and international donors. Details about
recent institutional developments and financing opportunities of ASIF are presented in Sections
2.5 and 5.2 (b) of the report.

1.2      Original Project Development Objectives (PDOs) and Key Indicators

14.     The objective of the project is to support the Government's policy to raise the living
standards of the poor and vulnerable groups through: (a) improving the quality and access and
increasing the coverage of community infrastructure and services in poor1 communities and for
the most vulnerable groups in response to critical emerging needs; and (b) promoting
complementary institutional capacity building at the community and municipal levels so as to
improve the quality and sustainability of service delivery and municipal investments, increase
accountability, and enhance greater stakeholder empowerment at the local level.

     The PDO refers to poor communities and the wording is maintained unaltered to be consistent with the legally
approved documents (original and revised). However, the funds allocation was done based on the vulnerability of
communities defined through an econometric analysis of a national community survey, which identified 13 indicators
strongly statistically correlated with a community’s predisposition to fall into the nationally defined poverty level.
Communities were then ranked on this vulnerability assessment and clustered into three categories (most vulnerable,
vulnerable and least vulnerable). Thus, the ICR refers to these communities as vulnerable, instead of poor, throughout
the document.



                                                          3
15.     The key indicators identified to measure progress toward achieving project outcomes were
the following:

          Increased community infrastructure and services providing higher quality and better
           access in poor and vulnerable communities targeted under the project, measured by the
           number of micro projects (MPs) completed
          Capacity building at the municipal level to train municipal officials directly involved
           in community MPs in financial management (FM), measured by the number of officials
           trained
          Strengthened social service delivery systems through integrated social service centers,
           specialized for vulnerable groups, measured by the number of centers established for
           persons in difficulty
          Empowerment of beneficiary communities through capacity building to effectively
           plan and manage their investments on a sustainable basis and strengthen partnerships
           with the local Governments, measured by the number of beneficiary communities
           included in the project and the number of municipalities that received training and
           technical assistance
          Enhancement of poverty targeting through a community mapping and profiling
           exercise designed to identify the neediest communities in Armenia, measured by the
           number of communities included in the poverty mapping exercise

1.3    Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
       Reasons/Justification

16.      The objective of the project is to support the Government's policy to raise the living
standards of the poor and vulnerable groups through: (a) improving the quality and access and
increasing the coverage of community infrastructure and services in poor communities and for the
most vulnerable groups in response to critical emerging needs; (b) promoting complementary
institutional capacity building at the community and municipal levels so as to improve the quality
and sustainability of service delivery and municipal investments, increase accountability, and
enhance greater stakeholder empowerment at the local level; and (c) creation of employment
associated with the provision of community infrastructure and services.

17.     The PDO was revised with the (emergency) 1st AF, which was in response to a
Government request in the context of the financial crisis (approved by the Board on February 24,
2009), by adding an additional outcome—the creation of employment associated with the
provision of community infrastructure and services. This reflected the Government’s intention to
combine social assistance to the poor in the form of MPs with job creation of paid employment.
In order to measure this new objective, new indicators were introduced, first in the level of PDO
indicators, later transferred to the level of intermediate indicators, as follows:

          Contribution to short-term employment and income generation in poor participating
           communities as measured by the number of jobs created and income generated from
           completed MPs and local manufacturing of new school furniture


                                                4
18.     At the same time, the opportunity was taken to revise and adjust the targets of some original
indicators.

1.4    Main Beneficiaries

19.     The ASIF III Project (including the three AFs) targeted the following main beneficiaries:
(a) vulnerable communities in the rural and urban areas of Armenia; (b) children and their teachers
from kindergartens and elementary, primary, and secondary schools in urban and rural areas; (c)
patients from vulnerable communities and medical staff providing medical care in health facilities
(d) lone or homeless elderly from residential care institutions; (e) local Government staff (village
councils, mayors, and selected professional staff); and (f) locally based training providers. Local
businesses and the private sector also benefited through competitive tendering for the small works
contracted under the project.

1.5    Original Components

20.    The project design comprised three components:

       (a)     Component 1: Community Investments (total estimated base cost, US$24.97
               million). This component was designed to continue the work of the ASIF II Project,
               with improved procedures regarding the quality of works, sustainability,
               participation, and targeting of project funds for the MPs for the provision of social
               and economic infrastructure in vulnerable communities, under a participatory
               framework. These MPs were intended to respond to emerging priority
               infrastructure needs through construction and/or rehabilitation of schools, including
               libraries; science laboratories; gymnasiums and playgrounds; specialty schools
               (arts/music, sports); health clinics; multipurpose community-based centers; small-
               scale water supply, sewerage, and rural electrification systems; minor irrigation
               works; and access roads.

               To support the Government’s priorities in the delivery of social services, some
               specific investments such as the rehabilitation or reconstruction of an integrated
               social service center (one-stop shop) in Aratgatson, a center for elderly (shelter for
               homeless) in Yerevan, and a kindergarten for children with disabilities in Gyumri
               were identified and agreed during the preparation phase. Also, the improvement of
               school heating systems and the endowment of school furniture and teaching
               materials for elementary schools were identified as priorities for financing under
               the project.

       (b)     Component 2: Local Level Institutional Strengthening, Monitoring, and
               Evaluation (total estimated base cost, US$0.60 million). This component aimed
               at complementing the community investments component through the provision of
               technical assistance, training, and support services designed to increase the
               competence and accountability of the municipal administration in support of the
               Government’s decentralization initiatives. Building upon the findings of the
               institutional assessment carried out under the ASIF III Policy and Human
               Resources Development (PHRD) Grant (US$316,000), in consultation with


                                                 5
               Government counterparts, key donors, and Bank staff involved in the municipal
               development, this component was designed to support capacity-building efforts
               focusing specifically on the provision of basic training in FM, budgeting,
               accounting, and asset management. The training was to be provided for mayors,
               finance officers, accountants, and village council members in those communities
               where the ASIF implemented projects (small and medium), having thus a strong
               comparative advantage.

               Monitoring and evaluation (M&E). Special studies, technical assessments,
               formal reviews, and workshops to support and enhance the M&E capacity at the
               local level were included among the activities eligible for financing under this
               component. Also, study tours to provide training and learning opportunities to the
               ASIF’s technical staff in the areas of local development, institution building, and
               M&E were included under this component.

       (c)     Component 3: Project Management (total estimated base cost, US$3.14
               million). This component was designed to provide institutional support to the ASIF
               to effectively implement local programs and projects under an integrated
               development framework, in line with the Government’s poverty reduction agenda
               and its decentralization program. This component financed operating costs,
               including salaries, utilities, office equipment, training, financial audits, and
               management information system (MIS) maintenance.

1.6    Revised Components

21.    No revision was made to the project components of the ASIF III Project (Main Credit)
during the implementation.

1.7    Other Significant Changes

22.     The Emergency Additional Financing (1st AF) amounted to US$8 million and helped scale
up the activities under Component 1 (community investments)—with specific focus on small-scale
infrastructure and the associated manufacturing of furniture, special equipment, and teaching
materials for schools—as a short-term solution to the crisis through immediate temporary work
opportunities.

23.    The Second Additional Financing (2nd AF) amounted to US$7 million (approved on
February 25, 2010) topped-up allocations for Components 1 and 3.

24.    The Third Additional Financing (3rd AF) amounted to US$11 million (approved on
February 14, 2012) added resources for all three components.

25.      Table 1 summarizes the loan and credit funds allocation among the project components
as initially and subsequently approved. (Note: figures from the below table differ from the figures
in Section 1.5, which presents the total estimated base costs of the Project at Appraisal by
components).

26.    Several small closing date extensions were approved by the Bank for the Main Credit and
two of the AFs to either complete the advanced ongoing projects or to bridge with the follow-up
operations:

            IBRD-78470- seven months, from March 31, 2012 to October 31, 2012
            IDA-50710 - nine months, from June 30, 2014 to March 31, 2015

2.       Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1      Project Preparation, Design, and Quality at Entry

27.     The project was expeditiously and thoroughly prepared in slightly more than seven months
from the review of the Project Concept Note (March 2006) to the approval by the Bank’s Board
of Executive Directors (November 2006). The ASIF III Project preparation overlapped with the
last months of the preceding ASIF II implementation (closed on August 31, 2006). Also, the
design of the project benefited from the Bank’s experience of having covered 110 social fund
projects in the Europe and Central Asia Region and 58 countries from other regions since 1987.

28.      It also benefitted from the technical support provided under a PHRD Grant amounting to
US$316,000 (Grant No 055130) that financed two important studies for the project preparation:
Institutional Assessment (April 2006) and Social Service Assessment (March 2006).

29.    An advance payment facility amounting to US$1.5 million was approved in May 2006 to
provide early financial support for project preparation; for piloting new techniques related to
enhancing the quality of works (norms, standards, design, and supervision), sustainability, and
community participation in 20 MPs; and for supporting the ASIF office in project preparation.

30.     Since ASIF III was a repeater project, following ASIF II, there was no Quality at Entry
Review. However, the Second Quality Assessment of the Lending Portfolio (2nd QALP) in 2010
selected ASIF III among the projects to be reviewed and commented on the Quality of Design.

31.    The report appreciated that: (a) ASIF III was strategically relevant to the Government’s
poverty reduction and decentralization strategies and later to the Government’s initiative to offset



                                                   7
the impact of the economic crisis from 2008; and (b) the design drew on lessons from earlier
generations of the project and improved the project’s focus on vulnerable communities with better
targeting of subprojects and strengthened the capacity of procurement.

32.     However, several weaknesses were identified relating mainly to the: (a) relevance of the
RF to the assessment of PDO achievement; and (b) inability to assess other aspects related to the
community’s ability to pay for infrastructure and services, measurement of benefits from prior
operations, and the nature of national poverty and how this project would reduce vulnerability.
Given these weaknesses, the 2nd QALP report rated the Quality of Design as Moderately
Satisfactory.

33.    The implementation previous projects in Armenia fell short on poverty targeting, quality
of works, sustainability and institution building. The ASIF III project acknowledged them during
the preparation phase and incorporated several features in the project design to address these
weakness, based on the experiences of other similar operations as detailed further on.

34.     Objective poverty targeting criteria are critical to the proper identification of the
neediest beneficiaries. The fact that a clearly formulated poverty targeting and an allocation
mechanism based on objective criteria and poverty data ensures the flow of project benefits to the
neediest segments of the population and mitigates political pressures in the allocation of funds was
acknowledged. As a result, following the 1st AF the ASIF III Project design incorporated an
improved targeting strategy using a two-stage process—tested under social fund programs in
Europe and Central Asia—consisting of geographical targeting of project funds by region followed
by the identification of the needy communities within each region through a community mapping
and profiling exercise, based on a set of detailed criteria.

35.     Adequate quality of works is a prerequisite for sustainability and client satisfaction.
A good quality of community works for the projects identified as priorities by participating
communities is considered to be critical for obtaining clients’ satisfaction with the services
received. It also contributes to the increase of contractors’ accountability and to the mitigation of
the corruption risks. The ASIF III project design included the development of a comprehensive
set of procedures by the ASIF to ensure proper preparation of the bidding documents, competitive
selection of contractors, and adequate works supervision mechanisms and quality control
monitoring techniques. To improve community awareness regarding the implementation of MP
activities, the new procedures previously developed introduced for testing under the ASIF III
Project, with an aim to actively involve the engineers in charge of civil works in informing to
community citizens on the status of affairs on the respective construction sites.

36.     Sustainability and institutional building. Past experience under social investment funds
(SIFs) and community-driven developments revealed that the sustainability of such operations can
be best achieved through innovative designs by integrating multisector community-based projects
with capacity building and self-management of local institutions. Thus, the design of ASIF III
paid specific attention to local institutional capacity-building activities, innovation in poverty
targeting, promotion and outreach activities, and systematic and continuous M&E.

37.    Clearly articulated sectoral policies and investment priorities are enabling factors for
successful implementation of the programs. The success of similar SIF-type interventions


                                                 8
implemented in the past revealed their dependence on observance and coordination with social
sector strategic priorities, Government reforms programs, and municipal development plans, as
well as with other programs carried out by various donor agencies and NGOs. It was therefore
important to ensure that projects were focused on greater coordination of social-fund-type
activities with relevant sectoral polities (mainly in health and education) and investment priorities.
During project preparation, several meetings were held with representatives of Bank-financed
projects (ASIF II and Water Supply projects) and bilateral and international donors active in
Armenia, such as the Kreditanstalt für Wiederaufbau (KfW), International Fund for Agricultural
Development (IFAD), and the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), to
learn from their experience and to avoid unnecessary overlap.

38.     For the implementation period, the ASIF Board was mandated to ensure that project
activities were consistent with the social sector strategy priorities and the Government’s reform
programs in the relevant sectors. Under the ASIF III Project, a Technical Committee was
established to provide guidance to the ASIF for effective implementation of municipal FM training
programs. Also, the project design included information and outreach activities meant to explain
priority setting mechanisms to beneficiaries within the framework of a comprehensive
communication strategy.

2.2    Implementation

39.     The ASIF III Project (Main Credit) was approved by the Bank’s Board of Executive
Directors on October 26, 2006; became effective on December 20, 2006; and was closed on March
31, 2012. It was followed by three AFs approved as follows: 1st AF on February 24, 2009; 2nd
AF on February 25, 2010; and 3rd AF on February 14, 2012, the latter being closed on March 31,
2015. The aggregated period for the ASIF III Project implementation and its subsequent AFs was
close to eight and a half years from the Board approval of ASIF III to the closure of the 3rd AF

40.     The Mid-Term Review (MTR) Mission (April 26 – May 06, 2010) was delayed by about
one year, as to the original time plan. The delay was mainly due to the fact that the first AF was
just approved before the originally envisaged date, and it was deemed to be better to wait with the
MTR until one year into its implementation. The MTR rated the project performance as
Satisfactory for both overall project implementation and achievement of development objectives.
At MTR, the project disbursed US$22.05 million (88.2 percent of the total loan funds). The MTR
also revealed the need to make some adjustments and introduce new activities to improve project
performance in the areas of M&E of outcomes and observance of environment safeguards.

41.     Evaluative studies. An agreement was reached for the ASIF to further conduct four new
additional assessments under the project, covering: (a) beneficiary assessment (BA); (b)
assessment of infrastructure maintenance and labor impact of the MPs; (c) civil works cost-
effectiveness assessment; and (d) quality of civil works assessment. These studies helped in
properly filling out the M&E framework.

42.      Environmental safeguards compliance. Although no environment problems were
reported, the observance of the Revised Environmental Guidelines was needed to be enforced. For
this, the ASIF’s environmental capacity was upgraded by hiring additional environment specialists
and by delivering in-depth, on-the-job training to related staff.


                                                  9
43.     The performance of both fiduciary-related activities, procurement and FM, was rated as
Satisfactory at MTR and maintained as such thereafter.

44.     The project was never formally declared ‘at risk’. However, at some point, the
implementation of Component 2 was hampered due to the Government’s decision to spend less
credit/loan funds for technical assistance activities. As a result, the training for capacity building
at the local administration level was temporarily put on hold. Finally, when an agreement was
reached to conduct the training, the selection of the trainers was done at a slow pace and the training
was delivered to the targeted number of officials, however, at a slightly reduced scope.

2.3    Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation, and Utilization

45.     M&E design. Though the project did not explicitly define living standards, they are
assumed here to relate to access to social and economic services, including education and health,
as well as access to income-generating opportunities. This theory of change is implicit in the
following seven intermediate objectives drawn from the PDO: (1) improved quality of community
infrastructure and services in vulnerable communities; (2) improved access to community
infrastructure and services in vulnerable communities; (3) improved coverage of community
infrastructure and services in vulnerable communities; (4) improved sustainability of community
infrastructure and services in vulnerable communities; (5) increased accountability at the local
level; (6) increased stakeholder empowerment; and (7) creation of employment associated with
the provision of community infrastructure and services. These intermediate objectives were
considered sufficient to support Government efforts to improve living standards for poor and
vulnerable groups.

46.     The results framework of the Project was designed based on the assumption that increased
provision of social infrastructure and services, and job creation combined with capacity
development for these communities in matters related to the management of their own investments
and building partnerships with local authorities, and capacity building for local Government
officials to enable them to better deliver and maintain social services, would count as proxy for
improved living standards of the people living in vulnerable communities.

47.     The original project M&E framework allowed for detailed tracking of the physical progress
of the MPs and the number and types of beneficiaries who benefitted as well as the number of
officials who received capacity-building training. The indicators are adequate to measure most of
the intermediate outcomes listed above (1–3 and 7). The original project M&E framework allowed
for detailed tracking of outputs, including the MPs; beneficiaries of the MPs; officials receiving
training; number of villages mapped for poverty; and job hours and wages. The project also
measured beneficiary satisfaction and both increased access to and quality of social infrastructure,
as well as assessed the technical quality of the infrastructure.

48.     The main weakness of the RF is that there is that it is not outcome oriented and that there
is a lack of baseline data and most of the indicators are output oriented. In addition, outcomes 4–
6 lacked results indicators that would allow the project to track progress on their achievement.




                                                  10
Outcome 6 was particularly weak, the corresponding outcome indicator from the RF2 measuring
an output (number of communities) and making an untested assumption that participation in the
project would be inclusive and lead to empowerment of community members.

49.   The RF would have been partially strengthened through the inclusion of indicators
measuring the relevant impact of the intermediate objectives, such as: Increased sanitation safety
and health prevention as a result of improved access to water and sewage or facilitation of
employment for parents whose children are enrolled in early childhood education in kindergartens.

50.    M&E implementation. The project supported the creation and strengthening of an M&E
Unit under the newly created Management Information, Monitoring, and Evaluation Department.
This unit held primary responsibility for data collection, analysis, and information dissemination
with support from the MIS officers. The M&E design and function was well-embedded in the
implementing agency and by all accounts there was sufficient stakeholder ownership. The staff in
charge of M&E reporting at the implementing agency have been with the project since inception
and have strong institutional understanding and memory. The MIS software was upgraded during
implementation to strengthen the monitoring and reporting capacity. As a result of these factors,
the M&E plan was fully implemented and quality data were collected on time.

51.    As part of the MTR, the Bank and the ASIF team agreed on the need to carry out a
comprehensive evaluation strategy to go beyond the monitoring indicators. Supplemental studies
and assessments were commissioned and undertaken, including the following: BAs, the MPs’
sustainability and infrastructure maintenance and labor impact, civil works cost-effectiveness
assessment, and quality of civil works assessment.

52.     Also, some of the weaknesses in M&E design were addressed through the addition of
indicators that measured intermediate outcomes that were directly linked to the number of jobs
created and the wage income generated.

53.    M&E utilization. The completion of the poverty mapping exercise allowed project
management staff to more accurately target the project activities to communities along three
groupings: most vulnerable, vulnerable, and least vulnerable. Financing for the MPs under the
2nd and 3rd AFs was to be allocated as follows: at least 40 percent of the funds to the most
vulnerable communities and no more than 20 percent to the least vulnerable communities.

54.    Although the ASIF’s MIS database contains a significant amount of information; only a
small part of it is online and publicly disclosed. The ASIF’s website may be improved by providing
more individual MP-related information, not only for the sake of transparency but also for the
promotion of the MPs’ performance and results.

2.4    Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

55.    The ASIF managed the fiduciary (procurement and FM) and safeguards (social and
environment) responsibilities in a satisfactory manner throughout the project implementation.

56.     FM. The FM arrangements that the ASIF has in place were adequate in relation to: (a)
human resources with extensive experience in Bank-financed projects; (b) the internal control
procedures and filing systems, which were considered to be properly designed and implemented;
and (c) the results of the annual audits which rated the FM-related performance as Satisfactory.

57.     Interim financial reports were regularly produced and submitted to the Bank on time. There
are no pending audits at the project closing date.

58.     Overall, the FM was rated as Satisfactory during the entire project implementation. There
was only one exception in February 2014, when the rating was downgraded to Moderately
Satisfactory because of some shortcomings observed in contract management and monitoring, but
the situation was remedied shortly thereafter and the Satisfactory rating was restored.

59.    Procurement. As an implementing agency, the ASIF has substantial experience in
managing similar projects in Armenia and is familiar with the Bank’s procurement rules and
procedures. No major procurement-related issues were acknowledged during the project
implementation for the procurements conducted centrally by the ASIF.

60.     Also, for many small contracts, selected communities were involved in the various stages
of the procurement cycles under the ASIF’s supervision. Given the large number of small contracts
locally executed, the interest of bidders was limited and this resulted in a small number of bids for
each procurement. Overall, the contracts that were subject to post review were found to be in
compliance with Bank procedures.

61.     The ASIF’s procurement capacity was weakened from time to time due to the turnover of
procurement specialists, some of them leaving the ASIF for better opportunities in other public
sector agencies or private sector companies.

62.     However, periodically, the adequacy of procurement capacity was restored each time so
that, overall, procurement-related activities did not suffer. The Bank also supported the temporary
lack of procurement experts by hiring short-term consultants who worked with the ASIF and also
provided on-the-job training to the newly hired staff.

63.     In the future when the ASIF’s procurement workload will significantly increase,
recruitment of additional staff is envisaged and more proactive involvement in the development
and revision of the technical specifications for goods and works and the terms of reference for
consulting services.

Social (including safeguards)

64.   Participatory approach and gender inclusiveness. Under ASIF II a Beneficiary
Assessment was conducted and produced the recommendations that were considered in the



                                                 12
preparation of ASIF III. However, findings from the last BA under ASIF III in 2014 still showed
potential areas of improvement, including low levels of community awareness on who funded the
MPs; low levels of participation of direct beneficiaries (community members); and questions about
the level of effectiveness and representativeness of the Project Implementation Committees (PICs).

65.    As part of preparation for the follow-up transformational Armenia Social Investment and
Local Development Project (SILD) the Bank conducted an analysis of Beneficiary Engagement in
ASIF III and made recommendations for improvement. The report looked at beneficiary
engagement across four phases of the MP cycle (identification, preparation, implementation, and
post completion) and found that there were a number of practices, including participatory
approaches and information dissemination activities that were practiced in the past but had been
discontinued under ASIF III. Additionally, the PICs were supposed to share information with
community members but they were not doing so in a systematic manner.

66.    There is limited data on gender inclusiveness and participation under ASIF III.
Anecdotally, the beneficiary engagement report noted that in some villages a majority of the PICs
consisted of mainly women because the men seasonally migrate out of the village for work. Out
of the total number of 57,358 community members who participated in community general
meetings, 37,226 were women. In relative terms, women’s participation was higher in ASIF III
(64.9 percent) than in ASIF II (44.6 percent).

67.     The SILD includes plans for better tracking and monitoring of the extent to which the
project is gender inclusive, including indicators for the number of female participants in meetings.
The project documentation also specifies that activities should be organized in such a way as to
promote participation of women and vulnerable groups.

68.     Beneficiary feedback and grievance mechanisms. Feedback from project beneficiaries
indicated that in some cases there was a lack of awareness of project activities. In response, the
project staff increased the number of required community meetings from one to two. A significant
issue identified in ASIF III (and addressed in the SILD) is the lack of a formal grievance
mechanism. In the SILD, there are provisions for a grievance officer in each PIC a telephone
feedback line, and a committee in the ASIF. Additionally, there is an indicator tracking grievances
that were registered and addressed.

69.     Resettlements. No MP susceptible to resettlement or land acquisition was approved for
financing and no need for resettlement or land acquisition (permanent or temporary) occurred
during project implementation. So no MP had to be canceled for this reason.

70.     Environment. The ASIF III Project was classified as an Environmental Category ‘F1’
project as no major environmental issues were anticipated at preparation time, given the relatively
small size and rehabilitation nature of the MPs. Its Operational Manual included adequate
procedures and implementation arrangements, consistent with the Bank’s guidelines.

71.    The ASIF’s capacity for supervising compliance with the environmental requirements was
increased and adequately maintained throughout project implementation. The environmental
assessments were enforced and their frequency increased for each MP at various stages of
implementation using predefined check lists (including photos) which were properly filed and



                                                13
maintained in the MP archives. No major environment related issues were recorded during project
implementation.

72.    The Bank’s environmental specialist regularly supervised the environment-related aspects
of the MPs, visiting selected implementation sites 3–4 times a year.

2.5    Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

73.     All the MPs were properly completed by the project closing date (March 31, 2015), except
for two larger MPs (music school in Martuni and health center in Chambarak), for which the works
were delayed due to financial difficulties encountered by the contractor (same for both MPs) and
which continued beyond this date with financial support from the ASIF’s own funds.

74.     Given the Government’s commitment to continue supporting development of more
infrastructure for the delivery of social services, the Bank already approved a follow-up operation:
the SILD amounted to US$30 million, ensuring thus financial support for the continuity of SIF
type of programs in Armenia in the absence of the availability of Government’s own funds.

75.     For the purpose of the SILD implementation, and in line with the Government’ Strategy
for ASIF’s evolution approved in April 2014, ASIF was transformed into Armenian Territorial
Development Fund (ATDF), with responsibilities expanded to the (entire or partial)
implementation of other programs financed by the Government of Armenia or by other bilateral
or international donors. These new programs are listed in section 5.2 (b).

76.     The implementation arrangements and procedures from the ASIF III Project served as the
basis for the development of a new Operational Manual that was adapted to fit the requirements of
the follow-up project (SILD).

3.     Assessment of Outcomes

3.1    Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

77.      The seven ASIF III Project objectives supported the Government’s ongoing policy to raise
the living standards of the poor and vulnerable groups; therefore, the project was highly relevant
for its entire life cycle (from design to closure) to Armenia’s programmatic development programs
and priorities and consistent with the objectives included in the Country Assistance/Partnership
Strategies, as approved in 2004, 2009, and 2013.

78.    Relevance of Objectives. Country Partnership Strategy for 2014–2017 envisages
providing selective support to the Armenia Development Strategy (2012–2025) that aims to build
on the progress achieved to date in reducing poverty and improving access to quality social
services, with particular focus on continuing the promotion of community-driven approaches to
develop basic infrastructure for social service delivery. Thus, the ASIF III Project continued to be
consistent also with the current Country Partnership Strategy (CPS), supporting its second cluster
‘Improving Efficiency and Targeting of Social Services’




                                                14
79.     Relevance of Design. The Project was prepared and approved within the time frame of
the 2004 Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Armenia supporting its Third Goal—Reduction
of Non-Income Poverty. Its design included small scale investments in community infrastructure
related to education, health and social services, considered as priority areas also by the Armenia
Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper approved in 2003. Over time, the Project continued to be
relevant, to the country priorities, as acknowledged by the 2009 CAS for Armenia, mainly
supporting the Strategic Objective 1 (Addressing Vulnerabilities), Results Area 2 related to
poverty, social protection and job creation.

80.     Relevance of Implementation. During its implementation the Project continued to be
relevant to the country needs, particularly when Armenia was severely hit by the global economic
crisis. The Bank approved the 1st AF on emergency basis, expanding the development objective
to include the job creation element. Two subsequent AFs were approved, toping-up financial
resources for scaling up the program.

Rating: High

3.2    Achievement of Project Development Objectives

81.   The overall PDO indicator achievement was ‘Satisfactory’, consistent with all the
Implementation Status and Results Report ratings during the entire project’s life cycle.

82.     This ICR assesses the extent to which the project achieved its objective of supporting the
Government’s policy to improve living standards by examining the seven intermediate outcomes
stated in the PDO.

(a)    Improved quality of community infrastructure and services in vulnerable
       communities - Achieved

83.     The project provided quality community infrastructure, with evidence of the quality of civil
works found in an Assessment of Civil Works Quality from 2010. This assessment found that, in
general, the quality of the 55 sampled civil works MPs and corresponding building materials and
related items was satisfactory and that there were some works of high and excellent quality. The
shortcomings on quality were related to repair and the materials and items had nothing to do with
the soundness and durability of the buildings.

84.     Enforcing compliance with seismic safety standards and permitting rehabilitation works
only for buildings that were not overly damaged (beginning with the 3rd AF) contributed to the
quality and safety of community infrastructure.

85.     Additional evidence on quality is found in community perceptions on quality of MP
construction, as measured in the three BAs (2008, 2011, and 2014). These assessments show that
the project exceeded its target of 70 percent beneficiary satisfaction rate on the quality of
infrastructure and services received. The 2008 BA reported a general finding of overall positive
views from beneficiary communities on the quality of the infrastructure. However, there were a
few examples of communities that were not satisfied. The 2011 assessment queried about
perceptions on the quality of the different types of works and found that for each type of project



                                                15
(health care, school, potable water pipe, community center, and community area) at least 70
percent of the beneficiaries were satisfied with the quality of the MPs. Potable water pipes,
community areas, and community centers had the highest satisfaction rates and health centers had
the lowest. The 2014 assessment found that direct project beneficiaries and heads of infrastructure
showed a satisfaction rate of 76–85 percent. The report indicated that in some cases it was
challenging to distinguish whether reported flaws were due to poor construction quality or due to
improper operation and maintenance of infrastructure.

(b)    Improved access to community infrastructure and services in vulnerable
       communities - Achieved

86.      The project increased access to community infrastructure for approximately 1.7 million
Armenians (against a target of 1.5 million) through the provision of 319 MPs (against a target of
283) in all regions of Armenia. The majority of MPs selected by communities were schools (35
percent), community centers (28 percent), and kindergartens (13 percent), followed by health care
facilities (7 percent), special schools, potable water, environmental, elderly houses, irrigation, and
sewage systems (less than 5 percent each).

87.     The project financed rehabilitation works for 1,182 piped household water connections
which provided access to improved water sources for 38,221 people in rural areas. The targets for
schools and kindergartens benefitting from furniture and equipment and for community centers
benefitting from furniture were exceeded.

88.     Additional evidence on improved access is found in an assessment commissioned as part
of the preparation for the SILD project. The ASIF team compiled data on the use of social
infrastructure, before and after the ASIF III intervention, from different sources on the following
infrastructure types: health care facilities (logbooks), schools (absence hours), kindergartens
(enrollment rates), and water supply (project MIS). Data are reported for a three-year period and
for a one-year period that includes the period immediately before and after the ASIF intervention.

89.     Table 4 summarizes the reported use data gathered for this assessment. In addition to the
data in table 4, the assessment also reported that the quantity of potable water supplied increased




                                                  16
on average by 66.9 percent for 17 MPs of potable water systems completed and that the number
of irrigated hectares increased by 86 percent for 2 irrigation MPs completed under ASIF III.

(c)     Improved coverage of community infrastructure and services in vulnerable
        communities - Achieved

90.     The project exceeded its target of reaching 27.6 percent of the rural population in the
targeted areas: 35.5 percent of the targeted group benefitted from improved infrastructure and
services. As shown in a 2015 multidimensional poverty analysis in Armenia, this was a
particularly relevant indicator that served as a proxy for reaching the poor and vulnerable in the
country. This analysis showed that over the period 2008–2013, the rural areas of Armenia had a
greater share of the population that is multi-dimensionally poor (generally they are worse off on
housing, heating, and education dimensions and relatively less deprived on the employment
dimension). Though this has been improving over time, the rural areas of Armenia were shown to
have a consistently higher share of the population that is multi-dimensionally poor compared to
the national and urban levels.

91.     Poverty targeting. Reaching poor and vulnerable villages was key to achieving the
intermediate objectives 1–3. Following the first AF, it was agreed to implement a community
targeting exercise to improve the project’s reach in poor and vulnerable villages. The exercise
consisted of a two-step process. In the first step, fund allocations were considered at the marz
level and in the second step, the needy communities within each marz were targeted based on
vulnerability tests.

92.      This exercise was completed by the start of the 2nd AF and the ranking of the communities
was updated for the 3rd AF when the requirement was introduced that no less than 40 percent of
the loan/credit funds be allocated to the most vulnerable communities and no more than 20 percent
to the least vulnerable communities. Though the distribution of total project funds (original credit
plus all three AFs) to the most vulnerable communities improved after the new requirement was
added, the project still fell short of meeting this requirement overall. The distribution after the 2nd
AF, however, largely met the requirement and is as follows: most vulnerable (40.5 percent),
vulnerable (38.4 percent), least vulnerable (16.1 percent), and Yerevan, Gyumri and Vaandzor (5
percent). Yerevan, Gyumri and Vaandzor were not included in the mapping exercise due to their


                                                     17
low poverty levels and thus were only to receive a very limited amount of funds. This exercise
greatly improved poverty targeting of the final two AFs. Given the moderate targeting
performance prior to this exercise and the improvement following it, the project has been
moderately satisfactory in targeting vulnerable villages through the poverty mapping exercise.

93.    The mapping exercise also allowed the ASIF to identify the communities eligible for
reduction of the mandatory community contribution from 10 percent to 5 percent of the MP works
(maintaining the minimum requirement of 4 percent for the most vulnerable communities)
following the impact of the 2009 global economic and financial crisis that affected Armenia too.
This also allowed the more vulnerable communities to propose more comprehensive MPs to
properly address their needs.

(d)      Improved sustainability of community infrastructure and services in vulnerable
         communities - Partially achieved/limited reporting evidence

94.     The project financed an assessment on sustainability, infrastructure maintenance, and labor
impact in 2012. This analysis found that, overall, measures to promote the sustainability of the
investments (such as planning and estimates for operation and maintenance costs and regular
maintenance work) were lacking. Operation and maintenance plans for assets rehabilitated by the
ASIF were available only for 44 percent of the sampled facilities. The evaluation noted that at the
time of the analysis the current state of most infrastructures was good or excellent, but the lack of
systematic planning and budgeting for operations and maintenance raises concerns about the long-
term sustainability of infrastructure constructed under the project. Community feedback indicates
that they place a high value on MP infrastructure. Lack of operations and maintenance is attributed
to insufficient resources in the vulnerable communities served by the project. However, the ICR
team visits to various types of MPs that were completed several years ago revealed adequate
maintenance of the facilities and their proper functioning.




                                                      18
(e)    Increased accountability at the local level - Partially achieved/limited reporting
       evidence

95.     The project financed capacity development at the municipal and local levels. The target of
the number of officials trained was met—716 local officials received FM training. In addition,
there was training for local community members; 184 communities received capacity-building
training against a target of 158. This training was delivered to 3,331 community members (PICs
and Elderly Councils), of whom 1,138 (18.8 percent) were women.

96.     Knowledge acquisition due to training of local Government officials was measured through
tests of knowledge related to the training topics before and after the program. According to the
ASIF data, improvements in acquired knowledge ranged from 37 percent to 44 percent in the five
marzes (Syuniq', Vayots' Dzori, Armavir, Ararat, and Kotayq where pre and post testing was
administered.

97.     There is limited evidence on accountability at the local level. However, overall, the project
performed well on procurement and FM and there were no misprocurements or issues reported on
fraud and corruption. This may indicate that there was some level of accountability at the local
level. The 2011 BA reported that almost all contractors thought that the process of contractor
selection was entirely transparent and that the majority of contractors thought that the
implementing agencies at the community level performed detailed and scrupulous supervision and
control.

(f)    Increased stakeholder empowerment - Lack of evidence

98.     The project aimed to increase stakeholder empowerment through provision of capacity
building and training and also through participatory selection, operations, and maintenance of
infrastructure. The number of communities was also not a good proxy indicator to measure
empowerment. Thus, there is limited evidence on empowerment. A better method would have
been to evaluate the impact of this training on empowerment and develop indicators accordingly.
The 2014 BA provides some evidence on community perceptions on the impact of the project on
social capital generation. This assessment found that community members felt that the
implementation of the projects had a positive impact on the interrelations of the community
members by creating a climate of partnership, trust, and respect.

(g)    Creation of Employment - Achieved

99.   The project achieved and exceeded all of its targets on creation of employment related to
MP and school furniture.

          The target for creation of jobs from the MPs was 535,000 job-days. This was exceeded
           as 668,738 job-days were created. The target of US$8.2 million for total value of wage
           income generated from completed MPs was also exceeded. The total value of11.2
           million.
          The target for creation of jobs from manufacturing of school furniture was 40,600 job-
           days. This was exceeded as 52,099 job-days were created. The total value of wages



                                                 19
           generated from these jobs also exceeded the target of US$0.44 million. The total value
           of wages created was US$0.57 million.

100.   An assessment of the labor impacts of the ASIF MPs found the following:

          On average, eight temporary jobs were provided per MP
          The MPs provided temporary employment for around five months longer per person
           and the compensation amount was equal to that of the average monthly wage in
           Armenia
          Thirty percent of the surveyed respondents who were temporarily employed indicated
           that the income received had a significantly positive impact on the living standards and
           well-being of their families. Another 63 percent said it had a positive but small impact.
           Forty-eight percent of those temporarily employed indicated that their temporary
           employment had a positive impact on entering the labor market at a later stage or gave
           them experience that helped them start their own business.

Additional Impacts

101. Decentralized approach. The BA highlighted the positive impact the project had with
regard to supporting the Government’s decentralization program at the local level and, in particular,
strengthening local institutions and empowering communities. More importantly, it revealed that
community infrastructure MPs served as effective frameworks for promoting the institutionally
strengthened local Governments, mobilized community members, and created linkages with their
constituents under the ASIF MPs, which enhanced interpersonal trust and strengthened intra-
community bonds and cooperation.

Rating: Substantial

3.3    Efficiency

102. At project preparation, no calculations on net present value, economic rate of return, or
financial rate of return were conducted. This was attributed to the demand-driven nature of the
project whereby MP selection is unknown at the time of preparation, therefore preventing the use
of ex ante traditional methods of cost-benefit analysis. The basis of the assessment of efficiency
for this ICR comes from two cost-effectiveness studies (2008 and 2010) of civil works and a review
of comparable Bank-financed projects that was conducted in preparation for the SILD Project, to
determine the estimated internal rate of return (IRR).

103. Though no traditional ex-ante economic and financial analyses were undertaken, there is
evidence on the quality and cost-effectiveness of the ASIF MPs. For the ASIF III Project,
efficiency is evidenced in four ways: utilization of funds, percentage of output targets met,
construction cost comparisons, and quality of civil works.

104. Estimation of IRR for MPs. An analysis of the IRR for three of the MP types in Armenia
and in comparator countries was conducted as part of the preparation for the SILD (details in
Annex 3, Table 3.4.). The IRR was pulled from the economic analysis undertaken for Bank-


                                                20
financed projects in the water, kindergarten, and school sectors. Inclusion of projects in other
countries allows for a comparison of the IRR across countries. The IRR for similar water supply
projects in Armenia (comprising 5 percent of the total ASIF III MPs) was calculated at 26.1 percent,
and for kindergartens (14 percent of ASIF III MPs) and high schools (35 percent of ASIF III), the
cost benefit was reported at 3.3 and 3.2, respectively. The estimated IRR and cost-benefit
calculations were relatively higher in Armenia when compared to similar projects in Moldova and
Guinea-Bissau.

105. Cost-effectiveness comparisons. Each assessment of cost-effectiveness used different
types of civil works to assess the extent to which ASIF III MPs were cost effective relative to
similar constructions by other actors. The 2008 assessment found that, relative to comparator
organizations, the ASIF III MPs had the lowest budget cost per square meter for renovations,
reconstructions, new constructions, and, in almost all cases, for heated buildings. The 2010
assessment also looked at relative costs when compared with comparator organizations and found
that the unit cost for a final product per square meter for ASIF III MPs was 1.24 times less than
comparators.

106. Quality of civil works. The Assessment of Civil Works Quality conducted in 2010,
concluded that in general, the quality of civil works and of the used building materials was
satisfactory. As a rule better quality (high to even excellent) was observed for all the newly built,
rehabilitated or reinforced constructions. However, for the repair works the observed quality was
lower, and the recommendation for strengthening the site supervision, was made.

107. Other efficiency criteria. The time for implementation (8.75 years) for the Main Credit
and its three AFs was below the limit of “old” projects which is 11 years for projects with AFs.
The disbursement performance was notable. It was ahead of schedule for most of project
implementation life, with no recorded lags. At MTR, the projects disbursed 88 percent of the
funds.

Rating: Substantial

3.4    Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Satisfactory

108. The project achieved its development objectives by effectively delivering benefits to
targeted vulnerable communities. Building on the strong track record of its two predecessor
projects, ASIF III continued to support the Government’s efforts of improving the living
conditions of poor and vulnerable groups and strengthen institutions at the local level. The project
aligned with Government and Bank strategy goals and is therefore relevant in its objectives and
design. The community-driven approach was particularly relevant, given the Government’s stated
aim of using these approaches to develop basic infrastructure for social service delivery.

109. While targeting mechanisms continued to improve and the project ensured that the
infrastructure and related activities benefitted those designated as most vulnerable, the targets for
resource allocation to the most vulnerable communities in remote or isolated areas; socially
vulnerable persons, including the elderly and refugees; and those living in high mountainous


                                                 21
communities, earthquake zone communities, and border-zone communities, were only partially
met.

110. In general, the project achieved the majority of its objectives. The record on achieving
PDO and intermediate indicators was excellent: all were achieved or exceeded. Additional
evidence showed that the real benefits of improved access to quality social and economic
infrastructure for communities resulted in related project impacts, including increased school
attendance, improved access to water, and increased health center visits. In addition, there is
evidence of high quality of construction of infrastructure projects, cost efficiency of the MPs, and
overall beneficiary satisfaction with both the project process and social and economic
infrastructure.

3.5    Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes, and Impacts

(a)    Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

111. Poverty impacts. The project supported the Government’s efforts to improve living
standards and to increase access to the basic social services in the neediest communities that were
identified by the poverty mapping exercise.

112. At the same time, the MPs implemented during the project life had labor-intensive
components related to the civil works, thus maintaining a certain critical level of employment in
the contracted companies from the construction sector (severely hit by the crisis). The MPs also
provided temporary employment for community members enrolled in the implementation.

113. Beginning with the 1st AF, the project provided support for the procurement of furniture
for a large number of schools and kindergartens. This prevented large layoffs from the furniture
manufacturing industry during the crisis and the fall into poverty of an even higher number of
people.

114. Gender and social development. Community participation in MP-related decisions has
been observed and enforced during the entire project implementation. A mandatory second round
of community consultations was introduced beginning with the 3rd AF. Women were represented
in a proportion of 64.9 percent in the community general meetings. Details are provided in section
2.4. However, the overall participation in general community meetings was smaller in ASIF III
(57,358 participants) when compared with ASIF II (155,000 participants). One reason for this
may be that the communities under ASIF III were smaller due to the vulnerability criteria, which
correlated strongly with small rural communities.

(b)    Institutional Change/Strengthening

115. At the central level, the ASIF was the implementing agency for ASIF III and for previous
similar types of projects (ASIF I and ASIF II). In18 years of activity, it became a strong institution
with sound technical expertise and efficient administrative capacity.

116. The experience in MP management from design throughout implementation up to
completion, and even post-completion sustainability issues, made the ASIF the most suitable



                                                 22
implementing agency for the follow-up Bank-financed, recently approved operation (March 2015),
the SILD, amounting to US$30 million.

117. Moreover, the ASIF was transformed into the ATDF, maintaining its autonomous status
but with extended prerogatives and responsibilities in the implementation of other projects
supporting the Government’s priority of achieving balanced geographical development by
reducing territorial disparities.

118. In addition, the ASIF/ATDF became the implementing agency (entirely or partially) for
other infrastructure projects financed by other bilateral and international donors such as USAID,
Swiss International Cooperation Office, Asian Development Bank, European Investment Bank, or
the World Bank.

119. At the local level, capacity building was supported by the second component of the ASIF
III Project and detailed information is presented in section 3.2.

(c)    Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

120. Mainstreaming children with different abilities into regular kindergarten Early
Childhood Development programs. The inclusion of classes for these children into the same
establishment for regular classes, combined with early enrollment and provision of specialized
education, contributed to a faster and more effective recovery and inclusion of these children in
regular Early Childhood Development educational programs.

121. Adequacy of staffing in the rehabilitated medical and educational units. The
interviews with direct and indirect beneficiaries revealed the improved working conditions, both
with regard to physical rehabilitation and equipment endowment, contributed to the retention of
existing staff or attraction of new staff in these units.

3.6    Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

122. Three BAs were financed by the project, in 2008, 2011, and 2014. The sequencing of the
BAs allowed proper monitoring of the relevant indicators from the RF and verification if the
recommendations of previous assessments had been implemented. Several important results of
these assessments are presented below; annex 5 presents more details on these aspects.

          These assessments found that the participants were well-informed of project activities
           and that the MPs targeted priority needs.
          Beneficiaries perceived a positive impact on the living standards of community
           residents (88 percent of the respondents from the 2012 BA) and highly valued the
           positive impact of the MPs on the improvement of the social and economic conditions
           of residents.
          On the whole, satisfaction with the quality of projects was high (the 2014 BA rate of
           satisfaction with procedures, quality, and duration exceeds 80 percent). The MPs
           generated temporary employment for community members, which had a positive
           impact on living standards (62.6 percent of the respondents in the 2012 survey).


                                               23
          The training received through the ASIF was felt to have a positive impact on local
           Government capacity.
          In general, though there was awareness of the need for operations and maintenance,
           responses around the practice of operations and maintenance were inadequate (2012
           survey - 44 percent had plans for operations and maintenance).

4.     Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: Modest

123. Of the four risks identified at the appraisal stage: (a) the potential rise of construction costs;
(b) the Government’s capacity to ensure the agreed counterpart funding; (c) the availability and
sustainability of funding for capacity-building activities at the municipal level; and (d) potential
corruption threats). Out of them, the only one risk that materialized was the counterpart funding
and it was adversely affected by the global financial and economic crisis, and had consequences
on co-financing for MPs implementation and subsequently on operation and maintenance.

124. This threat was mitigated when the 2nd Additional Financing was approved by reducing the
community contribution to 5 percent, with a minimum of 4 percent for most vulnerable
communities. This reduced contribution requirement was also applied to the communities having
micro-projects financed by ASIF III Main Credit and 1st AF.

125. Going forward, the risk of counterpart funding to continue supporting ASIF remains.
Armenia’s current economic outlook is poor and this could definitely impact counterpart funding.
The new SILD project, however, mitigates much of the risk of the financial sustainability of the
ongoing operation of ASIF. In addition, multiple other donors have commitments or are planning
to commit additional funding to ASIF. This, however, does not ensure independent, self-financing
of ASIF and this risk will continue to be monitored by the SILD team.

126. Also the lack of adequate counterpart fund affects operations and maintenance (O&M) of
the infrastructure by communities. This was an issue identified by studies under ASIF III and thus
the follow-up Bank financed project (SILD) has taken several measures to ensure better O&M,
including requiring the cost of O&M to be included in the project proposal, requiring communities
to periodically report on the current status of their infrastructure and sign a commitment to O&M
following completion of the works, and making any community not maintaining their current
investment ineligible for future ASIF projects.

5.     Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1    Bank Performance

(a)    Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

127. The Bank’s team leader who led the project preparation and supervised the first phase of
ASIF III project implementation was also the team leader for the ASIF I and ASIF II Projects.


                                                  24
This continuity was beneficial for the establishment of a good working relationship with
Government counterparts and provided an institutional memory for the project and its lessons. It
also enabled fast project preparation and implementation take-off.

128. There was no Quality at Entry review, but as previously mentioned, the 2nd QALP report
from 2010 made some constructive observations related to the: (a) RF, which was considered too
output-oriented; and (b) inability of assessing other results arising from project implementation
regarding the sustainability, quality of works, or safeguards compliance and rated the Bank’s
performance for this criteria as Moderately Satisfactory.

129. The ICR acknowledges that the team attempted to address these observations following the
MTR and during the implementation of the subsequent three AFs. The revision of the RF was less
successful, but the issues related to the sustainability, quality of works, and safeguards compliance
were carefully analyzed by the studies commissioned and were subsequently addressed.

130. Retroactively analyzing the features of the initial RF and taking into account the traditional
M&E approach (output based) of counterpart partners, it can be concluded that at the preparation
phase it was not easy for the Bank team to convince the client to accept a stronger outcome-based
approach. However, this issue was not neglected during the implementation phase—when the
client’s sophistication gradually increased and enabled increased acceptance for an outcome-based
approach—as currently is the case with the new Bank-financed SILD Project. This is a process
that took time but changed the approach for a longer term in the future.

(b)    Quality of Supervision

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

131. With three AFs, the project supervision can be considered as a continuously combined
activity of supervision with preparation.

132. During the entire project implementation, supervision was conducted by two team leaders,
both of them exercising their TTL-ship prerogatives diligently. The transition from one to another
was properly overseen by the sector manager and was smoothly put in practice with good impact
on project implementation and the overall relationship with the Government and the implementing
agency. The responsiveness with which the Bank responded to the Government’s requests was
highly appreciated by the counterparts that the ICR team met.

133. The project supervision documents—Implementation Status Reports (Bank internal) and
Aide Memoires—were produced on time and properly covered all the main aspects of project
implementation, providing useful information to the Bank’s management and to the counterparts.

134. The fiduciary aspects regarding procurement (prior and post review) and the FM were
adequately reviewed by the Bank’s experts and related reports were regularly produced. No major
issues were flagged from this point of view.

135. Similarly, compliance with social and environmental safeguards was constantly evaluated
by the Bank’s specialized staff, having adequate resources allocated for this purpose. No major
issues were reported from this point of view, either.


                                                 25
136. The fact that for the last six years of the project life the team leader was based in the region
enabled a high number of supervision missions and field visits to MP sites, and a good
interconnectivity with the implementing agency, facilitating the resolution of most of the issues
deriving from implementation in real time. This also contributed significantly to the quick
preparation and approval of the three AFs.

137. The supervision team was proactive in early identification of project implementation
bottlenecks and quickly implemented appropriate remedial measures. For example, when the
ASIF’s procurement-related capacity was endangered by the exit of one staff member, the Bank’s
team hired a short-term consultant who provided temporary technical support to the ASIF to fill
the gap and delivered on-the job training for the newly hired staff. Also, for the 3rd AF, when there
was a need to increase the civil engineering capacity the Bank hired a consultant who
complemented the ASIF’s capacity to review the technical designs of the new MPs from the
seismic safety point of view and to check compliance with the requested standards in the field.

138.    The Bank’s office in Yerevan provided valuable support both with regard to technical
aspects of sector-related issues and fiduciary responsibilities. The continuous support and real-
time communication with Government counterparts enabled efficient and early identification of
issues arising from implementation and their quick resolution.

139.  The team, however, was not able to secure agreement of the government to improve the
PDO and results framework as recommended by the QALP assessment.

(c)    Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

140. Overall Bank performance is rated Moderately Satisfactory based on the ratings of Bank
performance in ensuring Quality at Entry and Quality of Supervision.

5.2    Borrower Performance

(a)    Government Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

141. The Government of Armenia was highly supportive of the ASIF III program both during
the project preparation and implementation phases. The Ministry of Finance adequately budgeted
and provided the borrower’s counterpart financing to the ASIF on time. The Ministry of Territorial
Administration and Emergency Situations, which incorporated the Ministry of Territorial
Development, provided the strategic regional development framework that enabled the
implementation of the ASIF III project activities at the community levels.

142. The Government diligently searched for additional sources of financing to support the
development and implementation of ASIF type projects, thus creating conditions for the expansion
of such programs to cover as many vulnerable and needy communities as possible.




                                                 26
143. The fact that the prime minister chaired the ASIF’s Board throughout project
implementation reflects the importance attached by the Government to this project and its
continuous commitment to secure proper conditions for its successful implementation.

144. The Board comprises members of Government, representatives from NGOs and civil
society, and representatives from elected local Governments. The Board meets biannually for
regular meetings or whenever there is a need to take strategic or critical decisions or for routine
implementation procedures. In the context of the ASIF III Project, the Board approved 74 MPs,
exceeding the ceiling of AMD 100 million; 206 contracts awarded through national competitive
biddings; and all routine quarterly and annual implementation reports.

(b)    Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

145. The ASIF was the implementing agency for ASIF III and previous similar types of projects
(ASIF I and ASIF II). With 18 years of experience, the ASIF (created in 1996) implemented over
900 local social and economic MPs and became a strong institution with sound technical expertise
and efficient administrative capacity. It became a highly respected and trustworthy institution,
being considered by most of the beneficiary communities as a partner and even a friend (quoting
the BAs) rather than just a financing agency.

146. Gradually, the ASIF gained experience in MP management from design throughout
implementation up to completion, and even post-completion sustainability issues.

147. The fact that the ASIF’s Board is chaired by the Prime Minister gives it strong leverage in
acknowledging the issues arising during project implementation at the Government level and
mobilizing the necessary Government actions to quickly resolve them.

148. Given all these credentials, the ASIF was selected to be the implementing agency for the
follow-up Bank-financed, recently approved project (March 2015), the SILD. Moreover, the ASIF
was transformed into the ATDF, maintaining its autonomous state but with extended prerogatives
and responsibilities in the implementation of other projects supporting the Government’s priority
of achieving balanced geographical development by reducing territorial disparities.

149. Besides the SILD Project amounting to US$30 million, the following programs financed
by international or bilateral donors are likely to be implemented (entirely or partially) by the
ASIF/ATDF over the coming years:

          Swiss International Cooperation Office - Grant amounting to CHF 2.88 million to
           support implementation of intercommunity infrastructure projects in seven
           consolidated communities (Syounik and Vayots Dzor regions)
          USAID - Grant amounting to US$8.6 million to support intercommunity projects in 14
           pilot clusters in the Kotayq, Syounik, Vayots Dzor, Shirak, Lory, Tavoush, and Ararat
           regions.




                                                27
          Asian Development Bank (US$107 million) and European Investment Bank (US$125
           million) to support the upgrade of the seismic safety of public schools in Armenia
          World Bank - Local Economy and Infrastructure Development Project (US$66 million)
           to support infrastructure investments as prerequisites for future tourism developments

150. Under these circumstances, the ASIF’s workload and responsibilities will significantly
increase and additional staff with various specializations will need to be hired.

151. Also, since remuneration of staff remained flat in the ASIF in the last ten years, some
experts left the agency for better-paid jobs in the market and had to be replaced, which was not
always easy. To prevent future staff attrition and to retain existing qualified staff in the agency,
staff motivation should not be neglected.

(c)    Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

152. Overall borrower performance is rated Satisfactory based on the ratings for Government
performance and implementing agency performance.

6.     Lessons Learned

153. Poverty targeting. The experience of implementing the ASIF III Project revealed that
clearly formulated poverty targeting enables equitable and adequate allocation of project funds to
the neediest communities, avoiding possible political interference in the selection process. ASIF’s
III targeting approach used a two-stage process, combining the geographical targeting of project
funds by region (marz) with the identification of the neediest communities within each marz
through a community mapping and profiling exercise based on a set of detailed, previously agreed
criteria. This resulted in the classification of needy communities into three clusters (most
vulnerable, vulnerable, and less vulnerable), which proved to be effective in the beneficiary
community selection process.

154. Technical designs have to be adequately adapted to the specificity of local conditions.
Being a country with high seismic risk and vast, high mountainous areas (where the winters are
long and cold), Armenia has some specificities that have to be taken into account at the technical
design phase. The technical design, complying with high seismic safety standards, and subsequent
delivery of good quality and cost-effective community works projects were important factors for
ensuring affordable sustainability costs both with regard to infrastructure maintenance and
functioning (mainly heating costs) and for obtaining beneficiaries’ satisfaction for the services
delivered.

155. Operations and maintenance requirements have to be enforced and properly
budgeted. Despite the efforts taken to improve community involvement and develop capacity in
operation and maintenance of infrastructure, this is still problematic mainly due to the lack of
adequately secured financial resources. The 2012 study commissioned by the project found that
44 percent of sampled projects had operation and maintenance cost planning and estimates for
2011.


                                                28
156. The report made several recommendations on improving operations and maintenance,
including: (a) adding additional criteria for review before approval of project proposals, including
separate items or annexes to show operation, maintenance, and sustainability costs for assets; (b)
giving priority to and encouraging applicants who conduct operations and maintenance on existing
assets at an appropriate quality and level; (c) evaluating the operation and maintenance of assets
previously improved by the ASIF in the case of communities that are applying for additional ASIF
funding after receiving a project in the past; and (d) providing enhanced training on operations and
maintenance. These recommendations translated into inclusion of more strict requirements in the
follow-up operation (SILD).

157. Adequacy of the Results Framework. The RF was acknowledged to be inappropriate for
the proper monitoring and evaluation of the PDO, as it was output based instead of outcome based.
This generated difficulties on the justification of the PDO achievement and sometimes even
created confusion. This was the main reason for rating the Bank’s performance as Moderately
Satisfactory. Thorough consideration was given to this lesson during the preparation of the follow-
up SILD, which has a much more outcome-based results framework and PDO and a more
evaluation-based Monitoring and Evaluation plan.

A.     Component 1. Community Investments

The project successfully met its infrastructure goals and expanded on the success of previous ASIF
projects. This was accomplished through the provision of 319 MPs financed with IDA credit, local
contributions, and financial support from sponsors. Disbursements of IDA credit for this
component totaled US$48.8 million, 110 percent of the US$44.2 estimated at appraisal.
Community contributions and sponsor contributions for overall project financing were larger than
anticipated (127 percent and 382 percent of planned, respectively). The ASIF financed projects
selected by the targeted communities; these were mostly schools, community centers, and
kindergartens.

School and Kindergarten MPs and Furniture

Most of the projects selected by communities were schools (35 percent) and kindergartens (14
percent. In addition, the project financed the provision of school equipment and furniture to 846
schools and kindergartens (59,768 units of furniture were provided to schools and 4,905 units were
provided to kindergartens). According to the BAs and the ICR mission interviews, there were
several positive impacts associated with school and kindergarten MPs and the provision of
furniture and equipment. Some of the reported impacts include increased attendance, reduced
transport time, and increased morale.

Community Center MPs and Furniture

A large proportion of selected MPs (28 percent) were community centers. The project also
financed new furniture for community centers; there were 65 community centers that benefited
from new furniture—16,994 armchairs and other types of furniture were provided to assembly
halls and cultural centers. There were some related impacts associated with provision of
community centers and new furniture, including increased ease of doing necessary business;
reduced travel time; and increased authority of community Government.

Health Care Facilities

Some communities selected the MPs to the rehabilitation of health care facilities (PHC, ambulatory,
or even small hospitals). Almost US$4.2 million, representing 8 percent of the total costs for
works (US$53.9 million) under Component 1 of the project, was spent for the rehabilitation or
construction of 23 health care units, thus providing improved access to better quality health
services for 606,483 potential beneficiaries.

Capacity Building and Community Participation

Capacity building was provided to community councils, school boards, and the PICs to help them
effectively plan and manage their MPs, as well as strengthen relationships with the local
Government. Around 5,331 community members of the PICs and Elderly Councils participated
in the training, of which 1,138 (21.3 percent) were women. The total number of participants in
the community general meetings was 57,358 persons, out of which 37,358 (64.9 percent) were
women.



                                               36
Creation of Employment

By hiring local beneficiaries to assist with the construction of civil works and furniture for schools
and community centers, the project provided much needed employment opportunities during the
financial crisis. For the construction of the MPs, this resulted in 668,738 job-days and US$11.2
million of wage income being generated. The local manufacturing of new school furniture resulted
in 52,099 job-days and US$0.57 million of wage income being generated. Assessments
undertaken reflect the positive impact of the local construction and manufacturing related to the
project. Almost all respondents surveyed in the 2011 BA indicated that the employment
opportunities had a positive impact on their well-being.

B.     Component 2. Local Level Institutional Strengthening, M&E

Institutional Strengthening

The project met its goal of the number of local officials trained; this cost US$0.15 million instead
of the planned US$0.60 million due to the decision to use less loan/credit funds for this activity.
These trainings benefitted mayors, finance officers, accountants, and village council members who
received municipal FM training. The training was completed by 716 local Government officials
from 145 communities from all regions of Armenia and they demonstrated knowledge through
assessments given before and after completion of the training.

Monitoring and Evaluation

The project financed special studies, technical assessments, formal reviews, and workshops to
support and enhance the M&E of activities and to allow for adjustments and mid-course
corrections as indicated. The following M&E activities were undertaken:

          Three BAs (2008, 2011, and 2014)
          Two assessments of the cost-effectiveness of the MPs (2008 and 2010)
          Assessment of the sustainability, maintenance, and labor impact of the MPs
          Assessment of the quality of civil works projects

C.     Component 3. Project Management

This component used US$3.15 million in IDA Credit to finance institutional support for the ASIF
to effectively implement local programs and projects. This was achieved through the financing of
operating costs, including salaries, utilities, office equipment, training, financial audits, and MIS
maintenance.

                                Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

No net present value or economic rate of return calculations were undertaken at project preparation.
This was attributed to the demand-driven nature of the project; the selection of the MPs was
unknown when the project was prepared. There is more information available now, which allows
for a more extensive economic and financial analysis.

Development impact.3 Almost 91 percent of the project financing for community investments
(US$62.9 million), went for MPs supporting social infrastructure in least vulnerable, vulnerable,
and most vulnerable communities according to the community mapping exercise. These MPs
provided increased access to potable water, kindergarten and education, health care, and
community and cultural facilities. The provision of these facilities is highly likely to contribute to
human development. There is insufficient data to provide a quantitative analysis of the benefits of
improved quality and access to social infrastructure. However, there is evidence on the quality of
infrastructure as well as the impact of the project on access to services (found in earlier sections
of the ICR). Though there is also no data on what would have happened in the absence the project
(for example, in vulnerable communities that did not receive the ASIF), it is very likely that this
project contributed to human development in targeted communities though the exact impact cannot
be completely quantified.

Cost-effectiveness comparisons. There were two cost-effectiveness assessments of civil works
(2008 and 2010). Each used different types of civil works to examine the extent to which the ASIF
III MPs were cost-effective relative to similar constructions by other actors.

The 2008 assessment looked at multiple dimensions to determine cost-effectiveness, including the
unit cost of the final product and duration of civil works. This assessment found that only 44.4
percent of the projects were completed within the time limit stipulated in the contract; in the
remaining 55.6 percent of the cases, the works were completed between 12 and 175 days after the
deadline. The main reasons for extension were severe weather conditions and changes in project
design. The extensions are of concern because they affect costs incurred for technical supervision
and quality of the works.

Project design was assessed and found to be generally satisfactory. However, there were some
examples of projects with imperfections and omissions that significantly influenced the quality of
civil works. The most common error in project designs was inaccuracy in measurements and
estimation. In comparison with other organizations, the share of project design cost spent by the
ASIF in construction budget estimates did not differ significantly from comparator organizations.

     Definition: A project is expected to contribute to development if expected benefits justify the expected costs and
included benefits that can be realistically stated in monetary terms or other benefits that are more difficult to monetize
or sometimes even to quantify but can be demonstrated to be important as project outcomes. Expected benefits and
costs attributable to a project are measured by comparing the situation with the project to the situation without the
project. Where plausible alternatives exist, the selected project should be shown to be the preferred design (OPCS
2014).

Additional analysis was undertaken on final product costs and cost-effectiveness by comparing
costs of civil works per square meter with NGO and Government projects. The analysis found
that for renovations, the budget costs per square meter for the ASIF MPs were the lowest (1.1–
1.48 times less than comparators). For reconstructions, the ASIF III MPs were also the lowest
(1.04–3 times less). For new constructions, they were 1.06 times less than an NGO (exempt from
tax) project and 1.12 times lower than the ones financed by Government line ministries. An
additional analysis of budget costs per square meter surface of heated building found that, with the
exception of two cases, the ASIF MPs are lower by 6 to 51 percent.

The 2010 assessment measured cost-effectiveness along similar dimensions. Again, the
assessment found that projects were exceeding their estimated duration; in 70 percent of the cases
the project dates were not adhered to.

This assessment also conducted an analysis of the final product costs of civil works, comparing
the costs with 10 organizations. As seen in table 3.2, for capital construction, the ASIF’s unit cost
of final product was lower in all cases in comparison with the unit costs of other donors. Notably,


                                                   39
for capital constructions, it was 1.24 times less than other donors’ figures; for internal heating
system installment (with the exception of the judicial reform project), 1.9 times less; and for
heating with internal combustion, 1.9 times less than similar figures of other donors.

Note: * Number of beneficiaries is computed as the share of the population of the targeted community that is
supposed to use a specific service during a year according to their age. For example, for schools, the number of
beneficiaries is computed as the share of population of school-age children in one year. This number is reported
without repetitions in case of >1 MP in a community.

Estimation of the IRR for the MPs. As part of preparation for the SILD Project, a more detailed
analysis of the IRR for relevant MP typologies was conducted (summary of this analysis is
presented in the below Table 3.4. This analysis estimated the IRR of kindergarten MPs (using data
from SIF III and a comparator project in Armenia) and found that the estimated IRR for this type
of project was 18 percent. Additional analysis on comparable projects in Armenia (potable water
and secondary schools) yielded additional data points that can be used to estimate the economic
returns to these MPs. The rehabilitation of secondary schools in Armenia was estimated to have a
cost-benefit ratio of 3.3 per student, and building potable water connection is estimated to have an
IRR of between 10 and 26 percent for different projects.

                              Annex 5. Beneficiary Survey Results

The main results of the three BAs conducted during project implementation are presented below.

2008 BA

      The ASIF projects are aimed at resolving the needs and problems that are top priority and
       the positive impact of the projects in sampled settlements is evident.
      On the whole, almost all stakeholder representatives are satisfied with the ASIF MPs and
       the quality of work done. However, some communities complained about the unfavorable
       weather conditions and some shortcomings revealed during the work.
      Representatives of the community and organizations’ primary stakeholders were informed
       about the projects to be implemented. In particular, the local Government representatives,
       initiative associations members, and those providing services had clear information on the
       projects in contrast with the users of those services.
      The benefits of the ASIF projects are available to almost all the community members with
       the exception of the Tazagjugh Piped Water Project, where not all members have access to
       the water pipeline.
      SIF MPs have provided short-term jobs to some community residents by giving them an
       opportunity to be involved in construction activities.
      The participation of community members in the activities within the framework of the MPs
       had a positive impact both on the efficiency of the project as well as community functioning.
      To some extent, ASIF MPs also add to community solidarity and collaboration by
       mobilizing community members to solve common problems and to preserve what already
       exists. Renovated infrastructures, particularly cultural and community centers, and
       improvement projects create favorable conditions for the community members to meet and
       organize different events.

2011 BA

      The vast majority of community leadership was aware of the ASIF, but only about 60
       percent of direct beneficiaries had heard of the project.
      Awareness of the project varied—only about 50 percent of direct project beneficiaries were
       aware of the details of the project. This varied by type of project; for example, because a
       water project involved most of the village there was more awareness surrounding these
       types of projects.
      With regard to relevance to needs, about a half of the direct beneficiaries felt that the project
       was generally needed and the initiative was collective, but the other half thought that the
       initiative came from community leadership. However, almost all respondents thought that
       the project was fully relevant to the needs of the community.
      Generally speaking, satisfaction with the quality of projects and project duration and
       timelines was good.
      About 70 percent of direct project beneficiaries thought that the implementation of the
       ASIF projects had a positive impact on cooperation and solidarity in their community or
       institution.




                                                  45
    Regardless of group affiliation, all respondents thought that accessibility (including
     affordability) to services through the infrastructure provided had improved.
    In the case of all projects, a majority of both direct and other beneficiaries believed that the
     projects had a positive influence on a number of indicators such as effectiveness,
     attendance rate, accessibility, improvement of service quality, and improvement of sanitary
     conditions.

2014 BA

    The ASIF projects improved small-scale public infrastructure and also instilled a sense of
     responsibility for public property in the beneficiaries.
    The ASIF resolved issues deemed as priorities of the community—beneficiaries surveyed
     confirmed that the ASIF selected the most urgent issue, calling for immediate resolution.
    The ASIF implemented its projects with social consent and broad involvement. The
     inclusion of two general community meetings, panels, and PICs enabled all community
     members to participate in the process. The communities fulfilled their co-financing
     obligation and this instilled a sense of care and responsibility for their own efforts.
    The ASIF project is renowned and has a good reputation. Community leaders view the
     ASIF as a mechanism for solving some of the social problems in their communities.
    The ASIF provided partners with experience and professional expertise—participants
     reported that their experience in the ASIF helped them gain knowledge and experience
     related to procurement and FM. Communities have been able to use their experience to
     establish ties and implement projects with other donor organizations.
    Beneficiaries expressed high levels of satisfaction and comprehension of benefit.
    Although the majority of beneficiaries know who is responsible for operation and
     maintenance of the infrastructure rehabilitated by ASIF, in only two thirds of communities,
     the entities managing the infrastructures included in their budget expenses for maintenance
     and operation activities. Moreover, even such funds are budgeted, half of the beneficiaries
     considered that the allocated funds were not sufficient. In such cases the responsible
     entities attempt to attract funds from other sources.

The ICR team paid several field visits to the MP sites, meeting local authorities, members of
local initiative groups, and direct and indirect beneficiaries. Table 6.1 presents the main findings
that were reported.

                                                            satisfactory. However, some small areas on the

                                                       quality of the facilities and the project process. They
                                                       reported a feeling of responsibility and ownership

                            school                     structure—dirt walls and a crumbling ceiling. There
                                                       were multiple needs but the village agreed that the
                                                       school was a priority; they had received computers
                                                       and had nowhere to put them. Constructing the
                                                       school was also a thought to prevent out migration.
                                                       Beneficiaries are happy to have the school and there

                                                       improper draining pipes could lead to water damage.

                            Borrower’s Contribution to ICR

I.     Introduction

The ASIF III Project (hereinafter ASIF III) commenced its activities in December 2006. The ASIF
III’s goal was to support the Government in its continuing commitment to raise the living standards
of the poor and vulnerable groups within the Government’s evolving social policies and programs.
The ASIF's ideology and approaches were based on the principle that the communities should
identify their problems and participate in all the stages of the MP implementation.

According to the Credit and Loan Agreements with the Bank and the AFs it was anticipated that
at least US$66.8 million would be disbursed from 2006 for activities of the ASIF III. This amount
comprises US$51 million Bank credit, contribution from the Government of Armenia, private
entities’ and individuals’ contribution, and contributions of beneficiary communities.

The distribution of the ASIF funds by regions was figured out on the basis of a two-stage poverty
targeting strategy. The first level of targeting defines broad allocations for the marzes and is based
on a methodology, which includes population size, and indicators of poverty and special regional
factors. The second stage of targeting consists of identifying the needy communities within each
marz. Using the special selection criteria relating to social, demographic, economic, financial,
geographic, and infrastructure conditions, the 918 communities outside Yerevan are ranked marz
by marz, starting from the neediest to those with the least priority needs. As a result of the mapping
exercise, the communities of a marz are classified into three clusters: Cluster A - most vulnerable
communities; Cluster B - moderately vulnerable communities; and Cluster C - least vulnerable
communities. The list of potential applicants is compiled in the first instance from the most
vulnerable communities in Cluster A and from those included in the list of priorities of a marz
regional development plan.

II.    Assessment of Project Objectives, Design, Implementation and Operational
       Experience

1.     Objectives of the ASIF III

The objective of the ASIF III Project was to support the Government’s policy to raise the living
standards of the poor and vulnerable groups through:

      improving the quality and access, and increasing the coverage of community infrastructure
       and services in vulnerable communities and for the most vulnerable groups in response to
       emerging critical needs; and



                                                 50
         promoting complementary institutional capacity building at the community and municipal
          levels so as to improve the quality and sustainability of community investments and service
          delivery, increase accountability, and enhance greater stakeholder empowerment at the
          local level.

All the objectives were fully achieved.

2.        Design

The ASIF Project had three components:

                 Community Investments
                 Local Level Institutional Strengthening, M&E
                 Project Management

The ASIF III Project is rated as Satisfactory.

3.        Implementation and Operational Experience

Community Investments

Since December 2006, the ASIF received 517 MP proposals from communities of which 319 MPs
have been completed (in 184 administrative units of Armenia). Data on the MPs completed, by
typology, are presented in table 7.1.

Provision of school furniture was one of the features of the ASIF III Project. In the course of
ASIF III, a total of 58 contracts were signed for the procurement of furniture at a total cost of about
AMD 2.55 billion (US$6.97 million). Within these contracts 61,853 units of furniture were
provided for 814 educational facilities in Armenia; 4,905 units of furniture were provided to 32
kindergartens; 262 units of furniture were provided to four health care facilities; and 16,994
armchairs and other type of furniture were provided to assembly halls of 65 community and
cultural centers rehabilitated by the ASIF MPs.

Strengths

The ASIF’s activity covered all regions of the Republic of Armenia. The main strength of the
ASIF is its capacity to penetrate into remote, isolated, and vulnerable communities; induce
effective discussion on their perceived priorities; and bring to fruition project proposals to serve
their needs. By the completion of the project, about 1.7 million community members benefited
from the project and the ASIF’s response to their community's demand for priority social needs.

The updated ranking of all Armenian communities, based on the community mapping and profiling
exercise carried out in 2007 and 2011, served as the roadmap for monitoring of the requirement
instituted under the Main Credit and AFs. The final allocation of ASIF III funds for the MPs with
regard to targeting of the communities according to their vulnerability has therefore met all the
requirements set in the project papers.

Weaknesses

The drop in US dollar-AMD exchange rate and the increase in the prices of building materials led
to the breaching of a number of construction contracts. New bids were announced to complete the
MPs.

Despite the efforts made by the ASIF to improve communities’ involvement in and development
of their capacity in operation and maintenance of infrastructures, the latter is still problematic
mainly due to lack of financial resources.

Local Level Institutional Strengthening, M&E

The third project included a large and well-designed component of local-level institutional
strengthening aimed to strengthen collaboration between local authorities and community
organizations as well to develop local institutional capacity.

Local Government training includes training of local community officials (mayors, finance
officers, and council members) of the communities that have implemented the ASIF III MPs.

Topics covered by the training included: (a) general structure of the central and local Government;
(b) detailed analysis of the local Government system; (c) community assets, enterprises, and
business activity; (d) community social and economic development programs; (e) local
Government budget; (f) management and operation of the community property and infrastructure;
and (g) intercommunity unions. The training sessions were delivered in 12 working days, with



                                                  52
each session lasting six hours. The municipal FM training has been successfully implemented
with 716 local Government officials (mayors, finance officers, and council members) from 145
communities from all regions of Armenia having completed the training.

Community council and community members training. Capacity building is provided for
community councils, school boards, and the PICs to effectively plan and manage their investments
and strengthen partnerships with local Governments. Currently, there are a total of 6,434
community members who have participated as members of the PICs and community councils, of
which 1,933 are women and 2,728 are local Government officials. This component is appreciated
by the Government of Armenia.

Project Management

This component supports the ASIF through the provision of equipment, vehicles, salaries,
operating costs, training, technical assistance, and M&E.

The ASIF Executive Office is capable of implementing, on average, 60 MPs a year. The
employees selected on a competitive basis attended special courses and gained significant
experience during the years of the ASIF's operation. The powerful computerized accounting and
MIS based on a high-speed computer network enable the generation of not only any necessary
report but also the follow-up of the progress of each MP. In 2008, 2010, and 2014, three
sociological studies were conducted aimed at the assessment of the impact of the ASIF activity.

Strengths

The main strength of this component is the existence of the ASIF Executive Office with
experienced employees.

Weaknesses

The main weakness is low staff remuneration which has stagnated and remained the same since
2006. If more attention had been paid on staff remuneration, there would have been lower attrition
of highly qualified staff.

III.   Evaluation of Borrower and Bank Performance Bank

The overall Bank performance in preparing and supervising the project was Satisfactory. The
project’s primary objectives were well defined from the beginning and project components fit well
with those objectives and responded to the Armenian Government’s reforms. During project
implementation, the Bank team was highly professional and committed, providing continuous
assistance on all implementation-related issues, and worked efficiently in close contact with the
ASIF team and Government officials. The MTR provided the Government and other interested
parties with detailed and useful information on project implementation.




                                               53
Borrower

The borrower’s performance is rated as Satisfactory. Strong Government commitment and interest
was continuously expressed for the ASIF. A valuable endorsement of this is the fact that the prime
minister of Armenia is heading the ASIF Board.

The ASIF Executive Office was the main coordinating unit for project implementation and worked
extremely diligently on all aspects of project execution. The ASIF team worked enthusiastically
on project implementation, was dedicated to ensuring essential community participation in the
project, and worked extremely well with the Bank and other donors and sponsors who also
participated in the project. The consultants hired under the ASIF III Project presented themselves
in a positive light.
