                                      On the financial stateme.nts ofArmenian Social Investment Fund
r                                                  for the year ended 31 December 2013


[            To the Management of the Armenian Social Investment Fund

             We have audited the accompanying financial statements of the Armenian Social Investment Fund
[            (the ASIF) which comprise the statement of financial position as at 31 December 2013, the
             statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income, statement of changes in equity and
             statement of cash flows for the year then ended and a summary of significant accounting policies
             and other explanatory notes.

             Management's Responsibility for the Financial Statements
             The ASIF' s Management of the Fund is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of
             these financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards, and
             for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of
             special purpose financial statements that are free from material misstatements, whether due to
             fraud or error.

             Auditor's Responsibility
             Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit. We
             conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing. Those Standards
             require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain
             reasonable assurance whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement.

            An audit involves performing procedures to obtain reasonable audit evidence about the amounts
[           and disclosures in the financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's
            judgment including the assessment of the risk of material misstatement of the financial
            statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those assessments, the auditor considers
[           internal control relevant to the entity's preparation and fair presentation of the financial statement
            in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the
            purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity's internal control. An audit
[           also includes the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of
            accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the
            financial statements.
