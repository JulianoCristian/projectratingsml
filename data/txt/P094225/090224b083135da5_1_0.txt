INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT N 82
On the special purpose financial statements of
Armenian Social Investment Fund III Project
for the period from 1 January 2015 to 31 July 2015
To the Management of the Armenian Territorial Development Fund (the ATDF)
We have audited the accompanying special purpose financial statements of the "Armenian
Social Investment Fund III" Project (the Project) financed by Financing Agreements IDA
4238-AM, IDA 4548-AM, IDA 5071-AM and IBRD 7847-AM, which comprise the
statement of cash receipts and payments, the statement of uses of funds by project activity for
the period from 1 January 2015 to 31 July 2015, and a summary of significant accounting

Management's Responsibility for the Financial Statements
The ATDF management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these
special purpose financial statements in accordance with International Public Sector
Accounting Standards: Financial Reporting Under the Cash Basis of Accounting (IPSAS-
Cash Basis), issued by the International Public Sector Accounting Standards Board (IPSASB)
within the International Federation of Accountants (IFAC), and Financial Management
Manual for World Bank Financed Investment Operations, and for such internal control as
management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of special purpose financial
statements that are free from material misstatements, whether due to fraud or error.
Auditor's Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these special purpose financial statements based
on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing
(ISAs) as issued by International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board (IAASB) within
the IFAC. Those standards require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance whether the special purpose financial
statements are free from material misstatement.
An audit involves performing procedures to obtain reasonable audit evidence about the
amounts and disclosures in the special purpose financial statements. The procedures selected
depend on the auditor's judgment including the assessment of the risk of material
misstatement of the special purpose financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In
making those assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the preparation
and fair presentation of the special purpose financial statement in order to design audit
procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an
opinion on the effectiveness of the internal control.
