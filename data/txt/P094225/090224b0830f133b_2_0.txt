                                                 On the special purpose financial statements of
                                                 Armenian Social Investment Fund III Project
                                                    for the year ended 31 December 2014

               To the Management of the Armenian Social Investment Fund (the ASIF)

               We have audited the accompanying special purpose financial statements of the Armenian
               Social Investment Fund III Project (the Project) financed by Financing Agreements IDA
               4238-AM, IDA 4548-AM, IDA 5071-AM and IBRD 7847-AM, which comprise the
               statement of cash receipts and payments, the statement ofuses of funds by project activity, for
               the year then ended 31 December 2014, and a summary of significant accounting policies and
               other explanatory notes.

               Management's Responsibility for the Financial Statements
               The ASIF management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these special
               purpose financial statements in accordance with International Public Sector Accounting
               Standards: Financial Reporting Under the Cash Basis of Accounting (IPSAS-Cash Basis),
               issued by the International Public Sector Accounting Standards Board (IPSASB) within the
               International Federation of Accountants (IF AC), and Financial Management Manual for
               World Bank Financed Investment Operations, and for such internal control as management
               determines is necessary to enable the preparation of special purpose financial statements that
               are free from material misstatements, whether due to fraud or error.

               Auditor's Responsibility
               Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these special purpose financial statements based
c              on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing
               (ISAs) as issued by International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board (IAASB) within
               the IF AC. Those standards require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and
[              perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance whether the special purpose financial
               statements are free from material misstatement.

               An audit involves performing procedures to obtain reasonable audit evidence about the
               amounts and disclosures in the special purpose financial statements. The procedures selected
               depend on the auditor's judgment including the assessment of the risk of material

c              misstatement of the special purpose financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In
               making those assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the preparation
               and fair presentation of the special purpose financial statement in order to design audit
               procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an
[              opinion on the effectiveness ofthe internal control.

0         An audit also includes the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness
          of accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation
          ofthe special purpose financial statements.
          We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a
          basis for our opinion.


          Opinion
          In our opinion,

               1. the special purpose financial statements present fairly in all material respects cash
                  receipts and payments of the Project for the year ended 31 December 2014 in
                  accordance with IPSAS-Cash Basis;

               2. funds have been used in all material respects in accordance with the conditions of the
                  Credit Agreement 5071-AM (third additional financing) between the Republic of
                  Armenia and International Development Association, and World Bank related
                  guidelines, with due attention to economy and efficiency, and only for the purpose for
                  which they were provided;

               3. supporting documents, records and accounts have been maintained to support claims
                  for reimbursement of expenditures incurred. Expenditures included in the withdrawal
                  applications and reimbursed against are eligible for financing under the IDA Credit
                  Agreement 5071-AM (third additional financing);

               4. the Designated account used has been maintained in accordance with the provision of
                  the IDA Credit Agreement 5071-AM (third additional financing), and World Bank
                  related guidelines.



c         Emphasis of matters

           Without qualifying our opinion we draw your attention to Note 13 of these special purpose
[          financial statements which disclose that financing under IDA 4238-AM, IDA 4548-AM and
           IBRD 7847-AM Credit Agreements were completed as at reporting date.
