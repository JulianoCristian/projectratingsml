Low-Carbon\n            Development Policy Loan for Mexico is to support\n            sector-specific, high-priority policy and regulatory reforms\n            that have been identified as critical to achieve\n            Mexico's climate change mitigation targets under the\n            Special Program for Climate Change (PECC). The policy areas\n            that are included in the proposed DPL promote low-carbon\n            development for: (1) increasing renewable energy supply,\n            promoting energy efficiency through cogeneration, reducing\n            gas flaring and venting, and piloting the reform of the\n            rural agricultural electricity subsidy; (2) improving the\n            efficiency of the vehicle fleet and road transport\n            operations in Mexico; (3) strengthening the market for\n            energy-efficient housing; and (4) mainstreaming climate\n            change considerations into land-use and forestry activities.\n            In addition, the proposed operation will contribute to the\n            efforts of the Mexico government to: (i) facilitate\n            Mexico's involvement in the international carbon\n            market, and (ii) implement Nationally Appropriate Mitigation\n            Actions (NAMAs), in particular the ones adopted in the PECC."}, "docdt": "2010-10-25T00:00:00Z"}
