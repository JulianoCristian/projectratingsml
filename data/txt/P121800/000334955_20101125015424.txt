                                SUMMARY OF DISCUSSION*

                                 Meeting of Executive Directors
                                      November 23, 2010
                                                 

The Executive Directors approved the Low Carbon Development Policy Loan (DPL) to the
United Mexican States in the amount of US$401 million on the payment terms and conditions set
out in the President's Memorandum (R2010-0265, dated November 1, 2010).

Executive Directors expressed support for the DPL which promotes sector-specific, high-priority
policy and regulatory reforms that have been identified as critical to achieve Mexico's climate
change mitigation targets under its National Climate Change Program (PECC). The DPL is
consistent with the Government of Mexico's 2007- 2012 National Development Plan and
establishes a program of financial, advisory and convening services. Directors discussed the links
and synergies among different Bank instruments for supporting Mexico's climate change
strategy. Executive Directors also highlighted the importance of continued donor coordination
and private sector involvement on climate change mitigation. Finally, Directors noted the
important role of the Bank in facilitating the achievement of Mexico's climate change goals and
reduction of carbon emissions in several key sectors of the economy.
