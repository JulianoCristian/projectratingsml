Main Policy Areas      Climate Change, Energy, Transport, Housing, Land Use, Forestry

                       Energy: The number of new cogeneration permits issued by CRE
                       increases from 59 (2009) to 70 (2012); the capacity of small-scale RE
                       producers that are connected to the grid increases from 25MW (2009)
                       to 35MW (2012); at least 1 large-scale Pemex project receives a new
                       cogeneration permit; Pemex reduces total gas flaring for associated
                       natural gas (excluding Cantarell) from 195 MMCFD (2009) to
                       145 MMCFD (2012), and for Cantarell, gas flaring is reduced from
                       504 MMCFD (2009) to 47 MMCFD (2012).
                       Transport: The energy efficiency and CO2 emission control standard
                       for new light duty vehicles issued by SEMARNAT /SENER/SE is in
                       force; the number of vehicles covered by transport operators' action
                       plans under the new Transporte Limpio program reaches 30,000, and
                       the number of freight service users who adopt action plans reaches
Key Outcome            50 companies.
Indicators
                       Urban: The number of newly constructed housing units that qualify
                       for CONAVI's new energy efficient housing subsidy increases to
                       200,000; the number of new housing units that qualify for international
                       carbon credits under the CDM programmatic methodology for
                       sustainable housing (AMS-III.AE) reaches 100,000, and; the recipients
                       of CONAVI's housing subsidy that participate in the green mortgage
                       (Hipoteca Verde) program reaches 140,000.
                       Land Use and Forestry: The number of permits for forest
                       management increases from 4,000 permits in 2010 to 6,600 permits by
                       June 2012 as a result of the regulatory reform, contributing to the
                       PECC goal of incorporating 2.95 million hectares by 2012; a draft
                       final national REDD+ strategy is published for consultation.


                       The objective of the proposed operation is to support sector-specific,
Program Development    high-priority policy and regulatory reforms that have been identified as
Objective(s) and       critical to achieve Mexico's climate change mitigation targets under
Contribution to CPS    the PECC for: (1) increasing renewable energy supply, promoting
                       energy efficiency through cogeneration, reducing gas flaring and
                       venting; (2) improving the efficiency of the vehicle fleet and road

                                               i
                 transport operations in Mexico; (3) strengthening the market for
                 energy-efficient housing; and (4) mainstreaming climate change
                 considerations into land-use and forestry activities.
                 The operation fits within the framework of the CPS by supporting the
                 Government's climate change strategy through a multi-sector DPL.

                 A range of economic, political, institutional, environmental, and social
                 risks were considered in preparing this operation. Overall, none of
                 them is expected to have a significant impact on the sustainability of
                 the supported government programs.
                 The selection of the policy areas contained in this DPL was based on
                 extensive analytical work and consultations in Mexico over the past
                 three years, most notably through the World Bank's Mexico
                 low-carbon study. The policy areas and actions for climate change
                 mitigation included are expected to have large potential for reducing
                 GHG emissions, have good financial and economic returns, and were
                 judged by Mexican and international experts to be politically and
                 institutionally feasible to implement (and most are already being
                 implemented at some scale in Mexico today).
                 The macroeconomic risk that a continuing recession in the United
                 States will negatively affect Mexico's economic recovery is mitigated
                 by sound and predictable macroeconomic and public debt management
                 by Mexican authorities.
                 The risk of a contraction in the overall investment in low-carbon
                 programs is mitigated by the Government's passage of national
                 legislation, the continuing commitment to the climate change program,
                 and an investment plan supported by the Fund for the Energy
Risks and Risk   Transition and the Sustainable Use of Energy. The regulatory reforms
Mitigation       that have been included in this DPL increase the likelihood that
                 low-carbon investments will take place by the inclusion of measures
                 that reduce the transactions costs of new energy technologies, such as
                 the interconnection and net-metering legislation for cogeneration and
                 renewable energy.
                 The risk that the large parastatals in the energy sector (CFE and
                 Pemex) will not have the financial authority or incentives to
                 implement the reform measures and make investments in their sectors
                 is mitigated by the legislative and organizational reform measures that
                 have been passed in the past two years (oil and gas reform, renewable
                 and energy efficiency laws). The risk that the Government will not
                 have sufficient financing for low-carbon investments is also mitigated
                 by the now dominant model of using independent power purchase
                 (IPP) agreements with the private sector for financing infrastructure
                 (such as RE capacity and cogeneration).
                 The risk that the fuel efficiency and emission control standard for new
                 light duty vehicles will not be issued is mitigated by the fact that the
                 current Administration has committed itself to issue fuel efficiency
                 standards through two key policy documents; the PECC and the
                 National Program for Sustainable Energy Use 2009-2012. The new
                 standard is expected to be published for public consultation before or
                 during the Conference of the Parties to the United Nation Framework
                                         ii
               Convention on Climate Change (COP16, UNFCCC) in Mexico in
               December 2010.
               In the Forestry sector, there is broad consensus that the forest
               management licensing process is inhibiting sustainable forest
               management and SEMARNAT has consequently simplified and
               strengthened the process, and is facilitating the reforms with local
               training programs. Furthermore, as stipulated in Mexico's Forestry and
               Rural Development Laws, the Government of Mexico has set in place
               national and state forest councils that also promote close coordination
               between agencies.
               The risk of adverse social and poverty impacts associated with
               low-carbon policies is mitigated through the consultations that have
               accompanied the adoption of the Government's national climate
               change program (ENACC, PECC), as well as the consultations for
               sector-specific programs.
               To mitigate social risks related to the implementation of the reforms in
               the Forestry sector, the Government is undertaking a broad
               consultation program at the local level. In addition, the Bank is closely
               engaged with CONAFOR in the development of Mexico's REDD+
               National Strategy, and CONAFOR already has experience in
               conducting these types of analyses through Bank-funded projects like
               PROCYMAF and the Environmental Services Project.

                    IBRD PROGRAM DOCUMENT FOR A
            PROPOSED LOW-CARBON DEVELOPMENT POLICY LOAN
                             TO MEXICO



                                 I.      INTRODUCTION

1.     The Government of Mexico has requested a Low-Carbon Development Policy Loan
(DPL) in the amount of US$401 million in order to recognize and support its on-going reform
and implementation of policies and programs to respond to global climate change. The
Government has asked that the DPL be presented to the IBRD Board of Executive Directors
for approval before the end of calendar year 2010, consistent with the needs of its fiscal and
debt management strategy.

2.      Mexico has a strong record, both domestically and internationally, of credible
commitment and concrete actions to address the challenges of global climate change. The
creation of the Inter-secretarial Commission on Climate Change (CICC) in 2005 (a
commission that includes major ministries and the President's Office) was an early public
signal of Mexico's recognition of and intention to address the range of mounting threats to its
sustainable development that arise from global climate change. As a dry and subtropical
country lying between two oceans, these climate change impacts include an increase in
average and extreme temperatures, a reduction in rainfall and changes in runoff patterns, and
an increase in the intensity of tropical storms from both the Atlantic and the Pacific.

3.      Since the inauguration of President Calderon on December 1, 2006, the need to
address the challenges of global climate change has been a unifying, consistent, and
increasingly high-profile theme of Mexican social and economic policy. The 2007-2012 Plan
Nacional de Desarrollo (NDP or National Development Plan) was the first broad statement of
the Calderon administration's development priorities and, having been widely consulted with
civil society, had environmental sustainability as one of its four pillars. Building on this
emphasis, the CICC's approval in May 2007 of the Estrategia Nacional de Cambio Climático
(ENACC or National Climate Change Strategy) was the Government's next important step in
furthering its climate change agenda. Announced by President Calderon himself, ENACC
placed climate change adaptation and mitigation at the core of Mexico's national development
policy, establishing the long-term agenda and setting medium- to long-term adaptation and
mitigation goals. In August 2009, the Programa Especial de Cambio Climático (PECC or
Special Climate Change Program) was published. It established the Government's plan of
action, including sectoral programs and targets for reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions,
the identification of the principal climate change risks and plans for adaptation, and
cross-cutting policy initiatives. In parallel with ENACC and PECC, Mexico has progressively
strengthened the legal and regulatory framework and public policies and programs so as to
achieve its climate change adaptation and mitigation goals.

4.      With the credibility gained from its strong domestic climate change agenda and its
international commitments, Mexico has obtained an international reputation as a leader in the
climate change field and become a chief advocate for an international climate change
agreement. Mexico's hosting of the 16th Conference of Parties (COP16) of the United Nations
                                              1
Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in November-December 2010 in
Cancun is but the latest example of its leadership. It is also noteworthy that, while not
obligated under the UNFCCC or the Kyoto Protocol to adopt policies and measures to reduce
its GHG emissions, Mexico has done precisely that. In January 2009, President Calderon
reiterated the commitment made by Mexico at COP14 in Poland that the country intended to
halve its GHG emissions by 2050 compared to 2002 levels. The PECC has mainstreamed
climate change in the country's economic and social development by establishing
sector-specific reductions targets and adaptation measures. In addition, to date Mexico is the
only UNFCCC non-Annex 1 country to have submitted its Third and Fourth National
Communications and is already at work on its Fifth for submission by 2012. Recognizing
Mexico's leadership in terms of both its domestic policies and programs and its international
commitments, Mexico is ranked 11th among all countries on the Climate Change Performance
Index (CCPI) for 2010.1

5.       The Bank's support for Mexico's climate change and sustainable development agenda
has steadily expanded since the mid-1990s in line with the Government's growing emphasis
on mainstreaming social and environmental sustainability considerations in all of its national
development plans and sector strategies. The FY2008-2013 Country Partnership Strategy
(CPS), which the Board discussed in April 2008, was fully aligned with President Calderon's
priorities as enunciated in the NDP and, as such, featured support for environmental
sustainability, including climate change mitigation and adaptation, as one of its pillars. The
CPS Progress Report, which the Board discussed in March 2010, confirmed this focus as a
key element in the partnership.

6.      The Bank's engagement in the field of climate change in Mexico currently comprises
the full range of Bank instruments, including: (i) analytical work, technical advisory and
convening services; (ii) policy dialogue; (iii) knowledge sharing; and (iv) financial services,
including investment and policy-based lending as well as CTF concessional financing, GEF
and other grants, and Carbon Finance. As shown in Figure 1, this engagement has progressed
over the past years, with subsequent stages building on previous actions. In the initial stage,
Bank support focused on technical advice (TA), analytical work and investments in clean
technology and institutional frameworks in the urban, energy and transport sectors (financed
in large part by the GEF and Carbon Finance), while DPLs recognized and supported the
foundations of Mexico's national climate change strategy. In the second stage, TA and
analytical work focused more specifically on climate change issues as inputs to Mexico's
climate change program (PECC), sector investments in sustainable urban transport became
mainstreamed, and DPLs recognized and supported institutional capacity building for energy
and transport and key sector reforms such as national renewable energy and energy efficiency
legislation. Current and future engagement by the Bank is intended to further the support to
Mexico's climate change program, including priority low-carbon development policies and
programs, continuing to mainstream mitigation and adaptation to climate change in key

  The Climate Change Performance Index compares the climate protection performance of the 57 countries that
account for more than 90 percent of energy-related CO2 emissions. Four-fifths of the evaluation is based on
objective indicators of emissions trend and level. The remainder is based on an assessment by more than
130 independent NGO experts of the respective country's national and international climate policy. Emissions
from land-use changes are not yet included in the index. Rankings 1-3 are not awarded; in 4-10 are: Brazil,
Sweden, U.K., Germany, France, India, and Norway.

reforms that were outlined in previous operations as necessary for meeting Mexico's
near-term climate change goals. Drawing on the results of recent analytical work, principally
the World Bank's study on low-carbon development for Mexico,2 this program recognizes
and supports priority climate change mitigation measures in key sectors of the Mexican
economy ­ energy, transport, urban housing, and forestry. The measures that have been
chosen are important for Mexico's mitigation program, not only because they have large

study is the first of several completed by the World Bank that were undertaken for the key developing and
middle-income countries, including studies for Brazil, China, India, South Africa, and Indonesia. A number of
other studies have been done on Mexico's climate change mitigation potential (Galindo, Quadri, Mckinsey,
Mario Molina), and the results of the analysis in terms of the priority areas and actions that can be taken are
largely consistent with the results of the MEDEC study. Unlike some of the Mexican studies, the MEDEC report
focused on the a cost-effectiveness analysis of some of the leading mitigation measures such that measures in
different sector s could be directly compared in terms of their GHG emission reduction potential and their net
economic cost.

                                   II.     COUNTRY CONTEXT

RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS IN MEXICO

8.      The Mexican economy is recovering from a brief but very deep recession. The
collapse of external demand, particularly in durable consumer goods, in the last quarter of
2008 and the first half of 2009 led to an almost immediate and severe downturn in
manufacturing industry and economic activity in Mexico. The ensuing loss of employment
and income generation opportunities as well as the higher level of uncertainty and risk created
by the global financial and economic crisis contributed to a fall in private consumption and
investment further denting aggregate demand. A subsequent rebound in external demand as of
the second half of 2009 is giving rise to an economic recovery, even though private
consumption and investment are trailing behind and have not yet contributed significantly to
the upturn of economic activity. Figure 2 provides a graphical presentation of the levels of
economic activity and the main components of aggregate demand. As can be observed from
Figure 2, by the 2nd quarter of 2010, the level of GDP was still slightly below its pre-crisis
level. The same is the case for private consumption and investment, whereas the level of
exports is just back to it pre-crisis level and public expenditure never dropped.

9.       The sharp fall in aggregate demand of 2009 created a large output gap. The average
annual growth of about 3.0 percent observed during the decade previous to the global crisis
provides a reasonable indication of the country's potential output growth at the time. The
financial crisis may have led to a temporarily lower rate of potential output growth 3 but, even
if that is the case, the contraction of economic activity by 6.5 percent in 2009 created a large
output gap. This implies that the economy may grow for a couple of years at a level
moderately above its potential rate of growth absorbing excess capacity instead of creating
undue inflation pressures.

view of market concerns regarding fiscal sustainability, largely related to a rapidly falling
volume of oil production, the authorities opted for initiating a program of fiscal consolidation
by increasing taxes and containing public expenditures. To moderate the withdrawal of fiscal
support and in line with Mexico's fiscal responsibility law, the budget allowed for a deficit
(excluding budgetary investments in the oil sector) of 0.7 percent of GDP in 2010, which is
expected to decrease to 0.3 percent by 2011 and should return to a balanced budget by 2012.5

11.     Monetary policy has been left unchanged after substantial easing in 2009. The increase
in tax rates and public sector prices, that are part of the 2010 budget law, have been estimated
to increase consumer price inflation by the end of 2010 to about 5.0 percent compared to
3.6 percent observed by the end of 2009. The monetary authorities have left the monetary
policy intervention rate unchanged in view of the temporary nature of the price increases and
the continued significant output gap that should contain inflation pressures.

12.     The monetary authorities have expressed their intention to increase the level of
international reserves to mitigate the impact of possible future financial shocks. A rules-based
mechanism that allows market participants to sell foreign exchange to the Central Bank was
reintroduced in February 2010 and should allow for a steeper increase of international
reserves. Over the first nine months of the year, the mechanism contributed US$3.8 billion to
an overall reserve accumulation of US$17.4 billion, with the difference consisting of net
public sector foreign exchange receipts. In the meantime, the US$47 billion Flexible Credit
Line, contracted with the IMF in April 2009 for the period of one year, was recently renewed
for another year.

MACROECONOMIC OUTLOOK AND DEBT SUSTAINABILITY
13.     After a sharp rebound of external demand over the past year, the Mexican economy is
headed for a more moderate and balanced expansion of economic activity. Economic growth
is expected to moderate in the second half of 2010 and continue to slow to about 3.8 percent
in 2011. Strong external demand for Mexican manufactured goods is projected to persist due
to the close integration of manufacturing industry with industrial production in the United
States, though growth of exports will normalize compared with its sharp post-crisis rebound
and as a result of a moderation of growth in the United States. More importantly, the
expansion of economic activity will be more balanced with respect to the contribution of
domestic and external demand to aggregate demand as GDP growth converges to the
underlying growth of domestic demand (see table 1).

14.     Domestic demand is recovering with a lag as it depends largely on a strengthening of
the level and quality of employment. Household consumption in Mexico is closely related to
developments in the labor markets, as labor income is the main source of disposable income.
In this regard, the recovery mirrors the sequence of the economic downturn in which the
collapse of external demand led to a decline in manufacturing industry followed by a loss in
employment and eventually a weakening of private consumption. Similarly, the recovery of
trade and industrial activity is leading to a rebound in employment which will be reflected in a
strengthening of private consumption. The increasing level of employment has taken place

 Investments in the oil sector, that are not included in this deficit target, amount to 2.0 percent of GDP annually
(See paragraph 17).

largely in the form of lower-paid jobs, which has held back a more vigorous increase of
private consumption yet.

15.      Trade and current account deficits will increase as domestic demand starts to play a
larger role in the economic recovery. The gradual recovery of domestic demand contributes to
import growth catching up with and slightly surpassing export growth. The widening of the
trade deficit is taking place from a low base after the trade balance narrowed substantially in
2009 (see table 2). The evolution of the trade deficit is currently the main driver of the current
account of the Balance of Payments, as the net outflows from tourism and freight services
together with the net interest payments and profit remittances are largely offset by the receipts
from workers' remittances. After a drop of almost 16 percent at the height of the crisis,
workers' remittances have stabilized at about US$21 billion annually. The current account
deficit is projected to increase from US$5.7 billion in 2009 to US$16.6 billion by 2012, which
remains moderate relative to the size of the economy and is mainly financed by Foreign
Direct Investment inflows projected at about 2 percent of GDP or US$22 billion annually
between 2010 and 2012.

16.     Mexico's medium-term growth outlook is reasonably encouraging. Progress in the
economic reform agenda and higher levels of investment in public infrastructure over the past
few years are likely to raise potential growth. Taking into account this impact, a recovery of
domestic demand, and a moderation of U.S. growth to a range of 2.7-3.0 percent annually, the
government has based its medium-term fiscal outlook on an annual economic growth of
4.2 percent for 2012-2016.

17.     Over the next few years, 2010-2012, the public sector will be subject to a continued
effort of fiscal consolidation. The budget proposal for 2011 presented to Congress contains an
update of the fiscal consolidation program as adopted in the budget for 2010 (see table 3).
Implementation of the program is on track with minor adjustments in terms of revenue and
expenditure estimates as a result of a more rapid economic recovery, a slightly higher oil price
and volume of production, and a stronger exchange rate. Budget deficit targets remain
unchanged, i.e., a budget deficit in terms of the fiscal responsibility rule of 0.7 percent of
GDP in 2010, 0.3 percent in 2011, and a return to budget balance by 2012. Investments in the
oil sector, that are not included in this deficit target, amount to 2.0 percent of GDP annually.
Tight public expenditure conditions, as reflected by a reduction in programmable 6 budget
expenditure by 5.7 percent in real terms in 2010 and 0.3 percent in 2011, are likely to prevail
as proposals for a comprehensive, base broadening tax reform are unlikely to advance before
the upcoming presidential elections (July 2012).

18.     The medium-term fiscal outlook projects a gradual reduction in the public
debt-to-GDP ratio. The outlook is based on a return by 2012 to a balanced budget in terms of
the Mexican Fiscal Responsibility Law. In addition, it assumes a gradual reduction of
investments in the oil sector from 2.0 percent in 2012 to 1.6 percent in 2016 which will lead
to a decrease of the Public Sector Borrowing Requirements (PSBR) from 3.2 percent of GDP
in 2010 to 1.9 percent by 2016. These public sector deficit targets in conjunction with nominal
output growth projections lead to a reduction of the net public debt from 36.8 percent of GDP
in 2010 to 36.3 percent in 2012 and 33.9 percent by 2016.

19.      The downward path in the public debt-to-GDP ratio is mainly susceptible to weaker
economic growth. Some of the main macroeconomic variables that have an impact on
Mexico's public finances include economic growth, inflation, interest rates and the oil price.
The impact of a variation in the average annual oil price by US$1 per barrel on oil revenue is
estimated at 0.04 percent of GDP, whereas a variation by 100 basis points in the average
annual nominal interest rate raises the interest cost of public debt by 0.12 percent of GDP.
The institutional framework for the formulation of fiscal policies, including the balanced
budget rule, provides for coping mechanisms, such as the use of revenue stabilization funds,
and requires adjustments to public finances in the light of adverse developments to assure
sustainable public finances. In this environment, only a lower nominal output growth could
derail the projected downward path in the public debt-to-GDP ratio, as a 1 percentage point
lower level of nominal GDP raises the public debt-to-GDP ratio by 0.4 percent. This implies
that if, after the recovery, the economy falls back to the average annual rate of growth of
3 percent instead of the projected 4.2 percent, and absent further fiscal adjustments, the public
debt-to-GDP ratio will fail to come down and stabilize at the higher level attained during the
crisis.

20.     The macroeconomic policy framework is deemed appropriate for the proposed
Development Policy Loan. Fiscal and monetary policies continue to be well-managed in view
of the challenges posed by the significant uncertainties about the strength and sustainability of
the global recovery and the volatility in global financial markets. No major internal or
external macroeconomic imbalances have been building up or are projected in the near future.


    III.     THE GOVERNMENT'S PROGRAM AND PARTICIPATORY PROCESSES
21.     On May 25, 2007, President Felipe Calderón announced Mexico's National Climate
Change Strategy (Estrategia Nacional de Cambio Climático, or ENACC), which put climate
change at the center of Mexico's national development policy. The ENACC established an
initial blueprint for the long-term climate change agenda for the country, together with
medium- and long-term goals for adaptation and mitigation. The PECC, in turn, defines the
specific policies and actions to be put in place over the subsequent three years (2009-2012), in
particular, by identifying vulnerable sectors and priority actions for mitigating GHG
emissions.7 Although the PECC does not prioritize actions according to their financial costs
and benefits, such considerations are recognized by the Government as critical to the success
of the country's climate change program and this analysis of costs and benefits has been one
of the key areas of support by the World Bank.

22.     As reflected in the PECC, low-carbon development is an economy-wide undertaking
by multiple sectors. Among the activities that are the largest sources of emissions in Mexico
are energy production and consumption, transportation, urban services (such as emissions
associated with buildings and municipal organic waste), deforestation, and agriculture (such
as from livestock and fertilizers). While the Mexican Government has made considerable
progress in the past five years in establishing a climate change program and has passed
legislation in several key areas (such as for energy and transport), additional regulatory and
administrative measures are essential for helping the Government meet its PECC goals. The
MEDEC study, which has been endorsed by Mexico's Inter-secretarial Commission on
Climate Change (CICC), has identified a number of high-priority interventions for reducing
the carbon intensity of development. While the majority of these measures have low net
financial costs, a number of regulatory, administrative, and knowledge barriers have inhibited
their development.

23.     For the purposes of categorizing Mexico's principal GHG emissions and mitigation
efforts, the following discussion focuses on four key sectors: energy, transport, urban, and
forestry and land-use.

ENERGY: ISSUES AND GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS

24.    Mexico ranks 13th in the world in total GHG emissions, and its CO2e emissions from
energy consumption are greater than those of Brazil, making it the largest energy emitter in
Latin America. About 60 percent of Mexico's total GHG emissions are generated from fossil
fuel-based energy production and consumption, including significant fugitive emissions
(leakage, venting, flaring) from oil and gas production and transportation. In 2006, electric
power, oil and gas production, and gas flaring and fugitive emissions accounted for about
46 percent of the country's GHG emissions from fossil fuels (figure 3), with the electric
power sector alone representing approximately 26 percent.8
8
  In 2006, the share of emissions from fossil fuel production and consumption amounted to 34 percent for
transport, 26 percent for electric power, 13 percent for manufacturing and construction, 11 percent for fugitive
gas emissions, 9 percent for oil and gas production and transformation, and 8 percent for other sectors. INE
                                                       9
25.    At present, as much as 76 percent of Mexico's installed electric power capacity is
based on fossil fuels ­ mostly natural gas, fuel oil, and coal ­ with only a small share
contributed by hydropower (19 percent), nuclear (2.3 percent), geothermal, biomass, and
wind. Nonetheless, recent studies have shown that the potential for renewable energy and
energy efficiency in Mexico is large.9 For instance, with modest changes in policies and
investment, wind power could increase its share in the generation mix from 1.4 percent in
2008 to 6 percent 2030, while the share of cogeneration could provide as much as 13 percent
of new power capacity over the period, with a significant share (3,700 MW) produced in
Pemex facilities.

26.     High levels of gas flaring and venting ­ within the context of an overall decline in oil
and gas production levels--at existing fields present an important opportunity to improve
resource use by capturing and using the flared gas. The amount of gas that is currently flared
and vented is significant and is approximately equal to Mexico's total gas imports (which
amounted to about one-quarter of Mexico's total gas demand in 2008). Measures such as gas
flaring and venting reduction and other efficiency improvements at Pemex can help offset the
current losses from its largest field (Cantarell) and thus help to offset the drop in Mexico's oil
exports and, consequently, public revenues. As such, these measures are a high priority for
both the country and the state oil company. At the same time, they are also crucial for
reducing the significant amount of CO2e emissions that originate from the natural gas (mainly
methane)10 that is either not effectively burned during flaring operations or is lost along the
process of oil and gas production (i.e., as fugitive emissions in storage, compression, and
transmission). These sources of CO2e represent a significant part of the GHG emissions from
oil and gas production activities in Pemex, which in turn constitute a sizable share of
Mexico's overall emissions.

27.     To reduce the energy sector's contribution to Mexico's GHG emissions, meet future
electricity demand (projected to grow 4.8 percent a year between 2007 and 2016), and limit
the growth of hydrocarbon imports, new reforms and investments are needed. Among the high
priority measures for reducing GHG emissions in the energy sector are: the promotion of
renewable energy technologies; tapping the unused cogeneration potential in industry,
including at Pemex facilities; lowering the level of gas flaring and venting in upstream
hydrocarbon production; and reforming energy pricing in the agricultural sector.

28.   To address the climate change and sustainability agenda in the energy sector, the
Mexican Congress adopted a comprehensive reform package in 2008:

    The combined methane (CH4) emissions from Pemex fields are estimated at 36.1 MtCO2e, where
uncombusted methane from flaring is the largest single source, accounting for 78 percent of total emissions. See:

x         The Energy Efficiency Law provides a legal framework for promoting more efficient
          energy use, complemented by the Program for the Sustainable Use of Energy11 and
          more specific regulations for implementing energy efficiency measures throughout the
          Mexican economy.
x         The Law on Renewable Energy provides a broad legal, regulatory, and financial basis
          for implementing a national strategy to transition away from hydrocarbon-based
          electricity generation to a broader use of renewable energy sources. The Law and the
          accompanying regulations are intended to allow Mexico to achieve its goal of a
          35-percent share of renewable energy in the national electricity mix by 2025.
x         The Reform of the Hydrocarbon Sector Law aims to strengthen the governance
          structure of Pemex and increase the company's flexibility in allocating expenditures
          and managing debt and procurement. To improve the efficiency of Mexico's oil and
          gas production, the law establishes the National Hydrocarbons Commission (Comisión
          Nacional de Hidrocarburos, CNH) as the institution responsible for regulating the
          exploration and exploitation of oil and gas.

29.     The reforms summarized above can contribute meaningfully to the implementation of
the Government's voluntary commitment to reduce GHG emissions to 50 percent below 2002
levels by 2050. Transitioning to a low-carbon growth path in the energy sector, specifically
for cogeneration and renewable energy, faces a number of policy and institutional barriers,
translating into increased transaction costs, in particular for small-scale private generators.
While in many cases these technologies are competitive with conventional ones in terms of
cost, their wider adoption is hindered by specific regulatory gaps, such as utility procurement
rules that in practice exclude small-scale producers, and the current power generation
planning methods that fail to account for the significant environmental co-benefits
characteristic of low-carbon technologies. One of the reasons for the low penetration level of
cleaner technologies in Mexico's energy mix is the fact that the Constitution mandates
least-cost procurement of electricity generation sources, with the Comisión Federal de
Electricidad (CFE) employing a relatively strict interpretation of this mandate focusing on
"first-cost" rather than "life-cycle cost." Another reason is that CFE evaluates power
production bids based on regulated and pre-specified prices of fossil fuels (such as natural
gas) that are supplied to the independent power producers (IPPs) by CFE. This puts renewable
energy at a distinct disadvantage since CFE and not the IPP is assuming the fuel price risk,
which is one of the main advantages of renewable energy.

30.     Achieving the objectives of a more diverse and carbon neutral electricity generation
mix requires additional regulatory, policy, and institutional modifications. Specific obstacles
to a low-carbon growth path in Mexico's energy sector include:

x         High transaction costs for cogeneration and small RE projects, lack of transmission and
          connection arrangements, lack of experience with small-scale RE contracts by CFE,
          payments to RE producers at a level that covers only the marginal (variable) cost, and
          unfavorable conditions and the lack of an integral strategy for the sale of surplus
          electricity produced by Pemex and other key industrial complexes.

TRANSPORT: ISSUES AND GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS

31.     Transport is the largest and fastest-growing sector in Mexico in terms of GHG
emissions and energy consumption, representing nearly 34 percent of total GHG emissions
associated with energy production and consumption in 2006 (Figure 3) and about 18 percent
of the country's total GHG emissions. The amount of energy consumed by road transport in
Mexico increased more than fourfold between 1973 and 2006, compared with an approximate
doubling of energy use by industry and other sectors. Road transport accounts for about
90 percent of the transport sector's energy consumption and emissions.

32.      The large contribution of the transport sector to the country's GHG emissions and
other types of pollution is explained by many factors, including: (i) rapidly growing
motorization rates, partially caused by the import of used vehicles from the U.S., the
availability of relatively inexpensive new vehicles, and relatively low fuel prices;
(ii) insufficient mass transit alternatives; (iii) the composition of the public transport fleet,
favoring smaller-capacity vehicles and including a growing share of older vehicles;
(iv) increased road congestion; (v) inadequate vehicle standards that impede improvements in
fuel efficiency and reduction of airborne pollutants; (vi) lack of consistent and rigorous
vehicle inspection schemes to enforce emission standards and restrict the use of inefficient
and heavily polluting vehicles; (vii) inefficiencies in road freight transport operations; and
(viii) the neglect of transport aspects in urban development plans.

33.    The average fuel performance of new light-duty vehicles in Mexico is low. In 2008 it
was about 12 km per liter compared to about 18 km per liter in Europe. An increase in the fuel
performance of new cars from 12 km per liter to 20 km per liter would lead to savings of
50 grams of CO2 per km. The age of the vehicle fleet also has a marked impact on Mexico's
overall energy performance and GHG emissions, with 10-year-old vehicles consuming
30 percent more fuel than new ones and producing proportionally more GHG emissions. The
high average fleet age (16.3 years) can be largely attributed to used vehicle imports from the
U.S.

34.     Long distance freight and passenger road transport accounts for about 20 percent of
the transport sector's CO2 emissions. A total fleet of 330,000 motor units and a similar
number of trailers are operated by approximately 110,000 operators. In this fragmented sector,
small one-person businesses (hombre-camion) are dominating. Many of them struggle to
survive, not being able to modernize their equipment or innovate.

35.    To lower the carbon footprint of development and tackle other problems related to
excessive automobile use, such as high levels of congestion and air pollution, Mexico has
chosen to follow a path of greater efficiency in transport use. This commitment was made at
the highest level, through the PECC, specifically focusing on policies and programs in three
broad areas: (i) improvement of public transport and support to modal shift mainly through a
nationwide US$2.7 billion ongoing federal program to finance mass transit systems, which is
complemented by aspects of urban planning and non-motorized transport; (ii) cleaner vehicles
                                              12
and fuels and demand management, among others, through fuel efficiency standards, stricter
vehicle emission standards, the regulation of vehicle inspection methods and characteristics
for in-use vehicles at federal level, including provisions for imported vehicles,12 and vehicle
scrapping; and (iii) greening and fuel efficiency improvements of long-distance passenger and
freight transport, including through improvements to the inspection scheme operated by the
Ministry of Communications and Transport (SCT) for heavy duty vehicles, heavy duty
vehicle scrapping, a program to improve the fuel and environmental performance of heavy
duty vehicles and measures favoring a shift to rail transport. These policies and programs are
in line with the National Development Plan 2007-2012, and most are also envisaged in the
National Program for the Sustainable Use of Energy, the Communication and Transport
Sector Program 2007-2012 or State programs.

URBAN SECTOR: ISSUES AND GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS

36.    Mexico's economic and population growth during the past decade has increased
consumption levels and demand for goods and services, placing increasing pressure on cities
through augmented energy end-use and solid waste generation patterns and, consequently,
increased GHG emissions, impacts on health, ground water, soil, and air quality.

37.     With the expected demographic and economic growth in the next two decades,
managing residential electricity demand will be critical to mitigate GHG emissions. Currently,
the residential sector accounts for 18 percent of total energy end-use in Mexico, with per
capita residential electricity use at 320kW/year, about one-tenth of that consumed in the
U.S.13 However, with a growth in average incomes, and increasing rates of electrical
appliances and air conditioning, the expected rates of growth for residential electricity
demand are enormous.

38.     Housing plays a key role in increased energy demand and the potential generation of a
large share of GHGs. According to the National Housing Commission (Comisión Nacional de
Vivienda, CONAVI), Mexico currently has 24.8 million houses, with about 7 million new
houses to be constructed over the next decade, to increase to a total of 45 million by 2030.
CONAVI estimates that a poorly designed house in a warm climate has an additional
consumption of 1,000 kWh a year. Air-conditioner saturation rates in Mexico were only about
20 percent in 2005, compared with about 95 percent in regions of the U.S. with similar
cooling-degree days. A recent study projects that air-conditioner electricity use in Mexico
could increase 10-fold by 2030, reach a value that is three times higher than total residential
electricity use in 2005.14 In addition to air conditioning, other energy systems in residential

12
   It should be noted that an important remaining issue on which relatively little progress has so far been made is
the need for improved inspection and maintenance of in-use vehicles throughout Mexico. While emission
standards for in-use vehicles established at federal level are rigorously enforced in Mexico City and the State of
Mexico, vehicle emission control is the responsibility of States and Municipalities and there is often minimal
enforcement in other States and in border areas. The State of Baja California has recently introduced a
mandatory vehicle inspection scheme, which is especially important because of the large number of old and
polluting vehicles crossing the border from the US. Other States are also in the process of improving their
vehicle verification schemes.

housing can also be improved. There is considerable potential for improving lighting, since
incandescent lamps still account for about 85 percent of residential light bulbs in Mexico.
Given the large potential for improving energy efficiency in the residential sector, Mexico is
preparing to launch a large-scale energy-efficient lighting and appliances program.

39.     Mexico does not have a residential building energy-efficiency code, but recent
programs by CONAVI to set energy efficiency and other sustainability criteria are a step in
the right direction. Residential building codes have proven to be a highly effective means of
reducing cooling loads (through thermal insulation and window improvements) in the U.S.
state of California. The combination of codes for residential housing units and high-efficiency
air conditioners can drastically reduce air-conditioning electricity consumption in new homes.

40.     Low-carbon development in urban areas is fully contained in the PECC, specifically in
the objective of promoting new, energy-efficient housing. Sustainable housing development is
an important element of Mexico's National Program for the Sustainable Use of Energy
2009-2012. Despite the Government's commitment to achieving sustainable housing,
reaching the specific objectives contained in the PECC and other programs will require
additional regulatory reform (such as building codes) and financial support (such as green
mortgages) to overcome upfront costs of energy efficient technologies and create the market
for sustainable housing. The Government is encouraging the private sector to adopt
sustainable energy criteria in housing construction by providing a subsidy to low-income
households that provides the critical upfront capital to allow the purchase of housing. This
multi-year process has allowed the private sector to modify their building practices and
incorporate energy and water-efficient devices, whereas previously they would build low-cost
housing but inadvertently pass the higher operation costs (such as utility bills) on to
homeowners.

FORESTRY AND LAND USE: ISSUES AND GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS

41.      Land use, land-use change, and forestry (LULUCF) contributed about 14 percent of
Mexico's GHG emissions in 2006, with 10.5 percent of emissions due to deforestation
associated with forest conversion to agriculture and pasture. The remaining 3.5 percent of
GHG emissions in 2006 were due to degradation driven by factors such as over-logging,
illegal logging, high grading (harvesting only the best trees), bad management, forest grazing,
pests, fires, and other human activities.15 The Government and the PECC recognize that only
by improving forestry management, including reducing the emissions from deforestation, can
Mexico meet its climate mitigation goals.

42.     Given the contribution of deforestation and degradation to the country's greenhouse
gas inventory, the Government of Mexico has recognized that interventions in the forestry
sector constitute some of the most important GHG emission mitigation options in the
short-and medium-term. The PECC contains the following four main objectives for the
forestry sector: (i) mitigate emissions from the forestry sector and those originating from land
use changes through programs for the sustainable protection, conservation, and management
of forest ecosystems; (ii) increase the potential of forests as carbon sinks through reforestation

and afforestation activities; (iii) stabilize the forestry-agriculture frontier so as to reduce GHG
emissions generated by the conversion of forest lands to agricultural uses; and (iv) decrease
the incidence of forest fires due to forestry and agriculture-related activities. Within these
objectives, one of the most important medium-term (PECC) goals is to incorporate
2.95 million hectares of land under sustainable forest management. Increasing the number of
forestry management plans is in this regard one of the most important ways for Mexico to
reduce emissions caused by deforestation and degradation (REDD).

43.     Mexico has made great strides in achieving its forestry goals through the creation and
implementation of key forestry-related programs and strategies. Among the most important
programs are the Programa Estratégico Forestal para México 2025, whose objective is to
promote and strengthen the sustainable development of natural resources in forest ecosystems
through conservation, protection, restoration, promotion, and production activities, as well as
to propose investment options in the forestry sector; and the Programa Sectorial de Medio
Ambiente y Recursos Naturales 2007-2012, which aims to identify actions for the
conservation of forest carbon stocks and the reduction of GHG emissions, and to promote
knowledge generation to strengthen climate change policy formulation. Since 2007, the
Federal Government, through CONAFOR, has implemented the ProÁrbol program for
developing community forestry, promoting sustainable forest management, soil conservation,
and reforestation. In addition, the Government of Mexico has also established the Programa
de Plantaciones Forestales Comerciales or PRODEPLAN (1997), whose main objective is to
develop productive activities through commercial forest plantations; and the Bank-supported
Programa de Desarrollo Forestal Comunitario (PROCYMAF, 1998), which aims to
strengthen community forestry schemes for sustainable forest management.

44.     Consistent with the National Development Plan, Mexico has paid close attention to
halting the advance of the agricultural frontier on forests and jungles. The Government of
Mexico has established ecological projects related to land conservation, restoration, and
reforestation through its farm-support program, Programa de Apoyos Directos al Campo
(PROCAMPO). Since 1995, PROCAMPO Ecológico has allowed PROCAMPO-eligible land
to be converted to ecologically friendly uses. However, this environmental component has
been limited, due largely to structural and institutional impediments, and to the limited
economic benefits that it offers.

45.     While the above mentioned measures have represented important steps to foster the
low-carbon development of the forest sector, limit the advance of the agricultural frontier on
forest lands, and protect biodiversity, there are several additional areas that need to be
addressed. Considering that the majority of GHG emissions within land use, land use change,
and forestry are caused by deforestation and degradation, the Government of Mexico
recognizes it must undertake regulatory, institutional, and policy reforms to promote
sustainable forest management.

46.    Mexico's forests cover close to 30 percent of the country's land territory (30.5 million
hectares of temperate forest and 26.5 million hectares of tropical forest).16 An additional
58.5 million hectares, or 40 percent of the territory includes xerophytic vegetation (vegetation

that requires little water) that is also under the responsibility of the National Forestry
Commission (CONAFOR). The forestry sector contributes around 1.4 percent of GDP, 17 and
generates over 100,000 permanent jobs that pay an income 3 to 4 times higher than that of
agricultural activities.18 Although an estimated 38 percent of Mexico's total forested area has
commercial potential (21.6 million hectares),19 only around 15 percent (8.5 million hectares)
of the area is currently managed under approved sustainable management plans.

47.     Sustainable forest management has been proven to generate significant environmental
and social benefits. In the Mexican context, the natural protected areas (NPA) system covers
nearly 10 percent of the forest area in the country and, for reasons of budget and ecosystem
management, the inclusion of additional areas needs to be selective. Outside of the NPAs,
abandonment has led to land degradation due to fires, plagues, illegal logging, and other land
use changes. According to the OECD, sustainable forest management has proven to protect
forest cover as effectively as NPAs (OECD, 1997), while providing livelihoods to over
12 million rural inhabitants in Mexico. The estimated emissions reductions from
incorporation of new areas to sustainable forest management are estimated to total
15.7 mtCO2e by 2012.

48.     SEMARNAT, CONAFOR, and forest producers agree that some of the most
important challenges preventing the incorporation of forests under sustainable forms of
management are the lack of streamlined procedures for permits, weak capacity, and
inadequate information for planning, promotion, and enforcement. The simplification,
elimination, and modification of administrative procedures represents an important step along
several dimensions: (i) acting as an incentive for users to incorporate forest land under
sustainable forms of management and preventing illegal land uses, (ii) harmonizing
procedures and requirements and promoting transparency, (iii) enhancing inter-institutional
coordination by creating a common language between government agencies involved in forest
management activities, and (iv) contributing to a systematic way of gathering and processing
information relevant to the forestry sector. This last dimension is particularly important, as the
generation of relevant data on the forestry sector allows for the informed planning, promotion,
and enforcement of sustainable forest management activities by SEMARNAT, CONAFOR,
and PROFEPA, respectively.

49.     Mexico is currently developing a comprehensive REDD+ strategy20 as a framework
for existing and future interventions in the forestry sector. Progress has been made in this
area, both on the institutional front and on defining and fulfilling the technical needs for the

   Mexico is a proponent of the REDD+ approach, which promotes the development of strategies and incentives
for the reduction of emissions from deforestation and degradation (commonly referred to as REDD) and for the
conservation and sustainable management of forests and for the enhancement of carbon stocks. While reducing
global forest loss from deforestation and degradation results in a decrease in further emissions of carbon into the
atmosphere, REDD+ recognizes that leaving growing forests intact also increases the removal of carbon already
in the atmosphere, a process known as carbon sequestration. Additionally, REDD+ supports the idea that forestry
initiatives could simultaneously address climate change and rural poverty, while conserving biodiversity and
sustaining vital ecosystem services.

design of the strategy. Along these lines, the country has submitted a Readiness Preparation
Proposal to the Forest Carbon Partnership Facility (FCPF)21 to receive grant support to work
out its national reference scenarios for emissions from deforestation and forest degradation,
design a national monitoring, reporting, and verification systems for REDD+, and put in place
national REDD+ management arrangements. Mexico is also one of eight countries that will
have pilot projects under the Forest Investment Program and has been welcomed as an
observer to UN-REDD's Policy Board. Through its involvement in these various spaces, by
2012 Mexico aims to have developed the instruments, mechanisms, schemes, and institutional
arrangements that will allow for the formalization of its REDD+ strategy and its initial
execution.

PARTICIPATORY PROCESS AND CONSULTATIONS

50.    As part of the National Development Plan (PND) and the Special Program for Climate
Change (PECC), the majority of the policies and programs included in this program benefitted
from a long-standing consultation process carried out by the Government in this context.
Additionally, Bank engagement in infrastructure and climate change projects requires regular
consultations and the participation of key stakeholders.

51.     The public consultations of the PECC were carried out from March 24 to June
18, 2009. Comments and suggestions were received from 97 persons and institutions and
posted on the Environment Ministry's web page (www.semarnat.gob.mx). Participants
included: 25 Schools, Universities, and Research Centers; 23 Environmental and
Non-Government Organizations (NGOs), 23 Consultants and Firms, 12 National and
Sub-national Government Officials, and 2 Rural Producers Organizations. In parallel with the
creation of the Inter-Secretarial Commission on Climate Change, the Government of Mexico
invited the scientific community and civil society to form a Consultative Council to provide
input to the PECC to ensure that strategies and sector programs are developed with due
consultation for potentially affected parties.

Cogeneration and Small-Scale Renewable Energy

52.     The three resolutions that promote increased cogeneration and renewable energy
supply went through a series of technical and public consultations prior to being published in
April 2010. On the technical side, input was solicited from both domestic and international
experts on the interconnection, net-metering, and model contract proposals, prior to be being
released for public consultation. In compliance with the Federal Law on Administrative
Procedures (Ley Federal del Procedimiento Administrativo), the draft of every regulation
must be pre-published in the respective institution's website or in the Diario Oficial de la
Federación to allow input and feedback from the general public. In the case of these energy
regulations, the draft resolutions were made available prior to their release on both SENER's
and CRE's website, and several workshops on renewable energy and energy efficiency were
held to discuss the specific content and implications of the three resolutions. In particular, the
RES/054/2010 (model contract for small-scale renewable or cogeneration) was pre-published
in the Diario Oficial on April 8th, 2010 for a period of 53 days; the RES/066/2010

Gas Flaring Reduction

53.    The Resolution to Reduce Gas Flaring and Technical Specifications was extensively
discussed with Pemex through four working meetings with senior management, during which
time the main agreements were reached, including thresholds for gas flaring, and the reporting
protocol. In addition, consultations on the Technical Specifications of the resolution were held
with international experts to verify their accuracy and technical feasibility, including the
GGFR of the World Bank and the Energy Resources Conservation Board of Alberta
(Canada). The draft Resolution on gas flaring was published on the CNH website.

Fuel Efficiency in Vehicles and Transport Operations

54.      The preparation of the energy efficiency standard for new vehicles takes place
through an open and participatory process. It begins with the dissemination of basic
information on the proposed standard in the National Standardization Program that is
published in the Official Gazette. This signals the formal start of the standardization process,
and is meant to serve as an instrument to plan, inform and coordinate the preparation of
national standards. The responsible entities, in this case SEMARNAT, SENER, and SE,
prepare the draft standard along with a regulatory impact analysis (manifestación de impacto
regulatorio). The draft standard is published in its entirety for public consultation, and
interested parties may provide comments to the National Consultative Standardization
Committee during a 60-day-period. During this period the regulatory impact analysis is
available for consultation with the Committee. The draft standard is revised based on the
comments received. The modifications to the draft standard as well as the answers to the
comments are published in the Official Gazette at least 15 days prior to the issuance and
publication of the final standard.

55.    Since 2008, SEMARNAT and STC have held regular meetings with all main transport
associations representing the road transport sector. These meetings discussed measures for
improving the Transporte Limpio Program under preparation. Additionally, SEMARNAT and
STC took advantage of sectorial conferences and events to present the Program. In the
beginning of 2010, a pilot of the Program was launched with approximately 15 firms to test
the program and make revisions. Given the imminent launch of the Program, STC organized a
meeting on September 6, 2010 with the four main transport associations which represent
nearly all transport companies in the country. These associations are: Cámara Nacional del
Autotransporte de Carga - CANACAR, Asociación Nacional de Transporte Privado - ANTP,

Energy-Efficient Housing Development

56.     The Sustainable Housing Program for Climate Change (PEDHSCC), including the
newly established CDM methodology for sustainable housing22 and the sustainable criteria for
the basic housing package,23 had an extensive consultation process in various phases,
involving government, academia, private sector developers, and potential homebuyers. A
government consultation process was established through the formation of a technical
evaluation committee, consisting of the Ministry of Social Development (Secretaria de
Desarrollo Social, SEDESOL), the National Housing Commission (Comision Nacional de la
Vivienda, CONAVI), the National Workers Housing Fund (Instituto del Fondo Nacional de la
Vivienda para los Trabajadores, INFONAVIT), and the Federal Mortgage Society (Sociedad
Hipotecaria Federal, SHF). The committee's goal was to determine the energy efficiency and
sustainable housing criteria which would enable a new homeowner to receive CONAVI's
subsidy. A sustainable development committee was established by CONAVI to meet with
academia, housing developers, and housing finance institutions (such as SHF and
INFONAVIT) to discuss and get feedback on the PEDHSCC. The committee decreed that all
housing developers must provide potential homebuyers information about CONAVI's
sustainable housing subsidy criteria and the green mortgage code. In addition, a public
consultation was held in Mexico City on December 1, 2009 in which the PEDHSCC and the
new housing CDM methodology were presented and queries answered. This event was
announced in the local newspapers and on CONAVI's website and included the participation
of over one hundred people from the state, local, and national level from the urban
development, housing and environment sectors, academia (public and private universities),
private developers, the construction industry, the housing finance sector, and potential
homebuyers.

Land Use and Forestry

57.     Given the importance of sustainable forest management for the forestry sector in
Mexico as well as to the PECC goals, a consultation process has been established for the
regulatory reforms in the forestry sector. Under the National Planning Law, indigenous
peoples have been represented in the development of the forestry law through their
involvement at the federal (National Council for Indigenous Peoples), municipal (Municipal
Councils), and rural levels (Rural Development Councils). Related to forest management,
Mexico has also recently created a REDD+ task force housed within CONAFOR and
composed of representatives of governmental institutions (forestry and non-forestry), NGOs,
forest organizations, academia, and financial institutions. The REDD+ task force has met
regularly to define the national REDD+ preparation strategy, to discuss and agree upon the
various components of the Readiness Preparation Plan Proposal (R-PP) submitted to the
Forest Carbon Partnership Facility (FCPF), and to discuss and agree upon the national
consultation strategy for REDD+. At the sub-national level, various REDD+ related meetings
and stakeholder consultations were held in 2009, with the participation of various state-level
or local-level stakeholder participation. Chiapas and Michoacán have formed working groups
to help develop REDD+ at the state level, and to mainstream Sustainable Forest Management
within their REDD+ strategies. Specific to the regulatory reforms for forest management,

mechanisms have been established by SEMARNAT to disseminate the changes. These efforts
include four annual regional capacity-building workshops that will act as platforms for
consultations with local communities.


             IV.       BANK SUPPORT TO THE GOVERNMENT'S PROGRAM

LINK TO THE COUNTRY PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY

58.     A multi-sector DPL supporting the Government of Mexico's Climate Change strategy,
as proposed in this DPL, is envisioned in the existing Country Partnership Strategy for
Mexico. Aligned with the Government of Mexico's 2007- 2012 National Development Plan,
the Mexico Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for FY08-FY13, composed of the same four
pillars24 as the National Development Plan (NDP), proposes a streamlined approach to
lending, accompanied by an enhanced program of non-lending advisory services and technical
assistance. Among other types of support, the CPS framework suggests that the
implementation of the Government's climate change strategy could be supported by a
multi-sector DPL, addressing barriers to reducing emissions across a number of sectors in the
context of the overarching objectives defined in the Government's National Development
Plan.

59.     The individual policy areas that are recognized and supported by the Bank through this
DPL and other assistance address multiple themes of the CPS. While environmental
sustainability is the key objective of all of the policy areas, there are also strong linkages to
the other themes as well. The reduction of poverty and inequality are directly promoted
through the subsidies for the purchase of energy-efficient housing under the National Housing
Commission (CONAVI), which are limited to lower-income groups in Mexico. The reforms
in sustainable forest management will allow low-income communities in rural areas, many of
them indigenous peoples, to make use of forested lands for their livelihood in exchange for
sustainable stewardship. Competitiveness would be strengthened through the promotion of
greater efficiency in the supply of energy (cogeneration), and in the improved efficiency of
freight and passenger transport (Clean Transport Program). For all of the policy areas that are
included in this DPL, institutional strengthening is an important objective and explicit
component of programs. For example, the forest management reforms are accompanied by
training of local communities in preparing and implementing sustainable forest management
plans.


COLLABORATION WITH THE IMF AND OTHER DONORS

60.    The macroeconomic situation and prospects for Mexico are regularly discussed
between the World Bank and the IMF. These consultations, held quarterly or more frequently,
involve an exchange of documents and recent reports conducted by the respective teams, as
well as a discussion of Mexico's financial sector issues, given their relevance for IMF and
World Bank engagement with the country. A Flexible Credit Line (FCL) for approximately

24
   The four pillars are: (i) reduction of poverty and inequality, (ii) increasing competitiveness, (iii) strengthening
institutions, and (iv) environmental sustainability.
                                                         20
US$47 billion was approved by the IMF in April 2009, whereby Mexico became the first
country to qualify and request this new instrument, only available to countries with a solid
financial system. At the same time, the U.S. Federal Reserve arranged a US$30 billion
currency swap in response to the financial turmoil that occurred in spring of 2009.

61.     Intended as a one-year arrangement, the IMF's FCL is being used as a precaution by
governments. For Mexico, the announcement of the FCL greatly reduced the volatility of the
peso. This flexible instrument, recently renamed, can be used at any time within a one-year
timeframe and the disbursements do not have to be staggered. This type of precautionary
support, complementary to World Bank and Inter-American Development Bank (IDB)
financing of the Mexican Government's budget, has also served as a backstop on international
reserves of the Central Bank, thus limiting the possibility of speculative capital outflows that
could cause further damage to Mexico's economic prospects. Meanwhile, Bank financing has
provided counter-cyclical and long-term financing of government expenditure and has
allowed the government to limit the crowding out of private sector access to local and
international capital markets.

62.    Through its joint preparation of the Clean Technology Fund Investment Plan, the
World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank have shared their respective
experience in the identification of low-carbon development options in Mexico. During the
preparation of the MEDEC study, which provides the analytical underpinning for this DPL,
the World Bank and the IDB held numerous meetings and attended multiple workshops with
Mexican counterparts, particularly on energy sector issues. While the Bank was preparing
MEDEC, the IDB was supporting a parallel analysis on the economics of climate change that
provided information to MEDEC, and vice versa.

63.     In the preparation of this DPL, the World Bank has also coordinated with the French
Development Agency (ADF), which has been an active player in the climate change area in
Mexico. In February 2010, ADF approved a US$250 million program to support Mexico's
climate change agenda through targeted technical assistance on sectoral and cross-cutting
issues. Given their common interest in supporting environment programs in general, and
low-carbon development in particular, the World Bank and ADF officials have met to discuss
their respective assistance programs in the areas of renewable energy, energy efficiency, and
forest management, including in the context of the preparation of this DPL.


RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER BANK OPERATIONS

CROSS-SECTORAL OPERATIONS AND ANALYSES

64.     The current low-carbon program builds on a number of past operations by the World
Bank in support of Mexico's Climate Change policy and institutional development. The range
of Bank activities is broad, and includes the areas of potential climate change impacts, as well
as measures that can be taken to reduce emissions (mitigation) and contribute to overall
sustainability goals. The Bank has worked in almost all sectors of Mexico's economy that are



                                              21
relevant to climate change through a range of advisory services, analytical work, investment
projects, and DPLs.25

65.    Through its analytic and advisory work, the Bank has contributed to the development
of Mexico's national climate change program, most significantly through the evaluation of
impacts, adaptation measures, and mitigation strategies related to water, forests, energy,
transport, and urban development. In all of these areas, the Bank has provided Mexico with
the experiences from other countries, such as in the use of carbon markets and renewable
energy policy, and in turn has helped to disseminate Mexico's best practices internationally,
such as in the areas of community forestry, bus rapid transit, and overall environment and
climate change planning. The Bank has contributed to the financing of Mexico's sustainable
development and climate change agenda through the use of grants (GEF), concessional
financing (CTF), carbon payments, and sector investment loans in the areas of clean energy,
urban transport, waste management, and land-use and forestry, as well as through
development policy loans.

66.       Several DPLs have been requested by the Government of Mexico in recognition and
support of their climate change program. These include the programmatic Environmental
SALs, the Climate Change DPL and the Environmental Sustainability DPL (both approved in
2008), the Green Growth DPL (2009) and the DPL for Adaptation to Climate Change in the
Water Sector (2010). These previous DPLs have recognized and supported: (i) Mexico's
overall climate strategy, including the adoption of the ENACC and the PECC programs,
(ii) the establishment of key institutions in the energy and transport sectors, namely CONUEE
and PROTRAM, (iii) the passage of key legislation in the energy sectors, namely the energy
efficiency and renewable energy laws, and (iv) the establishment of an adaptation program in
the water sector.

67.     The programs and policies that are recognized and supported by this DPL cover
sector-specific regulations, standards, and programs that have been determined as essential for
meeting the PECC goals, and which have been assessed in the World Bank's low-carbon
study and other analytical work to have good financial and economic returns, and can be
feasibly implemented in the near term. The interventions that are covered by the policy areas
included in this program cover actions in four key sectors: energy, transport, urban housing,
and forestry. Table 3 provides a list of the relevant interventions, along with the potential for
GHG reductions that they represent in Mexico both for the long-term (to 2030) and on an
annual basis.

68.    The proposed DPL is anchored in the analytical work carried out jointly by the World
Bank and a number of counterpart agencies in Mexico. Among these analytical works, most
relevant to the design and preparation of this operation is the World Bank study on
Low-Carbon Development in Mexico (MEDEC), prepared in consultation with representatives
from the Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources, the National Institute of Ecology,
the Ministry of Energy, the National Commission for Efficient Use of Energy, Pemex, and
CFE. Evaluating 40 low-cost interventions across key emissions sectors in Mexico, the

25
     The range of Bank assistance to Mexico in the climate change area is elaborated in more detail in Annex 5.



                                                         22
MEDEC develops a low-carbon scenario through 2030 assuming no major changes in
technology. The interventions evaluated as part of the study were selected based on their
potential for reducing GHG emissions, feasibility in the short or medium term, and low
economic and financial costs.

69.      The policy areas that were selected for inclusion in the Low-carbon DPL were
identified in the PECC as being of high-priority for Mexico's climate change mitigation
agenda in the near term. While the PECC did not evaluate mitigation measures from a
cost-benefit perspective, such an analysis was conducted as part of the MEDEC study. The
criteria that were used to evaluate and select the policy areas included: (i) the size of carbon
emissions reduction (table 4), (ii) the financial and economic returns of the measures without
considering the global environmental benefits, and (iii) the feasibility of implementing the
measures in Mexico in the short term, including the consideration of political and social
acceptability. All of the policy areas included in this DPL ranked high in terms of the
MEDEC criteria. Their overall potential for reducing carbon emissions is large, while their net
cost of reducing carbon emissions is modest (figure 4).

Sector Specific Operational Work and Analytical Studies

70.     The current DPL is linked to a number of sector-specific engagements that reflect a
long-standing and comprehensive policy dialogue and operational relationship between the
Government of Mexico and the World Bank.

71.     In the Energy sector, the World Bank currently supports a variety of interventions
aimed at putting the sector on a low-carbon development path. Among others, these include
studies on renewable resources (Mexico Renewable Energy Assistance Program, to be
completed in 2011) and on the social and environmental standards needed to develop wind
farms (Greening the Wind, forthcoming November 2010). They also include investments in
the development of wind plants (through Venta II) and studies on the potential for mini-hydro
development (through the Promoting Mini-Hydro Potential in Mexico technical assistance
project). A large IBRD and CTF-financed operation, the Mexico Efficient Lighting and
Appliances Project, to be presented to the Bank's Board in parallel with this operation,
supports Mexico's end-use energy efficiency efforts by financing the replacement of
appliances and incandescent lighting in residential and municipal buildings with more energy
efficient technologies for both public and private consumers. Under the Mexico Integrated
Energy Services Project, the World Bank is supporting rural electrification solutions in


                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         24
isolated poor communities using small-scale renewable energy, mainly solar photo-voltaic
(PV) units.

72.     Through a Fee-based Analytical and Advisory Services project, to be completed in
2011, the Bank is supporting Pemex in improving its analytical and management tools to help
evaluate the environmental and social externalities of the company's operations, build
performance indicators based on the valuation of environmental costs and benefits that can
complement corporate benchmarking exercises to report more fully on the company's
strategic goals, and analyze the strengths and weaknesses of Mexico's institutional framework
to regulate the environmental impact of the oil industry. The Bank has undertaken a review of
Mexico's residential electricity subsidy system (World Bank, 2009)26 and has proposed a
range of options that could both reduce the overall fiscal burden of the subsidies (estimated at
some US$10 billion in 2006) and better target subsidies toward low-income consumers.

73.      In the energy/agriculture sector, the Bank has been assisting Mexico to implement
low-carbon measures related to energy use. Support to the adoption of environmentally
sustainable agri-business practices is being provided through the Sustainable Rural
Development Project by financing investments in environmentally sustainable and renewable
energy technologies, including solar systems and biodigestors. The project also provides
assistance for policy development to address issues related to climate change and the
environmental impact of sub-projects and for institutional strengthening of SAGARPA.
Lastly, the recently delivered Agriculture and Rural Development Public Expenditure Review
(PER) provides a comprehensive overview of public expenditure in agricultural programs at
the federal and state levels, assesses the impact of major programs on competitiveness and
equity, and discusses key issues linked to Mexico's sectoral strategy. Complementary to this
Economic and Sector Work (ESW), an Economic Assessment of Policy Interventions in the
Water Sector is currently being implemented, supporting the development of regional and
macro analysis of policy interventions in Mexico's water sector as they relate to water use in
irrigation in the agricultural sector and its associated environmental externalities.

74.     In the Transport sector, particularly urban transport, the proposed Low-Carbon
Development DPL builds on and complements, among others, the outcomes of such
Bank-supported projects as the Mexican Medium Size Cities Transport Program, which
supported the strengthening of local institutional capacity as well as the federal urban
transport decentralization process; the Introduction to Climate Friendly Measures in
Transport, a GEF project that assisted the Government in developing policies and measures
for stimulating a long-term modal shift toward cleaner and less carbon-intensive transport in
the Mexico City Metropolitan Area; and the Mexico Mass Urban Transport Federal
Technical Assistance Program, which helped in designing, creating and establishing a federal
support program for mass transit. The DPL also links to the outcomes of the CTF and IBRD
supported Urban Transport Transformation Program (UTTP) and the Global Environment
Facility (GEF)-supported Sustainable Transport and Air Quality project, both aimed at
placing Mexico's urban transport on a low-carbon growth path. Lastly, the DPL complements
the transport component of the Framework for Green Growth DPL.

75.     In the Urban development sector, the Bank supported Mexico through a project aimed
at reducing solid waste methane emissions. In urban housing development, the ongoing Third
Fee for Advisory Services to Sociedad Hipotecaria Federal project is assisting Mexico's
Ministry of Finance in analyzing options for improving the functioning of the housing finance
markets in the medium term. Similarly, through the Private Housing Finance Markets
Strengthening Project, approved in 2008, the Bank is helping strengthen the financial and
technical capacity of Federal Mortgage Corporation (SHF) to develop and consolidate
markets for housing finance and to expand access to lower income groups.

76.     Relevant to the type of support the current DPL aims to provide to the Forestry and
Land Use sector, two Community Forestry or PROCYMAF projects successfully assisted
indigenous communities and forest owners to improve management and conservation of their
forest resources and generate alternative sources of sustainable income. In conjunction with
these projects, the GEF Indigenous and Community Biodiversity Conservation project built
upon the technical assistance offered through the PROCYMAF in the states of Oaxaca,
Michoacán, and Guerrero by initiating a parallel, demand-driven program for financing the
creation of community biodiversity conservation areas and complementary
biodiversity-friendly sustainable land use activities. Linking biodiversity conservation efforts
in Mexico with other countries of the region, the Fostering Sustainable and Competitive
Production Systems Consistent with Biodiversity Conservation project (P121111) that is
currently under preparation with funding from the GEF, will focus on sustainable
management and value chains development in the Mesoamerican Biological Corridor.
Additionally, the ongoing Sacred Orchids of Chiapas: Cultural and Religious Values in
Conservation Project is helping strengthen Mexico's sub-regional Protected Areas system by
establishing partnerships with landowners to secure a more effective long-term conservation
in the country's forest eco-regions.

77.     The GEF Consolidation of Protected Areas System project addresses forest protection
issues in national protected area systems, while the GEF-funded Environmental Services
Project aims to enhance and protect biological diversity and preserve globally significant
forest and mountain ecosystems through improving the targeting of the Payments for
Hydrological Environmental Services Program, piloting a market-based system to contract
environmental services, and establishing an endowment fund for biodiversity conservation to
provide long-term financing for PES. The complementary IBRD-IDA funded portion of the
project has the goal of substantially increasing the development of markets for environmental
services in Mexico through sustainable financing mechanisms and efficient payment delivery
mechanisms.

78.     The Bank has provided assistance to the Government of the State of Michoacan to
prepare a Climate Change Strategy led by the minister of environment (Secretaría de
Urbanismo y Medio Ambiente). The Bank´s support to subnational climate change initiatives
is one of the activities under the climate change MoU with SEMARNAT. The Bank´s
assistance has been two-fold: (a) a participatory planning process has been initiated to
promote awareness, identify issues, existing information and priorities, reaching out to civil
society through a series of national and international workshops, and assisting in the
preparation of proposals for donors funding; and (b) based on identified priorities and key
studies, a risk management approach of the impacts of climate change for selected sectors is
being prepared.

79.    In the Social Development sector, the Bank currently supports a variety of
interventions aimed at strengthening environmental sustainability principles within the
Government's social policy framework, as well as the social and equity dimensions of its
environmental and climate change policy. A study on the Social Dimensions of Climate
Change provides an impact analysis of disaster and climate risks on the poor, a municipal
index of climate vulnerability, and an assessment of the effectiveness of current risk
management programs. The Bank also has an MoU with the Ministry of Social Development
(SEDESOL) to mainstream sustainability principles across its social programs and to pilot a
more integrated approach to sustainable local development in the most marginalized
municipalities. At the municipal level, the Bank also supports a climate change municipal
development plan and a green fund in the municipality of Othon P. Blanco, Quintana Roo
(with a Cities Alliance grant). These and other initiatives are part of an ongoing policy
dialogue for a DPL on Sustainable Territorial Development and Adaptation to Climate
Change (FY12) through which the Bank aims to strengthen pro-poor adaptation planning,
climate risk management for the poor, and sustainable territorial development practices in
urban and rural settings of Mexico.

LESSONS LEARNED

80.     The design of the proposed DPL draws on the lessons learned from the World Bank's
continued dialogue with Mexico on climate change issues, from the Bank's investment
lending and technical assistance portfolio for Mexico's energy, transport, and land-use
sectors, and, from Bank activities related to climate change in other middle-income countries.
In particular, the design and scope of the current operation has been informed by lessons
learned from a number of previous cross-sectoral DPLs and other operations in Mexico,
including due to their strong links with related technical assistance packages and Memoranda
of Understanding. The long-term engagement between the Bank and the Government on
climate change has supported Mexico's leadership in the climate change arena. As such, the
proposed operation thus represents the logical next step in this relationship.

81.     In particular, the DPLs and sector investment loans provide valuable lessons with
respect to the need to ensure the anchoring of the proposed operation in the sector-level
analytical work carried out both by the Bank and institutions in Mexico. In the case of the
proposed DPL, a strong analytical basis across all the sectors it covers is provided by the
MEDEC Study, carried out by the Bank in coordination and consultation with a number of
environmental and sectoral institutions in Mexico, which, in turn, contributed to the analytical
foundation of the Government's Special Program for Climate Change (PECC). The DPL also
builds on the sector-specific and institutional lessons learned and advances made as a result of
the extensive analytical work done to prepare Mexico's Clean Technology Fund Investment
Plan, its Renewable Energy Assistance Program and Urban Transport Program.

82.    The analytical foundation and guidance in terms of the need for a sound and
well-developed monitoring program, consultation framework, and thorough assessment of
possible adverse social and distributional effects has been provided by the Bank's ongoing
Advisory Program aimed at improving the operational and environmental performance of
Pemex. In the Land-Use and Forestry sectors, similar lessons can be drawn from the
preparation process for the country's participation in the Forest Carbon Partnership Facility.
                                              27
Overall, the proposed DPL relies on the analysis underlying the Government's PECC, a key
part of the National Development Plan, which was widely consulted in accordance with
participatory processes established in Mexico's Planning, Transparency and Access to
Information legislation as well as other laws.

83.     Based on a review of project Implementation Completion Reports and discussions
with central government and line agencies, the Bank-supported climate change and
above-mentioned sectoral activities highlight the importance of Strong Country Ownership
in the selection of the Policy Areas included in the DPL. Country ownership is critical to
success, particularly for high-profile and important policy reforms, such as those included in
the proposed loan. The proposed project responds to Government's request to support specific
priority programs and areas that reflect the outcome of national policymaking processes.
Namely, the current DPL is grounded in the Government's exemplary program and activities
in climate change, including a comprehensive National Climate Change Strategy and the
related PECC, as well as Mexico's three National Communications to the United Nations
Convention for Climate Change (UNFCCC). The DPL also builds upon sustained and
effective efforts to support climate-friendly energy, transport, urban development, and
land-use management programs, based on an objective assessment of the long-term economic
sustainability issues and inter-institutional coordination complexities.

84.     Thus, the proposed operation builds upon the Government's own framework for
prioritizing low-carbon interventions across the sectors of the economy, acknowledging the
need to focus on a select number of central actions, impacts, and results. Toward this aim,
the monitoring indicators established for this operation are drawn directly from those the
Government is using to assess the success of its interventions. The Government has
repeatedly requested the Bank's support on climate change mitigation and adaptation,
environmental management, and sector-specific issues. The experience with developing and
providing comprehensive analytic and advisory packages on those priority issues, through
various MOUs, as a complement to policy lending, has served to ensure that the Bank's
engagement and support to Mexico is timely and strategic, and that policy development is
predicated upon a sound and strategic analytic basis.

85.     It is important for Mexico and other developing and middle-income countries to
establish domestic climate policies and programs in the context of the international
framework for climate change. Mexico's PECC program is a prime example of a Nationally
Appropriate Mitigation Strategy (NAMA), and Mexico and other developing and
middle-income countries should be recognized for well-designed national climate change
programs. Establishing standard methodologies and reporting protocols for national programs
can facilitate access to the international carbon market, while the preparation of mitigation
strategies (such as "low-carbon" analyses) can serve as the basis for international climate
change funds (such as the CTF).

ANALYTICAL UNDERPINNINGS

86.     The preparation of this DPL has been informed by numerous analytical studies and a
rich set of technical assistance activities covering the Energy, Transport, Urban, and Forestry
sectors as well as Climate Change and environmental management issues more broadly.
Among the analytical works that form the basis for this operation are:
                                              28
x   World Development Report 2010 ­ Development and Climate Change analyzes the
    climate change impacts on economic development and finds that, in order to reduce
    vulnerability to climate change, societies will need to increase efforts to protect natural
    resources and pursue other cross-sectoral, "climate smart" practices.
x   Low-carbon, High Growth: Latin American Responses to Climate Change explores how
    the region is exposed to climate change impacts and what it can do to avert its effects,
    both unilaterally and with the incentives of a global climate agreement.
x   Low-Carbon Development for Mexico (México: Estudio sobre la Disminución de
    Emisiones de Carbono, MEDEC) -- prepared by the World Bank in consultation with
    representatives from key Mexican agencies, research institutes, and civil society, ,assessed
    Mexico's potential for low-carbon growth and the macroeconomic and fiscal implications
    of a low-carbon development plan. The MEDEC study highlights opportunities for carbon
    emissions reductions from a range of sectors, including energy, transport, end-use energy
    efficiency, and forestry and land-use. Evaluating 40 low-cost interventions across the
    main emissions sectors in Mexico, MEDEC develops a low-carbon scenario through 2030.
    The interventions evaluated were selected based on their potential for reducing GHG
    emissions, feasibility in the short or medium term, and low economic and financial costs.
    The MEDEC study has provided the primary source of information for the policy and
    institutional measures included in this DPL.
x   Clean Technology Fund (CTF) Investment Plan, a multi-year "business plan" agreed on
    by the Government of Mexico, the IBRD, the IDB and the IFC, provides support for the
    low-carbon objectives in Mexico's Energy and Transport sectors contained in the
    2007-2012 National Development Plan, the National Climate Change Strategy, and the
    PECC.
x   Environmental Technical Advisory Program (TAP) with SEMARNAT aims to strengthen
    Mexico's capacity to mainstream environmental and climate change consideration in key
    economic sectors and public policy by: (i) supporting SEMARNAT and the Instituto
    Nacional de Ecologìa (INE) in building capacity at the state level for developing sub-
    national climate change mitigation and adaptation plans and environmental
    mainstreaming; (ii) strengthening SEMARNAT's capacity to mainstream environmental
    considerations in the agriculture, energy, and housing sectors; and (iii) supporting
    SEMARNAT in carrying out technical studies to assess climate change impacts and
    adaptation measures and identify GHG emissions mitigation measures.
x   Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with SENER aims to strengthen further Mexico's
    capacity to implement its National Energy Strategy and covers the following areas of
    cooperation: (i) support for integrating the policy to promote the use of renewable energy
    in power generation, (ii) analysis of options for modifying the regulatory framework for
    energy efficiency, (iii) identification of best practices for reducing gas flaring and venting,
    (iv) support for designing programs to promote the use of efficient lighting and
    appliances, and (v) support for developing a National Energy Strategy.
x   Study on Residential Electricity Subsidies in Mexico (January 2008) focuses on subsidy
    distribution across households according to income cohorts, sheds light on how the
    electricity pricing scheme could be modified, and suggests that there is room to reduce the
    magnitude of residential electricity subsidies while improving the targeting on
    low-income groups.
x   Global Gas Flaring Reduction partnership. Mexico, represented by Pemex and SENER,
    joined the GGFR in April of 2010. The GGFR partnership is supporting national efforts to
                                                 29
     increase Pemex's operational efficiency program (2008-2012) and the National Energy
     Sector program (PROSENER), as these initiatives establish concrete goals on gas flaring
     and venting reduction and gas utilization. In May of 2010, GGFR finished a study to
     review the gas flaring reduction implementation program of the offshore region (RMNE),
     which found that the integrated Cantarell and Ku-Maloob-Zaab oil fields emitted some
     15 mtCO2e in 2009.
x    Mexico Renewable Energy Assistance Program (ESMAP). Since 2009, this program has
     helped provide SENER and other energy agencies with timely support for their renewable
     energy regulations. Analytical work and associated workshops have been held covering
     the development of guidelines for contracting renewable energy and energy efficiency
     projects, international experiences with solar PV, valuing externalities for thermal power
     projects, and economic valuation of renewable energy.
x    Mexico Urban Transport Sector Technical Advisory Program (TAP) aims to help the
     Government of Mexico: (i) implement the Federal Mass Transit Program (PROTRAM)
     and the Urban Transport Transformation Program (UTTP); and (ii) strengthen the
     technical capacity of the team in charge of implementing these two programs.
x    Road Freight Transport Industry in Low and Middle-Income Countries (June 2007), a
     World Bank study, includes a case study for Mexico that examines the regulatory
     structure and related barriers to the improvement of road freight transport.
x    The Environmental Sustainability DPL (September 2008) included housing as a policy
     area and recognized CONAVI's publication of voluntary cross­sector guidelines for
     incorporating environmentally sustainable practices into housing construction. This was
     the first effort by the GoM to incorporate energy efficiency into the housing-related
     government programs and was designed to be implemented on a voluntary basis.
x    Technical Assistance to the Housing Sector (CONAVI) supported formulation of the
     Housing Construction Code. The new voluntary code is based on the methodology of the
     International Code Council and incorporates energy efficient criteria. It is intended to
     serve as a guide for government funded programs and to the municipal governments to
     update their local regulations.


                         V.       THE PROPOSED LOW-CARBON DPL

OPERATION DESCRIPTION

87.     This DPL recognizes and supports specific regulatory and institutional reforms for
implementing important actions throughout Mexico's economy ­ ranging from energy
efficiency to forest management ­ that have been identified as having large climate change
mitigation benefits, good financial and economic returns, and the ability to be implemented.
Drawing on the results of recent analytical work, principally the Mexico low-carbon study,27

   Johnson, T., C. Alatorrre, Z. Romo, and F. Liu. (2010). Low-Carbon Development for Mexico (México:
Estudio sobre la Disminución de Emisiones de Carbono, MEDEC). Washington, D.C.: The World Bank. This
low-carbon study for Mexico is the first of several completed by the World Bank that were undertaken for the
key developing and middle-income countries, including studies for Brazil, China, India, South Africa, and
Indonesia. A number of other studies have been done on Mexico's climate change mitigation potential (Galindo,
Quadri, Mckinsey, Mario Molina), and the results of the analysis in terms of the priority areas and actions that
can be taken are largely consistent with the results of the MEDEC study. Unlike some of the Mexican studies,
the MEDEC report focused on the a cost-effectiveness analysis of some of the leading mitigation measures such
                                                      30
this program recognizes and supports priority climate change mitigation measures in the
energy, transport, urban housing, and forestry sectors. By undertaking these and other
near-term priority actions in key sectors, Mexico will be able to put itself on a low-carbon
development path and meet its national goals as established in the PECC (see figure 5).

88.      The Policy Development Objective (PDO) of the Development Policy Loan is to
support sector-specific, high-priority policy and regulatory reforms that have been identified
as critical to achieve Mexico's climate change mitigation targets under the PECC for:

x   Increasing renewable energy supply, promoting energy efficiency through cogeneration,
    reduce gas flaring and venting, and piloting the reform of the rural agricultural electricity
    subsidy;
x   Improving the efficiency of the vehicle fleet and road transport operations in Mexico;
x   Strengthening the market for energy-efficient housing; and
x   Mainstreaming climate change considerations into land-use and forestry activities.

89.     In addition, the proposed operation will contribute to the efforts of the Mexico
government to: (i) facilitate Mexico's involvement in the international carbon market, and
(ii) implement Nationally Appropriate Mitigation Actions (NAMAs), in particular the ones
adopted in the PECC.

POLICY AREAS

Energy Sector Objectives

91.      This DPL would provide support to the institutional and regulatory initiatives
underway in Mexico, aimed at mainstreaming renewable energy supply, increasing
cogeneration, reducing gas flaring and venting, and thus contribute to Mexico's Climate
Change and Low-Carbon Development agenda and help to diversify the energy matrix.
Specifically, the operation recognizes and supports key regulatory changes in the electric
power and oil and gas sectors that will allow the implementation of the Renewable Energy
and Energy Efficiency Laws of 2008 and the related regulatory, policy, and institutional
initiatives launched in 2009.28

92.     To overcome the challenges identified previously, GoM is already implementing a
number of specific sub-sectoral initiatives. These include a policy reform to allow for an
increased use of cogeneration in industry (including petroleum and gas); new regulations that
remove the restrictions for small-scale RE projects (<30MW) that allow them to sign
electricity supply contracts with CFE; and new regulations from CNH that will reduce the
amount of gas flaring and venting in Pemex.

Aprovechamiento de Energías Renovables y el Financiamiento de la Transición Energética), September 2, 2009.
                                                    32
POLICY AREA 1 ­ COGENERATION AND SMALL-SCALE RENEWABLE ENERGY DEVELOPMENT

93.     Prior Action under this policy area is the adoption of a net-metering29 regulation, a
wheeling tariff covering transmission and distribution charges, and a model interconnection
contract for cogeneration and RE-based electricity generation.30 These rules provide new
incentives for large- and small-scale cogeneration plants to produce electricity and sell it to
the grid, at terms that are comparable to renewable energy. Notably, as a result of the new set
of regulation, small-scale renewable energy producers are now allowed to sell the excess
capacity they have to the grid, whereas previously only large-scale projects were allowed to
do so. Of particular importance here are the predetermined contracting procedures for
cogeneration and small-scale renewable energy suppliers to sell to the grid. At the end of the
project (12-18 months), it is expected that the number of new cogeneration permits signed by
CRE will increase from 59 (2009) to 70 (2012) and that the combined capacity of
grid-connected small-scale photovoltaic-based electricity producers will increase from
25 MW (2009) to 35 MW (2012). It should be noted that while the new reforms will affect all
small-scale renewable suppliers, solar PV, for which a baseline exists, will be used as a proxy
for overall RE capacity.

94.     One of the largest untapped sources of cogeneration potential in Mexico is in the oil
and gas facilities of Pemex, which is estimated to be equivalent to about 6 percent of
Mexico's entire electric power capacity. The new rules are expected to make it easier for
Pemex to sell electricity to the grid, and thus tap its huge cogeneration potential. By the end of
the project, it is expected that at least one large-scale Pemex project will comply with the new
cogeneration rules and, thus, be eligible for sale of electricity to the grid.

POLICY AREA 2 ­ GAS FLARING AND VENTING REDUCTION IN OIL AND GAS PRODUCTION

95.     The Prior Action in this area is the publication by the CNH of the Resolution to
Reduce Gas Flaring and Venting31 at Pemex and the associated Technical
Specifications-guidelines for facilitating and monitoring progress in reducing gas flaring and
venting. For the first time, a regulatory entity has instructed Pemex to reduce gas flaring and
venting, setting a specific goal of gas flaring reductions in the Cantarell field (the largest)32
from 30 percent of the associated gas produced to a target of 2 percent by 2024, along with
continuous reductions also in other fields. Complementing the issuance of the official
resolution and specifications for gas flaring and venting reductions, a second Prior Action

29
   Net-metering refers to the ability of electricity generators (usually small-scale), who also consume electricity
from the grid, to be paid, or receive credit, for the excess amount of electricity they generate and provide to the
grid. When their demands exceed the amount of electricity they generate at any point in time, they are net
consumers, and when their production exceeds their consumption, they are net sellers. Net-metering is critical in
allowing intermittent energy generators, such as small businesses and homeowners, to be able to afford to install
and produce electricity, including from cogeneration and renewable energy equipment.
30
   Resolution No. RES/054/2010, RES/066/2010 and RES/067/2010. The model contracts, published by CRE in
April 2010, specify that auto-producers with capacity under 500 kW will be able to swap energy with the system
with carry-over conditions, while those above 500 kW will be able to receive payments in exchange of the
excess energy they provide to the grid.
31
   Resolución CNH.06.001/09
32
   The Resolution states that "specifically for the Cantarell field, the Commission will review the situation that
keeps the projects executed for flaring and venting of gas for the purpose of establishing a specific work program
with PEMEX which will end in 2012."
                                                       33
under this policy area is the submission by Pemex itself of a number of Manifests to the CNH,
outlining the process and timeline for reducing gas flaring and venting at Cantarell and other
fields. While these Manifests are not binding instruments, since they can be unilaterally
modified by Pemex, they represent the public commitment by Pemex to the goals outlined in
the Resolution issued by CNH for gas flaring reduction, and are regarded as a major
achievement in the process of oil industry reform.

96.     As an outcome of the actions taken by CNH and Pemex outlined above, in the near
term (12-18 months from project effectiveness), Pemex is expected to reduce total gas flaring
for associated natural gas (excluding Cantarell) from 195 MMCFD (2009) to 145 MMCFD
(2012). In the case of Cantarell, Pemex is expected to reduce gas flaring from 504 MMCFD
(2009) to 47 MMCFD (2012).

Transport Sector Objectives

97.     The objective of the program in the road transport sector is to recognize and support
the Government's creation of a regulatory framework and incentives for increased energy
efficiency and lower vehicle emissions. While previous Bank operations have focused on the
issues of urban mass transit, including aspects of urban planning and non-motorized transport,
this operation focuses largely on the issues of vehicle efficiency and efficiency of interurban
freight and passenger road transport operations. The main policy measures and interventions
included in the operation include: (i) the establishment of a coherent set of standards for fuel
efficiency and emissions in new vehicles; and (ii) the operation of a program to assist long-
distance freight and passenger transport operators and freight transport service users to
enhance their fuel and environmental performance.

POLICY AREA 3 ­ FUEL EFFICIENCY IN VEHICLES AND TRANSPORT OPERATIONS

98.     In the absence of fuel efficiency standards for new vehicles, vehicle producers lack
incentives to put more energy efficient and less polluting vehicles on the market. In addition,
the long-distance freight and passenger transport industry in Mexico is inefficiently run,
warranting improvements in sector management and fuel efficiency.

99.     The Prior Action in this policy area consists of the initiation of a national fuel
efficiency standard for new light duty vehicles as part of the 2010 National Standardization
Program. A second Prior Action is the adoption by SEMARNAT and SCT of a Voluntary
Clean Transport Program to help long-distance freight and passenger operators and freight
transport service users to assess their fuel performance and to provide them with technical
assistance to improve it.

100. By project end, it is expected that as a result of the first Prior Action the fuel
efficiency standard for new light duty vehicles will be in force. This outcome is highly likely
because the President committed himself through the PECC and the National Program for
Sustainable Energy Use 2009 to 2012 to issue fuel efficiency and emission control standards
for new vehicles. In addition, to set an example for broader action the National Commission
for Energy Efficiency (CONUEE) has already issued energy efficiency guidelines for new
vehicles, which are mandatory for the Mexican federal public administration.
                                              34
101. The standard for light duty vehicles will be similar to the U.S. Corporate Average Fuel
Efficiency (CAFE) standard, but it will also take CO2 emission reductions into account.
Flexibility measures to reduce the cost of compliance, such as credits and debits if producers
exceed or miss the target or banking, are under consideration. In the medium term,
SEMARNAT/SENER/SE will also have issued a fuel efficiency standard for new heavy-duty
vehicles and will thus have completed a comprehensive framework of vehicle energy
efficiency standards.

102. The second Prior Action in this policy area consists of the adoption by SEMARNAT
and SCT of a Voluntary Clean Transport Program to help long-distance freight and passenger
operators and companies that use freight services assess their fuel performance and provide
them with technical assistance to improve it. This program is based on the SmartWay
Program that has been successfully operated by the U.S. Environment Protection Agency
(EPA), and that has been replicated in a number of developing countries, including China.
Participants in the Program receive a rating based on their fuel performance and have to
prepare and implement a three-year action plan to improve it. Many of the measures proposed
for freight transport operators are extremely cost-efficient and can be implemented almost
immediately, such as proper inflation of tires, the use of low-friction lubricants, driver
efficiency training, improved operating practices (such as reduced empty hauling), and speed
reductions. The initial measures can easily and quickly be offset by fuel savings. Other
measures, such as new equipment, will require more time to implement and can be
implemented in later stages. Users of freight transport services in the program (such as
consumer goods manufacturers) will have to select at least part of their suppliers among
participants in the Program. They may also include in the action plan measures to improve
their freight logistics. Participants' performance will be reevaluated on a yearly basis and the
rating will be updated.

103. By project end, it is expected that the number of vehicles covered by freight transport
operators action plans to improve fuel performance will be at least 30,000 vehicles, and that at
least 50 companies that use freight transport services will have an action plan. In the medium
term, it is expected that the Program will be improved. It is also expected that the Program
will be expanded to include a considerable part of the industry, with reductions of 0.9 million
tons of CO2e by 2012 according to the PECC.

Urban Sector Objectives

104. The objective of the DPL in the urban sector is to assist the Government in meeting its
short- and medium-term climate change goals through the promotion of energy-efficient
housing. The DPL will build on past efforts, specifically supporting the PECC goals that
address energy use in the housing sector.

105. Given the expected large expansion of the housing market in Mexico in the coming
decades, it is crucial to ensure that new housing is as efficient as possible, including the key
energy systems for lighting, water heating, and space conditioning. A key barrier to
sustainable housing is the lack of financing to help overcome higher upfront costs of energy
efficient technologies; this is particularly true for low-income housing. As a result, the
policies included in the urban sector focus on the national housing programs for low-income
                                              35
consumers established by the national housing commission (CONAVI), and the primary
mortgage provider (INFONAVIT) that is responsible for about two-thirds of total mortgages
in Mexico. An additional and complementary program for supporting the higher costs of
energy-efficient housing is the use of the international carbon market. For this, it is necessary
to establish clear methodologies and verification conditions to qualify for international carbon
credits.

POLICY AREA 4 ­ ENERGY EFFICIENT HOUSING DEVELOPMENT

106. The Government of Mexico aims to integrate housing policies, programs and
instruments that are able to reduce direct and indirect GHG emissions and at the same time
take advantage of the international carbon market opportunities for the housing sector. To this
end, CONAVI established the Sustainable Housing Program,33 which will help to create a
market for energy efficient housing by: (i) defining the Technical Criteria for the
Development of Sustainable Housing,34 with homeowners qualifying for a CONAVI subsidy
under the program "Esta es Mi Casa" by purchasing a house that meets the criteria;
(ii) implementing a nation-wide homogenous "green mortgage" (hipoteca verde),35 product,
and (iii) allowing CONAVI subsidy recipients to be eligible for the green mortgage and thus
receive better financing to overcome upfront costs of energy efficient technology. The
sustainable housing program is the Prior Action for this policy area.

107. By the end of the project it is expected that residential building development will
increasingly adopt the sustainable housing energy efficient criteria (energy and water use, and
solid waste management), which are financed with the green mortgage and with CDM
emission reduction certificates. In particular, it is expected that: (i) 200,000 newly constructed
residential buildings incorporate CONAVI's sustainable housing criteria and receive the
subsidy; (ii) 100,000 newly constructed residential buildings are registered to receive carbon
credits under the CDM programmatic methodology for sustainable housing; and
(iii) CONAVI's housing subsidies are mainstreamed with the "green mortgage" and that at
least 140,000 subsidies are tied to the green mortgage.

Forestry and Land Use Objectives

108. In the forestry and land use sector, the DPL recognizes and supports the Government's
reforms to the regulatory framework for sustainable forest management, which will contribute
to Mexico being able to meet the PECC target of incorporating 2.95 million hectares of
forests under sustainable management.36 Within the context of such regulatory reforms, the
33
   Programa Especifico para el Desarrollo Habitacional Sustentable ante el Cambio Climático, PEDHSSC,
December 2009.
34
   Características Paquete Básico para Programa de Subsidios, CONAVI, October 2009.
35
   Hipoteca verde is a mortgage product developed by INFONAVIT in 2007 for the financing of eco-
technologies (efficient in energy and water use, and in solid waste management) by providing an additional
20 percent of capital on the basis that the savings from the eco-technologies will provide a better cash-flow for
mortgage repayment.
36
   Mexican law makes a clear distinction between: (a) Sustainable Forest Management, which applies to native
forest managed as a permanent forest and that is partially harvested without losing a percent of forest cover;
(b) Commercial Plantations which are established in plots previously used for agriculture/livestock, or are simply
deforested/degraded, where there is no forest cover; and (c) Reforestation and Restoration, which correspond to
plantations with the exclusive purpose of recovering previously forested areas, with environmental objectives
                                                       36
operation will also build on Mexico's efforts to formulate its national REDD+ strategy, a key
pillar of which is sustainable forest management.

POLICY AREA 5 ­ SUSTAINABLE FOREST MANAGEMENT

109. The PECC highlights the goal of incorporating 2.95 million hectares of forest under
sustainable management by 2012. However, the lack of streamlined procedures for the
approval of forest management initiatives by landowners acts as a barrier to be able to achieve
this goal by promoting behaviors such as abandonment, which leads to uncontrolled plagues,
fires, illegal logging and land use change to more readily available and competitive economic
activities (urban growth, tourism, infrastructure, mining, agro-exports). Furthermore, given
that sustainable forest management is a key instrument to reduce emissions from deforestation
and land degradation, the lack of sufficient incentives to preserve forests and forestry-related
activities would limit the potential positive environmental and social benefits that could be
derived from the implementation of the country's REDD+ strategy in the future. Along these
lines, this policy area highlights the need for an adequate regulatory framework to promote
sustainable forest management, which will in turn be embedded within the more
comprehensive national REDD+ strategy currently being developed by the Government.

110. One of the main barriers preventing the incorporation of land under sustainable forest
management is the process for reviewing and approving management plans and obtaining
permits for forest management activities. To address this bottleneck, SEMARNAT,
CONAFOR, and forest producers agree to the need to reform the regulatory and
administrative processing of forest management plans and the issuance of associated permits.

111. One of the Prior Actions in this area is the publication by SEMARNAT of an
agreement that eliminates requirements, simplifies administrative procedures, and presents
standardized forms that must be completed to carry out forest management activities in the
Diario Oficial de la Federación. It is expected that within 12-18 months from loan
effectiveness, the administrative procedures governing forest management will have been
simplified as a result of the publication of the aforementioned agreement, with 2.95 M ha of
forest having been incorporated under simplified administrative procedures.37 Consistent with
PECC goals, in the medium term, Mexico should see an increase in the number of hectares
incorporated under forest management.

112. The second Prior Action under this policy area recognizes Mexico's efforts in
developing a REDD+ strategy to preserve the quantity and quality of its forests and in due
course to access carbon markets. The prior action consists of the recent creation of a REDD+

and not subject to commercial harvesting. For purposes of this DPL, Sustainable Forest Management refers to all
of the above and provides a framework for integrating the economic, environmental, and social aspects related to
the use of forest resources. This conceptualization is consistent with Mexico's Strategic Forestry Program for
2025 (Programa Estratégico Forestal 2025), which establishes that the objectives for sustainable forest
management, plantations, and restoration include increasing the production and productivity of areas under forest
management, improving the quality of the forest ecosystems, and reducing rural poverty.
37
   The number of permits given out by SEMARNAT and the associated areas under sustainable forest
management included as indicators in the policy matrix will depend on a variety of factors such as specific
programs, public and private investment, other substitute or complementary investments, the dynamic of
economic growth, and external and internal market prices.
                                                       37
Working Group (GT-REDD), a permanent sub-committee within the Inter-secretarial
Commission on Climate Change, led jointly by CONAFOR and SEMARNAT. The
GT-REDD38 will coordinate the design and implementation of the REDD+ strategy and
contribute to the formulation of national REDD+ policies, including those related to the
promotion of sustainable forest management. So far the GT-REDD has acted as a platform to
improve institutional and policy harmonization among government agencies in REDD+
related areas and has successfully driven the submission of the country's Readiness
Preparation Proposal to the Forest Carbon Partnership Facility (FCPF), which was reviewed
and assessed by the FCPF Participants Committee in March 2010 and clearance given for a
Readiness preparation grant. By 2012, the Government aspires to have developed the
instruments, mechanisms, schemes, and institutional arrangements that will allow for the
publication by SEMARNAT of a final REDD+ strategy draft for public consultation.


                   Box 1. Prior Actions for the Low-Carbon Development Policy Loan

The Government has implemented the following Prior Actions:

Policy Area 1: Cogeneration and Small-Scale Renewable Energy Development
    x CRE adopted and published interconnection and net-metering regulations, and model contracts for
        cogeneration and RE-based electricity.

Policy Area 2: Gas Flaring and Venting Reduction
    x National Hydrocarbons Commission adopted the Resolution to Reduce Gas Flaring and Technical
        Specifications for reducing gas flaring at Pemex.
    x As a result of the issuance of the CNH Resolution, Pemex adopted a series of gas-flaring and recovery
        goals (Manifiestos) and submitted them to CNH.

Policy Area 3: Fuel Efficiency in Vehicles and Transport Operations
    x SEMARNAT initiated the process for the creation of a standard for carbon dioxide ("CO2") emissions
        and energy efficiency for new light duty vehicles.
    x SEMARNAT and SCT established a Voluntary Clean Transport (VCT) Program to assist private
        long-distance passenger and freight operators and freight transport service users to improve the fuel
        efficiency of their operations.

Policy Area 4: Energy Efficient Housing Development
    x CONAVI established a Sustainable Housing Program (Programa Especifico para el Desarrollo
        Habitacional Sustentable ante el Cambio Climatico) to promoted energy efficient housing.

Policy Area 5: Sustainable Forest Management
    x SEMARNAT published an agreement in the Diario Oficial de la Federación that modifies the
        regulatory framework for forest management activities, including the simplification of administrative
        procedures for forest management.
    x The Inter-Secretarial Commission for Climate Change within SEMARNAT created an internal Working
        Group to coordinate the development of a national REDD+ strategy.




38
   The GT-REDD is composed of government agencies (federal ministries of Environment and Natural
Resources; Agriculture, Livestock, Rural Development, Fisheries, and Food; Energy; Communications and
Transport; Economy; Tourism; Social Development; Internal Affairs; Finance and Public Credit; Health; Foreign
Affairs; and the Institute of Statistics, Geography and Information).
                                                     38
                            Box 2. Good Practice Principles for Conditionality

Principle 1: Reinforce Ownership
x In May 2007, President Calderón announced México's National Climate Change Strategy (ENACC),
    culminating a two-year process of preparation and public consultation. Adopted in August 2009, the
    PECC adopted medium- and long-term goals for climate change mitigation and adaptation and defined
    strategies for each sector. ENACC and PECC are at the heart of the environmental sustainability pillar of
    México's National Development Plan (PND) for 2006-2012, which Congress approved, and are also
    central to Calderón's vision for México in 2030.
x Energy consumption--including by the energy sector, as well as by transport and housing--is a major
    source of México's GHG emissions. The Government's strong commitment to reducing emissions from
    energy consumption is evidenced by the approval of laws for the Sustainable Use of Energy and Use of
    Renewable Energy and Finance of Energy Transition; the more recent secondary regulations related to
    renewable energy generation, energy efficiency, and transport efficiency; and the initiation of various
    sector-specific sustainable development financing mechanisms, including the Energy Transition Fund,
    the National Infrastructure Fund (FONADIN), and the Green Mortgages program.
x As a single-tranche operation, this DPL acknowledges and reinforces these important steps to develop
    and implement transport and energy sector policies necessary to achieve México's climate change goals.
x As indicated in Section IV, the policies and actions recognized and supported by this operation are
    underpinned by a substantial body of analytical work and by an in-depth and on-going dialogue with the
    Government.

Principle 2: Agree up front with the government and other financial partners on a coordinated
             accountability framework
x The prior actions outlined in Box 1 and in the Operation Policy Matrix (Annex 2) have been agreed with
    the Government. They are all key elements of the Government's own strategy and programs to ensure
    that the energy, transport, urban development, and land-use and forestry sectors meet their intended
    contributions to México's climate change mitigation goals as established under the PECC.

Principle 3: Customize the accountability framework and modalities of Bank support to country
circumstances
x The choice of a single-tranche DPL responds directly to the Government's request for support for its debt
    management strategy in light of the exigencies of the global economic downturn and tightening of credit.
x As indicated under Principle 1, the policy areas included in this operation are all core aspects of the
    Government's program to strengthen the regulatory and institutional framework, financing mechanisms,
    and M&E systems pertaining to low-carbon transport, energy generation and use, and land use.
x As noted under Principle 2, all of the policies reflect the Government's extensive internal deliberations
    and public consultations and are also underpinned by the Bank's on-going dialogue with the Government
    and the substantial body of analytical work to which the Bank has contributed.

Principle 4: Choose only actions critical for achieving results as conditions for disbursement
x The Bank has agreed with the Government that the eight prior actions are all steps that are critical to the
    achievement of México's climate change mitigation goals, related to the areas of renewable energy,
    energy efficiency (both supply-side and demand-side including housing), transport efficiency, and
    sustainable forest management.

Principle 5: Conduct transparent progress reviews conducive to predictable and performance-based
             financial support
x Reviews of progress will be conducted jointly by the Bank, SHCP and concerned line ministries and
    other agencies, including SEMARNAT, SENER, SCT, and CONAFOR. The outcome indicators in the
    Operation Policy Matrix have been agreed with the Government and, together with the description of the
    Government's emission reduction program in the Letter of Development Policy, will provide a
    transparent basis for monitoring progress in program implementation.



                                                     39
                            VI.     OPERATION IMPLEMENTATION


POVERTY AND SOCIAL IMPACTS

113. In the Energy sector, the proposed programs are not expected to have significant
negative poverty or social impacts on consumers or the population at large. By improving the
efficiency of the energy sector, both for oil and gas and electric power, there are likely to be
cost reductions in the provision of energy services and a positive effect on affordability. The
renewable energy technologies (wind, hydro, geothermal) that are likely to be stimulated
through the program's reforms are not expected to raise supply costs, and some large-scale
renewable energy technologies (such as wind) have recently been procured in Mexico at costs
below conventional thermal plants (such as natural gas and coal).

114. The Transport sector programs and regulatory changes included in the operation are
not likely to have significant adverse social or poverty effects, being concentrated primarily
on vehicle and transport operation efficiency. The participation in the Clean Transport
Program is voluntary for freight and passenger transport operators and freight transport
service users. They decide on how far they wish to go in terms of efficiency improvements.
Many of the measures to reduce fuel consumption are very cost-effective and the initial
investment can be recovered in a couple of years; examples include automatic inflation of
tires, low friction lubrication, energy efficient driving, vehicle maintenance, and changes in
operating practices. As such, the introduction of these measures will have a positive impact on
operators, who often struggle to survive in the competitive environment, since they help them
to save fuel costs.

115. As far as fuel efficiency standards for new vehicles are concerned, no significant
increases in vehicle prices are envisaged nor are these standards expected to negatively affect
the mobility of low-income households and small businesses. Indeed, prices of new vehicles
normally depend much more on the accessories and the dress level than on their efficiency. A
recent market study of the Mexican car industry shows that 36 percent of all new cars are sold
at a price higher than the price of the "top-runners" in terms of energy efficiency. Other
studies to quantify vehicle price increases due to the standard showed that the average price of
new vehicles in Mexico could go up by US$1,600 to 3,400, but this increase could be
considerably lower if the Mexican Government implements a number of flexibility
mechanisms currently under consideration, such as weighted corporative fuel performance
averages, compensation among companies, and fuel-efficiency banking. These mechanisms
reduce the cost for car companies to comply with the standard. The cost-benefit analysis for
this measure carried out by SEMARNAT/INE showed net benefits of approximately
$3,000 per vehicle over its life.39 Finally and most importantly, middle and high income
households buy new cars in Mexico, while low income households generally drive used
vehicles or use public transport. Thus, even if prices of new vehicles increase, this would
unlikely affect the mobility of low income households.



39
  The cost-benefit analysis considered an increase in the price of the vehicle due to technological changes, the
rebound effect of increased driving, fuel savings, reduction in GHG emissions, and savings in fuel subsidies.
                                                      40
116. In the Urban sector, the sustainable housing program and its energy efficiency
component is expected to have largely positive social effects. CONAVI's housing subsidy
program will help low- and middle- income urban dwellers afford a house and will also lower
their utility bills. Under the sustainable housing program, households can receive a subsidy of
around US$5,000, while the package of energy efficiency and other measures increases the
costs of the house by approximately US$1,300. The package of "green" measures includes
CFL lighting, solar water heating, water-efficient plumbing fixtures, and waste disposal. In
addition, the energy efficiency investments are cost-effective and have a financial payback of
several years, while the reduced electricity payments constitute a continuous benefit to
dwellers.

117. Through the promotion of sustainable forest management at the community level, the
Government programs included in the Forestry and Land Use sector will help ensure the
incorporation of rural livelihoods and increase the organizational and technical capacity of
communities or ejidos to make sound decisions with respect to the use of forest resources.
The prior actions included within this DPL for the forestry sector are expected to have
positive social and poverty effects. The promotion of sustainable forest management through
the regulatory reforms and the integration of SFM within the context of a future national
REDD+ strategy, are expected to improve the quality of life of people living in forestry
regions through the sustainable use of forest resources and the ensuing protection of the
environment. Vulnerable populations such as indigenous peoples and ejido communities, are
expected to be positively affected, as they are disproportionably dependent on natural
resources for their livelihoods, and lack the capacity to withstand environmental shocks that
can result from the unsustainable use of forest resources.

118. Furthermore, the incorporation of land under sustainable forest management schemes,
particularly as it relates to the legal use of timber and non-timber resources and payments for
environmental services, is expected to promote increased opportunities for the development of
income-generating activities and employment creation for forest dwellers, ejidatarios, and
indigenous peoples living in forested areas. The Programa Estratégico Forestal para México
2025 highlights the role of SFM as a key instrument to overcome rural poverty along the
aforementioned lines, projecting the creation of 180 thousand additional jobs in the forestry
sector and a resulting increase in the contribution of the sector's GDP from 1 to 4 percent
from 2001 to 2025.

119. Additionally, positive social and economic benefits can be derived from SFM at the
community level. Through projects like PROCYMAF targeting poor indigenous and
non-indigenous people from communities and ejidos (comuneros and ejidatarios), Mexico
has promoted local capacity and social cohesion through the conservation of forest resources.
As an example, PROCYMAF has emphasized the creation of regional fora which have
brought communities and state governments together to set priorities and discuss the
allocation of investment resources, which has in turn promoted the development of the
complementary infrastructure (roads, schools) that will help to make forest communities more
viable.

ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECTS

120. The Government's reforms supported by this DPL are likely to have significant
positive effects on the environment, forests, and other natural resources. The policies and
programs recognized and supported through this DPL are expected to facilitate more efficient
use of energy in the supported sectors and, in turn, lower the associated GHG and local air
pollutant emissions.

121. In the Energy sector, the policy reforms included in the program will contribute to
providing access to efficient, renewable and clean energy, thereby reducing air pollution and
mitigating its impacts on human health and associated costs related to treatments of
respiratory diseases. The focus on increasing energy efficiency through cogeneration and
reducing gas flaring at Pemex facilities, similarly, will help reduce the use of fuels that have
negative local environmental and health externalities, and generate substantial energy and
efficiency gains for Mexico's state-owned energy companies.

122. In the Transport sector, the reforms and programs included in the operation will
contribute to a more efficient and less polluting vehicle fleet, thus bringing Mexico on a path
to greater energy self-sufficiency and reducing local air pollution and the related negative
health impacts and costs. Likewise, the supported reforms and programs will contribute to a
more efficient road transport sector, reducing the related externalities and improving the
financial health of the operators.

123. In the Urban sector, the policy reforms included in the operation will contribute to
reducing energy demand from the residential sector, in particular increasing energy demand
buildings, lighting, and home appliances. The promotion of sustainable eco-technology
improvements in residential buildings will further help reduce the use of fuels and, in turn, the
associated emissions of GHG and local air pollutants.

124. In the Forestry and Land Use sector, the policy reforms included in this operation are
expected to have only positive impacts on the environment, as they aim to generate global
environmental benefits through sustainable forest management and the associated reduction of
emissions generated by deforestation and land degradation (REDD+) and promotion of
biodiversity conservation and protection.

125. There may be short-term negative environmental impacts associated with the policy
reforms, such as through the construction of renewable energy facilities, cogeneration plants,
or new energy-efficient housing. For these potential effects, Mexico will rely on its
well-developed environmental impact assessment process to mitigate unwanted
environmental impacts.

126. In its dialogue with the Government of Mexico, through numerous analytical studies
and through the MOUs with SENER, SEMARNAT, and the Ministry of Finance, the Bank
will continue to help the relevant agencies in developing a framework and, where necessary,
the capacity to identify, assess, monitor and evaluate, and manage any social and
environmental impacts that may result from the planned institutional and policy changes.
Through the Energy Sector Management and Assistance Program (ESMAP), for instance, the

environmental and social issues when developing energy projects, including the expected
sharing of costs and benefits.

IMPLEMENTATION, MONITORING AND EVALUATION
127. A separate Project Implementation Unit (PIU) will not be created for this operation,
but rather each governmental institution will be responsible for the policy areas or activity
included in this program for monitoring and evaluation. Because of the focus on policy,
regulatory and institutional development, the majority of the monitoring steps involve
one-step evaluation of program achievements by the time of ICR (approx 18-24 months). The
Ministry of Environment (SEMARNAT) will be responsible for the coordination among these
agencies under this DPL. The sectoral Ministries and agencies responsible for the monitoring
and evaluation of the different policy areas are:

a. Policy Area 1: Cogeneration and Small-Scale Renewable Energy Development
   CRE is the agency responsible for regulating and providing technical standards for the
   operation of the electricity sector. In particular, CRE will monitor the success of the new
   regulations for small-scale renewable producers and cogeneration, establishing baseline
   indicators for the cogeneration contracts, the number of small-scale renewable producers
   that connect into the grid, and will verify the existence of any contract between CFE and
   Pemex in order to purchase power.

b. Policy Area 2: Gas Flaring and Venting Reduction in Oil and Gas Production
   CNH is the agency created to regulate the upstream activities in hydrocarbons. CNH
   adopted the Resolution to Reduce Gas Flaring and Technical Specifications which intends
   to reduce gas flaring at Pemex, and is responsible for approving the Declarations
   (Manifiestos), which are not binding instruments since they can be unilaterally modified
   by Pemex, but which outline the gas recovery goals and gas flaring reduction work plan
   and timeline by Pemex. Accordingly, CNH will publish the timeline and goals derived
   from these commitments and establish a methodology for M&E of the Pemex compliance
   (including baseline and specific targets). CNH will have to publish the evaluation and the
   degree of compliance of the goals by Pemex in its different fields on a regular basis.
c. Policy Area 3: Fuel Efficiency in Vehicles and Transport Operations
   SEMARNAT leads the actions in fuel efficiency standards from an environmental point of
   view and SENER/CONUEE from an energy efficiency point of view. SEMARNAT will
   also co-issue the final standard. Accordingly, these entities are committed to publish a set
   of fuel efficiency standards for new light duty vehicles that is considered as one of the key
   outcomes of this DPL by the time of ICR (18-24 months).SEMARNAT will be the pivotal
   entity for the Voluntary Clean Transport (VCT) program that will assist private long-
   distance passenger and freight operators and freight transport service users to improve fuel
   efficiency of their operations. SEMARNAT will establish the baseline and the targets for
   this activity, while it will remain responsible for the monitoring and evaluation of the
   VCT program.

d. Policy Area 4: Energy Efficient Housing Development
   CONAVI is the entity responsible for the Sustainable Housing Program. Accordingly, it
   will establish the methodology and the M&E system for this program, in particular the
   monitoring of the three key indicators included in this DPL: (i) new housing units with
                                            43
   energy efficient housing criteria, (ii) qualification for international carbon credits under
   the CDM programmatic methodology for sustainable housing, (iii) joint participation in
   CONAVI's housing subsidy and in the green mortgage (Hipoteca Verde) program.

e. Policy Area 5: Sustainable Forest Management
   SEMARNAT is the Ministry responsible for modifying the regulatory framework for
   forest management activities and the simplification of the relevant administrative
   procedures in this area. Accordingly, SEMARNAT will monitor the reduction in the
   processing time for management licenses, and quantify how many permits are issued and
   the total amount of land under sustainable management that is established. Additionally,
   SEMARNAT, through its REDD+ working group, is also responsible for coordinating the
   inter-institutional efforts involved in the design of the national REDD+ strategy in which
   policies to promote sustainable forest management will play a key role.

128. The implementation of the sector reforms and the regulatory framework embedded in
this program is likely to require strong inter-institutional coordination capacity, horizontally
as well as vertically. In response to this need, the World Bank has been engaged in the last
years, through lending instruments and technical assistance programs in supporting the
Government of Mexico in implementing its Urban Transport, Energy Efficiency and
Renewable Energy programs, as well as strengthening its Housing Financial Markets and the
Protected Areas System. A core element of the assistance is helping to build the capacity of
the institutions involved and to strengthen the linkages of those institutions in their
policy-setting, investment review and financing capacities.

129. The proposed monitoring framework for this operation includes 8 monitoring
indicators and corresponding expected outcomes, which can be considered strategic
milestones in assessing progress in implementation of the DPL. The Bank will monitor
actions taken to achieve these outcomes and review progress in the implementation of the
DPL, as well as subsequent government actions, through the closing of the loan.


FIDUCIARY ASPECTS

130. As documented in the 2003 Country Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA),
the 2007 Country Procurement Assessment Report (CPAR), and other analytical work, the
public financial management (PFM) systems at the federal level are adequate to support
development policy lending in Mexico. As envisioned in the CPS, the Bank is collaborating
with the Mexican Government at the central and sub-national level in strategic areas aimed at
modernizing and reforming public finances, and increasing transparency. This has been
supported by a number of knowledge services to the SHCP and Secretariat of Public
Administration (SFP), through different Bank financing products. Likewise, the Bank has
reviewed the PFM systems of the Mexican federal administration in the context of a series of
different DPLs approved in the last fiscal year.

131. In the last decade, the Mexican Government has introduced a number of laws and
policy reforms in public finances aimed at improving fiscal responsibility and transparency by
modernizing the budget process and creating a more efficient and transparent fiscal
framework in line with international good practices. The funding from this DPL will support
                                              44
the Federal Expenditure Budget (Presupuesto de Egresos Federales, PEF) and, accordingly,
will be subject to provisions of the annual PEF Law, the Federal Budget and Fiscal
Responsibility Law, the Government Accounting Law, and the Manual of Budget Procedures,
among others. This set of legal and regulatory arrangements, together with the country
financial management operating systems, provides for sound budget formulation, execution
and internal control arrangements for public expenditures. Other internal control aspects are
ruled by the Federal Public Administration Internal Control Standards.

132. Although rules and procedures governing the budget, accounting and public
expenditure laws are clear and comprehensive, and the budget monitoring and control systems
work well, there remain areas within the public finances where further advances could be
made. Developing a long-term focus for the budget, including performance results in the
budget formulation process, and engaging the public sector to focus on results are key
priorities. Currently the Mexican Government is working towards achieving the envisioned
PFM reforms, including harmonized budget and financial accounting reporting,
modernization of its treasury operations including full implementation of the Single Treasury
Account, as well as designing an integrated financial management system at federal and state
levels. With Bank support, progress has been made to move towards international standards in
different areas of the country PFM systems.

133. The most recent World Bank Country Procurement Assessment Review (CPAR) of
2007, prepared jointly with the IDB, identified issues in the public procurement system
including excessive regulatory complexity and the need for more effective governance and
coordination. The current Government has the objective to align public procurement more
closely with economic expenditure policy, aimed at producing value for money, ensuring
transparency, economy and efficiency, while improving the overall quality of goods and
services. To that end, recent amendments to the legal framework and operational reforms
advanced in 2009 and 2010 have taken several important steps towards addressing the issues
identified in the 2007 CPAR. These changes include legitimizing the use of framework
agreements, a more comprehensive role for e-procurement (COMPRANET), addressing some
of the bid-opening procedures, and an effort to streamline disputes by providing an
out-of-court conciliation process managed by the Civil Service Ministry. Other significant
reforms include greater recognition of the professionalization of the procurement function and
the importance of best practice in terms of total cost of ownership and fair dealings. As
envisioned in the CPS, the Bank is collaborating with the Mexican Government in strategic
areas aimed at modernizing and reforming the PFM system, including its public procurement
system. In particular, in the procurement arena, this support has been provided by a number of
technical assistance and knowledge services to the Secretariat of Public Administration (SFP)
and through different Bank financing products.

134. As for external oversight, the Federal Supreme Audit Institution conducts, on a regular
basis, a number of performance, financial and compliance audits on Government federal
programs. The annual public accounts are prepared and sent to Congress within four months
of the end of each fiscal year. The external audit of these accounts is undertaken by the
Auditor General's office and submitted to the legislature fourteen months after the end of
each fiscal year. Audit reports are comprehensive and there is a system in place to follow up
on audit findings and recommendations. The results of audits by the Auditor General's office
are made public in the Annual Audit Report on the Federal Public Accounts.
                                             45
DISBURSEMENT AND AUDITING

135. The flow of fund arrangements for this operation will be those customarily observed in
DPLs for Mexico, as per long-standing agreements with the Government. The SHCP has
informed the Bank that BANSEFI will be the financial agent of the Borrower with regard to
this DPL.40 Under this arrangement, upon effectiveness and compliance with any withdrawal
tranche release conditions the Bank would deposit the single tranche disbursement to a
designated account of the Bank of Mexico (BANXICO) in US Dollars for subsequent credit
by BANXICO to an account of the National Treasury (SHCP/Tesorería de la Federación,
TESOFE) used for budgeted expenditures. Based on the review of the 2009 audit reports of
the financial agent and the extensive experience between the Bank and BANSEFI regarding
funds flow from bank-financed projects, there is no evidence that the banking control
environment into which the DPL proceeds would flow is other than adequate. If requested by
the Bank, the SHCP would provide the Bank with a written confirmation of the described
transaction after funds are disbursed by the Bank.

136. Based on the assessment of the borrower's current PFM and the conclusion that the
fiduciary arrangements for this financing are adequate, the Bank will not require an audit of
the designated account of the financial agent, and no additional fiduciary arrangements are
considered necessary at this time.




40
   The use of a financial agent and designated account is a standard procedure of the Government of Mexico for
their control purposes and not an additional requirement by the Bank.
                                                     46
RISKS AND RISK MITIGATION

The matrix below sets out a preliminary set of risks, and their mitigating measures, that will
be discussed further with Government counterparts during project preparation.

                                           laws have already been approved, and the Ministry of Energy is fully

                                           important. There will also be an opportunity to further strengthen the
                                           new standards, which cover the period 2012-2016.

The Policy Development Objective (PDO) of the Development Policy Loan is to support sector-specific, high-priority policy and regulatory
reforms that have been identified as critical to achieve Mexico's climate change mitigation targets under the PECC for: (1) Increasing
renewable energy supply, promoting energy efficiency through cogeneration, reduce gas flaring and venting, and piloting the reform of the
rural agricultural electricity subsidy; (2) Improving the efficiency of the vehicle fleet and road transport operations in Mexico;
(3) Strengthening the market for energy-efficient housing; and (4) Mainstreaming climate change considerations into land-use and forestry
activities.

The Matrix below summarizes the proposed Prior Actions, Outcome Indicators, and Medium-term Actions in each Policy Area, where
Areas 1-3 are in the Energy Sector, Area 4 in the Transport Sector, Area 5 in the Urban Sector, and Area 6 in the Forestry and Land-Use

   ANNEX 4: THE GOVERNMENT'S PUBLIC CONSULTATION PROCESS FOR
                    LOW-CARBON DEVELOPMENT

1.      The design of the Mexico Low-Carbon Development Policy Loan was informed by a
long-standing consultation process carried out by the Government in the context of the
National Development Plan (PND), the Special Program for Climate Change (PECC), the
Clean Technology Fund (CTF) Investment Plan, and, more recently, the preparation of the
REDD+ National Strategy. In addition, the Bank's extensive engagement with the
Government on climate change, environment, and sector-specific activities include
consultations and participation of key stakeholders.

2.      As the Government's main instrument for advancing the implementation of the
National Strategy for Climate Change (ENACC), the PECC was developed under the
standards of the General Planning Law which mandates a participatory process. The public
consultation of the PECC was carried out from March 24 to June 18, 2009.
Comments/suggestions from ninety seven persons/institutions were recorded in the
Environmental       Ministry's     web    page      (www.semarnat.gob.mx).         Participants
included: 25 Schools, Universities, and Research Centers; 23 Environmental and
Non-Government Organizations (NGOs), 23 Consultants and Firms, 12 National and Sub-
national Government Officials, and 2 Rural Producers Organizations. Along with the creation
of the Inter-Secretarial Commission on Climate Change (Comisión Inter-secretarial de
Cambio Climático ­ CICC), the Government of Mexico invited the scientific community and
civil society to form a Consultative Council to ensure that strategies and sector programs are
developed with due consultation with potentially affected parties.

3.       Preparation of the CTF Investment Plan was carried out jointly by the Government of
Mexico, the IBRD, the IDB, and the IFC and also included consultations with relevant UN
agencies as well as representation from various countries engaged in Climate Change related
activities in Mexico. This multi-year business plan identifies programs to be co-financed by
the CTF jointly with the IBRD, IDB and IFC in the Urban Transport and Energy Sectors.

4.     A Technical Assistance MOU on Environmental Sustainability and Climate Change is
the framework for the Bank's support to the Climate Change Program in Mexico. The
monitoring and evaluation of implementation, support to sub-national initiatives, the public
consultation design and the study on Social Impacts of CC are some of the relevant activities
under the MOU.

5.     In parallel to the Low-Carbon DPL, the Bank is also preparing a Study on the Social
Impacts of Climate Change (SICC) in Mexico, based on all the Mexico-specific findings
accumulated during the preparation of the climate change regional study, based on the
combination of desk research and fieldwork that was carried out as part of the SICC report
preparation. Preparation of this study has incorporated consultations with a series of
communities, as well as the National Ecology Institute (INE); SEMARNAT; and Universities.

6.     The Bank is also assisting the State of Michoacán in the design and implementation of
a participatory planning process, based on a Strategic Environmental Assessment
multisectoral type of approach, to define and implement an Environmental Sustainability and
Climate Change Program.

        ANNEX 5: ENGAGEMENT WITH MEXICO ON CLIMATE CHANGE

1.      The World Bank has had an extensive engagement with Mexico on climate change
issues, which has addressed potential impacts, adaptation measures, and the mitigation of
emissions. The Bank has used a number of instruments, ranging from analytical work,
technical assistance, project investments, and development policy lending (see figure 7).
While some support has been directed at broad strategy and policy design, the majority of the
Bank's activities have taken place at the sectoral level. Among the sectors or themes that have
been the focus of the Bank's climate change work in Mexico have been energy, transport,
forestry, agriculture, water, urban development, and environmental and social sustainability.

2.      In the energy sector, a substantial amount of analytical work and technical assistance
has been undertaken by the Bank on clean energy. In the renewable energy field, the Bank has
been actively involved in the assessment of mini-hydro, solar PV for off-grid applications,
large-scale wind, solar thermal electric, regulatory policy, valuing externalities, and
renewable energy auctions. Other priority topics have been an analysis of residential electric
subsidies in Mexico and options for reform, a study and workshop on international best
practices for reducing gas flaring, and assessment of the potential benefits and reform
measures necessary to improve energy efficiency. A Memorandum of Understanding with
SENER was signed to strengthen Mexico's capacity to implement its National Energy
Strategy and an ongoing Renewable Energy Technical Assistance Program is providing
support to the government for implementing the renewable energy law and its regulations.

3.     On the transport side, analytical work and technical assistance has also been carried
out on diverse topics such as road freight transport, mass urban transport, and climate friendly
transport and air quality measures. The Mexico Urban Transport Sector Technical Advisory
Program is one example of technical assistance which aims to help the Government of
Mexico implement its Federal Mass Transit Program and the Urban Transport Transformation
Program and also to strengthen the technical capacity of the team in charge of implementing
these two programs. Similarly, the Road Freight Transport Industry in Low and
Middle-Income Countries Study examined the regulatory structure and related barriers to the
improvement of road freight transport in Mexico.

4.      An Environmental Memorandum of Understanding with SEMARNAT was signed
which aims to strengthen Mexico's capacity to mainstream environmental and climate change
consideration in key economic sectors and public policy. In the urban sector, a Housing
Sector Technical Assistance Program has supported the formulation of the Housing
Construction Code, which is intended to serve as a guide for government funded programs
and for municipal governments to update their local regulations.

5.      Broader climate change analytical work has also been conducted on social
development and resilience to climate change, addressing key poverty and vulnerability issues
associated with climate change, cap and trade systems, mainstreaming climate change into
key development sectors, responses to climate change, and sub national climate change
strategies, and low-carbon development. All of these studies have helped address key aspects
of Mexico's climate change program and have made the topic one of the key pillars of the
Bank's Country Partnership Strategy.

                                              71
6.       With regards to investment lending, the Bank has provided financing for a number of
projects related to climate change. Through a combination grants (GEF), concessional loans
(CTF), credits (carbon finance), and IBRD loans, the Bank has provided financial support to
projects on energy efficiency, renewable energy, urban transport, solid waste management,
community forestry, water services, and protected areas. Among the clean energy projects that
the Bank has helped finance in Mexico are the Integrated Rural Energy Services project
which supports small-scale off-grid energy services through the use of renewable energy
technologies; the Large-scale Renewable Energy Development Project supporting
grid-connected wind development in Oaxaca, and; the Efficient Lighting and Appliances
project that expands Mexico's energy efficiency programs in the residential sector. In the
transport sector, the Bank has financed the Urban Transport Transformation Program
through a combination of IBRD and CTF loans as well as a GEF grant that supports bus rapid
transit, clean bus technologies, and capacity building for public transport. In urban sector, the
Bank is helping strengthen the financial and technical capacity of Federal Mortgage
Corporation to develop and consolidate markets for housing finance and to expand access to
lower income groups through the Private Housing Finance Markets Strengthening Project. In
addition, the GEF Consolidation of Protected Areas System project is addressing forest
protection issues in national protected area systems and the Environmental Services Project
aims to enhance and protect biological diversity and preserve globally significant forest and
mountain ecosystems.

7.      In light of Mexico's international commitment to voluntarily reduce GHG emissions,
the country was supportive of undertaking analyses of potential climate mitigation actions.
The World Bank proposed undertaking a low-carbon study in Mexico in 2008 as one of
several similar studies being done in key developing and middle-income countries, including
Brazil, China, India, and South Africa. The Mexico low-carbon study developed a consistent
cost-benefit methodology for evaluating promising mitigation interventions, covering all
major sectors: electric power, oil and gas, transport, end-use energy efficiency, agriculture
and forestry. By focusing on selected projects with good financial and economic returns, it
was estimated that Mexico could maintain its emissions trajectory basically flat over the next
two decades without reducing the rate of growth the economy. The results of the study,
referred to as MEDEC for its acronym in Spanish, form the basis for the policy measures
selected for the current Low-carbon DPL. It should be noted that all of the interventions are
all key measures as part of Mexico's domestic climate change program, PECC.

8.     On the policy side, a series of development policy loans have been carried out, starting
with the Climate Change DPL (April 2008), which aimed to assist the GOM to integrate
climate change considerations into public policy. The Environmental DPL (October 2008)
balanced the objective of socio-economic development with environmental protection and
improvement by integrating environmental concerns in the sectoral policies and programs of
key development sectors (tourism, energy, forestry, water, agriculture and housing).

9.     Building upon the objectives of these prior DPLs, the Green Growth DPL (October
2009) sought to further develop the regulatory, monitoring and financial framework for a low
emissions evolution of the transport and energy sectors; the two sectors responsible for the
bulk of GHG in Mexico. Most recently, the Adaptation to Climate Change Water Sector DPL
(June 2010) recognized and supported the government's efforts to strengthen the institutional

                                               72
framework and monitoring capacity in integrated water resources management as well as
mainstream adaptation to climate change in water programs.

10.     The current Low-Carbon DPL builds on the previous analytic, investment lending, and
policy development loans directed at climate change. It focuses on some of the most
important policy areas for meeting Mexico's climate change mitigation targets. Over the past
three years, Mexico has developed a national climate change strategy and action plan, passed
national legislation in key sectors, developed institutional capacity to promote sectoral
programs, and put in place key regulatory reforms to achieve specific high-priority outcomes.
The six policy areas covered by the Low-Carbon DPL covering energy efficiency
(cogeneration), renewable energy, gas flaring reduction, efficient vehicles and transport
operations, energy efficiency housing, and sustainable forestry have the ability to dramatically
transform Mexico's GHG emission profile.
