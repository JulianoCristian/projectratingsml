Most\n            of the project works were carried out over a six-year period\n            between 1980 and 1986, as opposed to the planned five-year\n            period between 1978 and 1982. At appraisal, it was expected\n            that the first 3,600 ha would be commissioned after two\n            years, with an annual progression of 4,330 ha for three\n            years, for a total of 16,600 ha. In practice, however, after\n            a two-year delay in startup, it was possible to commission\n            9,400 ha in 1982 after two years and to proceed at an annual\n            rate of 1,750 ha for four years, reaching a total of 16,400\n            acres under irrigation by 1986. The slowing of the rate of\n            installation coincided mainly with introduction of budgetary\n            restrictions, which became increasingly severe from 1983."}, "docdt": "1987-06-29T00:00:00Z"}
