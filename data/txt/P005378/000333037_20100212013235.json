construction of 31 km of 60 kv and 62 km of 22 kv\n            power transmission lines and a substation for pumping\n            stations; land preparation and consolidation including farm\n            roads, windbreaks and drainage; installation of 450 km of\n            buried pipe distribution system including hydrants, each\n            serving about 16 ha, and associated mobile sprinkler\n            equipment; construction of main drainage channels entailing\n            about 300,000 cubic meters excavation; construction of 108\n            km of roads, reinforcement of 64 km of existing roads; and\n            construction of buildings and provision of equipment for\n            extension, operation, maintenance, artificial insemination,\n            and telecommunications.

Weaker commodity an inadequate\n            development approach in one project, lower than expected\n            efficiencies, insufficient attention to operation and\n            maintenance in a projects, and damage to the environment and\n            natural resources have been main factors affecting\n            performance. However, with one exception, which performed\n            poorly, the degree of success in the transfer of technology\n            respect of both irrigation practice and agricultural\n            productivity has continued to be sustained in the other\n            three projects."}, "docdt": "1977-04-12T00:00:00Z"}
