construction of six pumping stations with a\n            total installed capacity of 11,300 kw, each with an elevated\n            equalizing reservoir; construction of 31 km of 60 kv and 62\n            km of 22 kv power transmission lines and a substation for\n            pumping stations; land preparation and consolidation\n            including farm roads, windbreaks and drainage; installation\n            of 450 km of buried pipe distribution system including\n            hydrants, each serving about 16 ha, and associated mobile\n            sprinkler equipment; construction of main drainage channels\n            entailing about 300,000 cubic meters excavation;\n            construction of 108 km of roads, reinforcement of 64 km of\n            existing roads;

Weaker commodity\n            an inadequate development approach in one project, lower\n            than expected efficiencies, insufficient attention to\n            operation and maintenance in a projects, and damage to the\n            environment and natural resources have bee main factors\n            affecting performance. However, with one exception, which\n            performed poorly, the degree of success in the transfer of\n            technology respect of both irrigation practice and\n            agricultural productivity has continued to be sustained in\n            the other three projects."}, "docdt": "1977-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
