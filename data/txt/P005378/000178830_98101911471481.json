Weaker commodity an inadequate\n            development approach in one project, lower than expected\n            efficiencies, insufficient attention to operation and\n            maintenance in a projects, and damage to the environment and\n            natural resources have been main factors affecting\n            performance. However, with one exception, which performed\n            poorly, the degree of success in the transfer of technology\n            respect of both irrigation practice and agricultural\n            productivity has continued to be sustained in the other\n            three projects."}, "docdt": "1977-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
