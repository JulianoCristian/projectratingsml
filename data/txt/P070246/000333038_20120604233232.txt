  2.      The project has disbursed US$10.4 million out of the US$11 million GEF grant
  and is well underway to reach its objectives. The Thermo-Modernization (TM)
  Investments Component (US$5.8 million) was fully disbursed before the end of 2011
  and supported a total of 390 TM investments with a total investment value of nearly
  US$43 million. The Technical Assistance (TA) Component shows good progress and
  two out of the remaining three studies (a Macro-Economic Assessment of Energy
  Efficient Policies and an analysis of Home Area Networks within Smart Grids) have both
  been contracted and implementation is on track. The last TA activity is a National
  Registry of Energy Performance Certificates for Buildings the contracting of which is
  awaiting the result of the present restructuring due to the need for introduction of a goods
  category to enable the procurement of software for the Registry and due to insufficient

                                                2
time to complete the activity before the present closing date. All other components of the
project are completed.

3.     A four-month extension of the closing date is proposed in order to complete the
above-mentioned National Registry TA activity, the contract for which is ready for award
following a competitive procurement process. This activity will take around three months
to implement from the date the contract is signed. The new closing date will be October
31, 2012. This would be the third extension of the closing date.

4.    The team has agreed an action plan with the Implementing Agency to ensure
completion of all activities before the new closing date.

5.     The proposed reallocation is necessary to (i) reallocate US$200,000 intended for
the National Registry activity from the TA category of expenditure to the Goods category
since the main part of the activity will be purchase of software, and (ii) reallocate
remaining unused funds to the TM Investment Component in order to fund additional TM
investments.
