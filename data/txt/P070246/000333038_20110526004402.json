This\n            extension will ensure that the funds reallocated from the\n            partial credit guarantee facility component to the new\n            Thermo-Modernization (TM) investments component can be fully\n            disbursed and that the studies under the Technical\n            Assistance (TA) component can be completed in time. The\n            requirements for an extension of the closing date are being\n            met: 1) the project objectives continue to be achievable, 2)\n            the performance of the recipient and Bank Gospodarstwa\n            Krajowego (BGK) continue to be satisfactory, 3) BGK has\n            prepared an action plan acceptable to the bank to complete\n            the project in time, and 4) there are no outstanding audit\n            reports for the project. The restructuring will take into\n            account existing institutional and market capacities and\n            will improve progress in meeting the project development\n            objective.
