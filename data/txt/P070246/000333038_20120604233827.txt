Original/Current Project Development Objectives/Outcomes
The objective of the proposed project is to increase public and private sector investments in energy
efficiency in buildings. The project will achieve this by: 1) Overcoming the risk barriers in the financial
markets inhibiting commercial bank participation in energy efficiency project financing; 2)
Demonstrating the feasibility of packaged investments in higher-cost energy efficiency measures in
buildings and increasing acceptance of energy performance contracting mechanisms in Poland; and 3)
Stimulating the demand for energy efficiency services in the buildings sector and increasing awareness and
capacity of commercial banks to originate and implement loan transactions for EE investments.
