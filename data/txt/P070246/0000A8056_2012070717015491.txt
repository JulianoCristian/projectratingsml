                         Global Environmental Objectives
                         Global Environmental Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The objective of the proposed project is to increase public and private sector investments in energy efficiency in buildings. The project will achieve this by: 1)
                         Overcoming the risk barriers in the financial markets inhibiting commercial bank participation in energy efficiency project financing; 2) Demonstrating the feasibility of
                         packaged investments in higher-cost energy efficiency measures in buildings and increasing acceptance of energy performance contracting mechanisms in Poland; and
                         3) Stimulating the demand for energy efficiency services in the buildings sector and increasing awareness and capacity of commercial banks to originate and implement
                         loan transactions for EE investments.
