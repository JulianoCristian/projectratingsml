PAKISTAN
TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROJECT
CREDIT AND PROJECT SUMMARY
Borrower:              Islamic Republic of Pakistan.
Amount:                SDR 6.3 million (US$7 million equivalent).
Terms:                 Standard.
Project Description:  The proposed project would support the Government in
implementing a proposed structural adjustment program
being submitted to the Executive Directors separately.
The project focuses on assisting the Government in the
areas of macro-economic planning, agricultural pricing,
project preparation, industrial planning and incen-
tives, monitoring of public enterprises, exploration
and development of hydro-carbon energy resources and
national power planning. It provides for the financing
of about 225 man-months of consultant and expert serv-
ices, a number of contracted studies, computer hardware
and software, vehicles and training and fellowships for
local staff. The main risks which may arise during
project execution are possible delays in the deci-
sion-making process within the participating government
ministries and agencies. Given the Government's com-
mitment to its structural adjustment program, these
risks are regarded as minor.

INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO THE
ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF PAKISTAN FOR A
TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROJECT
1.      I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed Credit
to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan for SDR 6.3 million (ITS$7 million equiv-
alent) on standard IDA terms for technical assistance related to structural
adjustment of the economy.
PART I - THE ECONOMY 1/
2.      A report entitled "Pakistan:  Economic Developments and Prospects"
(Report No. 3802-PAK), dated April 14, 1982, was circulated to the Executive
Directors on April 16, 1982.
A. General Background
3.      Pakistan has experienced an uneven pattern of development over the
past 20 years. Rapid economic growth during the 1960s was followed by a
period of poor performance in the early, and mid-1970s. Having inherited an
extremely difficult economic as well as political situation in 1977, the
Government of Pakistan (GOP) has moved firmly and effectively to re-establish
economic stability and generate appreciable growth (averaging over 6% from
FY77 to FY81). The Government's recovery programs have been based on a
foundation of firm financial management and on a wide range of price adjust-
ments which have begun to correct the distortions in the Pakistan economy.
The reforms already adopted and the further measures proposed made it pos-
sible for GOP to reach agreement with the IMF in November 1980 on a substan-
tial Extended Fund Facility (EFF) program (SDR 1,268 million over three
years).
4.      Following a further rapid increase in migrant workers' remittances
(now over $2 billion per year) and the negotiation of the EFF, the balance of
payments position has become more manageable. This has provided an oppor-
tunity for GOP policymakers to move beyond a pre-occupation with short-term
stabilization problems and to focus increasingly on longer-term issues. GOP
is aware that, in the absence of further wide-ranging measures to strengthen
productivity and trade performance, its 6-6.5% p.a. target for economic
growth would need to be revised downwards because of balance of payments
constraints. Some recent developments, such as the slowdown in the world
economy and the depressed world market prices for Pakistan's principal
1/ Parts I and II are the same as Parts I and II of the President's Report
on a Structural Adjustment Loan and Credit (Report No. P-3314-PAK dated
MIay 11, 1982).



-2-
exports (cotton and rice), have underlined the tenuous nature of Pakistan's
external balance.
5.      Against this background, there has been a continuation of the steady
process of rationalization and improvement of Pakistan's economic policy
framework. During the past 18-24 months this process has been assisted and
accelerated by the dialogue between GOP and Bank staff on structural policy
issues, leading to a close understanding on the reform measures needed to
avert a serious balance of payments problem in the second half of the 1980s.
The Government's reform program is focused on the rebuilding of an effective
planning system; concrete steps to implement a well-conceived National
Agricultural Policy; policy reforms to accelerate the development of Pakis-
tan's oil and gas potential; and rationalization of the industrial structure.
6.      The Government's reform program which would be supported by the
proposed structural adjustment lending (SAL), and its links with the EFF
program agreed with the IMF, are described in Part II: a summary of the
Government's medium-term objectives, steps already taken and the further
actions to be implemented is presented in Table 5 (pages 32-36). The back-
ground to the choice of issues addressed under the proposed SAL is provided
by a brief review of past developments and balance of payments prospects in
the following paragraphs.
E. Economic Development to the Mid-1970s
7.      Sectoral policies and the allocation of investments during the 1960s
were effectively guided through a series of five-year plans. A significant
part of public investments was devoted to building up the infrastructural
base for agricultural growth by the construction of major irrigation works in
the Indus Basin, including the Mangla and Tarbela dams. In industry, public
sector involvement was small and emphasis was placed on the private sector.
However, the incentives and protection which were provided to the private
sector led to a bias towards import replacement and a concentration of
economic power held by a small number of bankers and industrialists.
8.      A series of major political disruptions took place from 1969 leading
up to the separation of Bangladesh at the end of 1971. The new Government
which came to power in Pakistan in 1971 reversed many of the policies of the
1960s. Most large industries, domestic banks and life insurance companies
were nationalized, with adverse effects on private investment and confidence.
Difficulty was experienced in absorbing these nationalized enterprises into
the public sector, leading to a general decline in industrial sector produc-
tivity. At the same time, the Government embarked on massive, long-gestation
public investments in industry (notably the Pakistan Steel Mill) and by 1977
public sector investment accounted for three quarters of total industrial
investment. The system of five-year plans was discontinued. From the
mid-1970s, public investments were allocated through annual development plans



-.3-
which did not provide a framework for programming the future phasing of
development expenditures.
9.      In several respects, government policies in the early part of the
1970s were biased towards the improvement of welfare for urban wage earners.
Substantial wage increases took place as well as over-staffing of the newly
acquired public sector enterprises, while consumer interests were protected
by a combination of price controls and subsidies. The agricultural sector
bore some of the burden of these policies. Output prices for domestically
consumed agricultural products were restrained to benefit consumers, while
prices for exportable products, such as rice and cotton, were kept well below
border prices in order to generate revenues to finance increased investments
and subsidies.
10.     In addition to large-scale investments in public sector industry and
the associated needs for infrastructure, there were continuing large outlays
on the major Indus Basin irrigation projects which had been commenced in the
1960s. However, these investments were not accompanied by adequate efforts
to utilize the irrigation water provided by these projects, to maintain
existing facilities, or to develop support services and other instruments
aimed at achieving sustained improvement in agricultural yields. The Govern-
ment became committed to a policy of increasing subsidization of agricultural
inputs as the principal means of promoting agricultural productivity.
11.     During the mid-1970s, following the first round of petroleum price
increases, there was extensive reliance on significantly increased external
borrowing, largely from OPEC sources, as well as excessive domestic borrow-
ing, in order to maintain the pace of public investment. This relaxation of
fiscal discipline led to an upsurge in domestic inflation and a depletion of
foreign exchange reserves.
C. Economic Reforms and Performance Since 1977
12.     The Government which came to power in 1977 embarked on a program of
reforms aimed at achieving financial stability, the revival of economic
growth and private sector confidence. Although a number of serious problems
remain, considerable progress has been made towards these objectives, despite
the 1979 oil crisis and political events in Afghanistan which necessitated
substantial outlays for refugee support and defense.
13.     Fiscal policies:   The Government has restored financial disciDline
and the fiscal situation has improved considerably since FY80. The budgets
for FY80 and FY81 both included substantial tax measures. in addition, there
were major increases in the domestic prices of wheat, sugar, fertilizers,
petroleum products, railway fares and water charges, which reduced budgetary
subsidies and the deficits of public sector operations. Despite the
unplanned expenditures following events in Afghanistan and cost overruns on
the Pakistan Steel Mill and Tarbela Dam, tight spending restraints were



-4-
maintained. As a result, the domestic bank financed budget deficit was
reduced from 4.4% of GDP in FY79 to 1% by FY81.
14.     Development planning:  The preparation of a Fifth Five-Year Plan for
FY79-83 marked a resumption of development planning after a lapse of several
years.  The Plan aimed to reorient agricultural policy away from a reliance
on subsidies towards programs to improve efficiency in the use of inputs, in
order to increase yields without an excessive burden on public resources; to
develop domestic energy resources; and to improve basic social services.
These shifts in priorities were to be achieved within an overall 10% p.a.
real increase in public sector investments, based on an assumed real growth
of GDP of 7.5% p.a. and a real increase in national savings of over 12% p.a.
over the Plan period.
15.     These assumptions have proved to be optimistic.  Although performance
in certain areas (such as agricultural production and exports) were as high
as or higher than expected and the rate of growth of GDP averaged over 6%
p.a. between FY78 and FY81 (compared to 3.5% during the earlier part of the
1970s), national savings and external assistance fell well short of expecta-
tions. The proportion of development expenditures financed by net foreign
resources fell from over 70% in FY75 to 37% by FY77 and continued to decline
to less than 25% by FY81. In addition, major cost overruns were experienced
on ongoing projects and the cost of the fertilizer subsidy escalated much
faster than originally estimated. The shortage of resources, combined with
the need to limit overall budgetary deficits, necessitated a cutback in
planned investments and prevented the planned reallocation of public develop-
ment expenditures. Faced with these severe constraints, GOP resolved to
prepare a Three-Year Public Sector Development Program to cover the period
FY82-84 in order to make progress towards implementing the shifts in expendi-
tures originally envisaged under the Fifth Five-Year Plan (see also
paragraphs 38 to 46 below).
16.     Agriculture and water sector policies:  A major government study of
the development of irrigated agriculture in the Indus Basin was completed in
1979; the study was assisted by UNDP with the Bank as executing agency.
Three principal recommendations of this study have been adopted by GOP as the
core of a new agricultural development strategy announced in February 1980,
namely that there should be:
(a) a progressive adjustment of prices of key agricultural
inputs and outputs to reflect real resource costs,
thereby phasing out input subsidies while providing
appropriate incentives for increased production;
(b) a gradual transfer of certain operations from the public
to the private sector, notably the distribution of
agricultural inputs and the exploitation of fresh
groundwater; and



-5-
(c) a reorientation of expenditures to optimize the use of
existing facilities, as against further investment in
major new irrigation works.
17.     In line with this revised strategy, subsidies on pesticides have been
eliminated in the two major provinces (Punjab and Sind) and fertilizer sub-
sidies were reduced by raising fertilizer prices by 50% in February 1980. In
connection with the Fertilizer Imports Credit (Credit No. 1066-PAK dated
October 17, 1980), GOP has undertaken to eliminate fertilizer subsidies by
mid-1985. Irrigation water charges have been increased by 75% over the past
four years. Crop procurement/support prices have been adjusted on several
occasions to maintain incentives for production and an Agricultural Prices
Commission has been established to provide a systematic basis for the con-
tinuing implementation of appropriate pricing policies. The process of
reorienting development expenditures in the agriculture and water sectors was
commenced in the FY81 Annual Development Program and has been carried for-
ward, with increased momentum, in the FY82-84 Public Sector Development
Program.
18.     Industrial policies:  The earlier policies of extensive nationaliza-
tions, tight restrictions on the private sector and rapid expansion of the
public sector have been reversed. A variety of measures have been taken to
revive private activity. Most agricultural procepsing and some industrial
units were denationalized in 1977-78 and constitutional safeguards have been
introduced against further arbitrary government acquisition. The areas open
to private investment have been considerably w:Ldened and a wide range of
incentives have been provided, including tax .holidays, excise and import duty
concessions, easier access to imported raw materials, concessionary credit,
income tax provisions and direct cash rebates. Investment sanctioning proce-
dures have been progressively streamlined. These measures have led to a
steady recovery of private sector confidence as evidenced by the substantial
increase in investment proposals, approvals and commencements in the past
three years; private investment increased by 14% p.a. in real terms between
FY79 and FY81.
19.     Government policy towards public sector industry has been to complete
ongoing projects and to improve the performance of existing public
enterprises. A gradual decentralization of decision-making and delegation of
management responsibility to individual public enterprises have taken place.
The centralized Board of Industrial Management has been abolished and boards
of directors, in some cases with private representatives, have been estab-
lished for each enterprise. Managers of enterprises have been given
increased autonomy to adjust prices in order to improve profitability. By
FY80, there was a marked improvement in public sector performance: produc-
tion increased by 32% in real terms and overall net profits before tax rose
to Rs 590 million compared to only Rs 20 million in FY79.



-6-
20.     Energy sector policies:  As an oil importing country (nearly 90% of
petroleum requirements are met from imports), Pakistan has been seriously
affected by the sharp increases in world petroleum prices in 1973/74 and
again in 1979/80; the import bill for POL products increased from $150 mil-
lion in FY74 to $400 million in FY77 and to over US$1,500 million in FY81,
equivalent to nearly 50% of the f.o.b. value of exports. GOP has passed on
the impact of higher world prices for petroleum to consumers in order to
restrain demand. In addition, it has sought to accelerate the exploration
for new oil and gas resources in Pakistan; joint venture agreements have been
signed with a number of private oil companies for concessions in previously
unexplored areas. The Government has also sought to reduce dependence on oil
imports by developing hydro-electric generating capacity and substituting
other fuels such as natural gas. Pakistan is one of the few developing
countries with an extensive gas distribution network based on domestic sup-
plies, and natural gas accounts for almost 40% of commercial energy use. A
35% increase in gas consumption between 1977 and 1980 helped reduce the
demand for oil imports. However, by 1980 serious shortages of gas had
emerged and it became evident that revised gas pricing and investment
policies were required in addition to measures to increase domestic oil
production from known fields, which had stagnated at around 10,000 bpd.
21.     Overall performance:  Although major problems remain, the economic
reform program implemented by GOP since 1977, together with favorable weather
conditions, has already resulted in a marked improvement in the economy.
Agricultural production has increased substantially and value added in
agriculture rose by an average of 4.2% p.a. between FY77 and FY81, in con-
trast to the earlier sluggish growth averaging 2.1% p.a. from FY72 to FY77.
The recovery in industrial activity and investment by the private sector, the
improvements in the performance of public sector manufacturing enterprises
and the completion of some public sector projects contributed to an average
8.0% p.a. growth in value added in industry over the same period. Conse-
quently, GDP grew by over 6% p.a. over four successive years to FY81, while
exports increased at an average rate of 13% p.a. in constant prices and 27%
p.a. in value terms.
22.     Monetary growth, which had reached 23-25% annually in the mid-1970s,
was reduced to below 15% p.a. by FY81. The Government's effective demand
management, combined with good harvests, held inflation to around 10% p.a.
during FY79 and FY80 and around 12-13% in FY81 despite external pressures and
substantial price increases in some key consumer items as part of GOP's
efforts to rationalize prices. While public consumption has been restrained,
private consumption was boosted by a rapid increase in remittances from
Pakistanis working in the Middle East, so that total consumption increased at
6.4% p.a. from FY77 to FY81, with gross national savings rising from 11% to
13% of GNP.



-7-
23.     Exports have grown slightly faster than imports over recent years
despite the impact on imports of higher petroleum prices, which have con-
tributed to a more than 25% reduction in Pakistan's terms of trade since
1978. However, since the value of imports was more than double the value of
exports in FY77, the trade deficit has continued to widen as shown in Table 1
below. The substantial increase in workers' remittances from the Middle East
has helped to limit the pressure on the balance of payments, so that the
current account deficit has been held approximately constant in nominal terms
and has declined from 6.8% to 3.3% of GNP between FY77 and FY81.

24.     The financing of these balance of payments deficits has continued to
cause difficulties. A serious crisis was avoided in 1979 only by temporary,
severe restrictions on imports and special emergency assistance from some
OPEC countries, as well as substantial short-term commercial borrowing.
However, in response to further improvements in Pakistan's economic manage-
ment and changed geopolitical situation since the invasion of Afghanistan,



-8-
external assistance has increased since FY80; in addition, an 18-month res-
cheduling of debt service due on official concessional loans from bilateral
members of the Pakistan Consortium was agreed in January 1981. Most impor-
tantly, GOP agreed with the IMF on a three-year Extended Fund Facility
program which is to provide SDR 1,268 million (over $1.4 billion) over three
years from November 1980; the contents of this program are discussed in Part
II below. Consequently, the short-term balance of payments situation
improved substantially by FY81.
25.     The balance of payments outlook for FY82 and FY83 is somewhat less
favorable, partly as a result of international economic conditions. World
markets for rice, raw cotton and cotton products are depressed, so that the
volume and average price of these exports are expected to decline. Despite
continued growth of other export items, the value of total exports for FY82
is expected to show little change from FY81. In addition, there has been a
relatively small increase in workers' remittances compared to earlier years.
Although imports are expected to decline in real terms (rising by only 5% in
value) due to the elimination of wheat and sugar imports, the reduction of
fertilizer imports and stable petroleum prices, the current account deficit
for FY82 is expected to widen to about US$1,400 million. GOP has responded
to these difficult conditions by ending the fixed link of the Pakistan Rupee
with the recently appreciating US dollar; from January 1982 to the end of
April 1982 the exchange rate depreciated by 17% against the US dollar.   In
the anticipation of some recovery in the world economy, a revival of export
performance is projected for FY83 and, provided net inflows of assistance do
not fall below expectations, the balance of payments situation should remain
manageable at least up to FY84, though foreign exchange reserves may fall
slightly to a little over the equivalent of one month of imports of goods and
services. However, longer-term projections indicate that serious balance of
payments difficulties could re-emerge after that time unless major structural
changes in the ecoao,ly are brought about.
D. Long-Term Balance of Payments Prospects
26.     The need for further coordinated policy reforms in broad areas of the
economy, aimed at a long-term strengthening of the balance of payments, is
underlined by an analysis of balance of payments prospects during the
remainder of this decade.l/ In order to achieve a modest 3% improvement in
incomes per head, GOP must seek to maintain a 6% p.a. rate of growth of GDP
1/ This section of the report is based on staff projections which are
presented (together with a full description of underlying assumptions)
in "Pakistan: Economic Developments and Prospects" (Report No.
3802-PAK), Chapter V. These projections are broadly consistent with the
Government's medium-term macro-economic objectives (see paragraph 30) and
have been discussed in detail with GOP officials.



-9--
through the 1980s.1/ Bank staff projections indicate that such growth will
place severe strain on the balance of payments from 1984 onwards and will
only be possible if it is based on strong efforts to promote savings and
exports and to limit imports through the promotion of efficient import
replacement, as well as further increases in commitments of external assis-
tance and a continued growth of workers' remittances. The Government agrees
with this assessment and the multi-sectoral program of reforms to support its
request for structural adjustment lending is designed to strengthen the
long-term balance of payments situation.
27.     The long-term projections indicate that, in addition to improving the
savings rate from 13% to 16% of GNP, a sustained growth of exports in the
order of 7-8% p.a. will be required throughout the 1980s while limiting the
growth of imports to around 6% p.a. (i.e., in line with the target growth
rate of GDP). Export growth of this order would be lower than experienced in
recent years, but would be significantly higher than the 4.5% p.a. average
achieved over the whole of the past decade; it would require continuing
improvements in agricultural yields in order to permit growing exports of
cotton and rice, a possible commencement of wheat exports, as well as further
growth of manufactured exports competitive at international prices.
Restraining the growth of imports would require improving self-sufficiency in
agriculture with increased emphasis on the domestic production of edible oil,
together with efficient import replacement in key industries such as fer-
tilizers and a substantial acceleration of domestic oil and gas production.
If these objectives can be attained, and workers' remittances continue to
increase by at least 10% p.a. (in nominal terms), it would be possible to
achieve a progressive reduction of the current account deficit from around 4%
of GNP expected over the next two years to below 3% by the latter part of the
decade.
28.     The financing of these deficits is, nevertheless, likely'to pose
serious problems since the absolute size of the current account deficit is
likely to rise to, and remain in the order of, $2 billion per year. Unless
net inflows of official assistance increase steadily in real terms - which
cannot be safely assumed in present circumstances - a considerable proportion
of Pakistan's capital requirements will need to be financed from commercial
1/ The Government attaches high priority to the reduction of the current 3%
p.a. growth of population and has adopted a new strategy for addressing
this problem which seeks to overcome the shortcomings encountered by past
efforts at family planning. The revised Population Welfare Plan,
approved by the Cabinet in November 1980, is based on a multi-sector
approach which recognizes that a reduction in fertility rates requires
fundamental changes in attitudes as well as improved delivery of serv-
ices.  GOP has sought the Bank's assistance in implementing this Plan and
a Population Welfare Project is being appraised.

sources. Commercial borrowing is expected to be needed in increasing amounts
from FY84 onwards, rising gradually to provide up to 50% of gross capital
inflows, or over $1 billion per year. Staff projections indicate that,
provided sound policies are followed to strengthen the balance of payments,
such increasing amounts of borrowing on commercial terms could be undertaken
while keeping the ratio of debt service to the exports of goods and services
(including factor services) below 20% throughout the 1980s. However, given
Pakistan's presently very limited access to international capital markets, it
will not be easy to obtain such large amounts of finance. Over the past two
years Pakistan has been able to obtain substantial short-term borrowings on
gradually improved terms, but it still faces the task of establishing credit-
worthiness for longer-term borrowing from private capital markets. In this
situation, the vigorous pursuit of further structural reform of the economy
will not only help to keep the external financial requirements of sustained
growth to manageable proportions but will also serve to improve Pakistan's
ability to obtain the necessary finance on acceptable terms.
PART II - STRUCTURAL ISSUES AND THE GOVERNMENT'S
REFORM PROGRAM
29.     Following the re-establishment of economic stability and a marked
improvement in performance, GOP has moved purposefully towards implementing
structural reforms designed to turn the recent recovery into a period of
sustained growth through the 1980s. Over the past 18-24 months, there has
been an intensive and fruitful dialogue between GOP officials and Bank as
well as IMF staff on necessary reform measures to support access to the IMF's
Extended Fund Facility and the proposed first phase of a program of struc-
tural adjustment lending. Bank staff participated in drawing up the sectoral
policy measures of the EFF program; the SAL program is designed to reinforce
and build on those initiatives.
30.     The Government's medium-term economic objectives are to improve
productivity, domestic resource mobilization and growth together with the
promotion of exports, efficient import substitution and liberalized access to
imports. The macro-economic targets for the Sixth Five-Year Plan period
(FY84-88) have been tentatively set as follows:
(a) GDP is to grow at 6.5% p.a. with growth rates of 5% p.a. and 10%
p.a. set for agriculture and manufacturing, respectively;
(b) Gross national savings are to be increased from the current 13%
to 16% of GNP by means of additional taxation measures, reduc-
tions in subsidies and internal profit generation by public
enterprises through the pursuit of flexible pricing policies;
(c) An increase in the share of investment to GNP from the present
16% is to be promoted to the maximum extent consistent with



-1 1-
improvements in savings and trade performance. The proportion
of private to total investment is to be increased from around
one third to 50%;
(d) Domestic credit expansion is to be kept in line with the nominal
growth of GNP in order to help reduce and keep the inflation
rate around or below 10% p.a.;
(e) Fiscal deficits financed from the domestic monetary system are
to be kept around 2%; and
(f) The current account deficit or the balance of payments is to be
gradually reduced from around 4% to 2.5% of GNP by FY88.
31.     The proposed SAL program reflects the Government's recognition of the
need for an integrated package of reforms covering several important sectors
in order to help achieve these economic objectives. The program would follow
up and carry forward a number of critical actions already initiated by GOP in
the fields of development planning, agriculture and water, energy and
industry. In some cases, these actions would be supported by studies and
other activities to be financed by a proposed IDA Technical Assistance
Project; documents for this Credit are being circulated separately to the
Executive Directors for their consideration. The principal aspects of the
SAL program are as follows:
(a) As noted in Part I above, GOP has drawn up a revised Three-Year
Public Sector Development Program for FY82-84 to achieve a
redirection in the pattern of public investments. This program
represents a major first step in the reorientation of government
expenditures. The FY82-84 program is to be "rolled over" to
cover FY83-85 to continue this process and will be followed by
the preparation and implementation of the Sixth Five-Year Plan
(FY84-88);
(b) Further steps will be taken towards the implementation of GOP's
revised National Agricultural Policy by (i) adjusting agricul-
tural input and output prices to provide appropriate production
incentives while reducing subsidies, guided by recommendations
from the newly established Agricultural Prices Commission;
(ii) the rehabilitation and improved operation and maintenance
of the existing irrigation system, financed to an increasing
extent through user charges; (iii) the preparation of new
high-priority projects and programs in line with the new policy
directions; and (iv) a progressive diversification of agricul-
ture;
(c) GOP will implement recently adopted major reforms to its energy
policies, particularly in the oil and gas sectors. Producer and



-12-
consumer gas pricing policies have been revised; the public
sector Oil and Gas Development Corporation is being reorganized
along more commercial lines; and a better balance is being
sought between the respective roles of the public and private
sectors in developing Pakistan's hydrocarbon potential. A
long-term energy plan is to be drawn up in order to integrate
the development of all potential energy sources over a 10-year
planning horizon; and
(d) In addition to continuing import liberalization under the EFF
program and other ongoing measures to revitalize industry, with
particular emphasis on private sector involvement, GOP will
implement a program of policy analysis and preliminary actions
to rationalize industrial incentives and initiate a systematic
performance evaluation and incentive system for public manufac-
turing industries. This is designed to lead up to a comprehen-
sive program of industrial reforms which could be supported by a
second round of structural adjustment lending to Pakistan.
32.     Since the EFF and the proposed SAL programs complement and reinforce
each other, a detailed description of the SAL program is preceded below by a
brief outline of the salient features of the program agreed with the IMF.
A. The Extended Fund Facility (EFF) Program
33.     The EFF program sets out the agreed macro-economic framework for the
Government's overall reform efforts for the three years from November 1980 to
November 1983. The program's objectives include a 5-6% p.a. real growth in
GDP, an increase in investment from 16.5% to 17.3% of GNP and an increase in
the savings ratio from 12% to 14% of GNP, while limiting domestic inflation
to an average rate of 10% p.a. and the balance of payments current account
deficit to about 4.0% of GNP during the last two years of the program.
34.     A continuation of GOP's stabilization policies to bring about a
reduction in the size of budgetary deficits and the rate of growth of the
money supply forms the demand side of the EFF program. To attain these
objectives, the program calls for continued expenditure restraint, including
an undertaking to reduce subsidies in real terms, and improved revenue per-
formance to limit government recourse to domestic bank financing. To assist
in restraining price increases to an average of 10% p.a., the average rate of
growth of domestic liquidity is to be limited to 14-15% p.a., slightly below
the projected increase in nominal GDP. To reserve adequate credit for
private financing within these overall ceilings, fiscal deficits and domestic
borrowing by public enterprises are to be curtailed; net bank credit to
Government (for both budgetary and commodity operations) is to be held to an
average of about 2% of GDP for FY81-83. GOP has adhered closely to these
targets. The first year of the program has been completed, objectives for
the second year have been agreed and detailed targets for the third year will



-13-
be finalized during 1982. As indicated in paragraph 30 above, GOP's
longer-term economic targets to FY88 are broadly consistent with, and in
several cases are more ambitious than, the parameters which have been agreed
for the 1980-83 period.
35.     The EFF program supports a phased program of import liberalization to
reform Pakistan's restrictive import policy under which all items not
explicitly on a free list or tied list (i.e., tied to purchases from specific
sources) are implicitly banned. By the end of the program, the number of
banned items are to be sharply reduced, bans replaced by tariffs where
appropriate, and the transition from a "positive list" (permitted imports) to
a "negative list" (prohibited imports) completed. Temporary quantitative
ceilings on importable items, imposed during the period of acute foreign
exchange shortage in 1979, were all lifted by December 1980. At the same
time, virtually all previously prohibited basic raw materials were added to
the list of permitted items and a number of commodities (including cement),
previously only importable by the public sector, were permitted to be
imported by the private sector. In July 1981, 212 previously banned items
were added to the free list, 36 items were transferred from the tied list to
the free list and more items on the free list permitted for import by the
private sector. The liberalization process will be continued so that the
present proportion of industry protected by bans or restrictions
(approximately two thirds) will be reduced by at least 40% by the end of the
program period.
36.     UJntil the end of 1981, the exchange rate of the Pakistan rupee had
been fixed since 1973 at Rs 9.9/US$1. As noted in paragraph 25 above, fol-
lowing indications that exports had been adversely affected by the relative
strength of the US$ over the previous 18 months, the rupee was delinked from
the US$ in January 1982. Its value is now being fixed daily by the State
Bank of Pakistan with reference to a basket of currencies of Pakistan's major
trading partners. Under these new arrangements, the Pakistan authorities
intend to manage the exchange rate in a flexible manner to help maintain
export competitiveness in world markets. The exchange rate adjustments up to
the end of April 1982 represented an 11% devaluation against a basket of
currencies of major trading partners. In order to stimulate exports, GOP has
also progressively extended the range of standard rebates of import and
excise duties on imported inputs; provided for rebates of income taxes on
profits from exports; and reduced minimum pricing and other restrictions on
export transactions. An Export Processing Zone is being developed outside
Karachi.
37.     The EFF program also includes a number of sectoral reform measures
including undertakings to reform pricing and other incentives. These were
included in the program after close consultation with the Bank and are con-
sistent with the further reforms to be pursued under the proposed SAL
program; they are discussed under appropriate sector headings (see also the
tabular presentation of the Government's reform program on pages 32-36).



-14-
B. The Proposed SAL Program
I. Development Planning
38.     Since 1977, GOP has placed high priority on reviving and strengthen-
ing the planning system. However, in its efforts to restore forward plan-
ning, the Government has faced serious difficulties owing to unanticipated
shortfalls in available resources, the absorption of resources to complete
large, long-gestation projects, and the reduced capacity of the planning
agency due to the loss of key personnel. As already noted, such shortfalls
in resources, coupled with the need to maintain fiscal balance, led to a
decline in public real investment during the first two years of the Fifth
Plan (FY79-83) and prevented the intended shift of resources toward
high-priority projects in agriculture, water, energy and the social sectors.
Since that time, increased aid commitments, debt relief and the EFF arrange-
ments, coupled with improved public savings, have increased the availability
of resources and provided a basis for a reassessment of the public sector
development program over the medium-term. GOP has responded positively to
this opportunity and, following discussions with Fund and Bank staff, a
revised Public Sector Development Program was drawn up for FY82 to FY84 to
reorient public expenditures in the direction intended in the Fifth Plan.
39.     The revised Three-Year Program is set within the macro-economic
framework of the EFF program and is consistent with a cautious estimate of
domestic and foreign resources available to finance public sector development
expenditures. The expected growth of development expenditures under the
Federal and Provincial Annual Development Programs for those years and the
proposed financing plan are shown in Table 2.

40.     Total development expenditures over the three years are projected to
increase at 9.4% p.a., thus remaining approximately constant in real terms.
After a large increase in foreign inflows in FY82 following increased aid
commitments in 1980 and 1981, foreign inflows available for financing
development expenditures are assumed to decline, so that the proportion of
total development expenditure financed by net foreign inflows would decline
once again to below 25% in contrast to the much higher proportions financed
by external assistance during much of the 1970s. Recurrent expenditures and



-16-
government revenues are assumed to grow approximately in line with GDP, so
that the current budget surplus expands in real terms to finance a gradually
greater share of the total development program. As a consequence, government
borrowing from the banking system is expected to remain below 2% of GDP. The
increase in revenue which is assumed to result from additional measures
appears to be manageable over the three-year period while the assumptions
regarding foreign economic assistance may prove to be conservative. Thus,
projected expenditures appear to be adequately covered by a realistic
estimate of prospective available resources.
41.     Although the total Public Sector Development Program is expected to
remain constant in real terms over the next three years, a major shift in
allocations towards the agriculture, water, energy and social sectors is to
be accomplished through the planned decline in expenditures on the fertilizer
subsidy and on public sector industry which are to decline sharply in nominal
terms and as a share of total expenditures; this major, structural shift in
priorities is clearly illustrated in Table 3. Because a substantial part of
the development program in agriculture and in the social sectors is a provin-
cial responsibility, provincial expenditures are to be expanded much more
rapidly than federal and their share in total development expenditures is to
grow from 18% to 24% between FY81 and FY84.

42.     The direction of investments in the agriculture and water sectors are
in line with the 1980 National Agricultural Policy Statement and form an
important part of GOP's policies to improve productivity in the vital
agricultural sector. These investments are described in more detail in
paragraphs 51 to 56 below.
43.     Consistent with the Government's objective of reducing the role of
the public sector in manufacturing, development expenditures on industry are
expected to fall from Rs 4 billion to Rs 1.4 billion or from 15.3% to 4.1% of
total allocations during FY81-84. About 80% of the allocation to industry
will be for the Pakistan Steel Mill expected to be completed in FY84. Most
of the remaining expenditures are for the completion of other ongoing
projects, mainly in cement, metal works and chemicals. Upon completion of
the ongoing projects, public enterprises will be expected to meet their
investment requirements through self-financing or through foreign and domes-
tic borrowing.
44.     In response to the rapid rise in international energy prices, GOP is
planning for major increases in expenditures on the development of domestic
energy resources. Expenditures on the power and fuel sectors are to increase
at an average rate of 23% p.a. and 14% p.a., respectively, over the
three-year period. Of the total allocation of Rs 16 billion for the power
sector, Rs 6 billion is for generation, Rs 7 billion for transmission and Rs
3 billion for additional distribution facilities in order to achieve balanced
power development. A rural electrification program to provide electricity to
nearly 4,000 additional villages will also provide infrastructure for private
tubewell development. The allocation to the fuel sector includes further
exploration and development work by the Oil and Gas Development Corporation
(OGDC), improvements in the gas transmission network, and the Government's
participation in joint ventures with private petroleum companies. The
revised development program in oil, gas and power forms part of a broader set
of energy sector initiatives described in paragraphs 64 to 78 below.
45.     The share of expenditures on transport and communications is to
increase slightly from 18% to 20% of total annual developnent expenditures
over the three-year period. Emphasis is to be placed on the completion of
ongoing schemes (the most important of which is Phase I of Port Qasim) by
FY84 and the rehabilitation and capacity improvements of existing road and
rail networks. Investment in telephones and telegraph is intended to augment
capacity to cope with an anticipated 14% annual growth in traffic.
46.    W4hile GOP's immediate attention has been focused on the productive
sectors, the FY82-84 program also marks a shift in resources towards the
social sectors which have been seriously neglected in the past. The educa-
tion program emphasizes the primary and secondary levels and vocational
training. The health program continues to accord high priority to the con-
struction of rural health facilities and training of paramedical personnel.



-18-
Higher allocations are also included to support an intensified population
planning effort.
47.     GOP is following up the FY82-84 Public Sector Development Program by
the preparation of a similar program for FY83-85. This program, which will
be extended to cover major public enterprise investments financed outside the
budget, will provide a further opportunity to reorient investments toward the
priority sectors. The FY83-85 program will be reviewed with Bank staff in
October/November 1982. These three-year public sector development programs
are designed to provide an effective linkage between the longer-term perspec-
tives of Pakistan's Five-Year Plans and the financing decisions reflected in
the annual development programs which are approved as part of the budget
cycle. Through a process of timely review, GOP intends to ensure that the
implementation of public sector development projects remains closely in line
with the objectives of longer-term plans, while keeping total outlays in line
with available resources and shorter-term economic stabilization policies.
48.     A Sixth Five-Year Plan, covering FY84 to FY88 and retaining the basic
objectives of the agreed structural reform program, is currently being
prepared. The Sixth Plan will provide a longer-term perspective for develop-
ment, specifying macro-economic targets (set out in paragraph 30 above),
identifying supporting sectoral policies, and outlining strategies and
investment programs for the key sectors. For the first two years of the
Sixth Plan, the phasing of public investment expenditures will be consistent
with the FY83-85 Three-Year Development Program. A mid-Plan review will be
conducted at the end of FY85 to assess progress toward targets, evaluate
available resources and adjust expenditures as necessary for the remainder of
the period. In this way, GOP will retain the flexibility to adjust to such
factors as fluctuations in international commodity prices, migrant remittan-
ces and the availability of external assistance, while avoiding the major
disruptions which marked the implementation of the Fifth Five-Year Plan.
49.     The revival of development planning in Pakistan has been accompanied
by the revitalization and strengthening of the Government's planning
capability. A highly regarded and experienced economist has recently been
appointed to the previously vacant, key position of Deputy Chairman of the
Planning Commission, with the Finance Minister taking up the position of
Chairman. More high-level staff are expected to be appointed shortly and
various forms of technical assistance are being sought. In addition, GOP has
taken steps to safeguard planned priorities by requiring the active involve-
ment of the Planning Commission at all stages of the project selection
process. The project selection and approval process, which was reviewed by
the Bank during the preparation of the proposed SAL, is designed to ensure
that all projects included in the program are evaluated to check their con-
sistency with government priorities and objectives and meet appropriate tests
of economic efficiency. Finally, the central monitoring of project implemen-
tation is also being strengthened by an expansion in the number and
capability of the project monitoring staff of the planning organization.

II. The Agriculture and Water Sectors
50.     As outlined in Part I, GOP has revised its agriculture and water
sector policies following in-depth studies and dialogue with Bank staff.
The Government's medium-term action program is directed toward the rapid
implementation of the 1980 National Agricultural Policy through: (a) the
reorientation of public expenditure programs in the agriculture and water
sectors, particularly towards the more efficient use and maintenance of
existing facilities; (b) continued adjustments of prices and other charges to
reduce subsidies and to provide incentives for increasing the productivity of
land and other key inputs; and (c) a progressive diversification of agricul-
ture.
51.     Reorientation of public expenditures: Past investments in the
agriculture and water sectors have created a substantial infrastructure,
giving Pakistan the potential to manage its water supplies to meet crop
requirements and to increase crop yields substantially. Carefully targeted
expenditures are now required to exploit this potential by improving the
efficiency of the irrigation system.
52.     It has been estimated that, at present, more than one-half the gross
inflow of water into the irrigation system is lost through seepage and per-
colation. These losses have reduced crop production and, together with low
utilization rates of public tubewells, have contributed to a serious drainage
problem; in about 60% of the Indus Basin the water table is within 10 feet of
the land surface. Investments such as watercourse improvements and canal
rehabilitation not only promise high returns but would also reduce the need
for investments in drainage.
53.     The importance of such investments in irrigation has been recognized
by GOP and the revised Three-Year Public Sector Development Program provides
for a shift of public expenditures in the water sector towards:
(a) the rehabilitation and adequate operation and maintenance of the
irrigation system;
(b) improving water conservation through the implementation of minor
works, primarily below the canal outlet, such as watercourse and
on-farm improvements, which together with more optimal water
scheduling would permit available irrigation water supplies to
be used more efficiently;
(c) enhancing water supplies while reducing public sector expendi-
tures through promotion of private tubewell development in
usable groundwater areas (including areas now under public
tubewells); and



-20-
(d) necessary drainage in waterlogged and saline areas to complement
the existing surface distribution and tubewell system.
54.     Within the agriculture sector, the pattern of expenditures planned
for FY82-84 indicates a marked shift from the past emphasis on fertilizer
subsidies towards a more balanced development program which provides for
increased expenditures on foodgrain storage, rural roads, agricultural
research, extension services (through the training and visit system and
extensive use of radio broadcasts), increased production of quality seeds,
improved credit facilities and other essential complementary activities.
55.     As Table 4 shows, while the proportion of total development expendi-
tures devoted to agriculture and water is to remain roughly constant at
27-28% during the three years to FY84, a substantial shift of resources is to
take place within each sector. In agriculture, the share devoted to the
fertilizer subsidy is to fall from 9.2% to 2.9% of total development expendi-
tures, with the share allocated to agricultural investment rising from 5.3%
to 9.2% of the total; since the major thrust of the agricultural program is
in areas that are provincial responsibilities, the provincial share would
rise much more rapidly than the federal. Federal allocations to the water
sector (excluding Tarbela) are to be sharply increased, as shown, with the
proportion of allocations to drainage and reclamation rising from 40% of the
total in FY81 to 50% in FY84.

56.     These shifts in expenditures will be reviewed and carried further
during the preparation of the FY83-85 and subsequent public sector develop-
ment programs. This continued reorientation of investment programs in
agriculture and water will be aided by the preparation of further
high-priority projects in these sectors including: (a) projects to give
effect to GOP's "SCARP Transition Program," designed to promote private
tubewell development in usable groundwater areas through investments in rural
electrification, supervised credit schemes and other measures. Wherever



-22-
practicable, GOP intends to phase out and/or divest public tubewells to the
private sector in order to reduce the heavy budgetary cost of operation and
maintenance; (b) drainage projects in saline areas; (c) projects to improve
the efficiency of water use in selected canal command areas; and
(d) complementary agricultural projects. This major project preparation
effort, which is to take place over the next 18-24 months, would be supported
by the proposed IDA Technical Assistance Project and by a UNDP technical
assistance project for which the Bank is executing agency.
57.     In addition to the reorientation of development expenditures, the
Government's program also provides for additional spending on the operation
and maintenance of the canal system and public tubewells to prevent further
deterioration of existing facilities and to reduce the extent of waterlog-
ging. GOP has recognized that Provincial Governments face severe constraints
in financing such expenditures and a special allocation of Rs 150 million was
made in the FY82 Federal Budget to enhance the funds available to the provin-
ces for canal maintenance. GOP has undertaken to increase budgetary alloca-
tions for canal maintenance substantially in real terms during the coming
years in order to meet the requirements (as estimated in consultation with
the Bank) for the operation and maintenance of the surface irrigation system
by FY85. In the short term, GOP also intends to increase allocations con-
siderably to meet the full requirements for the operation and maintenance of
existing public tubewells. In the medium to long term, as noted in paragraph
56 above, emphasis will be placed on the promotion of private investment in
subsurface irrigation in order to reduce the necessity for public sector
involvement in this area.
58.     To help finance these enhanced operation and maintenance expenditures
for irrigation, water charges and/or other levies on the supply of irrigation
and drainage services will be increased. Since, according to Bank estimates,
expenditures on the surface irrigation system alone would need to be doubled
to raise maintenance standards to the agreed satisfactory levels, an increase
in user charges to cover all operation and maintenance outlays must neces-
sarily be phased. GOP has already increased water charges by 25% per year in
three of the last four years and intends to increase charges further (at
intervals of not more than two years, subject to any necessary legislative
approval) or make other appropriate financing arrangements to achieve full
cost recovery in accordance with final deadlines for various provinces as
agreed with the Association.l/
1/ A number of these undertakings concerning increased expenditures on the
operation and maintenance of the irrigation system and periodic increases
in water charges reflect agreements concluded with the Federal and
Provincial Governments in connection with the Irrigation Systems
Rehabilitation Project which was approved by the Executive Directors on
May 4, 1982.



-23-
59.     Agricultural pricing policies:  The Government intends to continue
its policy of periodic adjustments to agricultural input/output prices in
order to align them with long-term trends in international prices and to
provide appropriate incentives to producers while reducing input subsidies to
release resources for other high-priority expenditures. The 50% increase in
fertilizer prices in February 1980 reversed the previous rapid escalation in
the subsidy bill; in the absence of such price increases the fertilizer
subsidy would have reached US$375 million in FY80, whereas it was contained
to US$250 million in FY81 and is estimated at US$200 million in FY82.
60.     Further fertilizer price increases averaging around 10% were
announced in March 1982, with relatively larger increases imposed on
nitrogenous fertilizers. The Government intends to make further adjustments
in order to meet the targets for reducing the subsidy set in the FY82-84
Public Sector Development Program, as well as to reach its objective of
eliminating the subsidy by mid-1985 as agreed under the 1980 Fertilizer
Imports Credit. Remaining pesticide subsidies are to be eliminated by 1983.
Present domestic farmgate prices for agricultural produce are generally below
world prices, so that it will be possible to compensate farmers for increased
costs resulting from the gradual removal of the fertilizer subsidy in the
short term. In the longer run, a continuing policy of incentive crop prices
together with reduced input subsidies will need to be accompanied by a
gradual improvement of yields and crop diversification. These objectives are
being pursued through the extension, research, water management and other
programs included in the FY82-84 Development Program.
61.     In view of the complexities of input/output price relationships in
the agricultural sector, the Government has determined that the recently
established Agricultural Prices Commission (APC) will play a central role in
guiding future pricing decisions. The APC's terms of reference, drawn up in
consultation with the Bank, direct APC to provide consistent and timely
recommendations on appropriate input and output prices, based on scientific
analysis of farm-level data and the effects of prices on productivity, con-
sumers, and the international competitiveness of Pakistan's agricultural
produce. The Commission is to be adequately staffed by June 1982 and its
initial work program, based on an outline agreed with the Bank, will be
directed toward designing a system for the collection of farm-level data;
initiating and assisting the collection of information on international
prices and production of Pakistan's major crops; and developing methods of
measuring the impact of price recommendations on consumers' and farmers' real
incomes. This work program is to lead to the development of a methodology
for preparing price recommendations (with supporting analysis) on a timely
basis. Assistance in these areas would be provided under the proposed Tech-
nical Assistance Project.
62.     Diversification of agriculture:  GOP's 1980 National Agricultural
Policy stresses the importance of a balanced emphasis on all aspects of
agriculture, including livestock, fisheries and new crops in addition to the



-24-
four existing major crops of wheat, rice, cotton and sugarcane. The most
intensive effort toward diversification in the immediate future will be to
increase the domestic supply of oilseeds. Since the present supply of edible
oil is mostly a by-product of cotton production and specialized oilseed crops
are not grown on an extensive scale, domestic production has not been able to
increase in step with the rapid growth of consumer demand and the import bill
has risen rapidly to US$300 million a year.
63.     To remedy this situation, the Government has created a high-level
Oilseed Development Board to advise on both the agricultural and processing
aspects of increasing oilseeds and edible oil production. An oilseed
development plan has been drawn up to promote a rapid expansion in acreage
for three non-traditional oilseeds (sunflowers, soyabeans and safflower) with
supporting pricing and input supply programs for increasing crop yields; a
gradual improvement in the yields of the traditional oilseeds (rape and
mustard); and improved extraction techniques. A substantial expansion in
acreage (from 11,000 to 85,000 acres) under non-traditional oilseeds is
planned over the next three years. For the traditional oilseeds, the prin-
cipal effort is to be made through the extension system and an annual 5%
increase in yields has been targeted. Technical assistance has been provided
by UNDP/FAO and is expected from USAID. To improve the extraction rate, a
program to rehabilitate oil extraction plants is being planned with assis-
tance from UNDP/FAO.
III. The Energy Sector
64.     Pakistan possesses a range of alternative commercial as well as
traditional energy sources. There is considerable scope for further develop-
ment of each of these sources. Of the estimated potential of 10,000 MW which
could be economically generated from hydro-electricity, about 20% has so far
been harnessed; there has been no significant use of coal for thermal power
generation to date; and there are sizable known reserves of natural gas, and
reasonably good prospects for discoveries of additional commercial oil and
gas fields. Since large capital requirements and long lead times are needed
to increase the available supply of energy from non-petroleum sources, GOP's
short-term response to the increased cost of imported energy is focused on
the accelerated development of Pakistan's oil and gas potential. Over the
longer term, a coordinated development of economically efficient alternative
domestic energy sources is to be promoted.
65.     In order to reverse a trend of increasing petroleum imports and avert
the prospect of an increasingly serious shortage of natural gas supplies, GOP
has recently revised its previous approach to setting producer prices of
domestic crude oil and natural gas; taken steps to devise a realistic gas
supply development strategy; and initiated institutional and managerial
reforms of the public sector Oil and Gas Development Corporation (OGDC). In
addition, GOP has recognized the need for a stepped-up effort in petroleum
exploration and is endeavoring to promote the role of private companies in



-25-
this effort. These policy developments are taking place under the
strengthened leadership of the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Resources
within an overall policy framework determined by a high-level National Energy
Policy Committee (chaired by the Minister for Finance) which was established
in 1980. A special committee chaired by the Governor of the State Bank was
set up in June 1981 to resolve a number of urgent pricing issues in the oil
and gas sectors and agreements have already been reached with private
producers which will lead to substantially increased investments.
66.     Crude oil production and exploration:  The first important step in
GOP's recent efforts to improve domestic oil production has been to
renegotiate the pricing and production agreement with the major existing
private producer, Pakistan Oilfields Limited (POL). Under the terms of a
1978 agreement with POL, output from the company's Meyal field was to expand
from 9,000 to 17,000 barrels per day by 1983. The well-head price of crude
oil was set at Rs 44 per barrel, which at that time was judged to be adequate
to cover expected production and investment costs over the five years and
yield an adequate rate of return to the producer. However, drilling costs
turned out to be considerably higher than originally expected, while produc-
tion per well was below estimates. In view of these developments, a new
pricing formula has recently been agreed between GOP and POL under which the
price of crude oil produced from new wells at Meyal will be substantially
increased to 30% of the import parity price.
67.     This new arrangement has a number of important advantages over the
previous fixed average price. Firstly, the new arrangements recognize the
considerably higher marginal cost of additional, as compared to existing,
production and provide a positive incentive for the continuation of drilling
at the Meyal field. Secondly, the new approach contains an explicit linkage
to the economic value of the product rather than merely to expected costs;
under the new arrangements, there will be an automatic incentive for an
accelerated development program if the world price of oil were to increase
further. This arrangement is expected to provide sufficient funds to com-
plete an agreed development program of eight additional wells by 1987 in
order to achieve the originally planned increase in the rate of production.
GOP has indicated to the Bank that the well-head price will be kept under
review to ensure that an adequate incentive is maintained for additional
economic investments (for example, in secondary recovery).
68.     GOP is also taking steps to improve operations at the Toot field,
which is being developed by OGDC with assistance from IDA and other donors
(Credit No. 867-PAK of January 12, 1979). Although performance at Toot has
recently improved, the pace of drilling and production has been well below
original expectations due to a number of factors including technical dif-
ficulties (in part due to complex geology), the loss of skilled personnel to
the private sector and to oil companies in the Middle East, and deficiencies
in the management structure of OGDC. These problems are being addressed in
the short term by the recruitment of a team of experts to assist OGDC. In



-26-
the medium term, there is to be a progressive reorganization of OGDC along
more commercial lines (see paragraph 76).
69.      Since 1976 GOP has signed a number of joint venture exploration
agreements with private oil companies for concessions in previously unex-
plored areas. Under these agreements the price for "new oil" from any dis-
coveries in these concession areas would be linked to international prices
(the domestic well-head price would be reduced by a 12.5% royalty and a
negotiated domestic price differential in the range of 10-12.5%) and the
maximum share of profits accruing to the Government has been fixed in these
agreements at 50-55%. The agreements also provide for OGDC to participate up
to an agreed share in the development of any commercial discovery. The terms
of these agreements are consistent with accepted international petroleum
industry practice and provide a strong incentive for exploration in Pakistan.
Seven exploratory wells were drilled in FY81 and a further eight are due to
be drilled in FY82. One small commercial discovery has resulted so far from
these efforts.
70.     Although the present pace of exploration is a significant improvement
over the early 1970s, it remains low relative to Pakistan's hydrocarbon
potential. A principal reason for this is that some of the more obviously
promising structures are held under license by OGDC, which because of its
financial and technical limitations can only sustain a modest exploration
effort. In order to step up the pace of exploration of OGDC-held areas, the
Government has recently decided to invite private sector participation in
exploring these prospects, either through joint ventures or through contracts
for exploratory drilling by private companies. GOP intends to negotiate
appropriate terms for participation in the development of 10 to 15 structures
to supplement OGDC's own exploration efforts and some of these negotiations
should be completed during 1982. GOP has also requested assistance from the
Bank for geological and geophysical studies to identify additional prospec-
tive structures.
71.     Natural gas production and pricing:  Although the Government's suc-
cessful promotion of the use of natural gas has dampened the adverse effect
of rising world energy prices on Pakistan's economy, shortages of gas have
emerged since the end of 1980 due to lack of effective forward planning. An
in-depth study of Pakistan's gas supply/demand situation commissioned by GOP
in 1981 indicates that the current need for load-shedding during the peak
periods of demand in winter will become increasingly serious and that, unless
substantial investment in increasing gas production takes place, a supply gap
of up to 40% of total demand could open up by the mid-1980s.
72.     The supply/demand study (carried out by foreign consultants and
funded under the Bank's Project Preparation Facility) has also confirmed that
substantial, economically recoverable reserves of gas exist in Pakistan.
However, the extremely low producer gas prices set by GOP in the past have
discouraged needed investment in the sector. Up to the end of 1981 the



-27-
well-head price for gas from the principal field at Sui was Rs 0.74 per
thousand cubic feet (mcf), while gas from the Mari field was priced at around
Rs 1.10 per mcf; these well-head prices are under 3% of the current cost of
the equivalent energy which can be derived from fuel oil, although fuel oil
is currently being substituted for natural gas in thermal power generation
during periods of peak demand. GOP has recognized the need for a substantial
revision of its approach to gas producer prices, and a new pricing policy has
been developed to facilitate the implementation of a strategy to close the
presently widening supply-demand gap. Agreement was reached in February 1982
for additional investments of over $150 million over the next 2-3 years to
maintain the current rate of production from the Sui field by means of addi-
tional drilling and field compression. Subject to further detailed reservoir
studies, the gas development strategy may also include:
(a) subsequent additional drilling to increase the
sustainable rate of production from the Sui field;
(b) doubling of production from the Mari field; and
(c) development of new gas fields at Pirkoh and
Khandkot.
73.     The revised pricing arrangements for the above investments are to
reflect the ownership and characteristics of each field. For the Pirkoh
field, which is to be developed by a wholly owned subsidiary of OGDC with
assistance from the Asian Development Bank, the well-head price will be
adjusted periodically to ensure a 12% discounted cash flow after-tax rate of
return on investments. For investments at Sui (which is 70% privately
owned), the recently agreed pricing arrangements for the investments required
to maintain the current rate of production are designed to provide a substan-
tial share of investment requirements through internal cash generation; the
average well-head price for all production will be adjusted annually in order
to generate a negotiated rate of return to share capital, after allowing for
production and development costs, taxation, debt service and an agreed rate
of accumulation of reserves for future re-investment. On this basis the
well-head price for Sui gas for 1982 is set at over Rs 3 per mcf.
74.     With respect to investments to generate additional gas supplies from
any other source, GOP has adopted a general pricing policy which represents a
major departure from its traditional cost-plus or fixed rate-of-return
approach. In each case, a "base price" would be negotiated to yield an
agreed discounted cash flow real rate of return on the total estimated costs
of the proposed development project and this "base price" would be indexed to
world oil prices. In each case, the rates of return would be negotiated
taking into account the different risks applying to various proposed develop-
ments. In cases where the costs of development remain subject to con-
siderable uncertainty at the time of initial negotiations (e.g., because
substantial further exploration or appraisal is required), the base price may



-28-
be subject to review at a pre-determined point in the development schedule,
once the scope and costs of the project have been more precisely defined.
Negotiations on the above basis have been commenced with the private
operators of the Mari and Khandkot fields. Progress towards implementing an
adequate gas supply strategy on the basis of this revised approach to pricing
will be reviewed jointly by the Bank and GOP in October/November 1982.
75.     In order to encourage conservation, the average prices of petroleum
products to consumers have been increased so as to remain in line with rising
international petroleum prices over the past few years and the Government
intends to continue this policy of promptly passing on cost increases to
final users. In contrast, gas consumer/user prices were naintained at
extremely low levels, in order to encourage the substitution of gas for oil
consumption and to counterbalance other domestic inflationary pressures. Up
to the end of 1981, the average consumer price of natural gas was about Rs 10
per mcf, well above the present average cost of domestic gas production and
distribution but only around 25% of the value of the fuel oil energy equiv-
alent. However, the time when one large low-cost field (Sui) could meet
Pakistan's increasing gas requirements is now over, and the marginal costs of
additional gas supplies are likely to be considerably higher. In addition,
with gas consumption increasing rapidly and serious gas shortages emerging,
the need to limit the growth of demand and to encourage conservation has been
underlined. The Government has accordingly adopted a policy not only to pass
on any increases in producer prices resulting from revised well-head pricing
arrangements but also to achieve a gradual rationalization of user prices for
all alternative sources of energy, while avoiding undue inflationary shocks
to the economy. An initial average increase in gas consumer prices of
approximately 20% was implemented effective January 1, 1982, and the Govern-
ment intends to implement further phased increases so that the average price
of natural gas to consumers would reach two-thirds of the value of equivalent
energy derived from fuel oil by FY88. The Government will review the gas
pricing situation annually and take necessary action to maintain adequate
progress towards these objectives.
76.     Reorganization of OGDC:  GOP has commenced the implementation of a
program to reorganize OGDC to correct existing deficiencies in its management
structure and operating efficiency following a recently completed management
study which recommended the restructuring of OGDC along commercial lines,
including the setting up of independent operating companies to undertake the
development of individual fields. In recent months, salaries for key OGDC
staff have been increased and there has been an increasing delegation of
authority to field development teams. As noted above, an independent company
for the development of the Pirkoh gas field is being formed as a wholly owned
subsidiary of OGDC. GOP has approached private companies as a first step to
negotiating a joint venture agreement for the development of the Dhodak
gas/condensate field. GOP is also investigating the feasibility of setting
up a separate independent drilling subsidiary of OGDC which would assume the
management of four modern rigs currently owned by OGDC and contract drilling



-29-
services to other segments or subsidiaries of OGDC as well as to private
companies undertaking exploration and development work in Pakistan.
77.     Energy sector planning:  On the instructions of the National Energy
Policy Committee, a 10-year national energy development plan is being drawn
up under the direction of the Planning Commission. This plan is to draw
together information on energy subsectors to ensure a coordinated development
of all alternative potential sources. The terms of reference of this study,
to be carried out with the help of consultants, have been drawn up and a
preliminary report is to be prepared by December 1982 in order to provide the
basis of the energy sector strategy for the Sixth Five-Year Plan.
78.     GOP has also requested assistance from the Bank and other donors for
detailed subsectoral studies which would be integrated into a final draft of
the long-term energy plan. The recently completed gas study represents the
first stage of these subsectoral studies. The proposed project includes
provision for further studies in the oil and gas sectors and the power sec-
tor; a feasibility study of the major Kalabagh Dam Project has commenced
(financed by UNDP with the Bank acting as executing agency); and several
donors, including the Bank, are expected to assist studies of the coal sec-
tor.
IV. Industry
79.     As described in Part I above, the Government's industrial policy
since 1977 has been to encourage the private sector and limit the role and
improve the efficiency of the public sector. GOP has already implemented a
wide range of measures to achieve this fundamental reorientation of policy
with encouraging results. There has been a substantial increase in private
investment, especially in medium and small-scale enterprises. At the same
time, GOP is aware that further streamlining of procedures and incentives, as
well as simplification of regulations, is desirable to maintain the momentum
of the recent recovery. A flexible exchange rate regime has been introduced
recently to support already existing export promotion measures. A policy of
import liberalization is also being followed in consultation with the IMF
in order to give domestic industry better access to imported inputs while
promoting improved efficiency by gradual exposure to competition from
imports. In addition, a number of surveys and studies are being undertaken
by GOP to provide the basis for further industrial policy reforms. Some of
this work will be supported by the proposed project as well as by sector work
to be undertaken by Bank staff over the next 18 months.
80.     Industrial Incentives Study:  The process of modifying industrial
policy in Pakistan has been complicated by the existence of the present
overly complex system of industrial incentives. Because of numerous
piecemeal alterations to incentives over the years, the precise effect of the
existing system on the industrial sector as a whole or on specific industries



-30-
is unclear; there is no comprehensive information on the protection that it
provides or its impact on resource allocation.
81.     GOP has accordingly commissioned a comprehensive study of effective
protection based on a large-scale sample survey of industrial enterprises, in
order to provide a review of the system of incentives including taxes, sub-
sidies, tariffs and other controls, on the basis of which standard measures
of prevailing degrees of effective protection will be calculated.  This
analysis will guide GOP in a simplification and reform of the structure of
incentives in order to achieve a more uniform level of effective protection.
The study, which is being carried out by the Pakistan Institute of Develop-
ment Economics, has been initiated with funds from IDA's Project Preparation
Facility (PPF) and would be continued under the proposed project; it is
expected to be substantially completed by December 1982. The Government has
appointed a committee chaired by the Minister of Finance to review the
progress of the study and its findings. In the light of the committeets
recommendations, GOP intends to introduce appropriate changes in tariffs and
fiscal incentives beginning July 1, 1983.
82.     Public sector enterprises:  To bring about further improvements in
the efficiency of the public manufacturing sector, GOP has decided to estab-
lish a Public Enterprises Signaling System which would develop a set of
objective performance criteria to be used in evaluating and rewarding
managers of public manufacturing enterprises and would provide the basis for
a strengthened incentive system for managers. The project, recommended by a
recent study of the public sector by a Bank-financed consultant, would con-
sist of the development of an information system to measure enterprise per-
formance; a performance evaluation system to translate goals into explicit
enterprise objectives in quantitative terms; and the provision of incentives
for managers, linking benefits with achievement of specified targets. The
project would be -inanced unde- the proposed project following initial fund-
ing from the PPI   Work on thi. project commenced in November 1981 and is to
be completed according to an agreed, detailed timetable over three years.
The work program has been designed so that the monitoring and evaluation of
enterprises can be implemented progressively once the initial phase of set-
ting up a management information system is completed during 1982.
83.     Financial sector study:  Pakistan's relatively low domestic savings,
the growing emphasis on the role of the private sector and the difficulties
being experienced by private companies in raising domestic financing point to
the need to improve the performance of financial markets and institutions
both in terms of mobilizing and allocating resources.  Improvement in
policies and institutions in this area would, inter alia, assist GOP to
attain the desired improvement in the savings rate over the medium term (see
paragraph 30). A Bank financial sector mission to survey and review the
performance of existing financial institutions and markets visited Pakistan
in March 1982 and a report containing policy recommendations for discussion
with GOP is to be finalized shortly. It is envisaged that selective reforms



-31-
of the financial sector, as well as the implementation of a revised
industrial incentive system and of the Public Enterprises Signaling System,
might be elements of a possible SAL II.
84.     Public/private sector balance:  GOP's objective of shifting the
balance of total investment substantially towards increased private invest-
ment (see paragraph 30(c) above) is to be pursued by the active promotion
of private investment in industry. In addition to offering improved fiscal
and other incentives, GOP is concerned to ensure that unnecessary constraints
on private industry are removed. A detailed inventory of regulatory con-
straints on industry is being prepared by GOP with a view to eliminating all
unnecessary government interventions.
85.     The need for further policy improvements is evident in the case of
large-scale industry. Although GOP has been successful in promoting a wel-
come resurgence of private investment, especially in smaller-scale ventures,
there have so far been few proposals for large-scale investments despite the
fact that, given the size of the market and Pakistan's resource endowments,
there is considerable scope for further efficient large-scale import sub-
stitution. While GOP's policy preference is that such projects should be
promoted in the private sector, the Government is aware that, due to the
lumpiness of such investments, there may be difficulties in obtaining a
sufficient flow of private funds and foreign exchange financing for such
projects.
86.     As part of the preparatory work for the Sixth Five-Year Plan, GOP
will study key industrial sectors in order to identify the likely extent of
such investments required over the next decade, determine the types of
policies necessary to promote such investments and consider the possible need
for and/or relative advantage of government involvement through joint ven-
tures with the private sector, or if necessary through sole public ownership.
These studies will, inter alia, analyze the adequacy of sectoral policies
(including pricing) and will assess the associated needs for infrastructure,
raw materials and credit to promote the necessary volume of investment.
Support for these studies would be provided under the proposed project as
well as through the Bank's own economic and sector work.

PART III - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN PAKISTAN I/
87.     The cumulative total of Bank/IDA commitments to Pakistan (exclusive
of loans and credits or portions thereof which were disbursed in the former
East Pakistan) now amounts to approximately US$2 billion. During its long
association with Pakistan, the Bank Group has been involved in almost all
sectors of the economy. This has included its involvement with other donors,
over a 20-year period, in the major program of works to develop the water
resources of the Indus Basin. Approximately 36% of total Bank/IDA commit-
ments to Pakistan have been for public utility services, 31% for industry (of
which 9% was for industrial imports), 30% for agriculture and 2% for educa-
tion. Lending for public utility services has included loans and credits for
railways, electric power, gas pipelines, ports, highways, telecommunications
and water supply.
88.     Lending operations in Pakistan have three main objectives:  first,
to support the directly productive sectors of the economy; secondly, to
support the expansion of, and to improve the institutions which are respon-
sible for, the principal public services supporting economic growth; and
thirdly, to meet basic needs in the areas of rural and urban development.
89.     In recent years, the Bank Group has placed special emphasis on lend-
ing for agriculture, which is the mainstay of the Pakistan economy. Projects
in this sector are aimed at augmenting the supply of essential inputs, prin-
cipally irrigation water, fertilizer, seeds and credit; strengthening
research, extension and other agricultural supporting services; improving
water management; reclaiming land by controlling salinity and waterlogging;
and providing essential facilities including tubewells, livestock development
and dairy processing. An important purpose of this lending is to assist the
Government's program to increase the productivity of available land and water
resources in the Indus Basin through quick-yielding investments, as recom-
mended recently in a UNDP-financed study for which the Bank was executing
agency.
90.     In industry, most lending for the private sector has been through
the DFCs, principally through eleven loans/credits amounting to US$270 mil-
lion for the Pakistan Industrial Credit and Investment Corporation (PICIC).
Direct lending for industry has also included assistance to three large
fertilizer plants, as well as for small-scale industry. IFC has made invest-
ments in 14 Pakistan enterprises for a total of US$73.7 million, of which
1/ Part III is substantially the same as Part II of the President's Report
No. 3275-PAK (Baluchistan Minor Irrigation and Agricultural Development
Project) dated April 19, 1982.



-38-
US$63.9 million was by way of loans and US$9.8 million by equity participa-
tions (these are shown in Annex II). About US$33.9 million remains outstand-
ing. The enterprises assisted by IFC include three in the field of pulp and
paper products, two in textiles, two in food and food processing, and one
each in cement, steel, fertilizers, plastics, wood processing and petrochemi-
cals. IFC is also a shareholder in PICIC.
91.     The focus of Bank Group lending for transport and communications has
shifted increasingly towards assisting Pakistan to better utilize existing
capacity by improving the efficiency of operations and strengthening the
institutions responsible for these services, especially the Karachi Port
Trust, Pakistan Railways, Telephone and Telegraph Department, and federal and
provincial highway agencies. In the power sector, the Bank Group has
assisted the Karachi Electric Supply Corporation (KESC) and the Water and
Power Development Authority (WAPDA) with four and three projects, respec-
tively; the sector has also been assisted by the construction under the Indus
Basin Development Program of Mangla and Tarbela Dams.
92.     In the oil and gas sector, the two Sui gas transmission companies
have been assisted with five projects, while IDA has recently financed a
petroleum development project and begin to play an important role in
strengthening the Oil and Gas Development Corporation. These efforts are
assisting in the efficient development and utilization of Pakistan's domestic
energy resources. A second water supply project in Lahore is currently under
implementation. Five IDA credits for education, totaling US$62.5 million,
have assisted in upgrading primary, post-secondary and higher technical and
agricultural education, middle-level training of primary teachers and
agricultural extension agents.
93.     Annex II contains a summary statement of Bank loans and IDA credits
as of March 31, 1982, and notes on the execution of ongoing projects. Credit
and loan disbursements have been generally satisfactory. Some projects have
experienced initial delays due to government procedures for project approval,
which are now being strengthened, and to slowness in appointment of consult-
ants. Rapid turnover of managerial and technical staff, in part due to
migration to the Middle East, and budgetary constraints have been problems in
the case of some projects.
94.     A number of further projects for Bank Group financing are currently
under appraisal or being prepared in Pakistan. These include projects for
fertilizer industry rehabilitation, urban development, water supply, oil and
gas development, population planning and railways. Pakistan continues to
have domestic resource constraints for the reasons set out in Part I. To
assist the Government to finance agricultural and other high-priority
projects which have a low foreign exchange component, financing of some local
expenditures in specific cases is justified.



-39-
95.     In addition to lending, economic and sector work provides the basis
for a continuing dialogue between the Bank Group and the Government of Pakis-
tan on development strategy, and for the coordination of external assistance
within the Pakistan Consortium.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
96.     The proposed project has been designed, in conjunction with an accom-
panying Structural Adjustment Loan and Credit (for which documents are being
circulated separately), to support GOP's efforts in implementing its struc-
tural adjustment program outlined in Part II; it would also assist in iden-
tifying further measures to be addressed in possible future SALs. The
project would focus on studies and institution-building in the areas of
planning, agriculture, industry and energy which have been identified by GOP
and IDA as having high priority and for which adequate funding is not avail-
able from traditional sources of technical assistance such as UNDP.
97.     The project was appraised in November 1981.  Negotiations were held
in Washington from April 22 to April 28, 1982; the GOP delegation was headed
by Mr. Ejaz Ahmad Naik, Secretary for Planning and Economic Affairs. Sup-
plementary data on the credit are contained in Annex III. Disaggregated cost
estimates are outlined in Annex IV.
Project Description
98.     The proposed project, to be executed over a three-year period, would
comprise the following components:

computerized so that up-to-date information can be entered into the balance
of payments forecasting model. The project would finance essential computer
hardware and software and would provide three man-months of specialists in
programming and development of appropriate software.
100.    Analysis of Sources and Uses of Funds in the Pakistan Economy.
Assistance would be provided to GOP to continue the work on the flow-of-funds
analysis which was commenced in 1981. Highly aggregated matrices of the
sources and uses of funds have been prepared for five recent years up to
1980. The proposed IDA Credit would finance five man-months of consultants
who would work on further disaggregation, updating and projection of the



-40-
flow-of-funds matrices, and train local staff in establishing and maintaining
the system.
Agriculture and Water
101.    Agricultural Prices Commission.  This component would finance 30
man-months of consultants, vehicles, equipment and 10 overseas training
fellowships for local staff. This would assist the Agricultural Prices
Commission (paragraph 61) in implementing its initial work program, a sub-
stantial part of which would be directed toward:
(a) the designing of a system for the collection of farm-level data;
(b) initiating and assisting the collection of information from foreign
sources (e.g. prices, production); and
(c) developing methods of measuring the impact of price recommendations
on consumers' and farmers' real incomes.
The program would lead to the development of a methodology for preparing
price recommendations (with supporting analysis) on a timely basis.
102.    Project Preparation.  As part of its adjustment program the Govern-
ment intends to direct increased investment to high-priority agriculture and
water development. In order to expedite this investment, it will be neces-
sary for a larger number of suitable projects to be adequately prepared.
Funds would be made available to finance pre-investment studies for priority
projects in these sectors. This would supplement the funds for project
preparation available under the UNDP technical assistance project (paragraph
56). Three projects which require further pre-investment work have been
tentatively identified: SCARP Transition, Tubewell Electrification and the
Left Bank Outfall Drain. One hundred man-months of consultants have been
budgeted for these studies.
Industry
103.    Effective Protection.  This study would analyze the structure, effec-
tiveness and appropriateness of the existing set of industrial incentives
in Pakistan. The work, which would be carried out by the Pakistan Institute
of Development Economics (PIDE) with the support of consultants, would
include an analysis and estimation of the levels of effective protection and
related measurements based upon data to be collected from a comprehensive
survey of industrial enterprises in Pakistan. These results would form the
basis for action by GOP to improve and rationalize the industrial incentive
system (paragraph 81). This study has already been started using an advance
of US$337,000 under the Project Preparation Facility (PPF).



-41-
104.    Public Enterprises Signaling System.  The Ministry of Production is
in the process of setting up a signaling system for evaluating the perfor-
mance of public enterprises (paragraph 82). The work would be carried out in
three phases: (a) the development of an information system; (b) the design
of performance criteria for enterprises; and (c) the implementation of an
incentive system to encourage improvements in performance measured according
to these criteria. The proposed project would finance the services of a
specialist consultant and others to assist the Experts Advisory Cell of the
Ministry of Production in setting up the signaling system and the development
and installation of essential computer software and hardware facilities. An
advance of US$350,000 under the PPF was used to initiate the design of this
signaling system.
105.    Investment Requirements in Large-Scale Industries.  This study is
designed to analyze the supply and demand prospects for key industrial com-
modities (such as fertilizers and cement) where large-scale and
long-gestation investments are required (see also paragraphs 85-86). The
study would identify the likely investment needs in these sectors for the
next 10 years and consider the possibility and relative advantages of provid-
ing for all or part of these investment needs through the private or public
sectors, or by means of joint ventures with the private sector. The study
would also identify the likely needs for infrastructure, raw materials and
financing in order to facilitate the required investments. To the extent
private sector investment is found to be possible and desirable, the study
would analyze the adequacy of incentives to promote such investments. The
proposed Technical Assistance Project would finance the cost of consultants
who would assist in carrying out the study.
Energy
106.    The energy components to be financed by the proposed project would
include specific studies supporting ongoing activities in the hydro-carbon
and power subsectors for which other financing is not available. These
studies would support the activities to be addressed in the Government's
proposed National Energy Plan (see paragraphs 77 and 78). Studies in the
natural gas and oil sectors could include, but would not necessarily be
limited to, the following:
107.    Natural Gas.  A gas supply and demand study covering the period until
1990 was recently completed (paragraph 71). This study demonstrated the
existence of a growing demand-supply gap and identified a number of invest-
ments to eliminate this shortfall. In order to bring about these invest-
ments, further steps need to be taken. The Technical Assistance Project
would be available to finance studies and analyses to facilitate additional
investments; for example, the project could finance the services of gas
engineering consultants to advise GOP on technical matters.



-42-
108.    Oil.  GOP has decided to accelerate oil exploration in Pakistan by
seeking increased participation by private oil companies (paragraph 70). It
is envisaged that the services of consultants will be required to support the
Government's exploration promotion efforts. This could be followed up by a
possible Petroleum Exploration Promotion Project which would include an
overall review and integration of the geology and geophysics of Pakistan as a
basis for developing new exploration concepts that could lead to a higher
level of exploration investment in Pakistan. Besides exploration promotion,
the services of consultants may be required to re-evaluate the reserves and
producibility of the Toot reservoir and optimize oil refining facilities in
Pakistan.
109.    Electric Power.  Assistance would be provided to the Water and Power
Development Authority (WAPDA) to set up a planning model to evaluate short
and medium-term options with respect to power generation, transmission and
distribution within the context of coordinated long-term planning objectives
and constraints. The model would, in the first instance, use the findings of
ongoing studies such as the hydro-carbon subsector studies, the hydel ranking
study and the feasibility study of the Kalabagh Dam. The data to be used
would be progressively refined and sensitivity testing of the model would
identify areas which would most benefit from such refinement; progress would
be continuous and would provide a firm basis for the annual update of WAPDA's
five-year engineering and financial forecasts.
Other Studies
110.    In addition to the specific components listed above, it is proposed
that about 25% of the total proceeds of the Credit would be reserved at the
outset to finance activities subsequently identified during further dialogue
with GOP on structural adjustment issues and on issues raised by the above
studies. The programming of these funds would be administered by the Minis-
try of Finance, Planning and Economic Affairs, in consultation with IDA. All
such activities would be subject to prior approval by IDA.
Project Implementation
111.    All proposed activities under the project would be subject to the
Government's normal procedures for review and approval of studies. Each
participating ministry or agency would be responsible for its component of
the project, including preparation of terms of reference, selection and
recruitment of consultants, procurement and training activities. The Plan-
ning and Development Division of the Ministry of Finance, Planning and
Economic Affairs would provide overall administrative and financial coordina-
tion. Within the Planning and Development Division, a Technical Assistance
Project Cell, headed by a Project Director, would be established and ade-
quately staffed and would be responsible for supervising and monitoring
implementation of the project and the programming of all funds related to it.



-43-
To facilitate this task, a Technical Assistance Project Implementation and
Review Committee, comprising representatives of each participating Minis-
try/Division, would meet periodically to review the pace of work and examine
consolidated project accounts for all expenditures being financed out of the
Credit. The progress of the project would also be monitored by the Bank's
resident mission in Pakistan and by missions from headquarters in liaison
with the supervision of the structural adjustment program.
Project Costs and Financing
112.    The estimated total project cost (including taxes which are negli-
gible) is US$7 million, of which US$5.6 million or 80% would be foreign.
Price contingencies for consultants, vehicles, equipment, training and fel-
lowships are based on annual rates of 13%, 11%, 10% and 9% for local costs in
1982, 1983, 1984 and 1985, respectively; price contingencies for foreign
costs are based on annual rates of 8.75% in 1982, 8% in 1983 and 7.5% there-
after. Total contingencies represent approximately 4% of total project
costs. Costs are based on end 1981 prices. Average base cost for consult-
ants, including salaries, allowances, subsistence and travel, are estimated
at US$10,250 per month. These costs are in line with prevailing rates. The
Credit would finance the cost of studies, consultants, equipment, vehicles,
training and fellowships. The executing agencies would meet the costs of
counterpart staff, office facilities, and other support services.
113.    Advances totaling US$687,000 authorized under the Project Preparation
Facility (PPF) for the Effective Protection Study and the Public Enterprises
Signaling System would be financed from the proceeds of the Credit. Disag-
gregated cost estimates are outlined in Annex IV.
Procurement and Disbursement
114.    Contracts for equipment and vehicles would not be of a sufficient
size to attract foreign suppliers under ICB and would be procured using local
shopping procedures acceptable to the Association. The aggregate value of
such items is estimated not to exceed US$160,000. Specialist consultant
services estimated at US$2.6 million and studies to be contracted estimated
at US$4.1 million would be obtained in accordance with the Association's
Guidelines for the Use of Consultants. The remaining costs consist of fel-
lowships and training. All procurement proposals would be subject to prior
review by IDA and would include detailed breakdowns of expenditures.
115.    The Credit would be disbursed as follows:  (a) studies, consultants,
and overseas training: 100% of total expenditures; and (b) vehicles and
equipment: 100% of foreign or local ex-factory expenditures or 65% of expen-
ditures if locally procured. Disbursements against all items would be fully
documented. Disbursements are expected to be completed in 42 months.



-44-
Accounts and Auditing
116.    The Ministry of Finance, Planning and Economic Affairs would estab-
lish and maintain consolidated project accounts for all expenditures financed
under the Credit. These accounts and supporting records would be audited
annually by auditors acceptable to IDA and the audit reports would be sub-
mitted promptly to IDA.
Benefits and Risks
117.    The proposed project would help GOP in implementing its structural
adjustment program in a number of key areas. Support under the project to
the planning process would enhance the Government's capability to monitor and
analyze important aspects of the economy which have an important bearing on
the success of and future actions under the adjustment program. The assis-
tance to the agriculture and water sectors would facilitate the determination
of appropriate agricultural pricing adjustments and the reorientation of
development expenditures towards programs designed to increase farm yields.
The proposed studies in the industrial sector would provide the basis for
further major policy reforms aimed at rationalization and increased produc-
tivity of both the public and private sectors. The studies in the energy
sector would assist GOP in addressing the crucial problem of increasing
production of local energy resources in the most cost-effective way.
118.    The major risk in project execution is likely to arise from possible
delays in the decision-making process within the various ministries and
agencies of the Government involved in the implementation of the project.
Given the Government's commitment to its structural adjustment program and
the priority attached to the activities to be financed under the Credit, it
is expected that the Government would expedite these decisions in a timely
manner and assign appropriate local staff and support facilities as necessary
for carrying out the project.
PART V- LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
119.    The draft Development Credit Agreement between the Islamic Republic
of Pakistan and the Recommendations of the Committee provided for in Article
V, Section l(d) of the Articles of Agreement are being distributed to the
Executive Directors separately.
120.    I am satisfied that the proposed Credit would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Association.



-45-
PART VI- RECOMMENDATION
121.    I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed Credit.

C. PROJECTS IN EXECUTION 1/
Credit No. 771         Tarbela Dam:  US$35 Million Credit of March 10, 1978;
Effective Date: April 4, 1978; Closing Date: June 30,
1982
Work to construct a flip-bucket at the outlet of Tunnel No. 4 is in
progress and will be completed in 1983. Serious erosion in the plunge pool
below the service spillway during 1977 necessitated additional protection
works which, together with work in the downstream channel, were completed in
June 1980. Similar protection work in the auxiliary plunge pool is virtually
completed. Since 1975, irrigation requirements from the dam have been met.
Power generation by the first four units began in 1977. Construction of a
second power plant with six units is in progress. All Credit proceeds have
been disbursed; the Bank continues to administer the Tarbela Development
Fund.
Credit No. 492         Fourth Karachi Port:  US$16 Million Credit of July 8,
1974; Effective Date: September 18, 1974; Closing
Date: December 31, 1981
The project is completed and, as of March 31, 1982, disbursements
amounted to US$15.6 million. The balance is committed and final withdrawals
are expected by end-April 1982.
Loan No. 1107          Fourth Sui Northern Gas:  US$60 Million Loan of May 15,
1975; Effective Date: July 5, 1975; Closing Date:
December 31, 1982
The Closing Date of the Loan has been extended to December 31, 1982
to allow the Borrower to utilize undisbursed funds toward increasing the
capacity of the Islamabad/Rawalpindi natural gas distribution system. Con-
struction should be completed in June 1982.
1/  These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding the
progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report any
problems which are being encountered, and the action being taken to
remedy them. They should be read in this sense, and with the understand-
ing that they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of
strengths and weaknesses in project execution.

Credit No. 546         National Development Finance Corporation (NDFC):
US$30 Million Credit of May 15, 1975; Effective
Date: July 17, 1975; Closing Date: December 31, 1981
The Credit was closed on December 31, 1981. The undisbursed amount
(about US$0.5 million) will be cancelled in April 1982.
Loan No. 1208-T         Second WAPDA Power:  US$50 Million Third Window Loan
of February 19, 1976; Effective Date: April 30, 1976;
Closing Date:  December 31, 1981
Most of the project components were commissioned in the last quarter
of 1980. Some payments are outstanding pending final comnissioning of the
remaining components. The Government has requested an extension of the
Closing Date to September 30, 1982 to accommodate payment of these sums.
Credit No. 620         Seed Project:  US$23 Million Credit of March 29, 1976;
Effective Date: November 29, 1976; Closing Date:
June 30, 1983
Project implementation remains behind schedule, with the most impor-
tant delays being the construction and equipping of three processing plants
in Punjab due to disputes with civil works contractors. As presently
scheduled, the Punjab component should be completed by June 1983. The plant
in Sind is complete except for some silos and the machinery is installed.
The Closing Date, originally December 31, 1981, has been extended to June 30,
1983.
Loan No. 1326          Development Finance Company (PICIC IX):  US$25 Million
Loan of September 14, 1976; Effective Date: November
29, 1976; Closing Date: December 31, 1981
This Loan was closed on December 31, 1981. The undisbursed amount
(about US$0.4 million) will be cancelled in April 1982.
Credit No. 630         Second Lahore Water Supply, Sewerage and Drainage
Project: US$26.6 Million Credit of June 8, 1976;
Effective Date: September 21, 1976; Closing Date:
December 31, 1982
All major works have been contracted. Construction delays, however,
continue and will probably cause a further delay in project completion.

Credit No. 648         Khairpur Tile Drainage and Irrigated Farming
Development Project: US$14 Million Credit of July 22,
1976; Effective Date: March 14, 1977; Closing Date:
July 31, 1982
Overall progress is currently about two years behind schedule due to
delays in employing consultants and procurement problems. Canal remodeling,
surveys, and extension services are proceeding satisfactorily but the tile
and collector drain construction has progressed slowly. Actions have been
initiated with the Association's concurrence to curtail cost overruns and
reduce completion delays.
Loan No. 1366-T        Punjab Livestock Development:  US$10 Million Third
Window Loan of February 18, 1977; Effective Date;
August 3, 1977; Closing Date:  December 31, 1982
The Government and the Bank have conditionally agreed on a revised
project which would aim to rehabilitate the Lahore Milk Plant and to estab-
lish about 300 Village Livestock Associations and their related service
activities. The contract of the milk plant consultants has been extended to
cover the period of construction and commissioning of the plant.
Loan No. 1372          Tenth Railway:  US$35 Million Loan and US$25 Million
and                 Credit of March 8, 1977; Effective Date:  May 9, 1977;
Credit No. 684         Closing Date:  June 30, 1982
The project is proceeding satisfactorily. The telecommunications and
signaling scheme is making good progress and the complete network is expected
to be commissioned before mid-1983. Procurement has been completed and the
total proceeds of the Loan/Credit have been committed.
Credit No. 678         Third Education:  US$15 Million Credit of February 18,
1977; Effective Date:  July 6, 1977; Closing Date:
December 31, 1982
The project is generally making good progress. Nearly all of civil
works contracts have been awarded and about 80% have been completed. One
project study has been completed and the two others are nearing completion.
About 70% of the project equipment has been procured and the balance is in
the process of procurement.  Technical assistance specialist services are now
being provided satisfactorily and about 90% of the fellowships have been used
or committed.  Project implementation in Sind and Baluchistan is behind
schedule by about one year, due to initial delays in building construction.



-56-
Credit No. 751         Hill Farming Technical Development:  US$3 Million
Credit of December 1, 1977; Effective Date: March 7,
1978; Closing Date: September 30, 1983
Staff vacancies are causing implementation problems, and the com-
ponents dealing with fodders, demonstration farms, apples and land-use are
progressing slowly. Nevertheless, most technical developments are progress-
ing satisfactorily and the training program is on schedule. A draft proposal
for a follow-up project has been received. Expenditures and disbursements
have been less than expected because of cost savings and procurement delays.
Credit No. 754         SCARP-VI:  US$70 Million Credit of January 19, 1978;
Effective Date: December 28, 1978; Closing Date:
November 30, 1986
Although the project is about three years behind schedule, sig-
nificant momentum has now begun in project implementation following the
resolution of budgetary and other initial problems. Progress has been made
in awarding the first civil works contracts and obtaining necessary equip-
ment, vehicles and materials.
Credit No. 755         Hazara Forestry:  US$1.7 Million Credit of January 29,
1978; Effective Date: July 14, 1978; Closing Date:
December 31, 1983
There has been significant progress in different project activities.
The Guzara socio-economic study, chir pine forest inventory and pulping test
for chir pine, and the first phase of the feasibility study have been com-
pleted. As a result of these developments, the final phase of the
feasibility study is expected to commence in the Fall of 1982.
Credit No. 813         Punjab Extension and Agricultural Development:
US$ 12.5 Million Credit of June 6, 1978; Effective
Date: September 12, 1978; Closing Date: June 30, 1984
The project is behind schedule despite some progress in staff
recruitment, acquisition of building sites and construction work.  Implemen-
tation of the T&V system and the research-extension linkages continue to be
weak. Low salaries for village level staff and delays in recruiting consult-
ants remain problems.
Credit No. 846         Fauji Fertilizer:  US$55 Million Credit of September 14,
1978; Effective Date: December 19, 1978;
Closing Date: June 30, 1982

Credit No. 867         Toot Oil and Gas Development:  US$30 Million Credit of
January 12, 1979; Effective Date: April 25, 1979;
Closing Date: March 31, 1983
Two new producing oil wells in the Toot field have recently been
completed despite very difficult drilling problems. However, serious
well-drilling and management problems still persist. Project implementation
is about 15 months behind schedule. The Closing Date, originally December
31, 1981, has been extended to March 31, 1983, to allow completion of the
original 8-well drilling program.
Credit No. 877          Salinity Control and Reclamation Project (SCARP) Mar-
dan: US$60 Million Credit of February 7, 1979; Effec-
tive Date: October 16, 1979; Closing Date: June 30,
1986
Initial budgetary and other problems have been resolved and CIDA (the
project co-financier) is assisting WAPDA in scheduling implementation
activities as well as in preparing subsurface drainage design and specifica-
tions. The project is about two years behind schedule.
Credit No. 892         Primary Education:  US$10 Million Credit of April 18,
1979; Effective Date:  October 23, 1979; Closing Date:
June 30, 1985
Good progress is being maintained. About 80% of the project inputs
including civil works, equipment, staff appointments and training have been
provided with less than six months' delay. The evaluation program is being
redesigned after the experiences gained in the first 18 months of evaluation.
Credit No. 922         Sind Agricultural Extension and Adaptive Research
Project:  US$9 Million Credit of June 12, 1979; Effec-
tive Date: June 26, 1981; Closing Date: June 30, 1984
Critical staff has been recruited and project implementation has
started. Recruitment of consultants has been delayed pending signing of a
project agreement between UNDP and the Government.
Credit No. 957         Fourth Agricultural Development Bank:  US$30 Million
Credit of December 7, 1979; Effective Date: June 5,
1980; Closing Date:  December 31, 1982
Overall progress of the agricultural credit component has been satis-
factory and the agricultural engineering training component has begun. It is
anticipated that project completion will be about one year behind schedule.



-58-
Credit No. 968         Third WAPDA Power:  US$45 Million Credit of January 10,
1980; Effective Date: July 30, 1980; Closing Date:
December 31, 1984
Despite some delays, mainly in land acquisition, execution of the
project is proceeding satisfactorily. Procurement action schedules and
construction targets for substations and transmission lines are generally
being met.
Credit No. 974         Third Highway:  US$50 Million Credit of April 9, 1980;
Effective Date: August 21, 1980; Closing Date: June
30, 1984
Of the five rehabilitation contracts, two are nearing completion, one
has been terminated due to poor performance by the contractor and re-awarded,
and work is progressing slowly on the remaining two contracts. Discussions
are in progress on equipment procurement and provision of technical assis-
tance to two provincial governments to improve road maintenance, and several
contractors have shown interest in using loans through IDBP for purchase of
mechanical equipment.
Credit No. 1019        PICIC Industrial Development:  US$40 Million Credit of
May 30, 1980; Effective Date: October 29, 1980; Clos-
ing Date: March 31, 1984
As of March 31, 1982, about US$29 million had been authorized for
sub-loans and US$10.8 million disbursed. The Government and PICIC have taken
corrective measures to improve collections on past sub-loans, and implementa-
tion of the project is proceeding well.
Credit No. 1066        Fertilizer Imports Credit:  SDR 38.2 Million Credit
(US$50 Million equivalent) of October 17, 1980; Effec-
tive Date: December 1, 1980; Closing Date: September
30, 1982
As of March 1982, about US$21 million had been committed.  The Clos-
ing Date, originally June 30, 1981, has been extended to September 30, 1982
to accommodate the award of contract for and shipment of the remaining fer-
tilizer under the project.
Credit No. 1109        Fifth Education (Vocational Training):  SDR 19.7 Mil-
lion Credit (US$25 Million equivalent) of April 24,
