are to improve\n            productivity, income and general living conditions for about\n            12,800 families, including 200 native Indian families.\n            Principal components of the project would be: (i) provision\n            of extension, credit, irrigation and other agricultural\n            support services; (ii) construction and improvement of about\n            180 km of rural roads and provision of associated\n            maintenance equipment; (iii) provision of land titles and\n            local mapping; (iv) improvement of health and education\n            infrastructure; and (v) support for project management,\n            studies and technical assistance in various fields,\n            including forestry management, project monitoring and\n            preparation of a national topographic and resource map of\n            Peru using satellite imagery. The International Fund for\n            Agricultural Devlopment (IFAD) would cofinance the credit\n            and project monitoring components."}, "docdt": "1982-11-30T00:00:00Z"}
