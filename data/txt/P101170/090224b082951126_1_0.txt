Implementation Status and Key Decisions

 Project implementation has continued to advance, with some slowdown in recent months.

 The first restructuring of the project, which became effective in May 2011, contributed to the consolidation of the public management tools supported by
 the project and movement towards an integrated approach for results based management. The initial slowdown in implementation progress during 2012
 was resolved, and following the approval of 2012 POAs for almost all components, implementation of project activities progressed effectively in the
 second half of the year.

 Following the Government’s proposal for e-governance related activities falling within the Project scope, an extension of 18 months, from June 30, 2013
 to December 31, 2014, was approved in May 2013 to allow time for completion of these activities and ensure smooth project completion, facilitating
 progress towards project development objectives. Past e-government related efforts had primarily focused on necessary back-end developments, and
 front-end focused activities are required to more completely fulfill the part of the PDO aimed at the “consolidation of key public sector management
 instruments under the CCO’s mandate”, and to fully translate advances into service delivery. The Bank team worked with the counterpart in preparing a
 proposal to finalize the e-government architecture and roll-out key software (EDAP) that will develop an integrated e-government platform for document
 management and the provision of centralized electronic process management services within the federal administration, allowing for the implementation
 of electronic procedures and services for citizens by exploiting and integrating ICT investments made during the life of the project. The contract for
 development of the EDAP was negotiated in November 2014. Receipt of the first deliverable is expected before loan closure (on December 31), with
 the software expected to be completed by April.

 Progress towards the PDO is considered to be Moderately Satisfactory. The Project will close as planned on December 31, 2014.

               INAP has been certified by ISO norms. In October 2014, the processes associated with the Quality Management System were recertified.
               Between August 2013 and October 2014, technical assistance was developed in the Internal Auditing Unit of JGM. In March 2014, the
               elaboration of various documents (including quality policy, specific procedures for planning processes, corrective actions, among others)
               was completed and are now being revised for approval and entry into effect.

               Providers did not comply with the TOR and the study was not contracted. The new authorities prioritized other activities. Instead, a Program
               for Planning Contracts and Public Purchases was carried out. Within this Program, Decree No. 1188/2012 has allowed for 15% savings in
               the purchased value of national public administration's vehicles.
