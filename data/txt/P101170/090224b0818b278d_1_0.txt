                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Project implementation is moving in a positive direction. The restructuring of the project, which became effective in May 2011, has contributed to consolidate the public management
                         tools supported by the project and move towards an integrated approach for results based management. Nadia Moragas has been appointed as Director Nacional Alterno and new
                         project coordinator. The initial slowed down of implementation progress during 2012 has been solved. Following the approval of 2012 POAs for almost all components,
                         implementation of project activities has been progressing effectively in the second half of the year, as shown by the results indicators.

                         The implementation of the e-government unified service platform continues to be enhanced and advances have been made regarding digital certification and signature and security of
                         information. Digitalization and interoperability will be expanded through a system for processing information and administrative files within and across agencies (EDAP) and the
                         development of a bus of services for exchange of information between agencies, allowing the consolidation and tracking of information, and facilitating the simplification of

                         proceedings for external beneficiaries. The system will also allow the integration of existing databases with information of public officials. Surveys to measure satisfaction rates on
                         services provided as well as understanding of quality standards, goals, and indicators by agencies subscribing to Citizens Charter Program (CCP) are being implemented and results
                         will be available in May 2013. Results from case studies are being consolidated and the methodology developed for conducting the assessments will be published. Following the
                         successful pilot at the Nuclear Regulatory Agency (ARN), the agency has been incorporated into the evaluation of CCP and the proceedings portal and is also using SISEG regularly.
