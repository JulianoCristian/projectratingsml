                         Project implementation has continued to advance, with some slowdown in recent months.

                         The first restructuring of the project, which became effective in May 2011, contributed to the consolidation of the public management tools supported by the project and movement

                         Following the Government’s proposal for e-governance related activities falling within the Project scope, an extension of 18 months, from June 30, 2013 to December 31, 2014, was
                         approved in May 2013 to allow time for completion of these activities and ensure smooth project completion, facilitating progress towards project development objectives. Past e-

                         aimed at the “consolidation of key public sector management instruments under the CCO’s mandate”, and to fully translate advances into service delivery. The Bank team worked
                         with the counterpart in preparing a proposal to finalize the e-government architecture and roll-out key software (EDAP) that will develop an integrated e-government platform for
                         document management and the provision of centralized electronic process management services within the federal administration, allowing for the implementation of electronic
                         procedures and services for citizens by exploiting and integrating ICT investments made during the life of the project.
