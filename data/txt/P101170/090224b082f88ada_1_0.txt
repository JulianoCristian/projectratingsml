                                                     and heads of specific sub-
                                                     components, as well as some
                                                     shortcomings in procurement.
                                                     The second restructuring
                                                     occurred in April 2013 in which
                                                     the closing date was extended
                                                     by 8 months from June 30, 2013

I. Disbursement Profile
1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

1.       With its experience supporting the Argentine Government through the first State
Modernization Technical Assistance Loan approved in 1998 (P057449 for US$30.30
million), the Bank was well positioned to support Argentina in strengthening the
institutional capacity of the Chief of Cabinet Office (CCO) and embark on a modernization
effort across the National Public Administration (APN) through the Second State
Modernization Project. The new project’s objectives were aligned with the World Bank
Governance and Anticorruption Strategy 1 and the 2006-2008 Argentina Country
Assistance Strategy (CAS) 2, which focused on institutional strengthening in selected public
sector management areas to support expenditure management, transparency, and service
delivery.

2.      At the time of design, public sector modernization was considered an important
element of rebuilding the state in the post-crisis years. The economic situation had
improved dramatically. Between 2003 and 2013, Argentina’s GDP growth rates averaged
6% annually. This growth was also broadly distributed, making Argentina one of the top
two performers in LAC in terms of poverty reduction and improvements in shared
prosperity. Poverty (measured at $4/day) declined from 31% in 2004 to 10.8% in 2013.
Inequality was reduced, and the middle class grew from 34% of the population to 53%
between 2000 and 2011. In 2007, President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner was elected
and the administration decided to concentrate its efforts on an incremental strategy aimed
at improving public sector management systems to improve policy implementation. This
entailed improving the efficiency of its use of resources; consolidating and expanding
horizontal public sector management tools to enhance public sector management
efficiency, transparency, and accountability.

3.      The first State Modernization Project (SMP I) - originally designed to support the
Government in processing data from 2000 onward (the “Y2K” problem) - was restructured
three times and by 2005, was reframed to assist the Government in strengthening public
sector management tools. The tools were designed to improve transparency, civil society
participation, and increase the efficiency and quality of management in selected public
services. 3 These areas became the basis upon which the activities of the State
Modernization II Project were initiated in 2007 as a means to expand and consolidate
reforms. The Implementation Completion Report (ICR) for SMP I rated the achievement

of the objectives related to public sector modernization moderately satisfactory, reflecting
more progress in some areas such as e-government and administrative procedures than in
procurement, human resource management, civil service training, and performance
management reforms. Reflecting this uneven progress across reform areas, the State
Modernization Project II took into account the incremental nature of the reform path in the
design of the second operation.
1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

4.     The project would contribute to a (i) strengthened capacity of the CCO to carry out
its mandate in key public sector management areas for improved coordination, monitoring
and evaluation; and to (ii) the increased use of modern e-government, procurement, human
resource management and social accountability tools, as well as improved capacity for
investment promotion.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators,
and reasons/justification

5.      The PDO remained unchanged throughout project implementation, although key
associated outcome targets were revised during the first restructuring in January 2011 in
order to more closely align the contribution of project activities to the achievement of the
PDO, as well as respond to changes in political priorities and the corresponding addition
of new activities in Components 1 and 2. All but two of the initial PDO indicators were
revised (see Annex 10 for a detailed analysis of these changes).

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

6.     The primary target group as identified in the Project Appraisal Document (PAD)
was the staff of the Chief of Cabinet Office. Additional beneficiaries included other
Ministries and Agencies within the National Public Administration, such as the National
Investment Development Agency (ANDI), 4 the Ministry of Labor, the Nuclear Regulatory
Agency (ARN), and the Federal Tax and Customs Administration (AFIP), which benefited
from activities that supported state modernization. The beneficiaries of the project
remained unchanged throughout project implementation. In strengthening the efficiency
and effectiveness of the management of public policies (primarily in terms of back-office
functions), an indirect link can be established with intended benefits for citizens in general
and the private sector.

1.5 Original Components

7.      Component 1 - Institutional Strengthening of the CCO (US$6.7 million)



4
  ANDI was dismantled by Decree 1187-2010 and replaced by the Secretariat for Trade and International
Economic Relations (SCREI).



                                                  2
This component aimed to (i) strengthen the capacity of the CCO to fulfill its mandate
through the design of a state modernization strategy and change management
methodologies, (ii) improve the role of the CCO in coordinating, monitoring, and
evaluating public policies, and (iii) strengthen the functions of investment promotion
within ANDI.

8.       Component 2 - Strengthening Key Public Sector Management Instruments (US$9.5
         million)
This component was to develop, consolidate and expand cross-cutting public sector
management tools and capacities in a number of areas. Specifically, the component aimed
to: (i) support the implementation of the national e-government plan through the design of
standards and tools to improve the quality of information and integration of processes and
systems; (ii) support e-procurement and upgrades to procurement systems and
methodologies; (iii) develop systems, tools, and information for human resources
management and training for the federal administration, and (iv) strengthen the Citizens’
Charter Program (CCP) and mechanisms to enhance citizens’ access to information.

9.      Component 3 - Project Management (US$1.7 million)
This component was to finance standard project management activities, including:
financial management and procurement and the monitoring of project implementation.

10.     Broadly, components 1 and 2 supported activities directed towards the achievement
of parts one and two of the PDO, with the exception of investment promotion, which falls
under part two of the PDO on increasing the use of modern tools in government. The
project also left US$2.1 million in unallocated funds to enable flexibility in meeting
unexpected expenditures to support the gradual implementation of public sector
management tools and systems in different ministries and agencies.

1.6 Revised Components

11.    The project went through two level 2 restructurings. The project’s first restructuring,
which occurred in January of 2011, entailed changes to the results framework, the project
scope and activities, and component costs. 5 Component 1 underwent a number of changes
during this restructuring, including the addition of new activities: (i) the development of
a conceptual framework for policy evaluation and the institutional and organizational
design, training and capacity building, implementation of a pilot; (ii) the down-sizing of
the CCO’s institutional strategy and change management activities and a reorientation
towards capturing lessons learned; (iii) the piloting of an integrated approach between
the Management Monitoring and Evaluation System (SISEG) and results-based
management; and (iv) the introduction of new activities for investment promotion, such as
the development of a National Investment Map and capacity building in Investors Services,

in light of the completion of project objectives earlier than expected. Component 2, by
contrast, underwent relatively minor modifications in the activities associated with e-
government and quality management and access to information. Changes made under the
second restructuring are described below.

1.7 Other significant changes

12.     During the first restructuring, changes were made to component costs,
disbursement arrangements and percentages, the procurement plan, and the closing date
was extended by 18 months from December 31, 2011 to June 30, 2013 (see Annex 11 for
the changes in component costs across the restructurings). The second restructuring
occurred in April 2013. The changes included an 18 month extension of the Closing Date
from June 30, 2013 to December 31, 2014 and a reallocation of loan proceeds between
expenditure categories. The main reason behind these changes was to allow for the
completion of the final stage of project activities – in particular, those related to e-
government reforms – and to continue supporting the relationship with the CCO. Both
restructurings led to a cumulative extension of three years. For most of the duration of the
project, the Project Implementation Unit (PIU) was hosted in the CCO, directly reporting
to the Chief of Cabinet’s Office. 6 In 2013, it was transferred to the Sub-secretariat for
Management and Public Employment. 7

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

13.     The ICR finds the quality at entry to be Moderately Satisfactory due to aspects of
project design, which although providing a technically solid roadmap for reforms, included
an ambitiously large number of reform areas and a complex results framework.

14.     The background analysis for the preparation of the second project was extensive
and provided a detailed understanding of the remaining challenges in each of the reform
areas, as well as an acknowledgement of the risks (the overall risk rating for the project
was high at the time of design). The incremental support strategy aimed at strengthening
different reform areas which generated important advancement in the previous operation
to help build support for further reform and expansion of the tools. However, this
engagement strategy also resulted in a dispersion of resources among an excessively large
number of initiatives and departments and agencies making the project difficult to
maneuver and coordinate. The design of the sub-components in the Second State
Modernization Project touched on major reform areas – procurement, civil service, e-
government, physical asset management, performance management etc. Though the CCO
had a role to play in each of the reform areas in defining practices and policies, the design
of these reforms required coordination among several departments within the CCO.
Limited coordination between these departments significantly elevated the costs of

    Decreto 2201/2013


                                             4
coordination and required substantial leadership of the Chief of Cabinet. While the ICR for
SMP I was not complete by the time of preparation of the second loan, general lessons
(both positive and negative) from the first operation could have been incorporated in the
design of some of the components – particularly with respect to shifting commitment to
reform and the likely resistance by Ministries and Agencies to some of the cross-agency
modernization efforts. 8 The ICR for SMP I noted weaknesses in commitment and
coordination of reforms in procurement and human resource management. 9 Interestingly,
where the first project had more success with combining reforms across the administration
(referred to as horizontal reforms) with Ministry specific reforms (vertical reforms), the
second project did not include vertical reforms in the initial design of the operation. Only
during the first restructuring was a pilot approach introduced in the Nuclear Regulatory
Agency (ARN). 10

15.      The sheer volume of indicators included in the results framework resulted in rigid
and complex monitoring arrangements and were subject to changes in interpretation over
time. At the time of design, the logic was to use the results framework as a tool for ensuring
progress in all areas and, given the incremental strategy, tracking engagement by
monitoring compliance with small steps. However, the large number of indicators
identified for each sub-component and, in some cases, specific activities decreased
flexibility to adapt to changing circumstances and required changes over the course of the
project. As a result, the overall Result Framework was both difficult to monitor and
ultimately to assess the impact of the operation. This was only partially corrected in the
first restructuring by the supervision team and impacts the rating of Bank performance.

16.      Early on, the project received an overall Quality at Entry Assessment rating of
Satisfactory by the Quality Assurance Group (QAG). 11 QAG also focused on the quality
of the technical assistance/training design, which was ranked as Highly Satisfactory. In
hindsight though, it seems that the challenges encountered could have been better
anticipated at design, particularly given the experiences from the implementation of the
first project.

2.2 Implementation

17.     Over the course of seven years, several factors negatively affected project
implementation and a number of adjustments had to be made to the operation to respond
to challenges posed by a difficult implementation environment. Over the course of the
project, the Chief of Cabinet position changed five times, resulting in changes in the heads
of key departments leading sub-components, as well as in the position of the Project
Director (with an average of 1.5 years for each Director). These changes in management

significantly impacted the execution of project activities – both in the direction and speed
of reforms.

18.      Such delays in political decision-making also contributed to delays in project
execution, affecting the timely achievement of results. There were recurrent delays in the
initiation of critical procurement processes, particularly the one associated with the
Business Continuity Center (the largest procurement of the project) resulting in part from
changes and delays in the appointment of lower level positions within the CCO. At one
point, the World Bank lowered the ratings for overall implementation progress to MU from
MS, citing a slowdown following elections in November 2011. The elections also delayed
the drafting and approval of the 2012 annual operating plan, which in turn delayed project
implementation across subcomponents.

19.     The coordination of reforms also proved an obstacle to project implementation.
Within the CCO, coordination among the various sub-secretariats and offices within the
CCO, and between them and the PIU posed a serious challenge at times. The level of
coordination was so taxing on the CCO to bring together the various modernization efforts
under one roof that pilots were not extended beyond ARN to other Ministries and Agencies.
Outside of the CCO, Ministries and Agencies also had to be convinced to adopt new tools
and business processes. Cross-government modernization approaches cannot always
effectively address the individual needs of agencies and resistance by government agencies
further slowed implementation. In line with its mandate the CCO can pass regulations and
resolutions to help institutionalize these reforms and offer support to implementation, but
ultimately such tools are rolled out on a demand basis from Ministries and Agencies.

Implementation of Components 1 & 2
20.     During the mid-term review (May 2010), the team noted the uneven progress across
project components and sub-components and that execution was proceeding slower than
planned as a result of changes in political commitment and the lack of an overarching
strategic framework to guide activities. 12 As a result of the MTR, it was agreed to narrow
the scope of some of the components, focus on the consolidation of the public management
instruments and strengthen their sustainability. This became the basis for the first
restructuring.

21.      During the first restructuring the subcomponent on organizational strengthening of
the CCO was reoriented. Despite significant investment in background studies and
international seminars early on to support the development of an overarching state
modernization strategy as initially envisioned in the PAD, the government decided
ultimately not to develop an overarching strategy for state modernization. The main
activities for this component were reoriented toward piloting an integrated approach to
modernization efforts, strengthening the CCO’s monitoring and evaluation function and
documenting lessons learned.

22.     Relatively minor modifications were made to the first three sub-components of
Component 2 (e-gov, procurement, and HRM) due to changes in Government priorities
and the availability of new technologies and platforms. However, the fourth sub-
component on quality management and access to information presented important
challenges early on. With respect to the Citizen’s Charter Program, a new set of activities
were introduced to reduce dispersion and ensure consolidation of some of the basic features
of the Program, with a focus on increasing citizen participation and ensuring basic quality
standards.

23.     The second part of the fourth sub-component on Access to Information at this point
was uncertain. The Access to Information Executive Decree 1172 (2003), which provides
the normative framework for access to information within the scope of the federal
administration, specifies that requests have to be delivered in person to the relevant
Ministry and Agency. A new law or amendment would have to have been approved to
allow for the use of an online platform to receive requests. No legal changes were made
and the head of the Undersecretary for Democracy Strengthening (the unit responsible for
implementing this subcomponent) was changed and the International Access to
Information Seminar (among other activities in the 2008 annual operating plan) was put on
hold. While a formal notification was requested from the Government regarding the
responsible counterpart for the sub-component and the new strategic focus, the issue
remained pending for the remainder of the project and no further activities were supported.
This component was affected by an overall change in the Government’s commitment
surrounding the disclosure of statistical information. Nevertheless, starting in 2012, rather
than changing the process of receiving requests, the CCO decided to invest in developing
a monitoring system to centralize information on the processing of access to information
requests from Ministries and Agencies, and improved the publishing of information online
for citizens via different websites (ArgentinaComparte, Internet Sano, Argentina.gob.ar,
Sitio del Ciudidano etc.) without support from the project.

24.     Recurrent delays in the procurement of the largest IT components as well as
pending reforms to e-government led to a second restructuring in 2013 to allow for the
completion of the final stage of project activities. The Quality Assessment of Lending
Portfolio (QALP) Review (March 2010) also highlighted the issues of IT procurement
contributing to a slowdown in IT related components. Work during this second extension
period was to focus upon finalizing the e-government architecture and rolling out key
software, such as the Digital Files for the Public Administration (EDAP) which enables
electronic procedures and services for citizens (captured in the PDO indicator target of six
Government-to-Citizen (G2C) services). Initially, implementation progressed well, but
then challenges in the procurement of EDAP related goods emerged and the team lowered
overall implementation progress to moderately satisfactory. EDAP was not fully developed
before project closing on December 31, 2014, though five fully automated procedures were
completed by June 2015.

Implementation Ratings




                                             7
25.     Up to 2011, the Bank had rated the overall process of implementation as
satisfactory. However, from 2011 forward, ratings vacillated between MU, MS, and S in
the Implementation Status Reports (ISRs). A QALP Review conducted in March 2010
rated the quality of implementation as moderately satisfactory. As mentioned, the project’s
scope covered multiple departments within the CCO and involved a number of Ministries
and Agencies in the adoption of new tools and business processes on a demand basis.
During implementation a series of challenges emerged. Some of these issues had
implications not only on the pace of implementation of the overall project but also on the
need for adjustments in the activities and direction of the reforms.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

26.     The Project’s M&E framework is considered to be modest. The design of the
operation’s M&E system exhibited some weaknesses and the implementation of
performance monitoring across the sub-components and activities proved difficult to
manage. While some of the original shortcomings were overcome during the first
restructuring, particularly in relation to the clarification of terms and targets, weaknesses
in the operation’s M&E design proved challenging to the evaluation of the operation’s
impact.

27.     M&E Design: The Results Framework included in Annex 3 of the PAD specified
seven Project Outcome Indicators and 31 intermediate outcome indicators which
monitored a mixture of higher level impacts and outputs of sub-component activities. A
few of the PDO indicators were also repeated as intermediate indicators. The design of the
result’s framework was not amenable to changes in the underlying activities of sub-
components, as discussed in section 2.1. This was only partially corrected with the changes
introduced in the results framework in the first restructuring where many indicators were
either rephrased or changed. Such changes are indicative of elements of both a corrective
and adaptive restructuring to fix design flaws in the original indicators and improve the
relevance of the activities and associated results framework, in light of changes in
government priorities. Moreover, over seven years, some of the indicators were subject to
multiple interpretations. 13 In some cases, the indicator itself was not well-specified. For
example, “design and implementation of the IT system” is not immediately clear which IT
system was being measured. Finally, the QALP (March 2010) review also highlighted the
need to introduce flexibility into the results framework.




13
   An example is the PDO indicator on the number of Freedom of Information (FOI) requests submitted by
electronic means. During implementation, this indicator was considered by the Government and Bank team
to have been achieved. Though Decree 1172 required that information requests be presented manually, the
Government made progress in increasing the online publication of information via different websites.
However, for the purposes of this ICR, a stricter interpretation based on the target set forth in the PAD
finds this indicator to have not been achieved (see Annex 10 for more details).



                                                    8
28.     M&E Implementation: Building off of processes begun during the first loan, the
PIU was well prepared to monitor progress and collect data regularly throughout
implementation. The PIU prepared bi-annual reports with details on activities and indicator
updates. Data collection relied heavily on meetings and reports by the counterparts
involved in each of the sub-components. Information on key project outputs and indicator
progress was regularly collected as part of the Bank’s supervision efforts. In the
Implementation Status and Results Reports, monitoring and evaluation was rated
Satisfactory throughout the project’s lifetime.

29.     M&E Utilization: Monitoring              Performance Dashboards
Dashboards were designed to monitor
the ongoing activities of relevant       • SIG Expedientes
departments/agencies,       including    • SIG Proyectos (SSEPFE)
those activities financed by the loan.   • Tablero de Metas Ministeriales (SIG Metas)
These dashboards were (and continue      • Tablero de Metas SSGEP
to be) used in decision-making           • SIG Proyectos - JGM (Comité de Emergencia

Gestión y Empleo Público). These             Programa Carta Compromiso para el Ciudadano
dashboards are being used to track       • Tablero del Premio Nacional a la Calidad (PNC)
performance across government, not       • Tablero de Seguimiento de Proyectos del

dashboards in different divisions of     • SIG Proyectos (SSTG)
the CCO. The full list of these
dashboards is presented in the table.
The management of these dashboards is now a core function of the CCO.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance
30.           Safeguards: No safeguard policies were triggered by the Project.

31.     Financial Management: Overall, financial management performance is considered
to have been Satisfactory. Some issues arose at the start of the project when Bank funds
were used to cover the share of government expenditures because of differing
interpretations of the legal agreement. Financial management performance was
downgraded to MS as a result. 14 These issues were quickly resolved and FM performance
was rated satisfactory in the remaining ISRs. The use of the government’s accounting
system to maintain project records provided an acceptable control framework over
transactions.

32.     Annual financial statements were subject to external oversight by Argentina’s
General Auditing Office (Auditoría General de la Nación - AGN). The audit report
covering operations to December 31, 2009 had an unqualified (clean) opinion on the
designated account. Qualified opinions were given on the Project Basic Financial
Statements and the SOE but did not point to any substantive issues. The audit report for
2010 showed qualified audit opinions on all basic financial statements and the SOE
statement. However, the substance of the audit qualifications did not entail accountability
issues or material weaknesses. The project responded adequately to AGN observations in
a note dated October 2011.

33.     Procurement: Overall, procurement performance is considered to have been
Moderately Satisfactory. Initially, procurement performance ratings were rated
Satisfactory through ISR#5 and then were downgraded to Moderately Satisfactory for the
remainder of the project (ISRs# 6-16). There were recurrent delays and cancellations in
the initiation of the largest procurement processes. During implementation there were
frequent delays in the delivering of procurement plans – in a number of cases the Annual
Operational Plans and Procurement Plans were not delivered at the same time. These
challenges were partially the result of changes in strategic direction which occurred
periodically throughout the duration of the project. Towards the end of the project, changes
in the PIU’s procurement team further delayed efficient processing due to limited capacity.
While procurement post-reviews were conducted and recommendations to improve
processing were made, in some cases the recommendations were only partially
implemented.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

34.     As of project closure, advances related to a number of the key public sector
modernization tools have been well-institutionalized, suggested by their on-going use
within the CCO, and in some cases Line Ministries and Agencies. Moreover, the extensive
reduction in consultants over the life of the project (as agreed upon at the start of the
Project) from a ceiling of 199 in 2008 to 55 in December 2014 resulted in a significant
transfer of skills to key functions within the CCO and helped ensure greater post-
completion sustainability. Following project closing, the majority of the consultants (47)
were absorbed by other projects financed by the United National Development Program
(UNDP) and the Inter-American Development Bank (IADB). 15



15
   At the start of the Second State Modernization project, a detailed plan was put in place to reduce the
number of consultants being financed through project funds and transfer skills to Government. An
agreement was reached to improve the selection, performance and supervision of consultants, enhance
training and knowledge transfer to government employees. Over time, there was a significant reduction in
the number of consultants being financed through the project and a transfer of skills to government funded
positions. By the end of 2008, there were 177 consultants working for the project (below the ceiling of 199
for 2008). The declining trend continued with 120 consultants at the end of 2011 - the project’s original
closing date. The schedule for hiring individual consultants was reassessed during the first project
restructuring, maintaining the ceiling of 120 until December 2013. By the end of 2013 there were 95
consultants working for the project and at project closing 55 consultants were working for the project.


                                                    10
35.     With respect to IT, a few of the systems that have been introduced such as digital
signatures are highly utilized, and it seems likely that they will continue to be so in the
future (similar to such systems and tools elsewhere). The EDAP platform, which is now
fully developed, allows for the interoperability of services through various government
portals and is expected to become the basis for additional online transactional public
services across the administration.

36.     While the Bank does not currently have immediate plans for a follow-up operation,
the topics addressed under the Project remain of high relevance and are expected to
continue to remain as such in the future – both at the national and sub-national levels.
UNDP and IADB also have active operations in a number of the areas supported by this
project. 16

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design, and Implementation
37.     Project objectives were substantial at the time of design (with the 2006-2008 CAS
including public sector strengthening as one of the pillars) and remained relevant
throughout implementation. The FY 10-12 CPS 17 had a pillar on governance and the
recently approved Country Partnership Strategy for FY 15-18 18 includes a cross-portfolio
approach to Governance, which continues work on areas such as developing institutional
transparency and improving capacity building programs for public servants, and
incorporates lessons from large public sector modernization projects at the national level
(including SMP I and II). The modernization efforts supported under this project remain
relevant to Argentinean authorities both at the national and sub-national levels, as reflected
by the degree of usage and institutionalization of most of the tools and systems supported
under this project.

38.     The relevance of the project’s design to the objective is considered substantial. The
original design focused on making incremental but impactful progress on areas of public
management requiring modernization across the national government. The design
acknowledged that the direction and pace of reforms would be highly dependent on the
political commitment and orientation of the highest authority (i.e. the Cabinet Chief) and
included a range of potential options in which to deepen reforms. Adjustments were made
during implementation via restructurings to align activities with the PDO based on these
fluctuations in political orientation and normal changes in information technology.
Necessary adjustments were made through two project restructurings, the extension of the
closing date twice, and other forms of proactive implementation support. While the design
of the components was consistent with the project’s objectives, the quality of the result’s

   UNDP’s project (ARG/12/012) is designed to promote and strengthen the strategies of the CCO to
improve attention to the citizen and contribute to the institutionalization of quality public management.

framework exhibited minor weaknesses in specifying the causal chain between
intermediate and final outcomes for a few of the areas covered by the project.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

39.    Prior to addressing the achievement of the project’s development objective, it is
important to clarify how the efficacy of the project is rated. In line with the ICR guidelines,
the overall project performance is a weighted average of the two primary objectives, as
described in the project development objective. Each objective is rated equally. To assess
each objective, PDO and intermediate outcome indicators, as well supplementary evidence,
are used to arrive at an overall assessment. Annex 10 provides a detailed analysis of this
evidence base, organized by objective.

40.    Overall, the project is viewed to have demonstrated progress in achieving its
development objectives of strengthening the capacity of the CCO to (i) carry out its
mandate in key public sector management areas for improved coordination, monitoring and
evaluation (rated substantial); and (ii) support the design and promotion of the use of key
public sector management tools (in the areas of e-government, procurement, human
resource management, and social accountability), as well as improved capacity for
investment promotion (rated modest).

41.    Each of the objectives stated in the PDO entail strengthening the functions of the
Chief of Cabinet Office. As such, it is useful to review two of the specific functions
assigned to the CCO:
    • Inter-ministerial coordination: coordination and control of activities among
       different Ministries to comply with public policies and budget objectives.
       Preparation and coordination of Cabinet meetings.
    • Congressional relations: Coordination between the Executive and Legislative
       branches. Send to Congress the projects of the Law of Ministries and National
       Budget. Endorse decrees and present reports to each of the Houses, once per month,
       on the accomplishment of objectives and public policies implemented by the
       Ministries. Annually, to produce a State Memoire for Congress.

42.     For the purposes of analyzing the first objective, we review those achievements
related to general organizational strengthening of the CCO as an entity and those related
specifically to its monitoring functions. First, we review the PDO and intermediate
indicators related to organizational strengthening of the CCO. The tasks associated with
the integrated functional assessment were finalized (achievement of PDO#1),
communication strategies based on successful experience from prior years are used,
participation mechanisms are used regularly and a pilot inventory of physical assets was
completed (achievement of intermediate indicators). The pilot on assets management
implemented since 2010 in the main building of the CCO yielded an average of
AR$327,000 ($38,000 USD) in annual energy savings.




                                              12
43.     Improvements to the CCO’s monitoring capabilities were also substantially
achieved. Included among the achievements, the proposed budgets of four agencies cite
SISEG reports as a source (achievement of PDO#3), ten dashboards to monitor public
policies and projects have been developed and are in use, and seven agencies have strategic
planning processes that enable the application of a system of results based management.
One of the dashboards, SIG Metas, allows the CCO to track performance objectives and
goals across the national public administration. In 2014, the system included 204 objectives
and 272 goals. Using traffic light visualization, the system provides alerts on the level of
achievement of indicators on a quarterly basis. The Chief of Cabinet prepares reports and
presents this information for discussion with Congress. Annex 12 contains a visual of the
2014 objective setting process for SIG Metas and an example of the goals and indicators
used by the Ministry of Interior and Transport.

44.      Given the difficulty in measuring institutional strengthening with the existing PDO
indicators (particularly since a few of the PDO indicators are output indicators), it is useful
to consider additional measures of institutional strengthening. The first is the process of
institutionalization of key functions and units within the architecture of the public sector.
For example, the Public Management Sub-secretariat was raised to the rank of a Cabinet
Secretariat and the assets management function of CCO was formalized with the creation
of the Administration Agency of State Assets under the CCO, with competencies over asset
registry and policy design on the management of central government buildings. A “Public
Policy Evaluation Program” was also established within the Cabinet and Administrative
Coordination Secretariat of the CCO. A number of decrees and regulations related to
modernizing the public administration have also helped to institutionalize the CCO’s role
within the National Public Administration (a full list is included in Annex 9).

45.     Another indication of improvements in the functioning of the CCO is the move
toward staffing the functions of the CCO by permanent staff rather than consultants. As
discussed in section 2.5, there was a significant reduction in the number of consultants
being financed through the project and a transfer of skills to government-funded positions.
This ensures that with changes in administration, a knowledgeable cohort of staff remain
in their positions. The organizational strengthening of the CCO, measured by changes in
staffing and structure and improvements in its capability to perform the functions of inter-
ministerial coordination and Congressional relations, indicates the project achieved the
objective of strengthening the CCO’s functions.

46.     The second objective as stated in the PDO was to strengthen the CCO’s capacity to
support Line Ministries and Agencies in the implementation of public policies (since the
CCO has no direct service delivery functions). This facilitation is done through the design
of tools and modernization of processes and systems related to ICT, hiring, procurement,
and reporting across the national public administration. As stated in the PDO, this entails
the design and use of modern e-government, procurement, human resource management,
and social accountability tools, as well as improves the capacity for investment promotion.
This objective is rated modest. In the areas of citizen charters, investment promotion, and
e-government, notable advances have been made. However, these have been somewhat
offset by more limited progress in the areas of procurement, HRM and access to



                                              13
information. The box below provides a summary of the achievements by tool. A summary
of the main achievements by sub-components is discussed below.

                                   Achievements by sub-component
 •      E-Government                                           Achieved
 •      Procurement                                            Partially Achieved
 •      Human Resource Management                              Partially Achieved
 •      Quality Management and Access to Information           Partially Achieved
 •      Investment Promotion                                   Achieved


47.        E-government – Achieved
This sub-component supported activities related to strengthening the National Information
Technology Office (ONTI); consolidating the government portal and online proceedings; and
developing new activities, such as national plans for enterprise architecture and ICT standards, as
well as implementing a secure data center. The specific objectives of this sub-component were to
improve the institutional coordination for e-government and implement a comprehensive e-
government environment that would provide a common development approach and coordinate the
development of an integrated, secure, and paperless administration. The impact of this sub-
component is likely to have been substantial. Achievement of the indicator related to the EDAP
(PDO#7) was almost achieved. The development of the platform and processes for five (rather than
six) fully automated public services lays the foundation for further automation across a range of
public services. Seventy-six agencies (well above the original target of 10 agencies) are using
digital signatures, contributing to efficiency gains from time-savings and processing, and 14,000
digital certificates have been issued, allowing individuals (citizens and public servants, including
subnational government and Judicial Courts) to exchange information more rapidly. All four
intermediate indicators were achieved, capturing significant improvements in the visits to the
government portal, user satisfaction with the portal, a unified platform (e-COMDOC which records
the administrative proceedings conducted by public agencies), and security data center in full
operation.

48.        Procurement – Partially Achieved
This sub-component supported the use of electronic tools for government procurement throughout
the federal administration (e-purchasing, e-procurement, and ArgentinaCompra). The project also
supported capacity-building to regulate national government procurement through the introduction
of a public procurement performance monitoring system. The project was able to make progress
in increasing the base number of suppliers participating in procurement processes (achievement of
PDO#4). Due to changes in ICT, 19 the SECOP procurement system was supplanted by a newer AR
COMPRAS system which the project supported. AR COMPRAS is currently in its initial stages of
development. The system is fully operational in the CCO and will be gradually rolled out across
the national public administration in the near future. The expected expansion in the use of a single
procurement portal (AR COMPRAS) to a number of government procuring entities has laid the




19
     Such changes in ICT systems are quite normal over five to ten years as technology evolves.



                                                      14
foundation for future efficiency gains and reductions in transaction costs for government
procurement.

49.      Human Resource Management - Partially Achieved
This sub-component supported the rationalization of employment regimes and posts, improvements
to the availability of human resource management information, and knowledge sharing and training.
While progress was made with respect to the areas of knowledge sharing and training and the
rationalization of employment regimes, less progress was made in unifying underlying information
systems. In 2012, as a result of changes in technological platforms and a government decision to
invest in new systems, the Government took a different direction and decided to invest in the
establishment of a new personnel registry (the Base Única del Personal del Estado [BUPE 20]) and
a human resource management system (the Sistema de Administración de Recursos Humanos
[SARHA]) in the CCO. Until October 2011, the project was investing resources in the expansion
in coverage of the previous centralized personnel registry (Sistema de Información de Personal
[SINFO]). The percentage of personnel incorporated into the SINFO system in operation until
2012 was 80%, just below the target of 90% (partial achievement of PDO#5). More progress was
made in the rationalization of labor regimes and position with 9,400 position profiles defined. The
development and implementation of the CONCURSAR platform, which manages internal and
external applications to positions in the National Public Employment System (Sistema Nacional de
Empleo Público [SINEP]) and other technical and scientific grades. It is used by 15 Ministries and
Agencies, and four additional organizations are in the initial stages of implementation. The
knowledge dissemination and training activities offered by the National Institute of Public
Administration (INAP) have also been achieved with over 140,000 officials trained through e-
learning platforms. Evaluations of 50 courses have reached satisfaction levels higher than 80%,
according to an evaluation performed under this component.

50.      Quality Management and Access to Information – Partially Achieved
This sub-component covered the aspects of the citizen charter program and implementation of the
access to information decree.
    • Citizen Charter Program (CCP): Activities focused on improvements to the design and
        implementation of the CCP in five areas: (i) improving the definition of indicators, quality
        standards, and benchmarks for each of the participating agencies; (ii) developing
        information dissemination systems to better reach citizens; (iii) expanding channels and
        methodologies for users’ and citizens’ feedback; (iv) developing protocols for provincial
        governments interested in replicating the Citizens’ Charter approaches and methodologies;
        and (v) the development of Quality Management Systems. At present, 43 organizations
        have been incorporated into the Program, of which 31 are at the national level. Satisfaction
        rates on services provided under the Citizen Charter Program service delivery, measured
        by independent evaluations, reached 70%, just below the target of 90% (partial
        achievement of PDO#6). However, a 70% satisfaction rate is generally considered good
        (in line with practices from other countries 21). The target of 90% was likely overambitious




20
   BUPE replaced the previous centralized personnel registry (Sistema de Información de Personal
(SINFO)).
21
   Citizen satisfaction rates with Citizen Charters in the UK ranged from 65%-85%. See Table 6 in:
http://lilt.ilstu.edu/staylor/csdcb/articles/Volume6/Pinney%201993.pdf. Also see the Public Affairs Centre,
“India’s Citizen’s Charters: A Decade of Experience,” 2007.


                                                    15
          at design. Moreover, user’s understanding of the quality standards, goals, and indicators
          adopted by CCP agencies measured through annual surveys exceeded the target of 70%
          (achievement of the intermediate indicator). The development of a Citizen Charters
          dashboard to monitor and evaluate commitments of each of the signed Charters is also
          currently in use by all of the entities involved in the program. It contains data on the level
          of achievement of indicators and commitments, as well as historical information. More
          efficient ways of providing services, as committed by public sector officials through the
          CCP, has helped to improved service provision.
      •   Access to Information: The project supported an initial set of activities to undertake a
          diagnosis of the information that could be proactively disclosed by the different federal
          agencies. It also included activities to work on mechanisms, processes, and training to
          strengthen the capacity of officials of the federal administration (including jurisdictions of
          selected federal agencies located in the interior of the country) and awareness-raising to
          strengthen implementation of the decree. The electronic platform for information request
          submissions and handling was not supported for the reasons discussed in the
          implementation section above. As such, the access to information indicator (PDO#2) was
          not achieved since the legal framework was not changed to allow for it. Under the project,
          a Cooperation Agreement between Mexico and Argentina was signed in 2008 on Access
          to Information, as well as awareness-raising activities. As discussed earlier, the CCO did
          develop a monitoring system to centralize information on the processing of access to
          information requests from Ministries and Agencies and improved the publishing of
          information online for citizens via different websites (Guía de Trámites,
          ArgentinaComparte, Internet Sano, Argentina.gob.ar, Sitio del Ciudidano, etc.).

51.       Investment Promotion 22 - Achieved
This sub-component supported the government investment promotion strategy through two parallel
channels. The first channel aimed at supporting knowledge building, including the competitive
advantage of selected sectors and clusters, and capacity strengthening of the Investment Promotion
Agency in key areas to leverage potential for investment promotion. The second channel supported
an array of activities aiming at strengthening the Investment Promotion Agency’s policymaking
functions, including the development of different investment promotion instruments. In the area of
investment promotion, the results of the activities were measured by two corresponding
intermediate indicators (showing that ANDI successfully developed a methodology for comparable
assessment of sectors and clusters, which was applied to seven priority sectors/clusters, and that
the strategy for strengthening local business capacities reached the targeted 20 businesses). Over
126 investment projects are currently in the Database of Projects of Productive Innovation (Banco
de Proyectos de Innovacion Productiva [BAPIP]). Such interventions improved the capacity of the
Investment Promotion Agency to monitor and analyze private sector investment nation-wide.




22
   For the purposes of analyzing the results of the operation, the sub-component on investment promotion is
considered among the tools to modernize the public administration. In the PAD, this component was
designed as part of the first objective (institutional strengthening of the CCO). The reasons for assessing it
in relation to the tools (the second objective) is because of the change in the location of the function within
the public administration (ANDI, originally under the CCO, was dismantled in 2010 and moved to the
Secretariat for Trade and International Economic Relations (SCREI) within the Ministry of Foreign
Relations, International Commerce and Culture (MRECIC). Moreover, the activities supported under this
component were specific to the function of investment promotion

For a comprehensive analysis of the results of each objective and sub-component see
Annex 10 and Annex 2 for the list of outputs by component.


3.3 Efficiency

52.     Project efficiency is considered to be modest. Given the nature of the project, no
formal economic cost-benefit analysis was performed at the time of design. While results,
such as increases in the number of suppliers participating in procurement processes, are
likely to contribute to savings from greater competition and enhanced efficiency, it is
difficult to quantify such benefits given the lack of concrete data. At best, benchmarking
data can be used to estimate impacts.

53.     The PAD’s Economic and Financial Analysis listed a number of potential financial,
economic, and social impacts by component. The proposed impacts mainly relate to
efficiencies generated from improvements in the delivery of public services, such as
reductions in cost of outputs and time-savings for citizens and businesses. To the extent
possible, these impacts have been updated based on the results of the project and are
captured in Annex 3. Some of the achievements, such as systems development and capacity
building, affect back-office processes, and while it is expected that such improvements in
delivery will end up contributing to improved services for citizens and businesses, such
gains are difficult to quantify.

54.    Total registered project costs, including local support, for the project which was
implemented over the course of seven years were USD22.22 million. In terms of IT
systems development, across the sub-components, USD4 million was invested in e-
government, USD1.3 million in procurement, USD1.8 million in human resource
management, and USD2.5 million in monitoring and evaluation, which included the
development of online dashboards (see Annex 11 for further details).

55.     While a detailed economic and financial analysis is not possible given data
limitations, an analysis of benefits derived from project activities measured in the results
framework suggests that in two areas the project investments of achieving the objective
were reasonable. These include e-government and monitoring and evaluation activities.
With the USD4 million invested in e-government, 76 agencies are using digital signatures,
contributing to efficiency gains from time-savings and processing moving towards an
integrated, secure, and paperless administration. Digital certificates have been issued to
over 14,000 individuals, allowing citizens and public servants of different ministries,
agencies, subnational governments and Judicial Courts to exchange information more
rapidly and use less paper. More information is available through the portal for citizens and
businesses, contributing to reduced “searching” time and more accurate information on
processes (reducing errors in applications). The Procedures Guide has over 1,400
procedures included in the system from 74 different Government agencies. Presently, the
site has roughly 3.2 million visits annually. The implementation of EDAP for managing
files digitally allows for the online provision of transactional services for citizens. Pilot

implementation includes the following five Government-to-Citizen (G-2-C) transactional
services:
          o discrimination complaints;
          o registration of Civil Society Organizations;
          o registration for service providers of assistance for beneficiaries of
             individual subsidies;
          o granting of tickets for inquires and guidance on addiction problems; and
          o granting the benefit of caregivers allowance.

56.     With USD2.5 million invested in monitoring and evaluation, the project has been
able to develop 10 executive dashboards in use across the National Public Administration.
These dashboards now play an important role in decision-making processes, driving
improvements in public administration functioning. SIG Metas, the dashboard used to
monitor national performance targets, is supporting the achievement of defined
performance targets across Ministries (see Annex 12, Figure 2 for the Ministry of Interior
and Transport’s specific targets). Other dashboards (such as SIG Proyectos) have improved
administration efficiency and accuracy. While no studies were conducted over the course
of the project to assess these gains, similar e-government projects elsewhere have captured
the time and financial savings to end users from ICT enabled efficiency improvements. 23

57.     Nevertheless, aspects of project implementation likely reduced the efficiency of
some activities. In line with ICR guidelines, beyond traditional measures of efficiency, the
review should take into account aspects of design and implementation that reduced
efficiency. As discussed in the implementation section, the restructuring and two
extensions of the project as a result of procurement issues and delays in political decision-
making reduced the overall efficiency in a number of the sub-components.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

58.      The overall outcome rating is considered to be Moderately Satisfactory (See Table
1), reflecting moderate shortcomings in the operation’s achievement of its objectives. Over
the course of implementation, the project made substantial progress towards its
development objective of strengthening the capacity of the CCO to carry out its mandate
and some progress in increasing the use of modern e-government, procurement, human
resource management and social accountability tools among the national public
administration. The design of the project reflected a good understanding of development
challenges that continue to remain relevant today. The efficiency of the project is difficult

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

59.     Through the promotion of effective public sector management across the national
public administration, the operation has had indirect but positive impact on citizens. While
the project was not designed to have a direct impact on poverty, gender, or social
development, the modernization of institutions that deliver key services in these areas has
helped to support the Government’s achievement of key public policy priorities. For
example, the automation of five G2C transactional services supported by the project
improves access and processing for discrimination complaints, granting the benefit of
caregiver allowances and assistance for beneficiaries of individual subsidies among others.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

60.     This project has been an important catalyst in the institutional strengthening of the
Chief of Cabinet Office established in 1994. From a long-term institutional development
perspective, the activities begun during SMP I and continued in the second loan have
strengthened the CCO’s ability to perform critical functions related to inter-ministerial
coordination and the promotion of improved processes and systems across the national
public administration. Through this project, the World Bank has maintained a continuous
policy dialogue on state modernization and other important areas for the country’s
development with the authorities over the last decade. This dialogue has kept state
modernization squarely on the agenda, despite numerous changes in leadership.
61.     Beyond the Chief of Cabinet Office, the project contributed to the institutional
strengthening of a significant number of Ministries and Agencies. Across the national
public administration, 18 ministries and agencies are using the Ministerial Goals
Dashboard (Tablero de Metas Ministeriales – SIG Metas), and every federal agency is
included in the National Portal’s Procedures Guide. A number of Ministries and Agencies
have adopted more than one of the tools under this project. Examples include the Ministry


                                             19
of Labor; the National Institute against Discrimination, Xenophobia, and Racism (INADI);
and the Social Security National Administration (ANSES) among others. The pilot in the
Nuclear Regulatory Agency (ARN) brought together strategic planning methodologies
linked to budget and monitoring and evaluation as well as career profiles and training.
62.     As a by-product of a few of the activities under this project, a few subnational
entities were also impacted. In the area of monitoring and evaluation, the project engaged
subnational entities through an agreement between the Federal Institute of Municipal
Affairs (IFAM) and the CCO to assist with M&E tools in local government. Up to six local
governments were included under this program. The project also assisted CCO with the
Committees of the Federal Council of Public Administration (COFEFUP) that took place
in different provinces to foster innovation in subnational public administration.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

63.    None identified.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

64.    No beneficiary survey or stakeholder workshops were conducted.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Moderate

65.      The progress made under the project is likely to be sustained for a number of
reasons. First, the legal framework provided by laws and decrees on digital signature,
human resources management, and procurement, makes the sustainability of project
outcomes more likely, as it provides the normative framework to move forward with
development and implementation of these public sector management tools (see Annex 9
for full list of relevant decrees). Second, the large transfer of consultants to permanent civil
servant status has improved the continuity in the staffing of functions within the CCO,
reducing turnover. Third, a number of the reforms have prompted the further
institutionalization of departments within the public administration (as discussed earlier).
The creation of these agencies as permanent entities within Argentina’s public sector
denotes strong support for the modernization efforts on the part of Argentinean authorities.
Finally, the use of the tools by Ministries and Agencies has embedded a demand for support
from the CCO. A number of the tools that this project supported are being used by
Ministries and Agencies (e.g. EDAP and SISEG). These tools and systems developed
through this project have been incorporated into the agencies’ current procedures and are
unlikely to be reversed. Pilot experiences on integrating the work on strategic planning
and M&E have improved the dialogue and joint work of different departments with
important synergies created, as with the planning and M&E dashboards. The moderate,
rather than low, risk rating for these reforms is due to the fact that changes in government
leadership and commitment could potentially stall reforms going forward, and in
exceptional circumstances, undermine existing arrangements, though this appears unlikely.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance


                                              20
5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

66.    During project preparation the Bank team drew upon its significant experience in
Argentina in general as well as its specific experience working with the State
Modernization I project.

67.     At design the team appropriately rated the risks of the operation as high.
Implementation risks and their effects on the project were also reasonably well anticipated
at the design stage. Policy commitment was rated as a high risk to the project. At the time
of design, project counterparts demonstrated active commitment, but over the course of
implementation this commitment varied. While these risks were recognized at the time of
design, the calibration of activities and components to these high risks could have been
better reflected in the design of the program, which covered a number of distinct reform
areas. Coordination within the CCO and among line ministries was given a rating of
substantial, although mitigating measures were also not sufficient for reducing the costs of
coordination entailed by the design of the project. Finally, the difficulty of ‘locking’ in
incremental steps into the Results Framework could have been better anticipated at design.

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
68.     The Bank team provided continued and strong technical support during
supervision, though a few aspects could have been improved. The Bank’s ability to
convene international expertise with respect to specific components was valued by the
counterpart. Over Video Conferences and during missions, the Bank held technical
discussions to facilitate advances towards project objectives. On the other hand, prior to
the first restructuring implementation, problems were not always signaled in the ISR
ratings (ratings were satisfactory). The team only downgraded the procurement rating to
moderately satisfactory during implementation despite recurrent delays and cancellations
in the initiation of the largest procurement processes. After the first restructuring, the
ratings better reflected implementation problems, oscillating between MS, MU and S.

69.     The project also experienced turnover in TTLs – three TTLs during the life of the
project. This turnover likely contributed to different approaches to supporting
implementation. With more consistent attention, additional adjustments to the Results
Framework could have been pursued during restructurings and more clarification and
consensus on the measurement of indicators may have improved the tracking of results.
Additional procurement support on the part of the Bank would also have helped to resolve
issues faster.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
70.     Overall Bank performance is considered to have been moderately satisfactory. At
design, the risks to the project were well specified and the design of components reflected



                                            21
a solid understanding of the reform trajectory. However, the calibration of activities and
components to these high risks could have been better reflected in design, and selectivity
in the results framework would have enabled more flexibility. During supervision, while
the Bank team provided continued and strong technical support, there was evidence of a
disconnect between the problems encountered and the assessment of implementation
progress.

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance and Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
71.     Given the unique position of the CCO (the implementing agency) at the apex of
government, government performance and implementing agency are considered
indistinguishable for the purposes of this assessment. The government’s political
commitment was highly uneven over the course of the project. Frequent changes to the
position of Chief of Cabinet had a detrimental effect on progress among all components of
the project. Continuous changes in strategy and courses of action associated with high
turnover undermined the pace and quality of implementing project activities.

72.      While this turnover at the political level had an impact on project performance, at
the technical level counterparts were able to identify ‘windows of opportunity’ to push
forward reforms and maintain momentum, even if it entailed shifting course. The
institutionalization of the project within the CCO, solid management of the PIU, and a
willingness of the borrower to make adjustments, enabled the project to continuously adapt
to these changes and maintain relevance. At the end of the first project, an important
institutional advancement was the creation of the State Modernization Project Directorate
in 2005 housed under the Chief of Cabinet Office. It was responsible for coordinating the
implementation of state modernization efforts, and the PIU was fully integrated within the
Directorate for most of the project’s duration. In 2013, it was transferred to the Sub-
secretariat for Management and Public Employment.

73.     In general, the PIU comprised a reasonably solid project management team. During
implementation, the PIU did a good job of adjusting to the range of challenges encountered
but did suffer from changes in staffing turnover, which reduced the efficiency of
procurement processing toward the end of the project’s lifetime. The PIU fulfilled its
responsibilities, including monitoring project activities, keeping records of all procurement
operations, ensuring compliance with Bank guidelines, monitoring compliance with legal
covenants, maintaining records for all activities, preparing and submitting progress reports
to the Bank, and closely collaborating with the preparation of this ICR. The permanency
of some key PIU staff throughout the life of the project was an important factor ensuring a
minimum level of continuity despite frequent changes in management and strategic
direction.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory




                                             22
74.    Overall performance of the Borrower is rated moderately satisfactory for the
reasons described above.

6. Lessons Learned

75.      A number of the lessons learned from the first operation remain relevant for the
second (see Annex 11 for lessons from SMP I). 24 Principally, the importance of not
underestimating the level of coordination required by cross-governmental tools, which
not only engaged different CCO departments but multiple Ministries and Agencies across
the national public administration. Piloting reforms, as demonstrated by the case of the
ARN, is important to gauging likely implementation challenges. Moreover, similar to the
first project, the process of altering the structure and functioning of the public
administration is an arduous, long-term, and incremental process. A few common themes
emerge from SMP I and II of relevance to similar projects involved in reforms to the
center of government:

Frequent fluctuations in reform space

76.     Engaging in reforms at the center of government entails acknowledging shifts in
political priorities and reform space that will constrain implementation. The political
support for the operation set the pace of implementation and many of the reforms pursued
required a substantial investment of political capital in order to nudge Ministries and
Agencies to adopt changes. These shifts in the goal post significantly affected project
implementation.

77.    Horizontal cross-agency reforms should be limited to only a few areas in
environments of fluctuating political commitment. This operation touched on major
reform areas – procurement, civil service, asset management, performance frameworks,
etc. Such diffusion increased the costs of coordination and required substantial political
leadership. For future operations, a more pragmatic design focused on a limited set of areas
and acknowledging the incremental nature of such reforms may work better in
environments with frequently changing political priorities.

Elevated coordination costs

78.     The efforts entailed in coordination should not be underestimated in advancing
horizontal reforms, particularly when not tied to incentive structures, such as financing).
The implementation of horizontal tools increases the costs of coordination substantially.
The number of Ministries and Agencies involved and the levels of staff that need to be
engaged resulted in a complex coordination process. Moreover, without links to the budget
or other types of incentives, engagement can be difficult. But once the costs of coordination
and successful implementation are overcome, such reforms are difficult to reverse.

pg. 38-40.


                                                  23
Flexibility of design and instrument

79.     To accompany such reforms, significant agility in the project’s reform trajectory
and implementation are needed to remain relevant to shifting priorities over time. There
is a trade-off inherent in using a lending instrument to support modernization reforms
which needs a solid project design up front to evaluate achievements, yet must be flexible
and adaptable enough to shifts in reform trajectories. The design of the project recognized
the incremental and gradual pace of reform, but these incremental steps were solidified in
a results framework which was at times out of sync with government reform efforts, despite
two restructurings. Moreover, to keep pace with the political changes likely would have
required a minimum of five restructurings (to align with the political cycle and changes in
management direction). This seems rather excessive for a TAL, and given this need, the
choice of instrument should be more carefully considered in the future.

80.     The use of ICT in advancing reform progress is highly constrained by leadership
and organizational factors. The work on the systems aspects – software and hardware –
was not immune to the political changes and organizational factors. Large ICT investment
in a context of shifting priorities and lacking a broadly accepted strategy is both difficult
to manage and easy to reverse. A number of the delays and difficulties in procurement
processes, as well as the factors behind the uptake of some of the systems by Ministries
and Agencies, can be traced back to these factors.

81.     Despite notable advances in the modernization of specific functions assigned to
the Chief of Cabinet Office, particularly in relation to monitoring public sector
performance and advancing the e-government agenda, there remains space to further
build the technical capabilities to execute the broad range of functions assigned to the
Cabinet Office. Further strengthening of critical oversight functions, such as human
resource management and public procurement, will enable the CCO to facilitate the
continued modernization of the national public administration and therefore better serve
the government and citizens. This will further sustain and extend achievements begun
under the state modernization I and II projects.

                               (competitive procedures to fill vacancies) in the national
                               public administration. It has reduced the time that applicants
                               must take to apply, reduced errors, increased the speed of the
                               process, and made the process substantially more transparent
                               from the point of view of an applicant.

             INAP          •   140,000 public servants have been trained through INAP’s e-
                               learning platforms. Such training may result in improvements
                               in the effectiveness and efficiency of service delivery.
Quality      Citizens      •   43 agencies are incorporated into the Citizen Charter
management   Charter           Program. Regularly performed surveys marked an average of
             Program           70 % level of satisfaction and understanding by citizens. The
                               program has contributed to enhanced accountability of
                               service delivery through improved quality management based
                               on users' inputs. More efficient ways of providing services, as
                               committed by public sector officials through the CCP, has
                               helped to improved services provision.

Preparación y diseño del proyecto

En relación a este punto, se concuerda con lo reportado por el Banco en el ICR.

Para la UCP el diseño del segundo préstamo fue ambicioso. En particular, en la
combinación de productos, los impactos esperados y los tiempos estipulados para su
desarrollo. La matriz de indicadores y metas a alcanzar en el tiempo del proyecto fue rígida.
En algunos casos, faltó una adecuada cadena causal entre los indicadores centrales (PDO)
y los intermedios. Esta mención cobra especial valor cuando se analiza la evaluación de
los riesgos del proyecto (consideración total: elevado).

Implementación del proyecto

El Reporte del Banco capturó los principales progresos y dificultades de la
implementación, así como también dio cuenta de las características del contexto político y
económico argentino desde 2008 a la fecha. Se mencionan los cambios de Jefe de Gabinete
como el principal factor explicativo de demoras en la toma de decisiones políticas que
contribuyeron a demoras en la implementación del proyecto. Sin embargo estos no
demandaron modificaciones en los equipos de línea de la UCP, ni en su funcionamiento.
En cambio, los cambios de Coordinadores y de Gerente de Proyecto (TTL) del Banco
tienen un impacto directo en la implementación del proyecto.

Asimismo, hace mención a productos generados a partir del proyecto que no estaban
planteados originalmente en el PAD.

Sobre la experiencia de trabajo con la UCP / Jefatura de Gabinete

Entre las principales funciones de la Jefatura de Gabinete se encuentran las de actuar como
Coordinador Interministerial para el cumplimiento de las políticas públicas y objetivos
propuestos por el Gobierno, servir de enlace parlamentario entre el Poder Ejecutivo y el
Legislativo, enviando al Congreso los proyectos de Ley de Ministerios y de Presupuesto
Nacional y seguir la relación fiscal entre la Nación y las provincias. ,. Por la naturaleza de
sus funciones la JGM tiene aceitados mecanismos de comunicación y coordinación con
otros ministerios y un gran potencial reformador, ofreciendo la ventaja de que las reformas
que allí se impriman tienen impacto directo en los demás organismos del Gobierno
Nacional, así como en agencias federales. No obstante, estas mismas características hacen
reflexionar sobre la necesidad de incorporar en los Proyectos de Modernización
actividades e indicadores de resultados que ofrezcan una flexibilidad consistente con el rol
de JGM de coordinador del Gobierno, sin restar impacto y calidad en los productos a
obtener.



                                             40
La JGM impulsa la provisión de servicios para mejorar la gestión administrativa de las
agencias federales. Los costos de coordinación para llevar adelante estas acciones son
elevados y, en ocasiones, exceden los tiempos estipulados del proyecto. Sin embargo, una
vez que los productos son alcanzados y son apropiados por las agencias, la sustentabilidad
está asegurada.

Sobre las revisiones del proyecto

Durante la implementación se llevaron a cabo:

    - una reestructuración y extensión del proyecto (febrero 2011);
    - una extensión del proyecto (julio 2013)
La reestructuración hubiera podido ser más provechosa si el Banco y la Unidad de
Coordinación del Proyecto (UCP) hubieran acordado modificaciones más sustanciales en
los indicadores y alcance de las actividades del proyecto. En relación a la última extensión
hubiera sido deseable discutir acerca de la continuidad de algunos de los componentes e
indicadores originales del PAD.

Sobre las adquisiciones

En relación a este punto, la UCP manifiesta su disconformidad con la valoración de
“moderadamente insatisfactoria” en la gestión de los procedimientos de adquisiciones
durante la implementación del proyecto.

En primer lugar, la UCP cumplió con los requerimientos del Banco en materia de
adquisiciones y de ello dan cuenta las auditorías estatales (AGN), las auditorías financieras
y de adquisiciones del Banco. En segundo lugar, la UCP acepta los retrasos en los envíos
del Plan de adquisiciones que obedecieron a demoras en la habilitación de fuente
presupuestaria (fuente externa) y al retraso en las definiciones políticas de las actividades
a incorporar en los Planes Operativos Anuales. Por último, las demoras y cancelaciones en
los procesos se han debido a reajustes en las definiciones políticas que exceden a la Unidad
de Coordinación de Proyectos.

La UCP tuvo desencuentros con el Banco en relación al proceso para la adquisición de
bienes informáticos mediante el proceso de Licitación Pública Internacional (LPI). A este
respecto, el Banco desestimó la contratación por falta de tiempo para la recepción de los
bienes por parte de los proveedores.

En relación a la consultoría para desarrollar el Expediente Digital de la Administración
Pública (EDAP) mediante el Servicio Basado en la Calidad y el Costo (SBCC), la UCP
acordó con el Banco el envío de los informes de consultoría para conocer los avances del
proyecto, conforme el contrato suscripto. Además, se realizó una reunión con el proveedor




                                             41
y la UCP para discutir los alcances del servicio, su sustentabilidad y posibilidad de
aplicación en otros organismos 25.

Sobre la evaluación de productos

En líneas generales, la UCP acuerda con la evaluación de productos que realiza el reporte.

En relación al producto denominado “adquisiciones electrónicas”, la UCP manifiesta que
el sistema AR COMPRA suplanta y supera el sistema SECOP, dado que está diseñado con
otra tecnología que permite incorporar el trámite de contratación de las adquisiciones en
línea para toda la JGM. La instalación del AR COMPRA para el conjunto de la
Administración Pública Nacional demanda un tiempo considerable, fundamentalmente,
para el ajuste de los trámites y workflows de las distintas agencias públicas.

Sobre la performance del Banco

La UCP manifiesta que hubiera sido deseable contar con un mayor y mejor
acompañamiento por parte del Banco, en particular, con el área de adquisiciones. Varios
de los retrasos y comentarios que se mencionan en el reporte se hubieran solucionado con
un asistente de proyecto emplazado en Argentina para canalizar las dudas y solucionar
dificultades durante la implementación.

Sobre la performance del Gobierno

El compromiso del Gobierno con el cumplimiento de los estándares y el convenio de
Préstamo ha sido permanente durante todo el proyecto. El Gobierno argentino destaca el
rol de la Unidad Coordinadora de Proyectos en mantener el ritmo de actividades, la
ejecución presupuestaria y el intercambio de información (reportes y misiones) con el
Banco.

Reflexiones finales

El Proyecto de Modernización del Estado II deja enseñanzas tanto para el Banco como para
el gobierno. Algunas reflexiones que deja la implementación del proyecto son:

. El Proyecto siguió los lineamientos en el Decreto 103/2001, Plan Nacional de
Modernización. El Proyecto contribuyó a mantener en la agenda institucional la
problemática de la modernización estatal. Asimismo, motorizó reformas en JGM que
tienen el potencial de ser replicables en otras agencias del Estado. La JGM ya está
trabajando en esta articulación.

. El contexto político marcó el ritmo de la implementación (en términos de cumplimiento
de indicadores, articulación entre componentes, adquisiciones, ejecución presupuestaria,
entre otros).

. Si bien la Argentina ha avanzado en materia de normativa relacionada con gestión pública
y modernización, los cambios no son automáticos. La implementación de herramientas de
tipo transversal / horizontal son las que requieren más tiempo y aumentan los costos de
coordinación. Sin embargo, una vez logrados, son los más sostenibles.

. Es conveniente revisar en forma periódica el diseño de indicadores de productos y
resultados. Para las próximas operaciones será aconsejable incluir diseños pragmáticos,
metas más acotadas y adaptables al rol de coordinador de JGM. . Las propuestas de pilotos
de intervención en agencias públicas más pequeñas (reformas verticales) disminuyen los
costos de coordinación y permiten asegurar una mejor gestión y el logro del objetivo
planificado.

Los equipos de SSPEFE/JGM y DNPOIC/MECON hacen hincapié en la necesidad de
trabajar de manera conjunta y fluida con la UCP/JGM y el Banco sin grietas de
comunicación a lo largo de todas las etapas de preparación y ejecución del Proyecto. Las
acciones periódicas de monitoreo de un Proyecto hacen a su efectividad, ya que son clave
para captar las necesidades que vayan surgiendo, de modo de mejorar la eficiencia del
proceso de ejecución.

                            with the creation of the Administration Agency of State Assets under the CCO, with
                            competencies over asset registry and policy design on the management of central
                            government buildings. A “Public Policy Evaluation Program” was also established
                            within the Cabinet and Administrative Coordination Secretariat of the CCO.
                        •   Strengthening of the regulatory framework underpinning the CCO’s mandate. A
                            number of decrees and regulations related to modernizing the public administration
                            have also helped to institutionalize the CCO’s role within the National Public

Relevant lessons of general application from SMP I:

“The objective of state modernization: State modernization is not an objective in itself but a means
to help the state to carry out its functions, primarily in service delivery and facilitation of private
sector development. It is, therefore, important to combine state modernization efforts aiming at
improving the inner workings of the state with efforts to improve areas that are also relevant to
individual citizens and businesses, such as enhanced provision of services and actions aimed at
private sector development and investment promotion. Likewise, it is important to balance fiscal
and qualitative impacts.




                                                  55
The pace of reform: The process of altering the structure and functioning of the public
administration to ultimately increase the efficacy, efficiency, and transparency of the state is, by
nature, an arduous and long-term process. In this context, it is important to fully capitalize on
windows of opportunity for drastic change and to “keep going” during periods when only
incremental and gradual change is feasible. As demonstrated by Argentina’s experience since the
crisis, public sector modernization can also be tackled gradually, in strategically chosen areas that
build upon and scale up early results. This implies an incremental approach that envisages public
sector modernization as a series of carefully sequenced and targeted series of steps, seizing
windows of opportunity in those areas where government ownership is high.

The importance of being strategic: Although, as discussed above, this operation has demonstrated
the merits of supporting gradual, incremental state modernization efforts, it also calls attention to
the need to be strategic, focusing resources on those areas with the greatest potential impact.
Otherwise, there is the danger of dissipating efforts and making the implementation process overly
complex.

Legislation is not enough: The experience under this operation indicates that the existence and
even passage of enabling legal and institutional frameworks does not ensure actual state
modernization. Although Decree 103/2001 provided a solid foundation to much needed public
sector reforms, it was unable to overcome the resistance and intrinsic difficulties of implementing
them. Only after the 2001 crisis drastically changed the system of incentives due to, among other
factors, the severity of fiscal conditions, it became possible to move forward on the arduous and
long path of state modernization.

Balancing “vertical” and “horizontal” reforms: The successful reforms of ANSES and AFIP
indicate that reform-minded leadership is a condition sine qua non for the implementation of
“vertical” reforms that profoundly transform individual agencies. However, there is also a need for
“horizontal” reforms with a cross-cutting impact throughout the public sector. There are areas of
public sector modernization that specifically call for horizontal reforms, including: a) the
modernization of government-wide systems, like financial administration, procurement, and human
resources management; b) when there is a need to establish “rules of the games” to guide the efforts
of individual agencies to ultimately minimize inefficiencies and maximize synergies, such as in the
case e-government; and c) the development of management tools that can be applied by individual
agencies across the public sector to ultimately capitalize on the potential for horizontal fertilization
and economies of scale.

Entry-points for state modernization: It is important to identify and expand “entry points” to build
up consensus for broader reform. As shown by this operation, such consensus can be increased
through the combination of both “supply-side” reforms, such as institutional and capacity
strengthening, and “demand-induced” reforms, through engagement with civil society and the
private sector. Likewise, entry-points for state modernization do not necessarily have to be of a
fiscal nature, and can be more oriented towards improved service-delivery, greater trust in
government and other areas.

Capitalize on the potential of ICT tools: Information and communication technology (ICT) can
effectively improve public management, service delivery, as well as enhance effectiveness of
poverty reduction programs and tax evasion.

Pragmatic client engagement: As illustrated by this operation, it can be very challenging to strike
a balance between what is technically best and what is politically feasible. To maintain and deepen
client engagement, the Bank may agree to technically less ambitious but politically more feasible
interventions with the understanding that such a pragmatic approach can impact closely the policy
dialogue over the short and long term. One of the trade-offs here might also be a greater focus on
outputs than on outcomes in light of the existing government commitment on new areas, rather than
not supporting certain areas at all.

Trade-offs typical of public sector TALs: As illustrated by this operation, public sector technical
assistance operations are often confronted with a trade-off between, on the one hand, ensuring a
solid project design that allows for clear ex-post evaluation (standard project paradigm) and the
desire, on the other hand, to stay closely engaged with the client as the state modernization agenda
evolves, as it often does, in a non-linear, stop-and-go manner. Privileging the latter almost
inevitably leads to a complex end-product that is not well suited for traditional ex-post evaluation.
While there is no simple answer to this tradeoff, it is important to take into account when evaluating
the impact of operations of these characteristics.

Modernization of subnational governments: This operation has demonstrated alternative ways to
transfer the institutional and technical know-how developed at the national level. It has done so
through direct institutional support but also by demonstration, as illustrated by the voluntary
adoption of national standards and legislation by provincial governments.

Proactive Client Engagement: Engagement rather than disengagement can often be more effective
in producing the desired changes. As shown by the ongoing project, demand for the greater reforms
can be induced by pro-active engagement, such as by sharing international practices and fostering
continuous dialogue among stakeholders on key issues, helping build coalitions of change.

Coordination is vital: The substantial achievements in the area of e-government have been possible
to the cooperation and coordination exhibited by ONTI and SINTyS. In particular, the SINTyS’
infrastructure platform responds to ONTI’s E-Government plan and the corresponding
interoperability and security frameworks. In addition, ONTI and SINTyS have collaborated in the
development of data standards, as this is an area in which their responsibilities overlap. 27”
