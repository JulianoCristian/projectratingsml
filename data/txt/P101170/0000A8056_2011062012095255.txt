                         Progress has been positive and thus project is being implemented satisfactorily. The restructuring of the project, which became effective as of May 5, 2011, will contribute to
                         consolidate the public management instruments supported by the project and strengthen their sustainability. The project closing date has been extended for an additional 18 month
                         period, until June 30, 2013.
