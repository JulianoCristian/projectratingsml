                         Progress has been positive in general, and is being implemented satisfactorily. The restructuring of the project, which became effective as of May 5, 2011, will contribute to
                         consolidate the public management instruments supported by the project and strengthen their sustainability. The project closing date has been extended for an additional 18 month
                         period, until June 30, 2013.

                         In support of achievement of the PDO, progress has been made in the implementation of a pilot project on results based management and in the M&E of performance indicators of
                         key National Public Administration agencies. The single window portal has been expanded and new transactional services have been developed. Implementation of the new e-
                         procurement system throughout the National Public Administration has advanced. The new training portal CAPACIT.AR is already online, facilitating training of public servants
                         through a virtual campus. Finally, the Citizens Charter program is being consolidated through new quality standards and better communication.

                         From October 2011, the project has experience a slow down in implementation due to the November elections and the change in administration. Once a new Project coordinator is
                         appointed -or the current one reconfirmed- missions will resume.
