                         monitoring and evaluation; and to (ii) the increased use of modern e-government, procurement, human resource management and social accountability tools as well as
                         improved capacity for investment promotion.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Project implementation continues to move in a positive direction. The restructuring of the project, which became effective in May 2011, has contributed to consolidate the public
                         management tools supported by the project and move towards an integrated approach for results based management. However, progress has been slow during 2012 and is finally
                         starting to pick up. Mariano Delorenzi has been appointed as Director Nacional Alterno and new project coordinator, 2012 POAs have been approved for almost all components
                         outlining the outputs to be delivered by the end of the year, and implementation of 2012 activities is ongoing. The results indicators will be updated in the next ISR.

                         A workshop was held on June 7, 2012, to present the results of the results based management pilot at the Nuclear Regulatory Agency (Agencia Regulatoria Nuclear, ARN) and to
                         discuss the next steps in this area. The pilot was very successful and the ARN valued the support provided by the project during its implementation. Some of the results of the pilot
                         include changes in the ARN's organizational structure, enhanced inter-institutional coordination, adoption of Citizen Charter, development of a strategic knowledge-management plan,

                         development of a performance evaluation system, and adoption of a quality system including certification of processes, among others. For the rest of the implementation period,
                         Component 1 will prioritize strategic planning as a key tool for results based management as well as the integrated implementation of different tools and systems supported by the
                         project, based on the agencies' demand.
