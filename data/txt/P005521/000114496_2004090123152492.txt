Amendment to Loan Agreements
Excellency:
We refer to the Loan Agreements (“Agreements”) referred to above, entered into 
between the Kingdom of Morocco (the Borrower) and the International Bank for 
Reconstruction and Development (the “Bank”). We also refer to the Bank’s letter to 
Your Excellency, dated December 29, 1998 concerning the interest rate determination 
implications resulting from the replacement of the French Franc currency by the Euro 
currency effective January 1, 1999. 
By the present, the Agreement is hereby amended as follows: the term “PIBOR”, 
wherever it appears in the Agreement, is replaced by the term “LIBOR”. Therefore, the 
terms “PIBOR Base Rate” and “PIBOR Total Spread” appearing in Section 2.05 of the 
Agreement shall henceforth read “LIBOR Base Rate” and “LIBOR Total Spread”, 
respectively. In addition thereto, the phrases “Paris interbank offered rate” and 
“Paris interbank offered rates” appearing in Sub-paragraphs (b) (v) and (b) (vi) of 
said Section are modified to henceforth read “London interbank offered rate” and 
"London interbank offered rates”.
All the terms and conditions of the Loan Agreements, as amended hereby, shall 
remain in full force and effect.
Please confirm your official agreement to the foregoing, as the Borrower’s 
authorized representative under the Agreement, by duly signing and dating the 
corresponding form of confirmation below and returning this amendment letter to us at 
your earliest convenience.  A signed duplicate original of this amendment letter is 
enclosed herewith for the Kingdom of Morocco’s official records.
This amendment letter shall become effective as of the date it has been fully 
executed by the parties thereto, and its provisions shall apply as of the first 
Interest Period and Interest Payment Date falling due after January 1, 1999.
Very truly yours,
INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR
   RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
