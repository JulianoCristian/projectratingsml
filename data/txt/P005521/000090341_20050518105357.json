The lessons\n            learned indicate that project coordination with a large\n            number of implementing agencies and directorates requires\n            well established and efficient mechanisms. Policy reforms\n            and capacity building (institutional engineering) require\n            much preparatory work and close supervision, especially in\n            the case of creating new institutions. A project requiring\n            new legislation takes longer than expected to implement. A\n            project with strong emphasis on institutional development,\n            policy reforms and strategic national studies is extremely\n            difficult to implement. Participation of all stakeholders in\n            the project design is important. A strong Monitoring and\n            Evaluation unit should be set up at project start, not only\n            to look at the physical and financial aspects of the\n            project, but also to monitor its impact and sustainability.\n            When large numbers of extensive studies are planned, the\n            mechanisms and procedures for reviewing/monitoring the\n            activities and validating the outputs should be kept as\n            simple and as efficient as possible, particularly if several\n            partners/ministries are concerned. Fixing conditions,\n            whether for loan negotiation, agreement or extension, should\n            be approached with caution and only after ensuring that all\n            the elements are in place for making the required outcomes\n            possible. Providing technical assistance and training to the\n            implementing agencies through a contract with an\n            international agency such as FAO, to be signed at the onset\n            of the project, is a good and efficient way to ensure that\n            those two components are implemented."}, "docdt": "2005-05-11T00:00:00Z"}
