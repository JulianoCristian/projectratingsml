integrated water resources\n            management and the creation of the River Basin Agency; b)\n            improve capacity in water resources planning and management;\n            c) improve water use efficiency; d) increase the\n            effectiveness of existing hydraulic infrastructure; and e)\n            introduce water pollution control measures.  The project\n            includes the following three components:  1) Policy reforms\n            and institutional development will promote integrated water\n            resources management by establishing a rational tariff\n            policy, increasing cost recovery and establishing\n            Morocco's first BRA (River Basin Agency).  2)  Capacity\n            building in water resource planning, information systems,\n            and technology will improve national and river basin\n            planning, monitoring, and management capability.  Water\n            conservation technology will also be fostered through\n            applied research.  3) Investments in water mobilization and\n            quality will improve productivity through rehabilitation and\n            maintenance of dams, safety monitoring, and groundwater\n            sewerage systems in small urban centers."}, "docdt": "1998-01-28T00:00:00Z"}
