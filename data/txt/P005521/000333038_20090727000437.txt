 IEGWB Mission: Enhancing development effectiveness through excellence and independence in evaluation.


About this Report
       The Independent EvaluationGroup assesses the programs and activities of the World Bank for two purposes:
first, to ensure the integrityof the Bank's self-evaluation process and to veri9 that the Banks work is producingthe
expected results, and second,to help develop improved directions, policies, and proceduresthrough the
dissemination of lessons drawn from experience.As part of this work, IEGWB annually assesses about 25 percent of
the Banks lending operationsthrough field work. In selecting operations for assessment, preference is given to those
that are innovative, large, or complex;those that are relevant to upcoming studies or country evaluations;those for
which Executive Directorsor Bank management have requested assessments; and those that are likely to generate
important lessons.
       To prepare a Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR), IEGWB staff examine project files and other
documents, interview operational staff, visit the borrowing country to discuss the operation with the government,
and other in-country stakeholders, and interview Bank staff and other donor agency staff both at headquarters and
in local offices as appropriate.
       Each PPAR is subject to internal IEGWB peer review, Panel review, and management approval. Once cleared
internally, the PPAR is commented on by the responsible Bank department. IEGWB incorporates the comments as
relevant. The completed PPAR is then sent to the borrower for review; the borrowers' comments are attached to
the document that is sent to the Bank's Board of Executive Directors. After an assessment report has been sent to
the Board, it is disclosed to the public.

About the IEGWB Rating System
       IEGWB's use of multiple evaluation methods offers both rigor and a necessary level of flexibility to adapt to
lending instrument, project design, or sectoral approach. IEGWB evaluators all apply the same basic method to
arrive at their project ratings. Following is the definition and rating scale used for each evaluation criterion
(additional information is available on the IEGWB website: http://worldbank.org/ieg).
       Outcome: The extent to which the operation's major relevant objectives were achieved, or are expected to
be achieved, efficiently. The rating has three dimensions: relevance, efficacy, and efficiency. Relevance includes
relevance of objectives and relevance of design. Relevance of objectives is the extent to which the project's
objectives are consistent with the country's current development priorities and with current Bank country and
sectoral assistance strategies and corporate goals (expressed in Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers, Country
Assistance Strategies, Sector Strategy Papers, Operational Policies). Relevance of design is the extent to which
the project's design is consistent with the stated objectives. Efficacy is the extent to which the project's objectives
were achieved, or are expected to be achieved, taking into account their relative importance. Efficiency is the
extent to which the project achieved, or is expected to achieve, a return higher than the opportunity cost of capital
and benefits at least cost compared to alternatives. The efficiency dimension generally is not applied to adjustment
operations. Possible ratings for Outcome: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately
Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly Unsatisfactory.
       Risk to Development Outcome: The risk, at the time of evaluation, that development outcomes (or
expected outcomes) will not be maintained (or realized). Possible ratings for Risk to Development Outcome: High
Significant, Moderate, Negligible to Low, Not Evaluable.
       Bank Performance: The extent to which services provided by the Bank ensured quality at entry of the
operation and supported effective implementation through appropriate supervision (including ensuring adequate
transition arrangements for regular operation of supported activities after loanlcredit closing, toward the
achievement of development outcomes. The rating has two dimensions: quality at entry and quality of supervision.
Possible ratings for Bank Performance: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately
Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly Unsatisfactory.
       Borrower Performance: The extent to which the borrower (including the government and implementing
agency or agencies) ensured quality of preparation and implementation, and complied with covenants and
agreements, toward the achievement of development outcomes. The rating has two dimensions: government
performance and implementing agency(ies) performance. Possible ratings for Borrower Performance: Highly
Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly
Unsatisfactory.

Preface

This is the Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR) preparedby the Independent
Evaluation Group (IEG) for the Water Resources Management Project (WRMP).

The WRMP was approved inFY98 for a loan o fUS$20.24 million. At mid-term review (May
2001) the project implementation was extended to 6 years. Actual project costs amounted to US$
14.46 million. The reduction intotal project costs was due to savings on consultancy services and
currency appreciations.

This report is based onthe Project Appraisal Document (PAD), sector and economic reports,
special studies, Country Assistance Strategies (CASs), Policy Framework Papers, credit
documents, review o fthe project files, and discussions with Bank staff. An Implementation
Completion Report (ICR, Report No. 3 1531, dated May 11, 2005) was prepared by the Middle
East and North Africa Region. An IEGmission visited Morocco in September 2008 and
discussed the effectiveness o f the Bank's assistance with government officials, other development
organizations, beneficiaries, and stakeholders (see Annex F). Their cooperation and assistance in
facilitating meetings and site visits are gratefully acknowledged. Special thanks go to Ms.Sabah
Bencheqroun, Mr.Mohamed Oubelkace, Ms.Francoise Clottes, Mr.Hassan Lamrani, and Ms.
Laila Moudden.

The IEGPPAR mission visited the Oum-er-R'bia River Basin Agency that was funded under the
project, and one o f the six other RBAsthat followed suit. It also visited four o f five agencies
involved in project implementation and examined laboratories, drip irrigation infrastructure, and
groundwater recharge weirs in Rabat, Agadir, Beni Melall, and Fkihben Salah (see Annex E).
Based on these field visits and interviews with officials and beneficiaries, this PPAR supports
ICR findings in all important particulars and finds it to be an accurate portrayal o f the
achievements encountered during implementation. Furthermore, this report reviews changes in
the country's approach to watershed protection in order to inform an upcoming Evaluation o f
Bank Group Support for Water-a       major IEGevaluation that will examine the development
impact o f increased attention to water resources management and water services. Inaddition, this
PPAR will inform a case study on Morocco's water sector.

Copies o f the draft PPAR have been sent to the relevant government officials and agencies for
their review and comments. N o comments were received from the borrower.

Summary

Morocco i s a dry country, its water resources are unevenly distributed and its rainfall patterns are
erratic. To offset these disadvantages, since its independence in 1956, the country has invested
heavily inthe construction o f reservoirs. The number o f dams has increased from 12 in 1960 to
114 by 2006, and led to a nine-fold increase in water storage capacity. Serious water problems
remain, however, and successive years o f drought have resulted in a nearly continuous drop in
reservoir water levels. As a consequence, many people have been forced to rely on groundwater
to satisfy at least a part o ftheir water needs. Unfortunately, the drilling o f a massive number of
wells has overtaxed subterranean supplies, and groundwater i s being rapidly depleted.

Inthe early 1990s, the Government ofMorocco (GoM) decided to reform its water sector and in
1995 it passed a comprehensive water law that laid the groundwork. The 1998 Water Resources
Management Project (WRMP), the subject o f this Project Performance Assessment Report, was
designed to support the goals and principles o f the water reform legislation by financing activities
that took an integrated water resources management (IWRM) approach, and inter alia
decentralized water management to the basin level and set up river basin agencies, while
promoting further legislationto change the institutional structure and help the 1995 law become
more functional.

The objectives for the WRMP were to assist the GoM in promoting comprehensive water
management in a manner that is economically efficient, equitable, and environmentally
sustainable. Specifically, the project aimed: (a) to support the establishment o f an institutional
framework for integratedwater resources management and the creation o f one River Basin
Agency (RBA); (b) to improve capacity inwater resources planning and management; (c) to
improve water use efficiency; (d) to increase the effectiveness o f existing hydraulic infrastructure;
and (e) to introduce water pollution control measures.

Decrees and public orders (2 1 and 32, respectively) to support the institutional framework for
integrated water resources management were processed through the national administrative,
political and legislative systems, and published. The Oum-er-R'bia River Basin Agency was
created under the project. As o f 2009, seven major and two smaller river basins are managed by
basin agencies. RBAs collect user fees, manage watershed planning, protect the environment, and
mitigate natural hazards. Under the project, RBAs constructed flood-prevention infrastructure by
stabilizing degraded hillsides through check dams in a wide area, and by constructing a flood
evacuation channel to reduce annual flooding o f a city center near the foot o f a mountain range.

The national capacity for water resources planning and management was increased through the
preparation o f 21 studies including: a National Water Plan, a National Flood Protection Plan, a
National Plan for Water Quality Improvements, and a Bulk Water Pricing Study. The analytical
work undertaken under the loan and through the various studies supported a database on water
resources that is still guidingpolicy decisions and investments inthe water sector.

Large-scale irrigation schemes in Morocco regularly experience water losses in excess o f 50
percent. Under the project, 11,000 hectares, or 10 percent o f the Tadla irrigation perimeter has
been equipped with drip irrigationtechnology, equipment for irrigation efficiency demonstration
plots was acquired, and six pieces o f heavy equipment were procuredfor land leveling activities.
Trials covering more than 580 hectares were carried out to determine crop water requirements,
demonstrate the use o f sprinklers, and to identify and promote improved surface irrigation

techniques. Water savings due to drip irrigationtechnology ranged from 16 percent to 38 percent,
while production increased by between 50 percent and 76 percent depending on the type o f
vegetable planted. According to a 2008 assessment, the decreasing presence o f nitrates inthe
aquifer demonstrate the effectiveness o f drip irrigation and the associated more limited use o f
fertilizers, which together ledto dramatically improved groundwater quality inthe Tadla region.

The overall outcome for the WRMP is rated as moderately satisfactory. Shortcomings occurred
with respect to the project's efficiency, and with a programto control waterborne diseases.The
project's risk to development is rated moderate, while Bank and Borrower performance is rated
satisfactory. Lessons derived from the WRMP experience were as follows:

0         Providing subsidies topromote the use of water-saving equipment is a necessary but not
suficient condition, even when the technologies increaseproduction and lower production costs.
For drip irrigationto spread, government subsidies that lower the cost o f equipment are not
enough because o f their hightransaction costs (farmers have to clean and service the drip
irrigation nozzles continually, and they need to learn new fertilizer application techniques).
Additional measures and/or incentives may be required. It proved necessary to support the
creation o f new agricultural extension services to work with drip irrigators, for example.
Furthermore, land tenure issues needed to be resolved in order to allow farmers to take their own
decisions with respect to installing the new technology and making further investments in its
support. In addition, extension agents need to watch new adopters very carefully to ensure that
the misuse o f the new technology does not lead to major crop losses-which       would make further
diffusion o f the innovation far more challenging.

0         Providing unlimited access to credible environmental datacan be an effective way to
promote change, institutionally and on the ground. Under the WRMP, a study on flood
prevention created vulnerability maps to identify hotspot areas, and these were put inthe public
domain. Inretrospect, having these spots clearly identified led to flood prevention actions.
Similarly, data on falling levels o f agricultural chemicals inthe aquifer is helpingto promote drip
irrigation.

0         The use of geographic information system (GIs),software during environmental
monitoring can help to assess levels of aquifer pollution. Water quality monitoring efforts clearly
identifiedthe geographic areas where reductions in agricultural chemical might be expected to
reach subterranean aquifers. When the responsible parties knew where to look for water quality
improvements, they were able to document major improvements.

 1. Backgroundand Context

 1.1      Morocco i s a water scarce country, and securing an uninterrupted supply o f water
for human consumption, agriculture, industry, and tourism has been a constant concern.
 Since its independence in 1956, the government has investedheavily inreservoirs: The
number ofdams has increased from 12 in 1960to 114 in2006.' This increase has
resultedina nine-fold increase inwater storage capacity (andan 80 percent mobilization
rate for surface water) which has helped Morocco to compensate for its uneven
geographical distribution o f water resources and erratic rainfall patterns.

 1.2      Currently, 100 percent o f the urban populationand 58 percent o f the rural
population have access to an improvedwater supply.2The country i s expected to achieve
the MillenniumDevelopment Goal o f access to safe drinkingwater, something that
would not have beenpossible without the huge capacity increase. The reservoirs also
sustain large irrigation systems. In 1967 the government committed itself to the provision
o f irrigation to one million hectares of land by the year 2000.3 Thanks to considerable
investmentover the period, this goal was achieved by 1998,4and as of 2006, the country
possesses a total irrigated area o f 1.4 million hectares.'

 1.3      Serious water problems remain, however. Since the 1 9 8 0 successive years o f
                                                                                  ~ ~
drought have resultedina nearly continuous drop inreservoir water levels. As a
consequence, many people have beenforced to rely on groundwater to satisfy at least a
part o f their water needs. Recurrent drought has ledto the drilling of thousands of wells
to guarantee a parallel supply o f water for the most urgentneeds, not to mention the
massive amounts requiredfor tourist amenities such as swimming pools and golf courses.
Subterraneansupplies are overtaxed, and groundwater i s beingrapidly depleted. In
southern Morocco, farmers inAgadir report that the water table i s falling by 1.5 to 3
meters per year, requiringthem to deepenwells every year or two.6Faced with spreading
shortages, the government together with the private sector, is currently investingin
transfer schemes to channel water from the north, where it is relatively plentiful, to water-
scarce areas further south.


I According to documents inthe files of the 2007 Morocco -Water Sector DevelopmentPolicy Loan
(P095840), an important dam construction programthat increasedthe number of dams from 12 in 1960to
114 in2006 resultedinan 80% mobilization rate for surface water and anine-fold increase inwater storage

  According to Ait Kadi(1998), governmentpolicy inthe agricultural sector has always favored
investmentsinthe irrigationsubsector. The goal was to put underperennial irrigation one millionhectares
by the year 2000. This was referred to as the "million-hectares" policy.
  "The objective of irrigating one millionhectareswas achieved.The agricultural development policy with
respect to irrigation was started in 1967.Under the policy, one million ha were to be irrigated by 2000. At
the endto 1998, one millionha of surfaces are effectively irrigated." See: ctl'objectif dumilliond'hectares

ROLEOFTHE BANK
1.4      The World Bank has helped Morocco to finance investmentsinthe water sector
since 1963. Over the past 45 years, nearly40 percent o f Bank lendingto the country has
been water related.

1.5      Faced with a severe drought duringthe 1990s and with reservoirs that were
disturbingly shallow, it was apparent to decision-makers at the highestpolitical levels
that finding new solutions to the challenges o f water resources management were
pressing: efforts to reduce demand neededto supplementthe search o f increased water
supplies. While many donorswere active inthe search, the Bank supported Morocco's
development o f a water sector strategy and sector staff provided important technical
inputsleadingto the Water Law of 1995.

1.6      With Board approval o fthe (1998) Water Resources Management Project
(hereafter WRMP) Bank financing began to support Morocco inapplying the Water Law
o f 1995. The law advocated more integrated management of water resources and
encouraged conservation to supplementthe investment indams. Demand-management,
reuse o ftreated wastewater, water transfers, and desalinizationwere promoted. In
addition, the law provided for increased cooperation between the various water
subsectors and highlightedthe importance o f reducing water losses from the source and
at all intermediate points up to the receiving body o f water. The project also provided
funding for the first basinmanagement agency, the Oum-er-R'bia River BasinAgency
( R W .

1.7      In2007, the Bankapproved a Water Sector DPL for Morocco withthe objective
o f securing institutional reforms not yet fully achieved under the 1998 WRMP. However,
the timing was unfortunate. While the Water Sector DPL was prepared under a
government favorable to the reform o f the water sector, a change ingovernmentin2007
resulted ina regime that preferredthe status quo ante.

1.8      While it is hardto know what stance Morocco's water sector will elect if
shortages become more dire, Bank water staff foresee ever worsening water resource
conditions that under current climate change scenarios are expected to affect the Maghreb
region particularly early and hard. Cause for further concern i s the 30 percent drop in
average precipitation since 1970, which, along with more frequent droughts and floods, i s
hardto be seenas anything other than a signof climate change. By 2025,35 percent o f
Moroccans could be living in"absolute scarcity," which i s defined as having less than
500m3/capita/yr (see Figure2).'

1.9        Despite a succession o f investments invery costly dams and the resultant
dramatic increase in surface water storage capacity, existing surface water supply
continuously falls s,horto f actual demand, and this has led to stringent water use
restrictions inirrigated areas. A new CAS, which i s currently underpreparation, i s
expected to strongly emphasize the adaptation to the water-related impacts o f climate
change.

2. Objectives and Components

PROJECTOBJECTIVES
2.1      The Water Law o f 1995 provides the necessary regulatory, legal and institutional
framework to support sustainable water management. The 1998 Water Resources
Management Project (WRMP) was focused on puttingthe Water Law into practice, and
reforming Morocco's water sector.8Policy reforms supported include the development o f
a framework for long-term planning, the establishment o f a regulatory framework to limit
groundwater miningand to control water pollution, the promotion o f economic incentives
to control demand, and improvements incost recovery for water-related services.

2.2      The objectives for the WRMP as indicated inthe Staff Appraisal Report (SAR)
were to assist the Government o f Morocco (GoM) inpromoting comprehensive water
management ina manner that i s economically efficient, equitable, and environmentally
sustainable. Specifically, the project's objectives were: (a) to support the establishment o f
an institutional framework for integrated water resources management andthe creation o f
one River BasinAgency (MA); (b) to improve capacity inwater resources planning and
management; (c) to improve water use efficiency; (d) to increase the effectiveness o f
existinghydraulic infrastructure; and (e) to introduce water pollution control measures.

PROJECTCOMPONENTS
2.3      The original components ofthe WRMP includedthe following:

(a) Policy Reforms and Institutional Development, to promote integrated water resources
management, establish a rational tariffpolicy, increase cost recovery, and promote
decentralized water management through the establishment o f Morocco's first river basin
agency; (b) Capacity Building inwater resource planning, information systems and
technology to improve national and river basin planning, monitoring, and management
capability and foster water conservation technology through applied research; and (c)
Investments inwater mobilization and quality to improve the productivity and
sustainability o fphysical infrastructurethrough the rehabilitationand maintenance o f
dams, safety monitoring, and groundwater development for reliable water supply. Lastly,
water quality would be improved through the construction o f sewerage systems insmall
urban centers, which would be complemented by improved public education campaigns
to combat waterborne diseases.




8According to the PID, the passage ofthe Water Law of 1995 was amajor step inthe implementation of an
integratedwater resources managementprogram. It was the result of acontinuouspolicy dialogue
conductedwith the government by the Bank inthe context ofthe preparationofthe 1995 Water Sector
Review. The Law providesthe necessary regulatory, legal and institutional framework to support
sustainable water management and institutes anumber of fundamentalpolicy reforms such as : (a) the
creationof river basinagencies for decentralizedwater managementand increasedstakeholder
participation; (b) the establishmentof long-term national andriver basinwater master plans; (c) the
introduction of water charges on bulk water resourcesand pollutiontaxes; and (d) the establishmentofthe
monitoring and control of water quality.

2.4     To better distinguishbetweenthe respective implementingagencies' tasks
(Ministry ofPublic Works [including the DepartmentofNational Meteorology], the
Ministry of Agriculture, andMinistry of Public Health), the implementing agencies and
the Bank informally reorganized the project's maincomponents, increasing them from
three at appraisal to five during the supervision mission o f April 2000. The revised
components, which took into account all the original project sub-components, included:
(a) water resources planning, (b) establishment o f the Oum-er-R'bia RBA, (c)
optimization of irrigation efficiency, (d) control o f waterborne diseases, and (e)
investments inwater mobilization.

3. Designand Implementation

PROJECT DESIGN
3.1     The WRMP was originally conceptualized as a US$200 million loan. Itwas
dimensioned to support a comprehensive water reform program. Inearly discussions with
the borrower, the project was expected to finance the Dachr ElOued Dam, at a cost of
about US$SO million, inaddition to several other activities. However, after the
engineering designs had beencompleted with Trust Fundresources (World
BaWJapanese PHRD), and following further discussions with the appraisal team, the
GoM decided to construct the dam without Bank financing, and, by the end o f the
appraisal, the WRMP was ultimately reduced to US$25.6 million.

IMPLEMENTATION       EXPERIENCE
3.2     Implementing the WRMP proved challenging. Not only had the financing for the
project beendramatically reduced, butpromoting institutional change inministriesthat
hadtheir owntraditions and approaches to coordination proveddifficult. Inpractice, the
various agencies that had historically discharged responsibilities for water resources
management had done so inan uncoordinated manner. Therefore, the consolidation o f
responsibilities into one resource management structure often conflicted with traditional
spheres o f influence and strongly vested interests.

3.3     Although the country had many experienced water engineers, they were not
necessarily institutional specialists-previous  water sector investment projects in
Morocco built infrastructure, not a new sectoral bureaucracy. International consultants
were hired for the conceptual institution-building work, but their output pleased almost
no one. Fewpublic officials were to be left with their domains intact. An important
consulting contract had to be cancelled after two years because, according to local
informants, "the results did not meet the government's needs."

3-4     During the mid-termreviewmission o f May 2001 a number o f changes were
suggested: project implementationwas extended to six years. Additions were made to
technical assistancecomponents that included more training and equipment for the
project-supported RBA; strengtheningo f the Directorate General of Hydraulics (DGH,
later the State Secretariat for Water, SEEau), more equipment and materials for the
Departmento fRural Works (MoPW) for carrying out applied researchand
demonstrations with their Experimentation, Trials and Standards Unit (SEEN) and the
three Regional Agricultural Development Authorities (ORMVAs). Adjustments were
made to unit costs as well as physical and price contingencies. Evenwith these additions,
the project's total cost was reduced from US$25.6 millionto US$20.24million,mainly
due to savings inconsultancy services and favorable exchange rates.

PROJECT COSTS
3.5       The loan for the WRMP was composed as a basket of currencies consisting o f
US$10 million and FF 59 million. In2002 when the Franc went out o f circulation, this
amount was converted into Euro at the prevailing rate (it was equivalent to  8.99 million
at that point). The loan was declared effective inJanuary 1999. There were three
cancellations totaling  4.98 million: FF 13 million in2001 (equivalent to  1.98 million)
after the mid-termreview;  1.5 million in2002; and  1.5 million late in2004. At
appraisal, implementation was estimated to take four years. The project was extended
twice by a total o f two and a half years and closed inDecember 2004. Project extensions
provided additional time so that implementing agencies conducting time-consuming
activities could complete the ones that were behindschedule. Cancellations were due to
cost savings-delays with studies, equipmentpurchases, and civil works led to payments
beingmade at more favorable exchange rates.

3.6       As o f May 1 2005, US$10millionwas disbursedplus 3.40 million, thus
making the total disbursement from the Bank loan US$14.46 million (equivalent), which
represented 72 percent o f the original loan. The final estimate o f total project costs i s
equivalent to US$18 million or 70 percent o f the appraisal estimate. The Government's
contribution, estimated at a total of US$3.65 million, represents 68 percent o f the initial
appraisal estimate, inline with the Bank's contribution.

RELEVANCE
4.2       The relevance o fproject obiectives is rated hiah:The project's objectives are
highly relevant given that Morocco is a water scarce country, which is expected to
become water stressedginthe near future.

4.3       While the World Bankhadprovided assistanceto Morocco's water sector for
thirty years, this loan represented a change instrategic approach. While inthe past, the
Bankhadprovided assistanceto different water sub-sectors, inthis case it beganto
address water issues in a comprehensive and integrated manner-a                        shiftthat reflectedthe
internationalconsensus on water expressed inthe DublinPrinciples.lo

4.4       Insupport ofthis neworientation, a Bankpolicy paperwas preparedand
approved by the Board in 1993. Country and region-specific strategy papers followed,
such as the 1995 Morocco Water Sector Review and the 1995 MENA Strategy for
Managing Water.          Both strategies describe institutional changes neededfor
implementing an integrated approach to water resources management.

4.5       Reflectingthe Bank's policies and strategies on water, the 1997 CAS specifies
strengthening integrated water management as an objective. This objective i s still
relevant as the most recent 2005 CAS stipulates the importance o f improving Morocco's
legal, financial, and institutional framework inthe water sector. Inparticular, the
overarching objective was to improve intra-sectoral coordination, inpart by matching
sector financing mechanisms to sector priorities (including integratedwater resources
management through river basin agencies), andto strengthen operator regulation.

4.6       A 2007 CAS review described the reform process inMorocco as fragile.
According to the progress report, the reform o fthe sector has yet to be consolidated and
to lead to sustainable changes inbehavior.12 The latest thinking withinthe Bank-to                        use
the climate change agenda to facilitate difficult political decisions-canbe seen as a

resource management strategy and recommendedBank investmentlending to the proposedfirst water
resource managementproject. The Water Sector Study (1997) provided the basis required for formulating a
strategy for water resourcemanagement.

term reforms (governance, integratedmanagement of resources, irrigation, drinking water supply and
sanitation) are startingto produce significant results. This progress, andthe dynamism of the underlying
inter-ministerial dialogue, is not irreversible. It has yet to be consolidated and to leadto sustainable changes
inbehavior.

necessary condition ifthe water sector i s to secure a sustainable supply of water for the
future.

4.7      Relevance o f proiect designi s rated substantial:

4.8      Project design was relevant to achieve the specific objectives o f establishing an
institutional framework for integrated water resources management, the creation o f a
River Basin Agency, capacity building, improving water quality and efficiency, and
increasingthe effectiveness o f existing hydraulic infrastructure.

4.9      With respect to the project's results framework, one o fthe specific objectives and
outcome indicators was not tied to inputs, andremainedvery broad compared to expected
outputs o f the project. The disconnect can be found inObjective 1 ("to support the
establishment o f an institutional framework for integrated water resources management",
see Annex C). The output indicator for this objective was to publisha number o f decrees
andpublic orders. While these decreeswere to create the legal basis for important
reforms inthe water sector, only a limited number o f key institutions received fundingto
improve their capacity for implementing and subsequentlyenforcing the decrees. Stated
inanother way, either the objectivewas formulatedtoo broador sufficient capacity was
not developed country-wide to link outputs (published decrees) to outcomes (e.g.,
institutions capable of controlling water quality and ensuringthat polluters pay for
pollution). Reflectingthis weakness, the project's results framework did not sufficiently
align outcome indicators with the first project development objective.

EFFICACY
4.10    The achievements by objectives for the WRMP includethe following:

4.11    Objective1:Supporting the establishment of an institutionalframework for
integrated water resources managementand the creation of one River Basin Agency
(RBA); this objective i s rated substantial.

This objective consisted o ftwo parts: 1) the establishment of an institutionalframework,
and 2) the creation o f a River Basin Agency (RBA). Overall, this objective i s rated
substantial, because decrees and public orders to support the institutional framework for
integrated water resources management were published, and the Oum-er-R'bia River
Basin Agency was created. As o f 2009, seven major and two smaller river basins are
managed by basin agencies. RBAs collect user fees, manage watershed planning, protect
the environment, and mitigatenatural hazards. Underthe project, RBAsconstructed
flood-prevention infrastructureby stabilizing degraded hillsidesthrough check dams ina
wide area, and by constructinga flood evacuation channel to reduce annual flooding of a
city center near the foot of a mountain range. Despite these considerable achievements,
problems remain, which will be discussed inthe following paragraphs.

4.12    Decrees and public orders were prepared, processed through the national
administrative, political and legislative systems, and published.These measures were
designed to support the institutional framework for integrated water resources
management (and they were clearly necessary to put the Water Law o f 1995 into
practice). By project closing inDecember 2004,21 o f a total o f 37 decrees hadbeen

  publishedas well as 32 public orders (see Table 5). Arguably, the two most important
  publisheddecrees relatedto water extraction (irrigation, electricity, potable water, and
  industry)and water pollution. However, boththe public orders relatedto the collection of
  fees for industrial water use andthe public orders complementing the decree for water
  pollution were still under preparation.

  4.13     Inthe interveningyears since project closing, atotal o f 11more decreeshave
  been approved and published. According to local sources, nine o f these decrees have
  regulations that are approved or they have been put into effect to some degree. A total o f
  five decrees have beenprepared but are still inthe process of being approved. Despite
  this considerable progress onthe legal front, the reformprocess is far from complete.
  While publishingdecrees is an important step, a far more important challenge is the
  creation o f an institutional framework and a change inbehavior among the ministriesand
  the population.

  4.14     A public awarenesseffort knownlocally as the "National Debate on Water",
  beganin2002 to forge a broadconsensus on some o fthe reform issues inthe water
  sector. A publication documenting the National Debate four years laterI3specifies the
  following issues as priorities infuture reforms: securing water resources, safeguarding
  water quality, promoting efficient water use, limiting groundwater extraction, and
  fighting erosion. Not muchprogress has beenmade. The World Bank-funded2007 Water
  Sector Development Policy Loanreiterates (four of) the same reform objective^'^ as the
  1998 WRMP. While it i s not surprisingthat reforming and integrating Morocco's water
  sector has not happened overnight, giventhat it i s now 10 years since the approval o f the
  WRMP it i s beginningto look as ifit will take a generation to see results. Some
  informants felt that the WRMP would have accelerated this process a bit more if it had
  paid more attention to the political processesinvolved, and especially to who was gaining
  and losing power and influence, while it was supporting increased attentionto integrated
  water resources management.




  l3National Debate on Water / Debat National sur L'Eau 2006.
  l4The 2007 Morocco - Water Sector Development Policy Loan (P09.5840) aims to achieve the following
  objectives:

4.15      Creationof the Oum-er-R'biaRiverBasinAgency: Since the project WRMP
closed, there has been considerable progress inthe development o f the basin agency for
the Oum-er-R'bia Basin inBeniMellal (see Map Annex G for the Oum-er-R'bia basin).
The Oum-er-R'bia RBA was signed into law by Decree 2-96-536 inNovember 1996 as
the first basin agency inMorocco. Under the WRMP the agency received funding for
legal and technical assistance as well as the procurement of equipment.Since then,
Morocco's seven major basins are managed by basin agencies (three o f them functioning
with the support of other donors). As of September 2008, two agencies beganto manage
two smaller basins. The principal functions o f all o f these RBAs include the allocation o f
water to the various users ineach catchment, the control o fwater quality, the assurance
o f cost recovery via charges for extraction o f water and discharge o f wastewaters, the
maintenance o f hydraulic infrastructure including dams, the enforcement o f extraction,
and effluent discharge licenses, and flood control procedures.l5

4.16      According to the Water Law o f 1995 and following the example o f basin
agencies inFrance, Spain, and elsewhere, RBAs are supposedto be financially
autonomous. Inthis respect they are accountable to their stakeholders as well as to the
state bureaucracy. The issuance o f decrees discussed earlier inthis report was important
as a legal and regulatory basis for the agency to collect dues. The IEGPPAR mission
found that as of September 2008, the Oum-er-R'bia RBA was approaching financial self-
sufficiency. The agency was able to finance ongoing work with beneficiary contributions
(80 percent o f the total budget), while staff salaries (20 percent) were still covered by the
government budget. Beneficiary contributions were transparently managed inthe MIS,
based on the Oracle software system, which had beenprocured with project funds. The
most important clients listed (interms o f billing) were the National Potable Water Office
(ONEP), responsible for drinkingwater distribution inMorocco, and the National
Electricity Office (ONE).

4.17      The mission attempted to assess the various functions o fthe M A , such as water
quality monitoring, flood protection, and recording o fhydrological and meteorological
data. All the necessary information was available usingthe MIS system. The same
systemalso manages accounts receivable and payable, and otherwise handles the
accounting. Staff responded to information requests with alacrity and competence,
although they would have appreciated project-fundedtraining inthe use o f the software
program with which they worked. l6The mission found that training had not been given
as was intendedbecause the MIS system hadbeen installed on the computers too close to
project closing for this to be arranged.




l5Initially, most ofthe personnel for the new Oum-er-R'biaBasin Agency came from the Directorate
Generalof Hydraulics.Regionaloffices ofthe Directorate GeneralofHydraulicshadbeenset up duringthe
1980s inevery basin. Givenits function inhydraulicresearch, monitoring, andwater resourcesplanning, it
was a precursor of the various RBAsthat are now functioning.
l6Accordingto the ICR, in 1999,the provisionoftechnical assistance and training, as well as equipment
and materialsto the DGH, was beencontractedto the FAO. All of the technicalassistance (more than 30
operations) andtraining(more than 10programs, mainly inwater resourcesplanningandmanagement)
have beencompleted. Moreovera largenumber of computer and field equipment, as well as 29 vehicles,
were deliveredto the DGHandthe six other newly establishedriver basinagencies usingloanproceeds.

                                                  12


4.18      The mission visited one of the project-financedmeteorological station (12 o f
which had been refurbished). It was equippedas intended, with all instruments
functioning. Meteorological data gathering and analysis i s one o f the many functions o f
the RBA.Yet another function ofthe RBA is the control and enforcement of groundwater
extraction via permits. Enroute to the meteorological station the mission was
(coincidentally) able to observe Oum-er-R'bia RBA staff engaged inenforcement work.
Traveling ina vehicle with IEG, basin management agency staff noticed a mobile rig
drilling for groundwater. These rigs are easy to move around and therefore usually hard
to catch inthe act ifthey are not discovered during the hours they are engaged indrilling
(see Figure 3). They approached the rig and demanded that the driller show his permit.
Since none o f the menworking the rig could produce a permittheir drilling was illegal,
and it was halted. They were not allowed to resume until agency staff could be shown a
permit from the Oum-er-R'bia BasinAgency.

4.19      Another responsibility o f the RBAs i s the maintenance o f all the dams inthe
basin. However, according to the SAR, the inclusion o f dam maintenance staff inthe
RBAshadnot beenenvisionedprior to the appraisal mission.17 According to officials
working inthe RBAs, dam maintenance puts significant pressure on the budget as well as
on stafftime. Staff interviewed noted that the few people working inbasin agencies are
overloaded with a multitude o f responsibilities. Ifthis i s true for other RBAs, it would
indicate that the balance of resources and responsibilitiesneeds to be revisited.




I7According to the SAR, the appraisal missionwas informedon the last day of the mission, ie: afterthe
"wrap-up" meetingthat an internal decisionhadbeentakento include maintenancestaffwithinthe RBA
structurebeginningJanuary 1, 1997.The impacton the budgetwas not clear at that time andwas subjectto
further consideration.

4.20    Objective2: Improving capacity in water resourcesplanning and management;
this objective is rated substantial.

4.21    The national capacity for water resources planningandmanagement was
increased underthis loan primarily through the preparation of studies. The following
section will demonstrate how the research conducted with project funds translated into
capacity building o f government officials and ledto fundamental changes inwater
resources management, flood prevention and mitigation, water quality monitoring, and
bulk water pricing. A total of21 studies have beencompleted. Several studies consist of
multiplevolumes and representconsiderable work. More detail on these studies is
presented inAnnex D.Four studies (as follows) are discussed below18:

         1. National Water Plan
        2. National Flood Protection Plan
        3. National Plan for Water Quality Improvements
        4. Bulk Water Pricing Study

4.22    NationalWater Plan(US$2.1 million).The original objective was to help
Morocco restructure its water sector according to IWRMprinciples, involving
stakeholder consultation, but developing the National Water Planproved challenging.
The GoM hiredan international consultant to work onthe planwithinthe ex-DGH(later
SEEau). The consultant spent nearly three years on the task, but still left it incomplete.
The TOR for the study called for five deliverables: (1) preparation o f a detailed inventory
o fthe information available on water resources, (2) setting up a database, (3) carrying out
detailed studies related to water resources planning, (4) making recommendations for
improving the institutional context, and (5) presenting a national master plan.

4.23    The analytical work that was undertaken ledto the updatingand strengthening o f
the database on water resources and the information it provides i s still guidingpolicy
decisions and investmentsinthe water sector. However, other aspects o f the National
Water Plan, such as options for future investmentsand financial analysis were not
furnished at the level anticipated. While the international consultant summarized
information involving different stakeholders, informants notedthat the DGH/ SEEau
expected a more traditional study describing Morocco's water resources andfuture
infrastructure needs, including feasibility studies and cost-benefit analyses. It therefore
terminated the contract early. However, the ongoing 2007 DPL on water represents a
renewed effort to develop a National Water Plan by consolidating individual river basin
planswith the already existinginformation from the National Water Plan.

4.24    NationalFloodProtectionPlan(US$1.1 million).The preparationo fthe
national flood protectionplanincluded: 1) the formulation o f a typology o f floods, 2) the
identification o f vulnerable sites as well as the prevention measures that shouldbe
adopted to protect each site, and 3) a review o f the institutional context and the
preparation of a detailed action plan.



18The four studies were selected becausethey represent the bulk ofthe allocation for studies inaddition to
being the most important interms of influencing water policy and relatedgovernment actions.

                                                     14


4.25     For phase 1of the study, the DGH/ SEEau surveyed local offices and identified
 390 specific sites vulnerable to flooding. Subsequently, six international consultants
together with Moroccan experts visited the sites and determined/assessed vulnerability
 levels. Vulnerability maps were produced with the help o f GIS software, and a total o f 20
 sites were classed as highly vulnerable to flooding. l9Four sites were selected (Fes, Sattat,
Berrechid, and Mohammedia) out o f the 20 vulnerable sites for more detailed design and
urgentflood protectionmeasures. Sites were markedon a vulnerability map and
transferred to local basin offices for further action.

4.26     According to one government official, the most important lesson learned from the
international experts was that flood prevention cannot be tackled by departmentsgoing it
alone or by treating the flooding problem with inadequately designedand dimensioned
protective infrastructure. Small infrastructure which was put inplace inthe past did not
solve the flooding problem; rather, it simply transferred it further downstream or
upstream. The solution was to treat flooding ina comprehensive and integrated way with
the relevant departmentsworkingtogether. This has now been accomplished in
Mohamedia, a city that was devastated by floods in2002.

4.27     The IEGPPAR missionvisited flood protectionstructures inone o fthe hotspot
areas identified by the flood protection study inthe city o f BeniMellal. Flood protection
structures were financed by the Oum-er-R'bia RBA with beneficiary contributions. Flash
floods usedto be caused by runoff from steep hillsides nearby every summer. The RBA
financed gabion structures and terraces inthe hills above the city, as well as a drainage
channel, which was designedto conduct flood water through the city (see Figure4).
Flooding was thus managed ina comprehensive way. The mission was informed that
duringthe RBAs's last board of directors' meeting, representatives ofdifferent
stakeholder groups attended inorder to express their gratitude for the work completed
and the protectionthat was accomplished.

4.28     NationalPlanfor Water QualityImprovements(USs0.7 million).The
national water quality protectionplan comprised: 1) a diagnosis o fthe quality o f water
resources, 2) an analysis o f sources o fpollution and their impact on water quality, 3) the
preparation o f a water quality protectionplan for the Oum-er-R'bia Basin and the country
ingeneral. All those steps were completed, andthe computer model developed for the
Oum-er-R'bia Basinhas been extremely useful informulating remedial measures against
pollution. The next section (objective 3, paragraph 4.37) will provide evidence for
achievements with respect to water quality monitoring andpollution control inthe Tadla
region.

4.29     Inaddition, a financial modelwas developedto determine the tarifflevel for
pollution from households, the tourist industryand other industries (mainly sugar, oil,
leather, milk, and phosphate production), as well as fertilizer andpesticides usedinlarge
irrigation schemes. While most o f the tariff issues have beenresolved with the help o f
this study and by the related decree andpublic orders, the identification o fthe agency
entitled to receive payments for reused water i s still pending. Boththe water supply
agency ONEP, responsible for water treatment, and the RBAs, responsible for water
allocation, are indispute over who would benefit from the revenues. As a result, large
golf courses and agro-businesses are not able to save water by making use o f treated
wastewater.

4.30    BulkWater PricingStudy (US$0.3 million).The completed study on bulk water
pricing included: 1) an analysis of the tariff system, 2) an evaluation o fthe fees paid for
bulkwater, and 3) the formulation of amethodology for determiningthe cost o fbulk
water. According to the people interviewed, this study on bulk water pricing was
perceived as a major milestone inreforming Morocco's water sector. Before the study,
water was seen as "a gift from God," and no analysis existed as a basis for why and how
much water users should pay for water. With the establishment o f RBAs, a mainpart o f
their budgetwas to come from water users, andthis study together with decrees and
public orders laid the foundation for that to happen. This study also found, however, that

                                               16


the government neededto contributeto the operating costs o fthe RBAsbecause
beneficiary contributions from bulk water were not going to be enoughto cover the
multiple activities with which the M A Swere charged.

4.3 1   Objective 3: Improving water use efficiency; this objective i s ratedsubstantial.

4.32    Large-scale irrigation schemes inMorocco regularly experience water losses in
excess of 50 percent. GivenMorocco's water shortages, it was importantto increase
water use efficiency inirrigation. Under the project, equipment for demonstrations
(including 2,500 tubular siphons) was procured, and six pieces of heavy equipment were
procured for land leveling activities. Some 144 trials (covering more than 580 ha) were
carried out instations and fields on the following topics: crop water requirements,
localized irrigation, improved surface irrigation techniques, and sprinkler irrigation. Land
leveling was supposed to reduce water losses by 35 percent. However, the highcosts o f
landleveling (US$190 per hectare) and the absence o f state subsidies ledto this
technique beingdropped. Since 2002, the government has provided a 60 percent subsidy

4.33    According to this field trial, water savings due to drip irrigation technology
ranged from 16 percent to 38 percent, while production increased by between 50 percent
and 76 percent dependingon the type o f vegetable planted. However, these tests were not
replicated, neither inthe Ouled Gnaou trial station nor inother stations, which moderates
the credibility ofthe results.

4.34    The IEGPPARmission spoke with one farmer who watered five hectares of land
with drip irrigation technology. One hectare hadbeenprovidedto himwith project
financing on the condition that he would equip the rest o f his fields with his own finds.
The IEGPPAR mission saw five hectares equippedwith drip irrigation. Results were
impressive, as the farmer doubled productionwhile also reducing water consumption.
Asked why his neighbors and friends were not following his example (as originally
intendedby the project), he explainedthat there were several reasons: family land use

                                             17


rights(which provide decision-making power to the older generation); use ofthe system
increased farmers' workload (regular cleaning o fthe tubes i s required), as i s specialized
knowledge (about how to apply fertilizers). Inthis regard, drip irrigation also requires
special fertilizer application techniques. Ifit i s done wrong, the whole crop can be lost,
which would, o f course, result inthe approach losing acceptance among farmers. Yet
extension services were not providedunder the project, and there is no place where
farmers are routinely imparted this specialized knowledge. This finding i s reflected ina
2007 Country Assistance Review undertaken by the IEG (formerly OED). The Review
highlighted the imbalance between the Government's strong support for irrigation relative
to the low priority which it gave to complementary extension and research. The review
also stressedthat a lack o f training and basic equipment was having an impact on the
motivation and the effectiveness o f agricultural extension agents. Notwithstanding the
absence o f a mechanism to support the technology transfer, according to officials inthe
Tadla ORMVA, 11,000 hectares, or 10percent o f the irrigation perimeter has been
equippedwith drip irrigation technology under the project, increasingyields and reducing
production costs. Meanwhile, the government has conducted feasibility studies to equip
the rest of the perimeterwith drip irrigationtechnology by financing 10,000 hectares with
the hope that the use o f this technology would spread.

4.35      For farmers to receive government subsidies for drip irrigation technology, their
equipmenthasto be tested and certified by SEEN.Underthe WRMP, a labjust for
systemtestingwas set up inthe Moroccan capital, Rabat, to certify tubes and hoses
(Figure 5).

Morocco's IrrigationSystems




Picture: IEG



4.36      Under project-financed testing, more than 400 irrigation equipment approval
certificates have beendeliveredby the SEEN. However, as o f September 2008, agency
staff levels were to be cut and the office with all the test equipment was to be relocated.
Clearly, inthis case, the sustainability o fthe materials testing lab i s uncertain.

                                                           18


4.37        Withrespect to the environmentalmonitoring sub-component, a system was
implemented inthe Doukkala and Tadla regions for assessingwater and soil quality. This
has helped to identify the locations and causes o f pollution as well as the remedial
measures to be taken. Inorder to improve environmental monitoring, the project has
provided technical equipment and consumables to the OFWVAs as well as staff training.
Almost 45,000 soil and water analysis tests have been conducted for private individuals,
mainly farmers.

4.38        The IEGPPAR missionvisited a lab for water and soil quality testing. In
appearance it was clean, and equipment appeared to be functioning and well-maintained.
Staff demonstrated that all the equipmentpurchased under the project was present and
verified that it was in general us. This could be observed at the time of the visit, as a
room full o f soil samples was awaiting analysis. GIS software had been installed, and
levels o f salinity as well as points o f pollution hadbeen mapped.A 2008 assessment,
tracing 100 water points since 1996 demonstrates that nitrate levels have actually
decreased inthe aquifer o f the Tadla irrigation perimeter(Figure6).

4.39        According to the 2008 assessment, decreasing nitrate levels inthe aquifer
demonstrate the effectiveness o f drip irrigation and the associated more localizeduse of
fertilizers, which leads to lower levels o f nitrate reaching the aquifer. These results are
important, and they should be usedto inform farmers and policy makersabout the
potential impact o f further investments indrip irrigation on water quality inthe aquifer.
The evidence on the environmental benefits of usingthis technology is quite convincing.

4.40    Objective4: Increasing the effectiveness of existing hydraulic infrastructure; this
objective i s rated modest.

4.41    Nakhla Dam.The targets for increasing the safety, reliability, and efficiency o f
water resource mobilization were only partially met for the following reasons:

4.42    Studiesconducted after appraisal revealed that water losses were due to leakages
inthe foundations, not inthe upstreamsurface o fthe dam. Proposedremedialmeasures
were therefore not feasible, and instead, cement was injected into the foundations inorder
to reduce water losses. An evaluation undertaken by the FA0 in2003 demonstrated that
the cement injection failed to reduce water losses. Therefore, ONEP built small
catchment basins on each side o f the dam to stemwater losses and use the "lost" water to
supply water to the city o fTetuan. The original goal of obviating the need for additional
newdam construction, inthis case o fthe Amsa Dam inthe MartilRiver (just below the
Nakhla Dam site) was not achieved, and plans are already well underway to construct the
newer andlarger Amsa Dam. Once the new structure is complete, which is estimated to
happeninfour to five years, the Nakhla Dam will be abandoned. While everything that
couldhave been done about dam safety was undertaken,and engineers' understanding o f
the situationhasbeensomewhat improvedthrough studies and evaluations, a 20 year
extension o f the life o f the dam as estimated at appraisal could not be achieved.

4.43    Artificial rechargeof the Souss aquifer.The objective ofmobilizing additional
groundwater by artificially recharging the Souss aquifer was met inthe limitedarea
where it was attempted.

4.44    The water table is falling dramatically inthe southern area of Agadir. The area is
known for citrus production, mostly for export to Europe and the U.S.Inrecent decades,
farmers hadto deepenwells every two years, since water tables were falling by 1.5 to 3
meters per year. A study was financed to assess the condition o f the aquifer under the
WRMP. Inaddition, financing was provided to rehabilitate five weirs that had been
constructed in 1991, and to construct an additional weir, Talekjount weir. The purpose o f
the weirs, which have beenconstructed downstream o f dams, i s to preventthe water that
overtops the dam or that i s released for irrigation purposes from beinglost to the sea.
Weirs are made out o f gabions or concrete structures. The ones visited were from three to
four meters high, and the theory i s that they will retain water andthat this will artificially
recharge the aquifer.

4.45    The Aoulouz Damreleaseswater according to a schedule determined by farmers'
needs. Since the establishment o f the Souss Massa RBA inAgadir, farmer associations
have beenactively involved inthe decision-makingprocess concerningwater releases.
On average, four releases per year take place with wide variance according to the annual
rainfall pattern. Since 1991,a total o f 1,532 million m3o fwater has been released.

4.46    Under the WRMP, the Souss Massa RBAundertookan evaluationo fthe
effectiveness o f aquifer infiltration (Figure 7). It found that, contrary to what was
expected, water does not infiltrate the entire aquifer, though it i s detectable quite far from
the insertionpoint-in this case it could still bemeasuredmore than 80 kmfromthe dam.
This does not help communities that have to tap into its groundwater from further away.

                                              20


One community, about a 100 km from the weir hadto builda pipeline (it was constructed
in2008) to transfer water from the dam. This project is beingfinancedbythe private
sector together with government subsidies.

4.47      As the weirs accumulate topsoil, gabions need to be built to raise their level for
themto continue the water-trapping function. No such actions were observed or reported.

4.48      Objective 5: Introducing water pollution control measures; the achievement o f
this objective is rated modest.

4.49      Pollution control. While water pollution control legislationhas been passed (see
Objective l), enabling regulations have yet to be approved. Flood control structures in
               the
BeniMelall and Mohammedia do, infact, reduce the riskfrom waterborne diseases
during flooding. Inaddition, the project financed the construction o f a laboratory for
water quality testing inaddition to equippingseven already existing laboratories.
Equipment receives periodic maintenance and i s usedto control water pollution (see also
Objective 3).

4.50     Control of waterborne diseases. According to the ICR, the project-supported
control o f waterborne diseases inthe Oum-er-R'bia Basinhas strengthened the capacity
o f the Department o f Epidemiology and Diseases Control (DELM) insix provinces
covering the basin (Khouribga, Azilal, BeniMellal, Khenifra, El Kelaa and Settat).
Equipment and vehicles were purchased under the project. Since the MoPH did not
request a specific budget from the Ministry o f Finance and Privatization (MFP) for
activities inthe first years o f implementation-developing hotspot maps for infectious
disease areas, hygieneeducation, and staff training for ONEP-this      hadto be financed by
the agency's own funds, The IEGPPAR missionwas not able to arrange meetings with
staff involved inthe DELMand it therefore cannot veri@ the status or impacts o f the
above-mentioned actions.

                                             21


EFFICIENCY
4.5 1    Efficiency i s rated as modest because the six land planners retained for land
 levelling activities ultimately proved ineffective. The lack o f extension advices ledto
 limiteduptakeofnewtechnology; andthe results ofthe US$2 million investedinthe
National Water Plan did not meet government expectations.

4.52     An ERRwas calculated for three project activities at appraisal and again at
completion. The combined ERR for the three infrastructure activities (Nakhla dam, weirs,
andthe installationof 12meteorological stations) was estimated inthe ICRat 79 percent
over 20 years. These activities represent 24 percent o f total project cost. Thus, the relative
efficiency o f the bulk o fthe investment has not beenquantified.The ICR estimates the
ERRfor the benefits o fthe repairs to the Nakhladamover 20 years. However, it will be
recalledthat it was ultimately not possible to repair the Nakhla Dam, and it may only
have a very short additional period o f use.

4.53     Inthe example ofthe weirs, no baseline data exists. Itis not clear howmuchof
the trapped water reachesthe aquifer, or evenwhat the infiltration rate would be without
the weirs. Therefore, it cannot be determined ifinvestments inthe weirs are economically
justifiable, although for communities that would have insufficient access to water without
them, their use can be considered a survival issue. Furthermore, the water levels inthe
dam that releaseswater to the weirs is at a historic low, which makes future water
releases uncertain. Most other investmentsface similar problems, either because their
benefitsare unknowable, or the cost o fthe externalities preventedcannot be calculated.

RISKTO DEVELOPMENT OUTCOME
The risk to development outcome is rated as moderate.The new regulatory and
institutional framework and policy reforms have laid the foundation for sustainable water
resources managementby providing the basis for efficient water resources allocation by
protecting against water pollution and floods and by ensuring stakeholder participation.
Decrees and public orders insupport o f an IWRMapproach to water management have
beenpublished.Others are still inthe process o fbeingapproved by parliament. W A S
have been established in seven major river basins, andthey are covering 80 percent o f
their operating costs from fees. The principle ofhaving a fully integrated management o f
water resources inMorocco i s widely accepted by relevant ministries,eventhough
individually they are unwillingto give up any authority.

4.54    The World Bank has re-engaged with the Water Sector DPL in2007. Other
donors, inparticular the EUandthe AfDB have decidedto lendtheir support to the
reform process inthe water sector. However, recent changes ingovernment have slowed
downreforms, and there is a risk that the GoM will further delay tough decisions, which
would impact the release o f the next DPL tranche.

4.55    With respect to risks, around the Nakhla Dam the investmentsincapturing
leaking water will have a limitedlifespan, since it will be abandoned infour to five years,
andneededimprovementsto the weirs constructed inthe Souss aquifer are not taking
place, which limits the stream o f future benefits that can be expected.

BANKPERFORMANCE

4.56      Overall Bank performance i s rated as satisfactory. The Bank took a bold
approach to water resources management and addressedthe tough issues despite the
difficulty involved.

4.57      Quality at entry i s rated as satisfactory:The WRMP was preceded by substantial
ESW carried out duringpreparation. This sector work provided a framework for a sector-
wide strategy andpolicy formulation and enabled a broad-based policy dialogue with the
Government.20The project was further prepared through a PHRD grant and the
engagement o f FAO/CP. A Quality at EntryAssessment by Q A G was conducted inFY
1999. The assessmentrated quality at entry as satisfactory, but pointed out weaknesses in
the M&Eframework, as well as with financial management. The PPARconcludes that
quality at entry overall was satisfactory. However, some o f the project objectives should
have been formulatedmore carefully to better reflect the limited financial resources
available for the intervention. It also draws attentionto the failure to systematically
identify the relative power o fthe winners and losers o fthe proposed institutional reform
process.

4.58      Quality o f supervision i s ratedas satisfactory: QAG also carried out a Quality o f
Supervision Assessment inFY 2000. Itratedoverall quality o f supervision as
satisfactory, but pointed out that an effective M&E systemwas not inplace. Supervision
missions focused on the progress o f the legal framework, as well as with the
establishment of the Oum-er-R'bia RBA. As will be further explained inthe M&E
section o fthis report, this PPAR argues that the lack o f M&E within the PIU was
compensated through M&E activities by World Bank consultants and supervision
missions and by the establishment o f in-country measurement systems in several line
agencies. These are likely to be more sustainable than a project-focused M&E system
within a PIU. An adequate numbero f supervision missions per year were conducted. The
skill mix of staffwas diverseand appropriate for the diverse components o fthe project,
except for the fact that not enough attention was givento the project's health education
and control o fwaterborne disease activities. Staff continuity contributedto the
achievements o f the project, especially givenits complexity and the challenging political
context. Inaddition, performance reporting was exceptional and compensated for the lack
o f a monitoring and evaluation framework.




2oThe Water Sector Review (1995) providedthe framework for anational water resourcesmanagement
strategy, andthe Water Sector Study (1997) provided the basis required for formulating a strategy for water
resource management.

BORROWER       PERFORMANCE
4.59    Overall, Borrower performance i s rated as satisfactory.

4.60    The Government's performance is ratedas moderately satisfactow: Support for
the WRMP came from the highest levels of government infavor of reforming Morocco's
water sector and taking an IWRMapproach to water resources management. The
Borrower involvedthe Bank ina series o f ESW, which ledto the Water Law o f 1995,
followed by a water strategy. However, giventhe complexity o fthe project, support
varied accordingto the sub-sectors involved.QAG, for example, pointedout that the
PHRD completion memorandum highlighted a lack o f Government ownership at the time
o f project preparation.

4.61    According to the SAR, the legal status o f the HighCouncil for Water and Climate
(CSEC) was to be strengthened under the WRMP. However, while the Council met eight
times before the project, it met only once thereafter. Difficulties with interagency
cooperation could have been more easily overcome had the Council assumed its role.
Moreover, delays inthe provision o f counterpart funding, particularly duringthe early
years o f the project, caused implementation delays.

4.62    The implementing; ag;encys' performance is rated as satisfactow: The following
five implementingagencies were involved inproject implementation: 1) the MoPW,
which in2003 was transformed into the Ministry o f Territorial Activities, Water and
Environment (MATEE), 2) the DGH, which later became SEEau, 3) the Oum-er-R'bia
RBA, 4) the Departmento fNational Meteorology (DMN), andthe 5) Department of
Epidemiology and Diseases Control (DELM).According to the SAR, a technical
coordination committee was to be created as well as a PIU. Although such a committee
was established, it was under-staffedand did not assume its coordination responsibilities.
Therefore, coordination betweenagencies proved challenging, although reporting took
place on a regular basis. However, after 2003 the SEEau took over monitoring all project
activities and closely collaborated with supervision missions.



5. Monitoring and Evaluation

5.1     Overall monitoring and evaluation i s rated as substantial.

5.2     M&EDesign:According to the SAR, indicatorsrelated to eachproject
component reflecting the input, output, and impacts related to that component were to be
applied to measure overall progress inmeetingproject objectives. Indeed,Annex 11o f
the SARprovides a results measurement framework linking objectives to inputs and
outputs, assessingrisks and assumptions and describing the expected impact o fproject
activities (also see Annex B and C inthis report). However, performance indicators were
not clearly defined inthe SAR and had to be improvedupon by Bank supervision
missions in collaboration with the implementingagencies.

                                              24


5.3     M&EImplementation:Supervisionmissions developed a set ofperformance
indicators, which were meticulously tracked inPSRs. Overall performance monitoring by
the Bank was exceptional inthat progress on each individual activity was described in40
to 100page-long supervision reports. Tables listing progress with decrees, public orders,
and bulletins were prepared. Inaddition, tables for progress with studies, as well as
training activities implementedby the FA0were updated on a regular basis.
Furthermore, the project's financial and economic aspects were also tracked in
supervision reports. Despitethe excellent reporting from the Bank's side, an M&E
systemmaintained by the Borrower has never been established, making the sustainability
o f M&E progress reporting inongoing sector reforms unlikely.

5.4     M&E Utilization:The Bank's supervision missionsused informationtracked in
supervisionreports intheir discussions with government officials. Thus the M&E system
was an importantelement inadvancing reforms inthe water sector. At the country level,
the ability to monitor and evaluate water resources development, allocation, and quality
control was improved inthe DGH/ SEEau as well as inRBAsthrough TA and training.
The capacity to monitor and mitigate flooding and to evaluate water and soil quality was
also strengthened.

SAFEGUARDS, FIDUCIARY        COMPLIANCE,AND UNINTENDEDOUTCOMESFORTHE
LWMPPAND THE WRMP
5.5     The project triggeredtwo safeguardpolicies: 1)OP/BP 4.01 on Environmental
Assessment and 2) OP/BP 4.37 on the Safety o f Dams.For the WRMP, the SAR
appropriately classified the WRMP as Category B.Annex 8 o f the SAR describes the
potential environmental impacts o fproject activities, and plausibly discounts potential
significantly negative impacts o fproject activities.

5.6     With respect to dam safety, assuranceswere obtained that DGH/ SEEau would
seek the expertise o f the Public Laboratory for Trials and Studies (LPEE) to review
specific safety aspects o f the Nakhla Dam. Inthe event, the dam hadproblems that were
not reparable and it i s scheduled for replacement.

5.7     The IEGPPARmissionvisitedAoulouz Damnear Agadir. This damhad a group
o f 11employees managing the dam. A seismograph was installed on the dam monitoring
risks o f earthquakes. Spillways for different volumes o f water release were part o f the
dam structure. Inaddition, two engineers were responsible inthe Souss Massa RBA for
dam maintenance. It i s evidentthat for dams that are safe to operate, there are systems in
place inMorocco for monitoring that they stay that way. These systems also helpto
manage flood control, seismic monitoring, and maintenance.

6. Conclusions and Lessons

6.1      The successive droughts ofthe 1990s,coupledwith the steadily falling water
levels inits reservoirs moved the management o f water resources, already highon the
national development agenda, even further up. With the approval o f the WRMP and the
work which was performed under its auspices, Morocco opted to face up to the thorny
problems that were constraining the benefits stemmingfrom its expensive and prolonged
efforts to build dams wherever feasible to secure its water supply. The country changed
its laws and drafted many regulations which, taken together, generally recognize that
conservation neededto supplement investments inincreased supply.

6.2      Inthe Moroccancontext, settingupriver basinagenciesprovedto beaneffective
way to introduce IWRMprinciples into the water sector. They proved able to cover the
bulkoftheir ownoperating expenses (except for salaries which remainedunder the
public payroll). And they improved public safety, reducingthe risk of flash flooding.
Agriculture, the biggestconsumer o f water, was the focus o f pilot efforts with drip
irrigation. The results were positive, leading to dramatic reductions inchemical pollution
and improvements inwater quality. Weirs have raised ground water levels for a radius o f
50 miles, albeit they needadditional investment to maintain performance at the current
level. Yet the question remains as to how to sustain the efforts o fthis groundbreaking
first step.

6.3      It is cause for worry that the sector is only part way to achieving the benefits of
soil and water conservation andpush-back is already well underway. The legal
framework has a way to go before it will be fully capable o f supporting a broader reform
o f the water sector. The current government may well find that it has few affordable
alternatives as it strives to achieve the right balance between continuing to investing in
expensivewater storage capacity, andtaking a demand-management approach. Yet at this
interimpoint, it is clear that this project points out one viable approach to which Morocco
may chose to returnifwater stress inthe Regionas predictedbecomes more severe.

6.4     The Bank i s to be commended for recognizing when more than infrastructure was
going to be required to overcome the chronic water shortage. As an early water resources
management project, the results are encouraging regarding what can potentially be
achievedwith an IWRMapproach. What the Bank needs to learn from this experience is
that there i s more to institutional reform than technical correctness. Reform is a political
process as well as a technical one, and careful identification of winners and losers from
any proposed reform, andthe relative strengths and weaknesses they have withinthe
governing structure, need to be considered at the outset.        .

6.5     Lessons from the WRMP were the following:

a       Providing subsidies topromote the use of water-saving equipment is a necessary
but not sufJicient condition, even when the technologies increaseproduction and lower
production costs. For drip irrigation to spread, government subsidies that lower the cost
of equipment are not enough becauseo f their high transaction costs (farmers have to
clean and service the drip irrigation nozzles continually, andthey needto learn new

                                             26


fertilizer application techniques). Additional measures and/or incentives may be required.
Itprovednecessaryto support the creation of newagricultural extension services to work
with drip irrigators, for example. Furthermore, landtenure issues neededto be resolved in
order to allow farmers to take their own decisions with respect to installing the new
technology and makingfurther investments inits support. Inaddition, extension agents
needto watch new adopters very carefully to ensure that the misuse ofthe new
technology does not leadto major crop losses-which        would make further diffusion o f
the innovation far more challenging.

a       Providing unlimited access to credible environmental data can be an effective
way topromote change, institutionally and on the ground. Under the WRMP, a study on
flood preventioncreated vulnerability maps to identify hotspot areas, and these were put
inthe public domain. Inretrospect, havingthese spots clearly identifiedledto flood
prevention actions. Similarly, data on falling levels o f agricultural chemicals inthe
aquifer i s helpingto promote drip irrigation.

a        The use of GIssoftware during environmental monitoring can help to assess
levels of aquifer pollution. Water quality monitoring efforts clearly identifiedthe
geographic areas where reductions inagricultural chemical might be expected to reach
subterranean aquifers. When the responsible parties knewwhere to look for water quality
improvements, they were able to document major improvements.

           Standards Unit / Service     WRMP to test irrigation pipes and tubes imported to
           des Expkrimentations, des    Morocco or produced in Morocco. Pipes are being put

           Normalisation                were constructed to test the effectiveness o fthe material for
                                        drip irrigation. Morocco has a new program for drip
                                        irrigation in which farmers receive a subsidy o f 60 % if
                                        they invest in drip irrigation. All material being subsidized
                                        has to be tested inthis Rabat agency.

                                        aquifer artificially. Under the WRMP, a mathematical
                                        model was developed for the Souss aquifer. It helped
                                        document the alarming yearly decline o f the water table by
                                        between 1.5 and 3 meters. Inresponse to this decline, nine
                                        weirs were constructed or improved (five o f them financed
                                        under the WRMP) to artificially recharge the aquifer. The
                                        mission visited two o f the weirs (see below).

3.        Aoulouz Dam                   The dam built in 1991, has a storage capacity o f 100
                                        million m3.It was constructed to mitigate flooding and to
                                        store irrigation water for years o f drought. Water from the
                                        reservoir irrigates citrus fruit and vegetable plantations
                                        further downstream. Water i s released from the dam 3-4
                                        times per year in order to artificially recharge the aquifer.
                                        The date for the release is negotiated with farmer
                                        associations. When the mission visited the dam, a release
                                        had been scheduled, but was postponed because it rained.
                                        The study o f the WRMP found that artificially recharging
                                        the aquifer i s effective only within 80 kilometers o fthe
                                        dam. This is why the private sector now financed a pipe
                                        transferring water directly to the citrus plantations of Sebt-
                                        Guerdane, more than 100 kilometers from the reservoir.

                                  concrete quarters block the river and force the water to
                                  infiltrate the aquifer. The weir was designed to modify the
                                  path o f the river and improve the aquifer recharge in lower-
                                  lyingareas. The mission noticed sediment accumulated
                                  upstream o f the weir, reducing its effectiveness. Officials
                                  discussed the idea o f involving farmers in silt removal
                                  because it contains a high level o f nutrients. However, as o f
                                  2008, no maintenance action has taken place.

                                  4 m highdam has been completely filled with silt and
                                  bushes, which reduces the effectiveness o fthe weir.
                                  Maintenance o f the weir was not visible.

                                  WRMP. It is composed o ftwo systems. The first is for
                                  management (accountability, logistics, HR, and user fees)
                                  and the second for technical information and decision
                                  making. With the help o fthis Oracle software, water
                                  allocations can be based on actually available water
                                  resources. The mission noticed a number o f staff usingthe
                                  system for updating information on surface and
                                  groundwater levels.

8.     Laboratory                 The mission visited the office laboratory stocked with new
                                  equipment (a UV-Visible Spectrometer, an Avanta ,I      Atomic
                                  Absorption Spectrometer, and a distillator) under the
                                  WRMP. The three-room lab was well equipped for
                                  chemical, physical and biological analyses. On-site
                                  measurement devices were also available. Three old kits
                                  procured under the WRMP were stored away, while five
                                  newer ones seemed to be in use.

9.     Irrigation mitigation work The mission visited the rehabilitationo f a flood evacuation
                                  channel crossing the city to prevent future floods. The
                                  section visited was 800 m long, about 2 m deep and about 4
                                  mwide. The site was identified as a black spot by the
                                  flooding study funded by the WB under the WRMP. As a
                                  result o f this study, flood protectionworks were undertaken
                                  with the agency's own funds. The agency not only
                                  addressed flooding in the city, but it protected hillsides with
                                  check dams and gabion structure to prevent torrential rains
                                  from damaging topsoil and causing flooding further
                                  downstream.

10.    Meteorological station     Simple station equipped with a pluviometer, a flow meter,
                                  and a water level meter. The station was under the

                              Sinceno suchdocumentwas issued,the basinofficers
                              exercisedtheir roleof policingagainst illegaldrilling, and
                              the drilling was stopped. Itwas to be taken up again only
                              after the acquisitionof a permit,whichthe agency hadto

                                     irrigation water had been destroyed a few days earlier by
                                     floods. The whole system from the dam to the channels was
                                     poorly designed and materials used were prone to large
                                     water losses through seepage.

18.        ORMVA water and soil lab  Large and very well equipped lab for water and soil quality
                                     monitoring. The lab currently undertakes a study on soil
                                     parameters for more than 2,500 farmers to optimize the
                                     fertilizer use and gather data to feed into the information
                                     system. Two staff work full time and three have been hired
                                     for this particular mission. The farmers pay for this test.
                                     The WRMP bought 25 lab devices (verified by the mission)
                                     as well as chemicals. Most o f the equipment i s beingused
                                     on a regular basis and well maintained.

19.        Laboratoire du Systeme    A database collects information from about 500 stations for
           d'hformation              water quality monitoring and about 200 for soil analysis.
           Gkographique et de        Parameters on salinity, water table, boreholes, etc. are
           Teledktection Spaciale    regularly updated. This database is being analyzed to
                                     produce regular reports for monitoring and decision
                                     making. Inaddition, satellite images are used to assess
                                     concrete structure inthe irrigation perimeter. A law has
                                     been issued to prevent new construction in the perimeter.
                                     This GIS tool based on satellite imagery provides
                                     information on illegal construction.

20.        Drip Irrigation Farm      The WRMP equipped a five ha farm with one ha drip
                                     irrigation devices under the condition that the farmer would
                                     extend the equipment over all 5 ha. Thanks to drip
                                     irrigation, the farmer more than doubled his production and
                                     used 50 times less water.

21.        Station des               The mission visited a water and agricultural
           Experimentations Hydro    experimentation station, which was equipped under the
