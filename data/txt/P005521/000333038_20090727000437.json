outcomes were moderately satisfactory, the risk to\n            development outcome was moderate, Bank performance was\n            satisfactory, and Borrower performance was also\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: 1) providing\n            subsidies to promote the use of water-saving equipment is a\n            necessary but not sufficient condition, even when the\n            technologies increase production and lower production costs.\n            For drip irrigation to spread, government subsidies that\n            lower the cost of equipment are not enough because o f their\n            high transaction costs (farmers have to clean and service\n            the drip irrigation nozzles continually, and they need to\n            learn new fertilizer application techniques). Additional\n            measures and/or incentives may be required. It proved\n            necessary to support the creation of new agricultural\n            extension services to work with drip irrigators; 2)\n            providing unlimited access to credible environmental data\n            can be an effective way to promote change, institutionally\n            and on the ground. Under the WRMP, a study on flood\n            prevention created vulnerability maps to identify hotspot\n            areas, and these were put in the public domain. In\n            retrospect, having these spots clearly identified led to\n            flood prevention actions. Similarly, data on falling levels\n            of agricultural chemicals in the aquifer is helping to\n            promote drip irrigation; and 3) the use of geographic\n            information system (GIS) software during environmental\n            monitoring can help to assess levels of aquifer pollution.\n            Water quality monitoring efforts clearly identified the\n            geographic areas where reductions in agricultural chemical\n            might be expected to reach subterranean aquifers. When the\n            responsible parties knew where to look for water quality\n            improvements, they were able to document major improvements."}, "docdt": "2009-06-01T00:00:00Z"}
