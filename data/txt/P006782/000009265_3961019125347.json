Some lessons learned included:  before\n            undertaking appraisal of a project as complex as Rio Grande,\n            the Bank should satisfy itself that the project has been\n            adequately prepared. The project design should be reviewed\n            by a panel of experts made up of independent specialists in\n            the main technical disciplines involved, before bid\n            documents are issued. An important lesson is that the\n            success of a project depends more than any other factor on\n            the ability and the experience of the people and the\n            institution involved in its implementation. A case in point\n            is Empresas Publicas Medellin (EPM) was, and still is\n            perhaps the best managed water and power utility in\n            Colombia, despite the rather poor performance of these\n            sectors in general. Last but not least, it is important to\n            emphasize that a complex project will in general face\n            considerable problems during implementation; even in cases\n            where the implementing agency is a very efficient institution."}, "docdt": "1995-06-26T00:00:00Z"}
