"The multipurpose water supply and\n            hydroelectric project will support Colombia's efforts\n            to provide the economic and social infrastructure needed to\n            facilitate growth and enhance well-being.  The Rio Grande\n            Multipurpose Project includes construction of facilities\n            needed by 1990 to provide safe and reliable water supply to\n            about 61,000 households currently without water or poorly\n            served, about 10,000 commercial establishments, and 8,700\n            manufacturing and industrial concerns in the Department of\n            Antioquia.  The power component of the project will help\n            ensure availability of electricity needed in the Department,\n            which is a productive center of major importance to\n            Colombia's economy.  Project works comprise\n            hydro-facilities on the Rio Grande including an earth-fill\n            dam, tunnels, a 300 MW underground power station, a 22 MW\n            surface power station serving as a pressure reducing\n            facility, a balancing tank and a steel conduit to feed raw\n            water to a potable water treatment plant to be constructed\n            under a second phase of this development.  The project also\n            includes the extension of a computerized data processing\n            network, and staff training."}, "docdt": "1984-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
