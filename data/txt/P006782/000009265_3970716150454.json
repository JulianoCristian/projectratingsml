"This multipurpose water supply and\n            hydroelectric project will support Colombia's efforts\n            to provide the economic and social infrastructure needed to\n            facilitate growth and enhance well-being. The project\n            includes construction of facilities needed by 1990 to\n            provide safe and reliable water supply to about 61,000\n            households currently without water or poorly served, about\n            10,000 commercial establishments, and 8,700 manufacturing\n            and industrial concerns in the Department of Antioquia. The\n            power component of the project would help ensure\n            availability of electricity needed in the department; which\n            is a productive center of major importance to\n            Colombia's economy. Moreover, in line with\n            Colombia's efforts to diminish reliance on\n            non-renewable hydrocarbons, the project would enable\n            reducing costly thermal generation in the national\n            interconnected system. Project works comprise\n            hydro-facilities on the Rio Grande including an earth-fill\n            dam, tunnels, a 300 MW underground power station, a 22 MW\n            surface power station serving as a pressure reducing\n            facility, a balancing tank and a steel conduit to feed raw\n            water to a potable water treatment plant to be constructed\n            under a second phase of this development. The project also\n            includes the extension of a computerized data processing\n            network, and staff training. The main risks are those\n            inherent in major civil works in difficult terrain,\n            including tunneling at great depth. The degree of risk is,\n            however, acceptable because geological conditions in the\n            area have been thoroughly studied, other large civil works\n            have been successfully carried out in the vicinity, Empresas\n            Publicas de Medellin (EPM) staff and consultants have wide\n            experience in this type of work and, finally, adequate\n            contingencies have been provided for."}, "docdt": "1984-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
