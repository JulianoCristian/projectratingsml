The overall outcome of the project was rated\n            satisfactory; the performance of the Bank and the borrower\n            was also rated satisfactory. The project's objective\n            was to support the restructuring of the industrial sector in\n            order to enhance its international competitiveness. Some of\n            the lessons from this experience are as follows: (a) the\n            rapidly changing political, social, and economic environment\n            in Hungary had a decisive impact on project performance,\n            both positive and negative. While it was hardly possible to\n            anticipate the dramatic changes, reaction to changing\n            situations could have been swifter. Given the evolving\n            nature of the reform process, several years of experience\n            with Bank financed activities, plus availability of\n            additional sources of external finance, it may have been\n            opportune for the Bank and the Hungarian authorities to have\n            reviewed the overall strategy for, and comparative\n            advantages of, Bank assistance much earlier in the project\n            life. This assertion is not intended to imply that all was\n            wrong and needed to be changed, but rather that, in light of\n            all the changes that took place, a fresh look may have\n            optimized the benefits of Bank assistance. (b)The project\n            design included too many components and eligibility criteria\n            (for credit lines), that made project monitoring and\n            implementation difficult under the prevailing political,\n            social, and economic conditions. Implementation became much\n            smoother, once the Loan Agreement was amended and procedures\n            were made simplified."}, "docdt": "1998-01-20T00:00:00Z"}
