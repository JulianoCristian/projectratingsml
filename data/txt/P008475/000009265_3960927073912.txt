MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDETT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE NATIONAL BANK OF HUNGARY
WITH THE GUARANTEE OF THE HUNGARIAN PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC
FOR A THIRD INDUSTRIAL RESTRUCTURING PROJECT
1.          The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan to
the National Bank of Hurngary for US$140 million equivalent is submitted for
approval. The proposed loan would have 15 years maturity with five years grace
and carry the Bank's standard variable interest rate, and help finance a third
industrial restructuring project.
2.          Background. Industry is the leading sector in the Hungarian economy,
representing about one third of GDP, employment and investment, and 85% of
exports. Sector growth, productivity and exports to convertible currency markets
stagnated in the first half of the 1980s, while its structure, dominated by large
vertically-integrated enterprises, did not sufficiently shift to activities with
competitive advantage. Most dynamism has been demonstrated by the small business
sector which grew rapidly from a small base in the early 1980s. Industry sector
performance, including exports, improved during 1987 - 88. Constraints to better
performance include: restricted domestic and international competition, limited
resourca mobility, and lack of financial discipline and autonomy of enterpris-
es. To address the above issues the Government has engaged since 1985 in a
medium-term program of industrial restructuring, developed jointly with the Bank,
including comprehensive policy reforms and support for specific restructuring
investments.   To strengthen economic performance and accelerate the policy
reforms, the Government adopted in 1987 a medium- arm economic stabilization and
structural reform program supported in 1988 by n IMF Standby Arrangement, and
a Bank-financed Industrial Sector Adjustment Loan (ISAL).   Small business
development is being encouraged through broadening of the private sector, and
rationalization of the tax and association framework. Parliament approved a law
of economic associations and a unified company profit tax law which have become
effective on January 1, 1989. The Government has initiated measures to address
emerging unemployment due to restructuring, including support for productive new
job creation activities, and development of employment and retraining services.
3.          Rationale for Bank Involvement.   The project contains two novel
features in the Bank's assistance program for Hungary in line with the country's
drive for reform. These are: (i) support for small business and entrepreneurial
development, including the private sector, and (ii) development of measures for
efficient employment creation and new employment services as a means of
alleviating the social costs of restructuring. Support in these areas would help
accelerate the restructuring program. The Bank has played an important role in
the analysis of issues related to the small business sector and designed an
appropriate small business credit component for the project. Further, the Bank's
review of the Government sponsored schemes for addressing emerging unemployment
problems has led to adjustments being made in the schemes. The pro4ect provides
for further development of the policy and institutional framework in this area.
Also, Bank involvement would help improve the institutional framework for
industrial restructuring, particularly the banking system, and improve the



- 2 -
feedback from enterprises on the impact of the reforms which facilitates the
formulation of necessary adjustments to the reform process.
4.          Project Obiectives. To support the restructuring of the industrial
sector in order to enhance its international competitiveness, the project aims
to help: (i) redirect the product/market mix of the sector to competitive areas
suitable for convertible currency exports, (ii) improve enterprise management
practices and capabilities, (iii) stimulate the establishment and growth of small
business firms, including the private sector, (iv) alleviate the adverse
employment impact of industrial restructuring, and (v) strengthen the
institutional capabilities in support of industrial restructuring.
5.          Project Description.  The project includes three enterprise credit
components, to be onlent through the participating banks, to support enterprise
investments for: (a) increased direct and indirect exports to convertible
currency markets (US$110 million of the Bank loan); (b) growth of entrepreneurs
and small businesses (US$10 million); and (c) efficient employment creation in
regions affected by emerging unemployment due to industrial restructuring (US$15
million).   An additional US$0.7 million would be onlent to enterprises for
preparation of business plans.  Eligible manufacturing subprojects under the
first credit component should export to convertible currency markets at least
601 of output directly or at least 70X directly and indirectly combined (of which
at least 401 indirectly) and pay back foreign exchange investment costs within
f ive years from direct or indirect foreign exchange revenues, or should be
carried out by firms with convertible currency exports of at least 301 of total
sales to help increase or maintain convertible currency exports of such
enterprises.   Subprojects should be viable from commercial (including export
marketing plans), technical, financial and economic (including minimum rates of
return of 181 in real .erms) points of view. Implementing enterprises should
prepare restructuring programs for their entire operations, and be financially
healthy. Maximum subloans would be US$10 million for direct exporters, and US$4
million for indirect exporters.
6.          The second credit component would support growth of proprietorships,
partnerships, small cooperatives and limited liability companies engaged in
manufacturing or related business services, with employment up to 60 persons
prior to investment. A firm's eligibility will be evaluated based on its past
performance, business plan, creditworthiness, and ability to service the proposed
credit, while subproject viability would be assessed in simplified fashion,
regarding commercial, technical and financial aspects, for which criteria will
be developed by each participating bank in an operations manual for small
business credit to be reviewed and agreed by the Bank. Subloan limits would be
US$150,000 (for a maturity up to three years). To stimulate the build up by the
banks of small business portfolios and flexibility, they can borrow for such
purpose for a maturity up to fifteen years, and maintain up to 30X of funds
onlent to them in short term working capital financing of small firms.
7.          Eligibility under the third credit component would be for employment
creating investments in manufacturing, agro-processing and business services in
regions suffering employment problems due to industrial restructuring. Project
support initially would be for three counties in North Hungary affected by
unemployment due to restructuring of the steel and coal mining industries.



Subprojects should be eligible under the Gover:tment supported investment
promotion program for job creation which is being revised following a review by
the Bank, including actions to stimulate the development of small firms in
manufacturing, tourism, construction, trade ard business services, while the
commercial, technical and financial viability will be assessed along criteria
similar to those for the other credit components. Minimum financial and economic
rates of return would be 12% in real terms. The subloan limit would be US$2
million.   The subprojects supported by the project should be undertaken in
accordance with the country's safety, health and environmental standards, which
are considered satisfactory.
8.          Onlending would be based on a refinancing facility in the National
Bank of Hungary (NBH) to which fourteen participating banks have access on a
first-come first-served basis.  The participating banks would take the final
credit decision on each subloan, based on appraisal carried out by the banks
with assistance from consultants and/or the Restructuring Program Office (RPO)
which has been established.   The institutional, operational, and financial
aspects of the participating banks have been assessed as satisfactory by the
Bank, and will continue to be monitored.
9.          The project also includes technical assistance:  to strengthen the
participating banks in the area of small business credit; to prepare subsector
restructuring programs; to carry out a comprehensive study of the performance
and constraints facing the small business sector; and to help improve the Govern-
ment measures for addressing unemployment. The latter includes assistance for
improving appraisal skills for productive employment projects and preparation
of a strategic plan for an area facing unemployment, and assistance and
investment support for development of new employment and retraining services.
Procurement will be based on Bank guidelines. The establishment of a revolving
fund of US$6 million and retroactive financing of up to US$7 million (5% of the
Bank loan) are recommended. A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are
shown in Schedule A. The disbursement schedule is shown in Schedule B. (Due
to the nature of the project largely involving support to subprojects which have
not been preappraised, no detailed breakdown of project expenditures by
procurement method is available.) A timetable of key project processing events
and the status of Bank Group operations in Hungary are given in Schedules C and
D, respectively. The Staff Appraisal Report No. 7456-HU dated January 13, 1989,
and a map are also attached.
10.         Agreed Actions. Industry-wide policy issues regarding the incentive
framework for industrial restructuring are addressed in the recent ISAL,
including incentives for convertible currency exports, and for entry of new
firms, including the private sector.  Signing of a subsidiary loan agreement
between NBH and the State, and of subsidiary financing agreements between NBH
and at least three participating banks would be a condition of Bank loan
effectiveness.   For the small business credit component,  completion of a
satisfactory small business credit manual by each bank is a condition of
disbursement to such bank. At negotiations, the following salient agreements
were obtained from the Government, NBH and the participating banks:   (i)
implementation of agreed actions to improve the export credit and insurance
system; (ii) implementation of agreed adjustments to the investment promotion
program for regional employment creation; (iii) ensuring prompt availability of



- 4 -
funds to beneficiaries for project implementation including foreign exchange;
(iv) monitoring compliance of participating banks with eligibility criteria for
their continued participation in onlending, including satisfactory policies,
procedures, staffing, and financial situation; (v) maintenance of interest rates
which would allow adequate spread, be positive in real terms and not include a
subsidy; (vi) lending in accordance with agreed eligibility criteria, and on
agreed terms and conditions (paras 5-7); (vii) appraisal and supervision of
subprojects in accordance with agreed policies and procedures; and (viii)
procurement along Bank guidelines and following agreed reporting and auditing
procedures.
11.         Benefits.  The project would help to strengthen the ongoing restruc-
turing efforts in the industrial sector, and lead to increased exports to
convertible currency markets in support of the country's trade balance. It would
also help balance the structure of the sector by promoting the establishment and
growth of small, including private, firms which would stimulate domestic competi -
tion, innovation and employment creation.  The project would help accelerate
enterprise restructuring and assistance to dislocated workers through its support
for employmeni creation and development of suitable employment and retraining
services in regions severely affected by restructuring.
12.         Risks. The main risk is the uuncertainty perceived by enterprise and
small business managers about Hungary's future macro-economic situation and
possible further changes in the industrial policy framework, which may affect
the incentives for enterprise restructuring and small business development, and
the level of credit demand under the project. This risk is reduced by the strong
support that the new Government and political leadership give to the economic
reform and by the policy actions agreed to by the Government with the IMF, and
with the Bank under the recent ISAL, which are aimed at creating a stable
business environment, conducive to restructuring and development of entrepreneur-
ship. Another risk concerns the capacity of the participating banks to promote
and appraise restructuring and small business investments. The project addres-
ses this risk with technical assistance measures and project coordination and
supervision arrangements.
13.         Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed loan.
