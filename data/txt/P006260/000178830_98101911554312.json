It was\n            identified during the CANAMBRA studies in 1965. It is\n            upstream of Sao Simao, where a hydroelectric plant partially\n            financed by the Bank is under construction by CEMIG. The\n            Itumbiara project was appraised in January 1973, and\n            negotiations were held in May 1973, with Dr. Alipio de\n            Barros and Dr. Mario Bhering representing the Government and\n            the Furnas delegation headed by Dr. John Cotrim. The project\n            consists of a 7km dam, the 2,080 MW Itumbiara hydroelectric\n            power station and related transmission facilities to meet\n            part of the increase in the power demand in the Southeast\n            and adjacent regions of Brazil."}, "docdt": "1973-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
