The potential environmental and social impacts of\n            CBRDP and SILEM will vary in significance according to the\n            size and strategic influence of sub-projects. Potential\n            environmental and social risks of SILEM are in the areas of:\n            planning for land use; exclusion of vulnerable social groups\n            or disadvantaged groups from planning or distribution; soil\n            and water management; displacement of population or\n            non-agricultural species; dependence on seed distribution;\n            pressure on land and water resources, biodiversity, or\n            cultural properties; potential conflict among participants;\n            health and environmental risks (especially associated with\n            agro-minerals and organic manure); and potential for\n            involuntary resettlement issues.
