"Ratings for the Sahel Integrated Lowland\n            Ecosystem Management (SILEM) Project for Burkina Faso were\n            as follows outcomes were satisfactory; risk to development\n            outcome was low or negligible; Bank performance was\n            moderately satisfactory and borrower performance was\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned includes: indicators must\n            be realistic, feasible and available at the time the project\n            is launched. A well-prepared logical framework (i.e., a\n            results-based monitoring framework) should be the backbone\n            of project design and should be fully specified and agreed\n            prior to implementation. An Integrated Ecosystem Management\n            (IEM) approach focusing on inter-village cohesion built on a\n            common interest in the protection of shared watersheds is a\n            successful model. SILEM was innovative as it brought\n            together villages located in a watershed area and created a\n            common interest among them based on an integrated management\n            plan to protect the watershed.  This approach of developing\n            a common vision across interested villages allows for a\n            coherent organization and management of different\n            occupations (farmers/cultivators and cattle farmers) based\n            on the recognition the performance in each business depends\n            on the common management of the shared watershed. The\n            success of this approach was also reflected in the decline\n            in social conflict in the areas where SILEM intervened.\n            Formal and informal mechanisms were both required to ensure\n            the sustainability of the investment."}, "docdt": "2011-08-31T00:00:00Z"}
