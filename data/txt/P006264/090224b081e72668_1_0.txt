exchange held under the control or for the benefit of such member. To that end,

permitting the creation of such lien, shall make express provision to that effect;
provided, however, that, if for any constitutional or other legal reason such
provision cannot be made with respect to any lien created on assets of any of
its political or administrative subdivisions, the Borrower shall promptly and at no
cost to the Bank secure the principal of, and interest and other charges on, the
Loan by an equivalent lien on other public assets satisfactory to the Bank.

property, at the time of purchase thereof, solely as security for payment of the
purchase price of such property; (ii) any lien arising in the ordinary course of

its date; and (iii) any lien on commercial goods to secure debt maturing not more
than one year after the date on which it is originally incurred and to be paid
out of the proceeds of a sale of such commercial goods.

Borrower, of any political or adinistrative subdivision thereof and of any entity
owned or controlled by, or operating for the account or benefit of, the Borrower

by the Borrower to retain qualified full-time teachers in the educational institutions
included in the Project and avoid a high turnover of said teachers.

TOTAL        23,500,000
2.   The disbursement percentages have been calculated in compliance with the
policy of the Bank that no proceeds of h Loan shall be disbursed on account
of payments for taxes levied by, or in the territory of, the Borrower on goods


﻿14
or services, or on the importation, manufacture, procurement or supply thereof;
to that end, if any event occurs which shall affect the amount of any such taxes
included in the cost of any item to be financed out of the proceeds of the Loan,
the Bank may, by notice to the Borrower, correspondingly reduce the disbursement
percentage then applicable to such item.
3.    Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph I above, no withdrawals shall
be made in respect of:
(a)   expenditures prior to the date of this Agreement, except that
withdrawals may be made in respect of Categories 3 and 4 on account of
expenditures incurred after July 1, 1974 in an aggregate amount not exceeding
the equivalent of $300,000; and

Borrower has certified to the Bank that the Subsidiary Project Agreement with
the Project State in which said expenditures have been made is legally binding
upon said Project State and is effective.
4.    Notwithstanding the allocation of an amount of the Loan or the disbursement
percentages set forth in the table in paragraph 1 above, if the Bank has reasonably
estimated that the amount of the Loan then allocated to any Category will be
insufficient to finance the agreed percentage of all expenditures in that Category,
the Bank may, by notice to the Borrower: (i) reallocate to such Category to the
extent required to meet the estimated shortfall proceeds of the Loan which are
then allocated to another Category and which in the opinion of the Bank are
not needed to meet other expenditures, and (ii) if such reallocation cannot fully
meet the estimated shortfall, reduce the disbursement percentage then applicable
to such expenditures in order that further withdrawals under such Category may
continue until all expenditures thereunder shall have been made.
5.    If the Bank shall have reasonably determined that the procurement of any
item in any Category is inconsistent with the procedures set forth or referred to
in this Agreement, no expenditures for such item shall be financed out of the
proceeds of the Loan and the Bank may, without in any way restricting or limiting
any other right, power or remedy of the Bank under the Loan Agreement, by
notice to the Borrower, cancel such amount of the Loan as in the Bank's reasonable
opinion, represents the amount of such expenditures which would otherwise have
been eligible for financing out of the proceeds of the Loan.

consistent with those set forth in the "Guidelines for Procurement under World
Bank Loans and IDA Credits" published by the Bank in April 1972, as revised
in October 1972 (hereinafter called the Guidelines), on the basis of international
competitive bidding.
2.   (a)   Bidders for the works included in Part A of the Project shall be
prequalified as described in part 2.2 of the Guidelines.
(b)   Furniture and equipment shall be grouped so as to permit such bulk
procurement as shall be consistent with sound technical and procurement practices.
Contracts for such items shall be for not less than $5,000 equivalent.
3.    Furniture and equipment which cannot be grouped into packages of at least
$5,000 equivalent shall be procured in accordance with the Borrower's regular
procurement procedures. Such contracts shall not exceed in the aggregate $600,000
equivalent.
B.    Evaluation and Comparison of Bids for Goods; Preference for Domestic
Manufacturers
1.    For the purpose of evaluation and comparison of bids for the supply of
goods: (i) bidders shall be required to state in their bid the c.i.f. (port of entry)
price for imported goods, or the ex-factory price for domestically-manufactured
goods; (ii) customs duties and other import taxes on imported goods, including
merchant fleet renewal and port improvement taxes, and sales and similar taxes
on domestically-supplied goods, shall be excluded; and (iii) the cost to the Borrower
of inland freight and other expenditures incidental to the delivery of goods to
the place of their use or installation shall be included.
2.    Goods manufactured in Brazil may be granted a margin of preference in
accordance with, and subject to, the following provisions:
(a)   All bidding documents for the procurement of goods shall clearly
indicate any preference which will be granted, the information required to establish
the eligibility of a bid for such preference and the method that will be followed
in the evaluation and comparison of bids.


﻿22
(b)   After evaluation, responsive bids will be classified in one of the
following groups:
(1)   Group A: bids offering goods manufactured in Brazil if the
bidder shall have established to the satisfaction of the Borrower
and the Bank that such goods contain components manufactured
in Brazil equal to at least 50% of the value of the complete
goods.
(2)   Group B: bids o-fering any other goods.
(c)   All evaluated bids shall be compared among themselves, excluding any
customs duties and other import taxes on goods to be imported (including merchant
fleet renewal and port improvement taxes) and any sales or similar taxes on goods
to be supplied domestically, but after adding to each group B bid an amount equal
to (i) the amount of customs duties and other import taxes which a non-exempt
importer would have to pay for the importation of the goods offered in such
group B bid, or (ii) 15% of the c.i.f. bid price of imported goods or of the ex-factory
bid price of domestically-manufactured goods, as the case may be, classified in
such group B bid, if said customs duties and taxes exceed 15% of such price.
The lowest evaluated bid resulting from the above comparison shall be selected
for the award.
C.    Review of Procurement Decisions by Bank
1.   Review of prequalification. The Borrower shall, before qualification is invited,
inform the Bank in detail of the procedure to be followed and shall introduce
such modifications in said procedure as the Bank shall reasonably request. The
list of prequalified bidders, together with a statement of their qualifications and
of the reasons for the exclusion of any applicant for prequalification shall be
furnished by the Borrower to the Bank for its comments before the applicants
are notified, and the Borrower shall make such additions to, deletions from, or
modifications in, the said list as the Bank shall reasonably request.
2.    Review of invitation to bid and of proposed awards and final contracts:
With respect to all contracts for (i) civil works, and (ii) furniture and
equipment estimated to cost the equivalent of $5,000 or more:
(a)   Before bids are invited, the Borrower shall furnish to the Bank, for
its comments, the text of the invitations to bid and the specifications and other
bidding documents, together with a description of the advertising procedures to


﻿23
be followed for the bidding, and shall make such modifications in the said
documents or procedures as the Bank shall reasonably request. Any further
modification to the bidding documents shall require the Bank's concurrence before
it is issued to the prospective bidders.
(b)   Promptly after the bids have been received, the Borrower shall inform
the Bank of the names of the bidders and the respective amounts of the bids.
(c)   After bids have been received and evaluated, the Borrower shall, before
a final decision on the award is made, inform the Bank of the name of the bidder
to which it intends to award the contract and the reasons for the intended award
and shall furnish to the Bank, in sufficient time for its review, a detailed report
by PRODEM on the evaluation and comparison of the bids received, together with
the recommendation for award of PRODEM and such other information as the
Bank shall reasonably request. The Bank shall, if it determines that the intended
award would be inconsistent with the Guidelines or this Schedule, promptly inform
the Borrower and state the reasons for such determination.
(d)   The terms and conditions of the contract shall not, without the Bank's
concurrence, materially differ from those on which bids were asked or
prequalification invited.
(e)   Two conformed copies of the contract shall be furnished to the Bank
promptly after its execution and prior to sending to the Bank the first application
for withdrawal of funds from the Loan Account in respect of such contract.
