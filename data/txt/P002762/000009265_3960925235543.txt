POWER REHABILITATION PROJECT
CREDIT AND PROJECT SUMMARY
Borrower:             United Republic of Tanzania.
Beneficiaries:        The Tanzania Electric Supply Company, Limited
(TANESCO), the Ministry of Energy and Minerals (MEN)
and the National Urban Water .1uthority (NUWA).
Credit Amount:        SDR 34.7 million (US$40 million equivalent).
Terms:                Standard.
Re-lending Terms:     The Government would onlend US$37.3 million out of the
proceeds of the credit to TANESCO at an irterest rate
of 9% over 20 years, with 4 years of grace, TANESCO to
bear foreign exchange risk; and make available US$2.4
millior to MEM and US$0.3 million to NUWA, both as
grants.
Cofinancing:          The United Republic of Tanzania is arranging
cofinancing as follows: grants from the Governments
of Canada (US$10.2 million equivalent), Finland
(US$2.3 million equivalent), and Norway (US$8.3
million equivalent); and a loan from the European
Investment Bank (US$6 million equivalent). An
additional amount of cofinancing for about US$10.6
million is being sought, but for which commitments
have not yet been confirmed.
Project Objectives:   The main objectives of the proposed project are (i) to
help restore Tanzania's power system, which is in
urgent need of rehabilitation, to reasonable levels of
reliability and service, and (ii) to encourage
efficient domestic energy resource development and
management. The proposed project would re-establish
the operating performance of TANESCO's power system
and assist in improving its financial performance
through appropriate pricing policies. It would also
help the Government and TANESCO to develop an invest-
ment program for the power sector based on least-cost
criteria, consistent with Tanzania's available
financial and foreign exchange resources. It is also
designed to improve availability and production of
household energy supplies by pilot activities Ln n3re
efficient commercial charcoal and charcoal stuEve
production.

Project Description:  The project comprises, for the power subsector:
rehabilitation of power stations with a total name-
plate rating of about 120 MW; rehabilitatiotu of
existIng transmission lines, substations and
distribution networks; improvement of associated
communications facilities and supply of transport,
spares and tools-  Technical assistance would be
provided for project implementation, financial
operations, engineering and training programs in all
areas of TANESCO's operations. For the other energy
sector components, the project comprises: two or
three commercial-sized pilot charcoal production
operations based on the use of natural forests that
have to be cleared for agricultural purposes;
training of charcoal cooker manufacturers and
artisans in production and dissemination of improved
cookers; and a study of the feasibility of
manufacturing or importing low-cost electric
cookers. For NUWA, the project would provide
technical support to improve its billing and
collection procedures to ensure more timely
repayment of its debts to TANESCO.
Project Risks:        The major risk is financial.  The projected load
growth and TANESCO revenues take the existing
depressed state of the Tanzanian economy into con-
sideration and also assume that it will continue for
the immediate future. As a result, high tariff
increases are required in order to provide adequate
cash generation for TANESCO's overall operations and
investments (even with an investment program that has
been curtailed). A 67% tariff increase has recently
been implemented and a semi-annual tariff review and
adjustment mechanism is provided for under the
project. No major physical risks are anticipated in
implementing the proposed project. The charcoal
cookers and production components depend on a newly-
created organization for their management. This
risk, as well as the problem of designing a workable
arrangement between Government-supported training and
financing activities and initiatives for private
sector operation and marketing, would be reduced by
the involvement of Tanzanian institutions experienced
in private enterprise development atnd from experience
from ongoing similar projects in other African
countries.

TANZANIA
POWER REHABILITATION PROJECT
II THE ENERGY SECTOR
Background
1.01           Tanzania  is a predominantly agricultural economy with a
population of 20.4 million people.   It is located on the East Coast of
Africa and includes the islands of Zanzibar and Pemba in the Indian Ocean
(Map IBRD 16231R). Measured by eonventional indicators Tanzania is one of
the 25 poorest countries in the world, with a 1984 GRP per capita incoze of
LS$210, a rate of annual average output growth of only 0.3% between 1982
and 1984, and a high population growth rate of 3.3Z.  Overall, the, per
capita rate of growth of its GDP averaged only 0.1X from 1973 to 1982, with
sharp real declines in more recent years.
1.02        For the last four to five years, the economy has been facing
serious hardships, with declining production in all important sectors,
leading to widespread shortages of essential goods and servicer and a
rapidly deteriorating infrastructure.    Inflation,  as measured  by  the
consumer price index, continues at high levels, fluctuating between 25 and
30% per year.  The important productive sectors, especially agriculture,
mining and industry, have had declining outputs, reaching their lowest
levels over the last seven years in 1983.   For example, ou-put of the
manufacturing sector in that year was only 42% of that reached in 1978.
This has important implications for the energy sector and is a major factor
in the lack of growth in electric power consumption (para. 2.07).   The
Government has taken various steps to stem the decline, notably its own
structural adjustment program, but the measures implemented have yet to
produce significant results, although a modest upturn of about 3% in GDP is
projected for 1985. However, it is hoped that renewed discussions with the
IMF, Bank and the international donor community may lead to an improved
stabilization program in the foreseeable future with increased donor
assistance. The outcome of these discussions and the Government's ability
to implement an effective economic recovery program are likely to have a
significant effect on the energy sector in terms of demand growth, energy
import requirements and the financial performance of energy supply
organizations.
Energy Resources 1/
1.03        Tanzania's energy resources are substantial and diverse, but
little exploited so far.  In addition to large, but unevenly distributed
forestry  resources,  the  country  has  large  coal  deposits  in  the
south-western region which are estimated at 2 billion tonnes with about
300 million tor.nes of proven reserves. Significant proven gas deposits are
located on Songo Songo Island some 200 km south of Dar es Salaam. Another
substantial deposit of as yet undefined size has been located at Nnazi Bay
north of the Mozambique border.   Oil exploration activities have been

Issues And Options In the Energy Sector, Report No. 4969-TA, Nov. 19f4.



-2-
ongoing for several years but so far with no significant results.   The
country also has some unexplored geothermal and uranium potential.
Tanzania's hydro potential is estimated at about 4,500 MW, of which 247 MW
have been developed so far and 80 MW are under construction.
1.04       Woodfuel.  Tanzania has apprrximately 440,000 km2 of forestry
resources  (40% of its land area) most of it in the form of natural
forests.  No national forest inventory has been made and thus there is no
reliable data base available for planning purposes.   Theoretically, the
potential annual fuelwood production of these forestry resources is about
20 million m3, but regional demands are poorly matched to sources of
supply, so that in major consumption areas annual consumption is estimated
to be some two and a half times greater than sustainable supply.   The
United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)/Bank Energy Assessment Report
estimated that by the year 2000 the productive capacity of the natural
forests could be reduced by 25% if present trends continue and if no ste2s
are taken to reduce consumption or increase replanting.  Because of the
growing shortages, market prices of charcoal in urban centers are rising
rapidly in real terms, exceeding those of price-controlled, but scarce
kerosene and LPG on an energy-equivalent basis. This imbalance has serious
ecologic consequences and implications for further woodfuel supply; the
Government is responding to this issue with a variety of actions, including
the proposed project's household energy components (para. 3.2), which will
indirectly affect fuelwood utilization.
1.05       Natural Gas.  Tanzania's natural gas reserves of 0.72 TCJ were
proven in 1983 under the IDA-financed Second Songo Songo Petroleum
Exploration  Project, CR 1199-TA  (para  1.23).   They are equivalent  to
Tanzania's total domestic commercial energy needs for the next 30 yesrs at
1981 consumption levels. There are probable reserves of over one trillion
cubic  feet.   The  principal  proposed  market at  present  is fertilizer
prodiction for export, with the domestic fertilizer market projected to
take only 10% of the proposed 1725 tpd urea and 1560 tpd ammonia plant.
Potential  financing  of  such  a  project,  estimated  to  cost  about
US$465 million, is being considered by an international consortium that
includes the IFC as a possible cofinancier. However, numerous difficulties
will yet have to be overcome before this project proves to be financially
viable and also in the best interest of the country.  Under the Petroleum
Sector Technical Assistance Project (CR P3547-TA, para. 1.23) a domestic
gas utilization study, as well as a gas pipeline feasibility study will be
carried out. Potential domestic uses for the gas include substitution for
liquid fuels in industry and transport, and, in the longer term, power
generation.
1.06      Coal.  Tanzania's coal resources are estimated at about 2 billion
tons of which 304 million are proven.  Two coalfields, Songwe-Kiwira and
Ketewaka-Mchuchuma, have been investigated by geological teams funded by
the People's Republic of China and the Federal Republic of Germany.
Present coal production is about 10,000 tpy from the Songwe-Kiwira
underground mine.  Its reserves are nearly exhausted, although an adjacent
block of reserves is scheduled to produce about 50,000 tpy by 1988. Two
other mining projects, one supported by the Chinese Government and the
other being studied under IDA Credit 1371-TA respectively could produce
some 150,000 tpy by 1988 and 300,000-500,000 tpy after 1990.  However, at



-3-
present it is not clear whether there exist markets large enough to absorb
this potential output or whether the coal could be competitive, given the
need for substantial transport infrastructure and distance from potential
markets.
1.07      Hydro.  So tar, a total of some 4,500 MW of potential power sites
with 21,000 GWh of firm annual energy have been identified.  Some 253 MW
have been developed, with another 80 MW under construction at Mtera, with
partial  IDA  financing  (CR  1405-TA).    Including Mtera,  annual energy
availability by 1988 will be 1450 GWh, significantly in excess of projected
demand (para. 2.10).
1.08          Petroleum.   Since 1969 the Tanzania Petroleum Development
Corporation (TPDC),under production sharing or joint venture agreements
with international oil companies, has drilled 23 exploration wells, so far
without success except for the discovery of gas (para. 1.05).  Hence all
petroleum is imported.   Refining of imported crude is carried out by the
Tanzanian and Italian Refining Company Limited (TIPER) at Dar es Salaam.
Petroleum products are marketed by five Tanzanian subsidiaries of
international oil companies.   The Government, through TPDC, holds a 50%
share in two of them, while the others are wholly owned by their parent
companies.  IDA's Second Songo Songo Petroleum Exploration Project funded
an organizational study of TPDC, and the recently approved Petroleum Sector
Technical Assistance Project includes training for TPDC staff.
1.09       Dependence on Imports.  Although petroleum accounted for only
7.4% of total energy consumed in 1981, it represented 92% of energy
consumption other than biomass fuels.   In spite of Government rationing,
the relative share of petroleum (crude and refined products) in total
imports has been growing since 1978, amounting to some 50% of export
earnings in 1984.  Tanzania faces a continuing, severe shortage of untied
foreign exchange which is needed to finance petroleum imports.   Lack of
funds to finance such imports has led to very costly supp y interruptions
from time to time.
Energy Sector Organization
1.10      Responsibility for energy supplies rests with several different
agencies with  little  coordination between  them until  recently.    The
Ministry of Energy and Minerals (MEM, formerly the Ministry of Water,
Energy and Minerals) handles hydrocarbons, electricity, coal and uranium.
The Ministry of Natural Resources and Tourism (MNRT) deals with fuelwood
through its Forestry Department, while the Prime Minister's office is
involved with the development of village woodlots, and to a lesser degree,
with village electrification.  As far as the commercial energy sector is
concerned, MEM supervises TPDC, TIPER, the Tanzania Electric Supply
Corporation (TANESCO), and the State Mining Corporation (STAMICO).  It is
envisaged that MEM will also supervise the Tanzania Rural Electrification
Corporation (TARECO, para. 1.11) as well as a gas corporation (GASCO) if
and when it is formed. Following the recommendation of the Bank's Energy
Assessment Report, an Energy Coordinating Committee was established in MEM
under the Commissioner of Energy, with participation by other ministries
and energy agencies.   MEM is now in charge of coordinating all energy
activities of the Government, including those covering woodfuels (in



-4-
collaboration with MNRT).  fEM has several technical assistance advisors on
its staff. The most recent addition was an advisor financed by the Federal
Republic of Germany on renewable energy who is assisting MEM and the
Government in developing a coherent approach to deal with fuelwood,
charcoal  and  other  household  fuels.    Two  diagrams,  outlining  the
organizational structure and operational functions of the Energy Department
of MEM are shown in Annex 1.1.
The Government's Energy Sector Objective , Strategy and Policy
1.11       The Government has five broad objectives in the energy sector:
the first is to assure minimum needed supply of energy to the various
sectors at reasonable costs; the second is to maintain uniform prices for
commercial  energy  (petroleum,  electricity)  throughout  the  country,
regardless of the local or regional costs of supply;  the third is to
maintain the financial viability of the various energy supply organizations
(I.e. power, petroleum); the fourth is to promote the exploitation of some
of the underdeveloped indigenous energy resources for domestic uses and
exports, (either directly or as inputs to export-oriented industries); and
the fifth is concerned with securing and augmenting the supply of household
fuels such as fuelwood and charcoal.
1.12        Expand Power Supply.   In pursuit of the first objective the
Government has actively supported the expansion of electric power supply
facilities with strong, and perhaps excessive emphasis on the expansion of
the interconnected transmission system (para. 2.19, 2.20); it owns the
electric utility company outright, has taken a majority equity position in
the country's only refinery, and is actively involved in the import of
petroleum products. Because of the heavy foreign exchange burden imposed
by oil imports, attempts are made to reduce consumption as much as possible
by keeping petroleum prices at least in line with, or above economic
opportunity costs, limiting oil imports, enforcing Sunday driving bans,
etc. The Government is also actively promoting the search for oil and gas
(with Bank Group assistance), generally in cooperation with foreign oil
companies (para. 1.08).
1.13       Commercial Energy Prices.  In pursuit of its social objectives,
uniform prices and tariffs are charged for petroleum products and
electricity throughout the country regardless of the local costs of
supply.   This results in significant cross subsidies between users in
different regions (pars. 5.15). Prices for LPG and kerosene, two important
household fuels, are set at much lower levels than those for other
petroleum products, although not below economic opportunity costs. In the
petroleum sector as a whole, prices (including taxes) are set at
sufficiently high levels in the aggregate so that significant net revenues
accrue to the Government.
1.14       Improve Financial Viability.  With respect to power prices the
Government is officially committed to malntain the financial viability of
TANESCO. This objective is being addressed under the project (para. 5.17),
1.15         Develop Indigenous Resources.   For- a number of years the
Government has actively promoted the development of its ample hydro



-5-
resources for exports in order to increase foreign exchante earnings.
Lately, this option has become more urgent because of the current and
future  surplus  of  generating  capaCity.    As  a  result  of  preliminary
negotiations with Kenya a joint interconnection study has been agreed upon
in principle (para. 2.15).  The Government is 8lso actively considering
development of gas (both for domestic and export purposes) and coal
resources (paras. 1.05 and 1.06).
1.16      Improve Household Energy Supply.  In the household fuels sector,
the Government is supporting reforestation (para. 1.04) and it is actively
involved in the renewable energy area, having established a renewable
energy unit in the Energy Department of MEM (para. 1.09). It is supporting
increased supplies of LPG under the IDA Petroleum Sector Technical
Assistance Credit (Report No. P-4013-TA) and it is planning to support
charcoal production, charcoal stove production, and the rehabilitation and
strengthening  of  power  distribution  facilities  under  this  project
(Chapter III).
Bank/IDA Participation in the Sector and Rationale for Involvement
1.17         The Bank Group has long been involved in Tanzania's energy
sector. The first Bank loan (518-TA) was to TANESCO for US$5.2 million in
1969 to meet  the projected power demands for 1970-71.   That project
involved installation of some 20 MW of diesel generating plants.   The
second power loan of US$30 million (715-TA) was made in 1970 to help
finance the first phase of the Kidatu Hydro Project.   This  involved
construction of a dam and an underground generating station on the Great
Ruaha River with a capacity of 100 MW; expansion of 15 MW in existing
diesel capacity, and construction of a transmission line from Kidatu to Dar
es Salaam. A third window loan (1306-T-TA) of US$30 million was approved
in 1976 to finance the second phase of the Kidatu development, involving
the construction of an upstream dam at the Mtera site and the addition of
100 MW of generating capacity at Kidatu.   All three projects have been
satisfactorily completed by TANESCO, broadly .-ithin their original
construction schedules, though there were cost overruns in the second and
third power projects, due mainly to unexpected bad rock conditions during
the excavation and international inflation that affected civil works
costs (Project Completion Report No. 4622 (Toan 1306-T-TA) June 1983). The
Bank Group provided supplementary funds to cover the cost overruns (US$5.0
million for Power II and US$7.0 million for Power III).   Other problems
that developed during project execution were the lower than projected
growth in demand, the inadequate adjustment of tariffs to meet the required
rate of return, and large build-up of accounts receivable that created cash
shortages for TANESCO.   The same issues confront TANESCO today.   With
respect to overly optimistic demand forecasts, steps have been taken to
make them more reliable in the future (para. 2.07). To prevent excessive
accounts receivables, some preconditions to settle Government accounts have
been met prior to negotiations and others are being proposed (para. 5.14).
Tariffs have been adjusted prior to negotiations (para. 5.16) and in the
future adjustments at six-months intervals will be required (para. 5.24)
1.18       Fourth (Mtera)  ydro Power Project.  Credit 1405-TA for US$35
million equivalent was approved in 1983 to partly finance the Fourthl Power
Project. This US $235 million project comprises the construction of an 80



-6-
MW powerplant and related civil works at Mtera, the construction ot a
control center, and some rehabilitation work, training, and a number of
management, planning and pricing studies. Italy, KfW, Kuwait Fund, NORAD
and SIDA are cofinanciers of the project. This project Is under way. At
this point no significant delays or cost overruns are envisaged.   The
project is expected to be completed in 1988.
1.19          Songo-Songo Project.   The Bank -also financed a petroleum
exploration project in 1980 to assess the gas potential at Songo-Songo (CR
27-TA for US$30.0 million) and a second oil-gas exploration project (CR
1199-TA) in 1981.  Reasonably-sized gas reserves have been confirmed at
Songo-Songo (para. 1.05).-
1.20        Energy Assessment   In 1984 the UNDP/Bank Energy Assessment
Program completed a comprehensive analysis of the energy sector (Report
No. 4969-TA).  Several of the report's recommendations have already been
implemented by the Government, such as the formation of an energy planning
department (para. 1.10), and the detailed analysis of domestic natural gas
utilization options (para. 1.05). A number of them form the basis for this
project.   In addition, the Government has agreed to a UNDP/Bank Energy
Sector Management Assistance (ESMAP) Program whose specific components will
be determined in early 1986, and is likely to include assessments of
fuelwood/household/crop processing fuel needs, and of the potentials for
energy conservation in industry and transport.
Past Bank/IDA Accomplishments
1.21         Past Bank/IDA activities in the energy sector have had a
significant and positive effect on sector development:
(a) Through sector work, studies and technical assistance, (in
part through the UNDP/World Bank Energy Assessment Program) a
significant energy sector planning capability in the MEM was
created.
(b) Through a succession of loans and credits (in close cooperation
with other lenders and donors), the expansion of the power sector
has been guided fror a minor, diesel-based operation to a
country-wide,   substantive  public  utility  system  with  an
impressive  performance  record,   in  spite  of  its  current
difficulties.    The  latter  can  be  largely  traced  to  the
deteriorating macro-economic environment, which drastically and
pervasively Affected TANESCO's operations by locking the company
into a, ia retrospect, too ambitious expansion program on the one
hand, ancd denying it the human and physical resources to maintain
its ongoing operations in proper operating conditions on the
other.
(c) IDA, through several credits, has been instrumental in the
establishment of an active petroleum sector exploration program
which is financed largely by international oil companies and/or
outside donors. The major result so far has been the discovery
of commercial-sized gas deposits which, after development of the
necessary infrastructure, will make a significant contribution to
energy supplies in Tanzania, as well as to possible exports.



7-
(d) Through substantial training support to the power sector and,
more recently, also to the petroleum sector, various needed
skills were developed, with the result that these public
enterprises ate largely managed and operated by Tanzanians.
(e) Technical assistance and studies financed under the various
credits have led to a number of important recommendations.   In
the power sector alone, a long-term power development plan, a
tariff study, a management study, a rehabilitation study and
several others have just been, or are in '-'e process of being
completed.   They will provide much needeo guidance for future
planning, better management and redirection of development
strategies.
Bank Rationale for Involvement
1.22      IDA's objectives in the energy sector include the promotion of:
(a) investment priorities based on least-cost criteria, consistent
with available financial and foreign exchange resources;
(b) efficient domestic energy resource development and management,
especially for wood resources, hydropower, natural gas and
petroleum imports, refining and distribution;
(c) sound financial management and financial planning for energy
enterprises through appropriate pricilg policies and prudent
capital structures; and
(d) the creation of competent national energy planning capabilities,
including training, studies and technical assistance.
Future Operations
1.23      Further IDA operations ate proposed for the energy sector in the
next few years.   First, the FY86 Petroleum Sector Technical Assistance
Project will address immediate sectoral requirements, including protection
of the Songo-Songo natural gas offshore wells, LPG marketing, improvement
in existing petroleum refinery product production, preparation for the
introduction of natural gas from the Songo-Songo offshore reserve into the
domestic market (by providing detailed market and gas supply studies) and
strengthening TPDC and MKM through manpower training programs. Second, the
proposed project, building upon the rehabilitation studies undertaken under
the Fourth Power Project, will focus on the rehabilitation and maintenance
of TANESCO's transmission and distribution system and isolated power
stations. In addition, it would include a fuelwood/charcoal and electric
cooker component.  In the meantime, IFC is taking the lead role for the
Bank Group in examining the technical, economic and financial feasibility
of an export-oriented fertilizer plant that would be the prime user of the
Songo-Songo natural gas reserves.   Depending on the results of the gas
feasibility studies, a gas infrastructure project might be considered.
Further energy sector assistance would likely focus on household/
industrial/agricultural fuel supply (with emphasis on mobilizing domestic
natural resources).

II* THE SUBSECTORS AND BENEFICIARIES
Introduction
2.01           The main focus of  the proposed project  is directed at
rehabilitating the physical facilities, and improving the financial and
managerial performance of the country's electric power utility, TANESCO. A
second purpose Is to help improving the supply of household fuels through
several large-scale pilot projects. This chapter discusses the problems
that face both sectors and the intended beneficiaries and have led to the
formulation of the project.
A. The Power Subsector
Power Subsector Operations and Performance
2.02      A number of important issues have to be addressed and resolved in
the power sector. They are:
(a) electric power system service reliability (para. 2.05);
(b) substantive surplus power generating capacity (para. 2.10) and
its effects on financial performance (para. 5.01);
(e) viability and priority of the interconnected grid extension to
the Northwest (Dodoma-Mwanza, Mwanza-Musoma, Shinyanga-Tabora)
(para. 2.19);
(d) tariff levels and structure, and unpaid accounts (paras. 5.15 &
5.10);
(e) increase in unexplained losses (para. 2.18);
(f) lack of competent, mid-level staff (para. 2.29); and
(g) measures needed to serve potential additional power markets
including international interconnections (paras. 2.12 - 2.17)
These issues are discussed in detail in the various sections indicated in
the respective parentheses.
2.03      Existing Facilities.  Electricity supply is the responsibility of
TANESCO, which supplies some 93% of the power consumed in the country, with
the balance self-generated by parastatals and private organizations.   The
present power system of TANESCO consists of an interconnected system (ICS)
in the east, northeast and southwest which provides services to the Dar es
Salaam, Morogoro, Tanga, Arusha, Moshi, Iringa-Mufindi and Mbeya regions
and has an installed capacity of 253 MW (Map IBRD 16231R) serving some
109,000 customers in 1984. Twenty-three isolated service areas supply the
larger urban and industrial centers in the rest of the country serving some
41,000 customers, with a total installed capacity of 66 MW, mostly in the
form of diesel driven generators, and less than 2 KW of hydroelectric
plants.   TANESCO's total Installed capacity of 401 NW comprises 253 MW
hydro and 148 MW diesel and gas turbine power stations; 80 MW of hydro-
electric capacity is under construction at the Mtera Project  (IDA CR
1405-TA); 51% of the present installed capacity is at the Kidatu power
station which supplies the main interconnected system. A detailed list of
existing facilities is contained in Annex 2.1.   A special, high-risk
feature of the ICS is that there is only a single 220 kV transmission



-9-
circuit connecting Kidatu and, later, also Mtera, with the main demand
centers around Dar es Salaam, which account for some 60X of total ICS
demands. The line transverses some difficult and dangerous terrain. Also,
the line consists of guyed towers which makes it vulnerable to damage.
This is a major reason for the need for the rehabilitation stand-by
capacity in Dar es Salaam that would be provided under the project (para.
3.04 & 4.11).
2.04        Rural Electrification Program.  In addition to TANESCO, there
exists a special rural electrification program under the Government-owned
TARECO.   So far the program's activities have been limited to providing
connections for only nine'villages due to lack of demand and investment
resources.   Given the Government's budgetary difficulties it is unlikely
that significant efforts will be made in this fleld over the next several
years.
Service Reliability
2.05        Service reliability of the TANESCO system has deteriorated to
such a degree that the whole supply system is in urgent need of
rehabilitation.   In general, it has been found that the state of the
network deteriorates as the voltage level decreases, particularly in and
around Dar es Salaam. Outages are frequent, with some 500 major incidents
per year reported in the 1981-83 period. Since then they have been rising
rapidly both in frequency and duration.   These outages are costly, with
major outages on occasion cutting such vital services as water supply in
Dar es Salaam for several days, and disrupting industrial output. Voltage
conditions at consumer terminals have been found to be as low as 100 V
(against a nominal 220 V).   Installations are in dangerous condition,
protective devices are missing or inoperative and there are pervasive signs
of aging, overloading, corrosion and lack of maintenance. Isolated diesel
generating stations, particularly the installations at Mwanza and Musoma,
are not operating properly and require urgent rehabilitation, if
excessively high power outages or load curtailments are to be reduced to
more acceptable levels. Most of these conditions are a result of lack of
spare parts, maintenance equipment, fuels, consumables and skilled labor.
A detailed study 2/ analyzing these conditions has been carried out with
funds provided under CR 1405-TA. Its findings provide the basis for this
project.
2.06        Patterns of Electricity Consumption.  In 1984, TANESCO's total
sales of electricity were 734 GWh, after two successive years of decline
from the previous peak of 723 GWh reached in 1981. Eighty-three percent of
the total was supplied in the ICS, the balance in the isolated systems. In
spite of falling sales in several recent years, losses, and in consequence
generation in the ICS increased year by year to reach 776 GWh in 1984, some
164 GWh, or twenty one percent higher than sales, which is excessively high
(para. 2.18). In 1984 ICS peak demand was 140 MW, an increase of 9% over
1983.  Sales to the major tariff classes were split in approximately the
proportions shown in Table 2.1.

It must be noted, however, that in recent years residential sales appear to
be  substantially  overstated,  while  commercial  consumption  may  be
understated (para. 5.15).   Also,  industrial demand is currently below
potential demand because of the very low industrial plant utilization
rate.   In the past, industry accounted for about two-thirds of sales.
Detailed data covering the period from 1970 to 1984 for the ICS and the
isolated load centers can be found in Annex 2.2.
2.07      Load Forecast.  Detailed load forecasts were recently prepared as
part of the Tanzania Power Sector Master Plan undertaken by Acres
International Ltd., Canada, and financed by IDA CR 1405-TA.  These were
modified by the mission to take account of the proposed loss reduction
program under the project. Given the distressed economic conditions of the
country, it is not surprising that these new forecasts are much lower than
those prepared only a few years ago.   Two forecasts were prepared: An
optimistic one, called (A), which presents an 'upper bound" and is based on
the assumption that agreement with the international donor community on an
appropriate economic recovery program will be completed shortly so that
economic recovery and growth can get underway in 1986. The other, called
(B), is a pessimistic one and assumes that there will be a two year delay
until real recovery begins in a manner that would affect in a significant
way the power consuming  sectors,  particularly  industry.    The marked
difference between these two new and earlier forecasts can be seen from the
comparison in Table 2.2.   Compared to the 1983 Staff Appraisal Report
projections for the Mtera Hydropower Project (CR 1405-TA), actual 1984
generation was 24% lower; for 1990 the most recent, "upper bound"
projections are lower by 29% and the "lower bound" ones by 59%.
2.08         Accuracy of Forecasts.   Given the inaccuracies of earlier
forecasts,  considerable  efforts  have  been  made  by  TANESCO  and  its
consultants in preparing the new load forecasts, using essentially a
"bottom-up" approach, which was based on plant-by-plant surveys of the
larger industrial plants and of new projects under construction, as well as
of each specific load center. This should make these new forecasts more
reliable than the earlier ones. This detailed, 'bottom-up' approach also
accounts for the seemingly erratic changes in annual percentage growth
rates in Table 2.3.

2.09      A more detailed discussion of the assumptions used, as well as a
breakdown of the forecasts by consumer categories can be found in
Annex 2.3.   To improve future forecasts, two TANESCO staff members were
trained in load forecasting techniques; they participated in their detailed
preparation, and both the computer hardware and software were transferred
to TANESCO.    Continuous  updating  of  the  load  forecast will  be  the
responsibility of TANESCO's Planning Department.   TANESCO already has
agreed to update them on a regular basis. IDA, under this project, will
include in its normal supervis4on activities a regular review of these
forecasts.
Supply/Demand Balance
2.10       Supply*  ICS capabilities in the form of hydro, once the Mtera
hydroelectric plant is completed in 1988, will be approximately 1,450 GWh
of firm energy capability and 320 MW of dependable capacity, much higher
than projected demand  (Table  2.3)4   Under either  load  forecast,  the
available firm energy capability and generating capacity of the ICS will be
in excess of projected demands until at least 1992 or later.   Low-cost
upgrading of existing diesel generating facilities could add at least
another three years until new capacity would have to be added to the system
(paras. 4.11 & 4.16). The additional back-up thermal generating capacity
(nameplate rating) will be 85 MW. If the ICS extension to Mwanza, Tabora
and Musoma are completed, another 35 MW of existing diesel back-up capacity
would become available to the ICS.   Because of the substantial surplus,
specific simulation studies with respect to sensitivity of demand to
increased tariffs (para. 5.17), or increased supply reliability are not
needed at this time.
2.11      Demand.  By far the largest load center in the ICS is the Dar es
Salaam area, with approximately 72,000 consumers (out of 109,000 total in
the ICS) and a peak demand of 85 MW in 1984.   This figure actually
indicates depressed demand,  since many factories are either closed or
working at low levels because of shortages of raw materials and supplies.
In addition, a number of potential consumers cannot be connected because of
local supply system limitations and/or the shortage of materials. If, (a)
factory production returned to normal and (b) all potential consumers were
connected (there are waiting lists for new connections), the system load in
Dar es Salaam would be significantly higher than the present figure and
could exceed 100 MW.
Corrective Actions
2.12          On the assumption that the Mtera Project is completed on
schedule, the following actions are possible to reduce to some extent the
surplus and the related financial pressures:
2.13       Power Exports.  In the foreseeable future, the only potential
market for power exports is Kenya.  Kenya presently imports up to 30 MW
from Owen Falls, Uganda.   Although Kenya has some as yet undeveloped
hydropower sites and has additional geothermal potential, these are costly
to develop. Also, Kenya has to maintain a substantial, oil-fired, reactive
power compensation capability at Mombasa, currently amounting to between
25-30 MW and growing.  An interconnection between the Tanzanian ICS from



- 13 -
either Tanga (at 132kv) or Chalinze (at 220 kV) to Mombasa is the most
likely primary interconnection between the two countries.   The Kenyan
authorities have indicated that they would prefer not to import more than
10 to 15X of their capacity (MW) requirements In order to maintain their
own supply reliability; but within this capacity constraint they would
likely import as much energy (GWh) as possible, particularly at a cost
lower than the alternative of operating the Mombasa oil-fired station.
Assuming energy would be delivered at an 80% load factor of allowable
import capacity, Tanzanian exports could be approximately 25 MW and 175 GWh
in 1990, and 100 MW and 700 GWh in the year 2000. The export level in 1990
could thus add about 172 and 12% to TANESCO's energy (GWh) and power (MW)
sales respectively.
2.14       lenya National Power Development Plan.  Kenya's future demands
and supply options for power will be studied in detail under the Kenya
National Power Development Plan (para. 2.15), completion of which is
scheduled for fall,1986.   A preliminary assessment indicates that some
import of electricity from Tanzania could be of great mutual benefit to
both countries.
2.15        Tanzania-Kenya Interconnection.  A joint interconnection study
between the two countries, to be financed by CIDA, has just been agreed
upon in principle by CIDA and the two countries. It will be carried out by
Acres which also undertook the IDA-financed Tanzanian Power Master Plan,
and will be carrying out the CIDA-financed Kenya National Power Development
Plan, for which the Bank/ESMAP is the executing agency.   The earliest
possible date that a transvnission line connecting the Tanzanian and Kenyan
power systems could be in place is considered to be early 1989.
2.16        Potential Electric Boiler Installations.  Proposals have been
made by the mill to install electric boilers at the Mufindi Pulp Mill with
a rated capacity of 25 MW, with average annual consumption ranging from 65
to 89 GWh/year, to utilize secondary surplus power from the TANESCO's ICS
until 1991, and at lesser rates thereafter, depending on surplus power
availcbility. This rate of consumption would be well within the projected
generating surplus of the ICS.  Any revenue derived by TANESCO over and
above connection, administrative and operating and maintenance costs would
represent a net financial gain to TANESCO.
2.17      Summary.  In total, the potential for additional sales, as shown
in Table 2.4, is about 275 GWh by 1990.

This would reduce the projected energy surplus of the ICS from 450 GWh to
about 175 GWh.  Whether such additional sales would be economically and
financially attractive to Tanzania and TANESCO will depend on the tariffs
and terms and conditions of the aales arrangements.   Care must be taken,
however, that any preferential tariffs that may be offered to these surptwis
users can be terminated,  if and when  'normal" demand encroaches upon
promotional sales of surplus energy. While IDA is in principle stronglv in
favour of such sales, during negotiations agreement was obtained with
Government and TANESCO that major promotional sales agreements are to he
reviewed by IDA to assure that they are in the best interest of TANESCO and
do not violate the principle of a least-cost power expansion program.
Power System Iosses
2.18       From 1970 to 1982, TANESCO's system experienced a rate of power
losses of 15% of generation. During and after 1983, however, there was a
significant Increase to 21%. This sudden increase is not explainable by an
increase in technical losses alone, which are a result of the lack of spare
parts and  scheduled maintenance.    Other major  factors are increasing
problems with meter reading and billing, as well as outright theft.
TANESCO suffers from a serious shortage of vehicles and meters, and lacks
reliable staff for a better performance in meter reading, for monitoring
the accuracy of meters, control of illegal connections and actual bill
collections.  The proposed project addresses both the issues of technical
and nontechnical loss reductions (para. 3.04).
Expansion Program
2.19        TANESCO's current investment program consists of addition of
generation, transmission and distribution facilities, and substantial
rehabilitation works. The company's systems expansion planning is its own
responsibility but in reality is heavily influenced by Government policy
and decision making (para. 2.29).   TANESCO, with assistance by IDA (CR
1405-TA), is involved in the construction of Mtera, an 80 MW, US$235
million hydroelectric power station to be completed in 1988.  TANESCO is
also in the process of expanding its interconnected transmission system.
This expansion program, consisting mainly of 132 and 220 kV transmission
lines, is designed to interconnect currently isolated areas of Tanzania
with the main ICS.   TANESCO has just completed 750 km of 220 kV lines
connecting the cities of Iringa, Mufindi, Mbeya and Dodoma to the ICS. The
line to the Mtera hydrostation has been connected to the main grid through
the recently completed Iringa-Dodoma 220 kV transmission line.  There are
four other lines planned for completion over the next few years:
Dodoma-Singida  220  kV,  210  km,  with  completion  scheduled  for  1986:
Singida-Mwanza 220 kV, 360 km, completion in 1988; Mwanza-Musoma 132 kV,
210 km, and Shinyanga-Tabora 132 kV, 200 km, both to be completed in 1988.
These transmission lines are intended to supply the cities of the
northwest:  Singida,  Shinyanga,  Mwanza,  Musoma  and  rhabora,  thereby
eliminating costly and unreliable diesel generation, but also adding some
35 MW of diesel  back-up capacity  to  the system.    This  transmission
expansion program, at a cost of about US$120 million in 1985 prices, is
expensive and imposes a major financial and economic burden on TANESCO and
the country (paras. 4.21-4.23), especially given the depressed state of
revenues due to the  ttatic nature of the economy and the related low demand



- 15 -
growth for power discussed earlier.- Also included in the expansion plans
is a US$16 million, 132 kV transmission line connecting Bukoba in the
northwest with Hasaka in Uganda, with construction start as yet
undetermined.    In addition,  TANESCO has  included  in  its medium-term
expansion plan other minor works of transmission and distribution.
Altogether this program results in capital irvestments of about TSh 7,200
million (US$410 million) between 1985 and 1992, expressed in December 1985
prices.  A summary is shown in Table 2.5, while a detailed breakdown  in
current and constant prices is provided in Annex 2.4. Of this total, some
TSh 6,076 million, or 84%, is currently scheduled to be spent between 1985
and 1988, with only 16% remaining for the following four years. New
investments in major generation and/or transmission facilities are unlikely
to be needed until the early to mid-1990s. A power sector masterplan has
just been completed. It shows that future expansion should be based on the
use of natural gas or hydro.

2.20      TANESCO's and Tanzania's restricted resource situation and urgent
need for rehabilitation make it essential that new investments be curtailed
as much as possible.   TANESCO's proposed program has been reviewed in
detail by IDA during appraisal, with the following conclusions:
(a)   Curtailment or delay of the major generating investment, Mtera,
would not be of advantage to TANESCO or Tanzania unless the tied
foreign financing were reallocated to other, higher priorities
and the economic costs of stopping this major construction
project were  outweighed by the additional   benefits of the
alternative investments. This is unlikely to be the case because
a substantial amount of funds has already been irrevocably
committed and disbursed and cancellation charges on the civil
works and equipment contracts would be substantial.
(b)   The largest of the transmission investments, the Dodoma-Mwanza
line, is marginally justified compared to the continuing,
unreliable diesel supply in the northwest (para. 4.27).   The
other two major transmission investments, Shinyanga-Tabora and
Mwanza-Musoma, are not economically justified at this time and
therefore should be postponed (paras. 4.28). In any case, they
should be deferred until completion of the Dodoma-Mwanza line is



- 16 -
firmly assured, because their use depends on the availability of
the latter. In this document, for financial projection purposes
it was assumed that construction of these two lines would not get
underway until 1988.
(c)   The power rehabilitation and energy investments proposed under
this project -offer the highest economic rates of return
(pars. 4.17) and deserve highest priority.
2.21        During negotiations, agreement was reached between IDA, the
Government and TANESCO about:
(a) the actual realizable components of TANESCO's expansion program,
taking into account the financial and economic burdens that this
program imposes on both TANESCO's finances and the country's
foreign exchange requirements. This investment program includes
completion of the Dodoma/Mwanza transmission line. It Includes a
postponement of the construction start-up of the 132 kV lines to
Tabora and to Musoma until completion of the Dodoma/twanza line
is firmly assured and the economic viability of these two lines
is proven.
(b)   Any changes and/or additions to TANESCO's mutually agreed-upon
overall investment program in excess of the equivalent of US$5
million per year, or in excess of US$5 million for any one single
additional project, will be reviewed with IDA.
B. The Household Energy Subsector
Urban Household Fuel Supplies
2.22          The second purpose of the proposed project is to make a
contribution towards solving the increasingly costly problem of urban
household fuel supplies.  Some 70-80% of all urban households depend on
charcoal as their major cooking fuel.   Total national consumption of
charcoal is estimated at about 300,000 tpy, with Dar es Salaam alone
accounting for some 120,000 tpy. Practically all charcoal is produced by
individual charcoal makers, using primitive and inefficient earth kiln
technology. About 100,000 ha of wood are cut annually to produce charcoal,
compared to a national afforestation program that still is averaging only
about 10,000 ha/year. Owing to the increasing scarcity of wood resources
within reasonable transport distance from larger urban centers and the
resulting, increasing trausport costs, the real prices of these fuels have
risen rapidly in recent years.    Prices in Dar as Salaam have more thaa
quadrupled in TSh terms over the last four years, a rate of increase far
higher than local inflation, with the retail price for small quantities
currently at about TSh 8/kg (US$440/ton, $228/ton shadow priced), among the
highest in Eastern Africa. Market studies in Dar es Salaam have shown that
the costs of charcoal and fuelwood is between two and a half to four times
higher than the costs of household electricity, kerosene or LPG on an
equivalent heat basis.  However, availability of the latter too fuels iS



- 17 -
limited because of insufficient supplies and lack of costly appliances,
while electricity usage is constrained because of the poor condition and
limited coverage (even in the towns) of the distribution network, the cost
of adding or reinforcing .iousehold connections, the cost of electrical
cooking appliances, and the absence of reasonable consumer credit
facilities to finance wiring, connections and appliances.
2.23      Natural Forests Resource.  There appear to exist extensive, yet
apparently isder-utilized natural forests to the south and west of Dar es
Salaam (as well as in other parts of the country).   These are presently
under-utilized because of poor technology, high transport costs and lack of
infrastructure (roads, settlements, etc.). A modern, commercially-oriented
charcoal kiln pilot project forms part of this project (para. 3.04) to
begin to address these problem. With success, this pilot project could be
quickly expanded to a larger scale at modest costs.
2.24        Electric Cooker Study.  As mentioned earlier (para. 2.10), a
substantial generating surplus exists in the interconnected system, at
least in the medium term, with the marginal cost of electricity essentially
being equal to zero.   However, the cost of electric appliances is very
high, with a two-ring cooker, domestically produced, costing some TSh 4,000
(US$220) retail (TSh 2,000 ex-factory).   This is far above the cost of
potential imports of higher quality appliances.  A study we  -sluate the
potential for the systematic promotion of electric cook.ng is included
under the project.
The Borrower and Implementing- Aencies
2.25       The borrower would be the Government of Tanzania.  The proceeds
of the proposed IDA Credit would be onlent to TANESCO for the power
rehabilitation component, and as grants to MEM for the energy components
and to NUWA for the Water Supply Administration accounting study.   The
proceeds for the charcoal cooker and the charcoal production components
would be administered by the Ministry of Energy and Minerals as the
Executing Agency and by NUWA for the accounting study.
C. TANESCO
Organization and Management
2.26        Electricity supply is the responsibility of TANESCO, which is
wholly owned by the Government and which operates under the supervision of
MEM. It was established in 1931 as a private company and bought out by the
Government in 1964. TANESCO supplies some 93% of the power consumed in the
country, with the balance self-generated by parastatals and private organi-
zations. TANESCO's Board of Directors is appointed by the Government and
the Managing Director by the President of Tanzania.   The company's top
management is of high quality and the company has been quite successful in
filling its most senior managerial positions with competent Tanzanian
staff.   However,  there is a serious shortage of qualified,  mid-level
administrative and technical personnel.   The  company maintains active
training programs and, assisted originally by the Bank and Swedish
International Development Agency (SIDA), has a Technical Training Institute



- 18 -
(TTI) in Kidatu.  A number of TANESCV training programs have been funded
over the years by the Bank and other agencies. Additional training will be
supplied under the project (para. 3.04).
2.27          TANESCO has a Board of eight Directors appointed by the
Government,  which  includes  officials  of  Government  ministries  and
parastatals.   The Chairman of the Board is the Minister of Energy and
Minerals. The Board is required to meet at least four times a year, but,
in  practice,  meets  about  every  second  month.    TANESCO  is  managed
substantially as a Government entity.   For example, final decisions on
implementing major investmeats rest with the MEM and are subject to Cabinet
approval.    TANESCO  is  required  to  follow  Government  pay-scales  and
employment  regulations.    According  to  its  Governing  Act,  TANESCO  is
intended to operate as an autonomous corporation. However, its autonomy is
limited  because  its  major  decisions  are  all  subject  to  Government
approval.   Also, the company routinely obtains funds -for its capital
expenditures from the Government rather than providing them from its own
revenues (Annex-5.2).
2.28        TANESCO's present organizational structure was established in
1973. The company has grown substantially since then and improvements are
needed in its organizational structure and management practices in order to
improve its efficiency and quality of services. This was recognized during
the appraisal of the previous IDA project (CR 1405-TA), which included the
financing of consultants to prepare an organization and management study.
The study is expected to be completed by mid 1986. In accordance with the
agreements reached under CR 1405-TA TANESCO will implement the agreed-upon
recommendations of the study after taking account of IDA's comments by not
later than December 31, 1986.
Staffing and Management Issues
2.29       TANESCO has a number of capable and dedicated senior managers.
However, there is a scarcity of competent middle to lower-level managers,
engineers and technicians, and an excess of unskilled or low-skilled
workers. The lack of middle-level, skilled personnel can be explained in
part by the rapid growth of the company in earlier years, in part by
attrition of qualified personnel to higher paying jobs elsewhere. Company
operations are handicapped by low civil service pay-scales, which in real
terms have been declining significantly in recent years.  These problems
are compounded by the lack of any incentive structure that could be used by
management to reward performance.   Furthermore,  the official no-firing
rule, in force until quite recently, was a direct invitation to indifferent
performance.   The latter issue, however, has recently been resolved and
TANESCO, in September 1985, has discharged some 1,300 employees, or 17% of
its staff, mostly unskilled labourers.   This action has increased the
number of connections per employee to about 27, still low by African
standards (Kenya 33, Ethiopia 54).    Staff by job category for 1980 to
1985, is shown in Annex 2.5).
2.30        Permission has been granted in principle by the Government to
institute some form of staff incentive program.   During negotiations,
agreement was reached with the Government and TANESCO about the formal
introduction  of  such  a  program.    It  should  consist  of  a  list  of



- 19 -
performance categories,  a monitoring system,  and a pre-announced award
system.  Such a plan should be developed in detail by TANESCO by January,
1987 discussed with IDA, and put into effect not later than by June 30,
1987.
Institutional/Manpower Development
2.31      TANESCO needs little additional investment in physical facilities
for its training programs. However, in terms of substance,, monitoring of
training requirements, and course programs provided with available training
resources, improvements are needed.   TANESCO's manpower Development and
Training is a section under the Directorate of Manpower Development and
Administration. It is responsible for assessing the training needs for all
categories of staff within TANESCO, for preparing short- and long-term
staff development plans, and for implementing those plans. TANESCO uses a
variety of training modes in implementing staff development plans and
arranges for the required training to be given through:
(a)  established  national  training  institutions--the  university,
technical and commercial colleges, and trade schools;
(b)  in-house training facilities--the TANESCO Commercial School in
Dar es Salaam and the TTI in Kidatu;
(c) ad-hoc courses;
(d) part-time study; and
(e) assignment in overseas power companies, with a substantial
training program undertaken by the Irish Electricity Board.
2.32        Technical Training.   Three recent, independent studies of the
manpower situation in TANESCO have indicated critical shortages of higher-
level technical staff and middle-level technicians, with the conclusion
that the need to train technicians has the highest priority. The existing
technician training facility in Kidatu (TTI) needs to be expanded in terms
of course offering and quality of instructions, and more specialized to
cater for the specific needs of TANESCO, rather than being a general
training  institute.    The most  urgent  need  is for  training  of  plant
operators, line workers, and electrical/mechanical maintenance and control
technicians.  Support for improving and expanding the technician training
program at TTI is being considered by CIDA under this project (para. 3.04
(h)>.
2.33       Needed Improvements in Data Processin.  TANESCO at present is
implementing a comprehensive program for modernizing its data processing
system, which will be fully computerized with the assistance provided under
this project, as indicated in Chapter V (para. 5.07).   At present, only
billing and payroll are handled that way. This will provide the company
with an urgently needed modern management information system which, by
providing up-to-date, accurate information will help it to improve its
operating efficiency throughout  its organization.   To accomplish these
tasks, technical assistance in the form of a senior financial advisor and a
systems analyst specializing in utility operations, as well as needed
computer hardware and software will be provided under this project
(paras. 3.04 & 5.07).



-20-
2.34           Technical Assistance.    On  the  technical  side,  both the
consultants who did the main study for the project, Engineering and Power
Development Consultants, Ltd. (EPD, UK), and TANESCO have identified an
urgent need for technical assistance in the form of advisors/trainers who
would work with TANESCO supervisors and the work crews executing the
various  components  of  this project and who,  at the same  time,  would
organize on-the-job training for the staff.  Without this assistance, the
project could not be undertaken at the scale envisaged and within the
proposed time frame.   The services of these advisors/trainers has been
included in the project (para. 3.04).
2.35        Insurance and Taxes.   Insurance of TANESCO's major assets is
considered  adequate.    It  is  effected  through  the  National  Insurance
Corporation, the sole government-owned insurance company, which in turn
re-insures through the European insurance market for plant and equipment,
including thermal power sets.  TANESCO is exempt from corporate taxes and
duties on imported equipment and parts.
D. Implementation of Household Energy Components
2.36       The Government has vested the responsibility for household fuel
supplies with MEM (para. 1.10).  The Ministry's Commissioner of Energy is
formally in charge of this program, which is being administered by the
newly formed Renewable Energy Division (RED) within the Ministry (Annex
1.1).  This unit is in charge of designing the charcoal kiln and charcoal
stove components of the project. It will also be in charge of implementing
these latter two project components in close cooperation with the Forestry
Department of the MNRT.   Disbursement of IDA funds for these components
,will be conditional upon completion of these arrangements, satisfactory to
!DA (para. 6.07).
2.37        The feasibility study regarding electric cookers will be the
responsibility of TANESCO (para. 2.24).
2.38        Accounting and Auditing.  Accounting for the energy components
will be carried out by the RED and should be fully satisfactory.   Annual
auditing, including auditing of the special account and statement of
expenditure will be performed by the Government-owned Tanzania Audit
Corporation (TAC).   During negotiations, agreement was reached with the
Government that IDA should receive audited accounts within six months after
the end of each fiscal year.
III. THE PROJECT
3.01         Background.   During preparation of the Mtera Hydro Project
(CR 1405-TA) in 1983, it became apparent that TANESCO's diesel generating
plants  and transmission and distribution facilities were deteriorating
rapidly and were in urgent need of rehabilitation.   Funds were included
under the Mtera Project to undertake a detailed study of the technical
conditions of the overall system. This study undertaken by EPD (UK), found
that the various components of TANESCO's power system, particularly the
distribution facilities and diesel plants, had deteriorated to such an
extent that only a thorough overhaul could reverse this decline. The same



- 21 -
conclusion was reached by the UNDP/World Bank Energy Assessment Report
(No. 4969-TA) which recommended to: 'improve the reliability of the power
system - - - by strengthening and rehabilitating generation, transmission
and distribution facilities". 3/
3.02      The Energy Assessment Report also pointed out the seriousness of
rapid declines in available forest resources, which provide the basis for
over  90% of  total  energy  supplies  in  the  country.    It  found  that
substantial savings could be achieved through the introduction of more
energy efficient charcoal production methods and improved household
stoves. The recommendations of the report, and the subsequent work by the
Renewable Energy Division of MEM provide the basis for the household energy
components of this project.
3.03      Project Objectives.  The main objectives of the proposed project
are:
(a)  To reestablish the operating  performance  of TANESCO's  power
system to reasonable levels of reliability and service which are
essential to both industry and basic infrastructure such as urban
water supply systems, etc.  The benefits derived therefrom will
be reduced customer losses from outage reductions and poor
voltage levels and reductions in direct operating costs to
TANESCO. The estimated economic benefits from these improvements
are quite large, exceeding costs by very substantial margins in
practically all categories (Chapter IV). No major investments are
foreseen as part of this project to reduce "normal" technical
losses to a technically optimal level because of the substantial
hydro power generating surplus existing in the ICS and the
resulting zero marginal cost of generation until the 1990's
(para. 2.10).
(b)  To assist the Government and TANESCO in developing a sound,
least-cost development program for the power sector;
(c)  To assist TANESCO in improving its financial performance;
(d)  To assist TANESCO  in improving the skills of  its operating
personnel, particularly in the areas of repair and maintenance
activities, bill collection, accounting and financial management;
(e)  To stimulate improved availability and production efficiency of
household energy supplies, by
(i) establishing, at commercial scales, pilot activities by
private operators to assure improved household fuel supplies
to urban areas, consisting of modern and efficient charcoal
production based on existing, underutilized forest stands
and sawmill waste;
(ii) the introduction and commercial production of improved
charcoal stoves, and

No. 4969-TA, p. iii.



- 22 -
(iii) by a study of 'the potential for increased access to electric
cookers at affordable costs in areas supplied by low-cost
hydropower.
(f)  To provide limited technical assistance to NUWA, the country's
urban water authority, to improve its billing and collection procedures (to
be supervised by the Bank's Water Supply and Urban Development Division)
which in turn will help ensure that NUWA will be in a better financial
position vis-a-vis its financial obligations to TANESC0 (para. 5.11).
3.04      Project Description.  The project would consist of the following
main components (a detailed description is contained in Annex 3.1):
Power Comeonents
(a)  Power stations rehabilitation:  This will include the rehabilita-

(2) Supply of spare parts. This includes the reestablishment of
sufficient stock levels for the project implementation
period, with a minimum inventory level of one year at the
time of project completion.
(3)  Supply  of  tools  and  equipment  for  the  electrical,
mechanical, meter testing, telecommunicatlon, and transport
workshops.
(f)  Project supervision and training:
The services of twelve engineers/technicians are included for a
total of 42 months (i.e. duration of the project) to assist in
the supervision of the proposed rehabilitation work and undertake
on-the-job training of junior supervisory staff, operators, and
technicians for electrical and mechanical maintenance, protection
and control, and line maintenance. If these components are to be
financed by CIDA as planned, five of these supervisors/trainers
would continue their work as special advisors to TANESCO for two
additional years after project completion. A list of the twelve
individuals is contained in Annex 3.1.
(g)  Engineering:
The engineering will consist of supervision, technical approvals
of  vendor  offers,  drawings  and  designs,  inspection  and
expediting,  and general assistance to the client.   It will
comprise some 180 man-months and extend over a period of 42
months.
(h)  Local training:
The  services  of  five  technicians/operator-instructors  are
included to train technicians and tradesmen at the Technician
Training Institute (TTI) in Kidatu for 42 months, with a possible
extension of two years, all financed by CIDA.   Subjects to be
covered are:   power systems protection and control, electrical
maintenance, mechanical maintenance, line maintenance, and diesel
station operations. This project component includes instruction
materials and equipment.
(i)  Specialize- overseas training:
Some 27 man-months of specialized training will be provided at a
recognized overseas power utilities (Annex 3.1).



24 -
(j) Technical assistance for financial operations:
The services of two financial experts for a total of 60 man-
months are included  to  assist  TANESCO  in  strengthening  its
Finance Directorate.   One will be a financial advisor, and the
second a computer systems specialist with in-depth knowledge of
utility accounting and financial control systems.
Miscellaneous
(k) Technical assistance to the National Urban Water-Authority
(NUWA):
Some 24 man-months of technical assistance is to be provided to
NUWA in order to enable this organization to develop a proper
billing, accounting, and bill collection system.
Energy Components
(1) Charcoal Production:
Two  or  three  efficient,  commercially-sized  pilot  charcoal
production operations. They will be based on the use of natural
forests that have to be cleared to make room for proposed
fuelwood plantations, and on the utilization of waste wood from
sawmills.  The operations will introduce energy-efficient steel
or brick kilns and will include the construction of access roads
or trails where needed, vehicles, tools and operator training.
The asim is to establish commercially viable, privately-run,
financially sound operations that will help alleviate the growing
scarcity of cooking fuels in urban areas, and in creating new
sources of employment and income. This project component will be
administered by the Energy Department of MEM in close cooperation
with the Forestry Department of MNRT. (See also para. 4.21)
(m) Charcoal Cookers:
Training of cooker (Jiko) manufacturers and/or artisans initial
supply of tools, materials and equipment, and the propagation and
demonstration of these cookers in the market place, mainly Dar es
Salaam.   This project component will be administered by the
Energy Department of MEN (See also paras. 4.22-4.25).
(n) Electric cookers:
A study of the economic and technical implications of the
manufacturing or import of between 35,000 to 50,000 low-cost,
2-burner electric cookers for supply to existing power consumers
within  TANESCO's  ICS.       This  project  component  will  be
administered by TANESCO.
3.05       Complementary Activities.  It should be noted that the project
scope  has  been  defined  under  the  assumption  that  financing  for  the
equivalent  of US$12 million could be obtained  for an  Electric Power



- 25 -
Distribution Network Project for Dar es Salaam from the Government of
Japan. 4/ If it were not, some US$5 million of urgently needed
rehabilltation work In Dar es Salaam would have to be included under this
project.   This would have to be done by either shifting the priority
rankings of the project, or by increasing the amount of co-financing, if
this could be accomplished (para. 3.09). The final decision by the Japanese
Government about this project will be made in mid-1986.
3.06       Project Preparation.  The power rehabilitation components of the
project are based on a detailed consultant study by EPD financed under
CR 1405-TA which was completed in March 1985. EPD is also undertaking the
detailed project preparatory work up to and including the tender evaluation
stage, with financing arranged through the Tanzania Investment Bank (TIB)
from IDA Technical Assistance Credit 1060-TA. Tender documents have been
completed and prequalification of bidders is to be completed by April 15,
1986.   Tenders will be called in May 1986 after details of cofinancing
portioning of the project have been finalized (Annex 2.5).  The charcoal
cooker and charcoal production components were prepared by the Tanzania
Industrial Studies and Consulting Organization (TISCO) with the help of
foreign consultants, with financing arranged from CR 1060-TA through TIB.
A detailed workplan and tender documents have yet to be drawn up by MEM.
However, MEM has already established its basic management unit for the
project components.
3.07       Project Costs.  The detailed cost estimates for the project are
contained in Annex 3.2 and are summarized in Table 3.1.   For the power
rehabilitation components, these estimates are mainly based on the EPD
Rehabilitation Report as well as IDA and TANESCO revisions to these
estimates. For the energy components, they are based on the TISCO studies
as modified by MEM and IDA; physical contingencies are estimated at 10% for
power components and 151 for energy components. No duties and taxes were
included for the rehabilitation components because TANESCO's foreign
investment expenditures are exempt from both.   However, they have been
included in the costs of the energy components (charcoal cookers, charcoal
production and electric cookers).   International inflation was used to
project  price  contingencies.    The  total  project  costs  are  about
US$88.6 million, including price and physical contingencies but excluding
interest during construction. The latter will amount to US$14.0 million.
Approximately US$76.2 million (83%) represent the foreign component and
US$12.4 million (14%) the local component of total project cost.
3.08      Basis of Cost Estimate.  The cost estimates are based on recent
quotations from manufacturers in Europe.   The base costs are adjusted to
expected end-December 1985 price levels. Physical contingencies of 10% for
the power components and 15% for the energy components have been added to
the base costs.  Price contingencies were applied in accordance with the
following international inflation rates (para. 5.20):
FY:       1986   1987   1988   1989
Percent:   7.2    6.8    6.8    7.0

3.09      Financing.  Of the total foreign exchange costs of the project of
US$76.2 million, US$74.7 million is for power rehabilitation, US$1.2
million for the energy components and US$0.3 million for NUWA technical
assistance. The foreign exchange costs will be financed in the amount of
US$38.8 million by IDA (plus another US$1.2 million for local costs), with
the balance  to be provided  by other cofinancing agencies.   Ftnancing
commitments-by others have been received so far for about US$10.2 million
from CIDA for transmission line rehabilitation and technical assistance and
training, and for US$2.3 million from FINNIDA for the rehabilitation of the
Wartsilla diesel generators, for US$8.3 million by Norway for tratnsformers,
a substation, and workshops, and for US$6.0 million by EI for diesel
generation repairs.
3.10       The commitments and the proposed IDA credit cover the estimated
foreign exchange costs of the- core components of TANESCO's program.
Financing for the remaining components under the project (approximately
US$10.6 million) is likely to be secured in 1986 or early 1987 from one or
more of several additional donors who have expressed interest in
cofinancing,  but whose commitments have not yet been firmed up.   This
should not pose any undue problems or risk since TANESCO could defer those
components for which no financing materializes without jeopardizing the
implementation of the package of core components for which financing has
been obtained (most of the components are not in extricably linked one to
another  nor  phased  sequentially  in  implementation).    Completion  of
cofinancing arrangements with EIB, Finland, and Norway would be a condition
of effectiveness of the proposed credit.   All local costs for the power
rehabilitation components will be covered by TANESCO while IDA will cover
the local costs of the energy components.  A financing plan has been drawn
up as follows:

3.11            Local  currency  requirements  (excluding  Interest  during
construction) will be provided by TANESCO from its own revenues.   The
foreign exchange costs will be partially financed by the proposed IDA
credit, with the balance to be provided by cofinancing agencies.   To
TANESCO, IDA funds would be onlent by the Government at a 9X annual rate of
interest and 20 years, including 4 years of grace, with TANESCO taking the
foreign exchange risk. Interest during construction would be financed by
the Government.  To MEM, the foreign exchange component of the two charcoal
energy components under its administration would be passed on as grants.
3.12      Consulting Services and Project Implementation.  TANESCO will be
responsible for implementing all of the power components, as well as the
electric  cooker study.    Consulting services have been contracted  for
preparing bid documents and bid evaluation, materials and equipment
specifications,  construction  standards  and  specifications.    EPD  are
undertaking this work with financing arranged through the Tanzania
Investment Bank from IDA technical assistance funds (CR 1060-TA).
Consulting services for project supervision will be contracted according to
usual  Bank/IDA  guidelines.    TANESCO  will  organize  a  Rehabilitation
Department for the duration of the project under the Operations
Directorate as a Condition of Effectiveness.   This Department and its
staff, however, will remain an integral part of the Operating Directorate
of TANESCO. This department will have three main branches: generation,
transmission and distribution.   TANESCO has agreed during appraisal to
employ twelve, primarily expatriate, full-time advisors (five electrical
engineers and seven technicians) for construction planning and project
implementation  for  a  period  of  42  months  (para.  3.04).          Their
qualifications, experience, and terms and conditions of employment will
have to be satisfactory to IDA. Counterpart staff will work closely and on
a full-time basis with the above-mentioned experts to gain experience.
Should completion of the project be delayed beyond the 42 months
implementation period the counterpart staff is expected to supervise
completion  of   the  remaining  components  without   further  advisory
assistance. TANESCO will hire outside contractors to undertake the major
works   on   the   transmission   lines   (Hale-Moshi,   Kidatu-Ubungo   and
Chalinze-Morogoro), the main transmission substations (Tanga) and for about
one-half of the work to be done on distribution networks. The remaining
services, mainly distribution rehabilitation, will be done by TANESCO staff
under supervision of the equipment manufacturers or the eleven experts
formerly mentioned.
3.13        The project implementation, estimated to be three and a half
years, would start in the third quarter of 1986 (para 3.15).  A detailed
implementation schedule is provided in Annex 3.3.
3.14         Procurement.   All transmission and distribution equipment,
vehicles, and tools included under components financed by IDA will be
procured under international competitive bidding in accordance with IDA
guidelines  for  procurement;   the  contractors  for  transmission  and
distribution works will also be selected through international competitive
bidding in accordance with IDA guidelines; all proprietary spare parts for
generation and transmission equipment estimated to amount to about US$2.7
million will be purchased through negotiated contracts with the respective
equipment manufacturers.   All contracts amounts equal to or larger than
US$100,000 equivalent to be financed from the proposed credit will be



- 29 -
subject to IDA's prior review. Local materials will be procured by local
competitive bidding.  Consultants for technical supervision funded by IDA
will be selected according to standard Bank/IDA guidelin.:s.   Goods and
services financed by cofinanciers will be procured in accordance with their
respective guidelines.  A detailed procurement schedule is shown in Table
3.2.

3.15       Disbursement.  The proceeds of the proposed IDA credit will be
disbursed over a 48 months period covering all project components, from
September 1986 through August 1990. Disbursement from the credit account
will be fully documented and would be made for 1002 of foreign and 50% of



- 30 -
local expenditures for, equipment and materials, and 100% of total
expenditures for consultant servi--es and training, for the components to be
financed by IDA. The expected disbursement schedule does not conform with
the standard disbursement profile for Power Projects in Eastern Africa,
because this is a rehabilitation project consisting mainly of replacement
equipment and materials,  and spare parts.   Much of this material  is
available from stock or can be produced on short notice, and most
deliveries will be staged over a period of no more than 30 months,  This
will be done to secure the advantages of materials standardization and bulk
purchase discounts.   The expected disbursement schedule of IDA funds for
the project is shown in Annex 3.4 and summarized in Table 3.3.  Overall
disbursement of total project funds including those provided by cofinancing
agencies are expected to be more rapid (Annex 3.2) because of the expected
larger sharr. of up-front equipment 'and materials purchases financed by
others. Retroactive financing will not be needed.

3.16       In order to expedite disbursement of funds under the respective
disbursement categories of credit, two special accounts (TANESCO and MEM
respectively) with initial deposits of US$1 million for TANESCO and
US$500,000 for MEM, would be established and maintained in the Bank of
Tanzania. The special accounts would be replenished by the Association in
accordance with agreed procedures.  The statement of expenses (SOE) would
be used for contracts up to US$100,000 which would not require IDA's
previous approval.
3.17       Environmental Considerations.  The services and works components
of the proposed project include mainly repairs and reconstruction of
existing facilities.   No adverse environmental effects are expected as a
result of these activities.
3.18        The charcoal manufacturing component is designed, in part, to
utilize stocks from natural forests, to be followed subsequently by
systematic replanting of the cleared land. This, on balance, will improve
environmental  conditions,  and  minimize  erosion  problems.    These  are
currently more serious because of uncontrolled --ilization of Lhese forest
resources by charcoa'l producers who are using priaitive and highly wasteful
production methods.  The energy components (improved charcoal cookers and
improved charcoal kilns) will reduce the net consumption of wood resources
per unit of useful energy produced, thereby reducing over-cutting,
watershed damage and erosion.
3.19         Project Monitoring.   The types and contents of reports and
records necessary to evaluate TANESCO's performance and to monitor the
progreas of the project, its evaluation, and completion were agreed upon



- 31 -
with TANESCO and Government during negotiations. The monitoring guidelines
and performance indicators are detailed In Annex 3.5. Major project events
to be checked against target dates are tendering, contract awards, key
construction stages and completion of the various components of the
project. Financial and management monitoring will concentrate on the rate
of return, review of tariffs, billing and collection, outstanding
receivables, number of staff, and project costs and financing.
3.20           Project  Risks.   The  implementation of  the power system
rehabilitation components does not involve any significant risks besides
those that are normally associated with routine maintenance and replacement
work.  Given the large scope of the project, care will have to be taken
that interruptions of power supplies to users are kept to a minimum while
repairs or replacement work is in progress.  In view of the complexity of
the project a possible source of delays could be the lack of proper
seheduling of materials and equipment flows from suppliers to warehouses to
the works for the various components.   To reduce the risks of delays
provisions have been made for the services of a full-time engineering
advisor to supervise these functions (Annex 3.1).
3.21      Because of the shortage of mid-level management capability in the
TAINESCO organization, there is a risk of implementation delays and poor
work  performance.    To overcome  these problem the services of  twelve
engineering/technical advisors have been included in the project.
3.22       The two other energy components, charcoal cookers and charcoal
production based on modern technology, face some risks because the
organizational structure for managing both components has still to be
created. Also, while some similar activities have taken place in Tanzania
before, none of them were of a scale as large as contemplated unader this
project.   In addition,  there will be some risks and special problems
involved in properly designing the interface between governmental support,
training and financing activities for what are to become basically private
sector production and marketing activities.   Involvement of either the
Tanzanian Investment Bank (TIB) or the Tanzania Development Financing
Limited (TDFL) should reduce the risk given their experience with private
enterprise development.   In addition, a number of similar projects have
been undertaken or are underway in other African countries and the
experiences there will be utilized in the design and execution of these
project components.
IV. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS AND PROJECT JUSTIFICATION
Economic Costs of Electricity
4.01       The economic costs of electricity have been estimated based on
the average incremental costs (AIC) of the committed expansion program
(para. 2.19).   These costs have been used as a measure of the economic
costs of electricity, because the ongoing program will be sufficient to
satisfy incremental demands until about the mid-1990s, depending on actual
load growth (para. 2.10).
4.02      The AIC for the entire TANESCO system represent an average value
of the AIC's of the ICS as well as the isolated branches and has been



- 32 -
calculated on the basis of the inveLtment program as summarized in
Annex 4.1 and load forecast B as detailed in Annex 2.3.  Because of the
heavy ongoing investments in ICS generating and transmission components, it
was found that there is little difference at present between the AIC's of
the ICS and the isolated branches, S/ although the differences in their
respective shares of capital and operating costs are qutte large, of
course. This has implications for tariff -olicies (para. 5.15). The AIG
as calculated includes the full costs (capital, 0 & M, fuel and customer
costs) of all ongoing and committed projects scheduled for completion
between now and 1992.   To these were added the required distribution
investments between 1992 and 1997 that are projected to be needed under
load forecast B to absorb the output of the surplus generating capacity.
4.03        In order to analyze the effects of the now much lower than
previously projected growth in power demand on the AIC, the potential AIC
based on the demand projections contained in the Mtera Power Project
Appraisal Report  (No.  4050-TA) were also  calculated.   The difference
between these two rates is a proxy measure of the potential value of faster
load growth resulting from special promotional sales efforts (para. 2.17).
4.04       The data and assumptions underlying the analysis of the AIC have
been  presented  in  Annex  4.1.    The  results  have  been  summarized  in
Table 4.1.
TABLE 4.1
1986-1992 Average Projected and Potential
Incremental Costs of the National Power System
TSh/kWh (US$/kWh)
(shadow exchange rate TSh/US$-35/1)
-     …---- - Discount Rate
Projection Basis:              9%         10%          12%          15%
Projected Actual AIC       3.8 (0.11)  4.3 (0.13)  5.4 (0.16)  7.3 (0.22)
Potential AIC              2.1 (0.06)  2.3 (0.07)  2.6 (0.08)  3.0 (0.09)
The AIC's are high by African standards. Evaluated at a discount rate of
12%, for example, they amount to USt 16/kWh. This, as pointed out before,
is the result of lagging sales, a heavy investment program, the small size
of the system, and the high costs of operating the diesel-based isolated
load centers.  If power demand bad grown (and would continue to grow) as
predicted only two years earlier, the AIC per kWh would be reduced by some
50%.
4.05       Based on preliminary data contained in the draft reports of the
Acres Power Sector Master Plan and the Meta Tariff Study, the LRMC of
delivered energy from future investments beyond 1992 would be about 35 to
40% lower than the AIC applicable now.

Economic Analysis of Power System Rehabilitation
4.06      The purpose of the power system rehabilitation components of the
project is to restore the existing system to acceptable levels of operating
performance and to maintain it in that condition thereafter. To achieve
the first objective, extensive rehabilitation works are required, backed by
needed supplies of electric systems equipment and materials, maintenance
tools, equipment and vehicles, together with technical supervisory support
to assure the proper implementation of the works. To achieve the second
objective, extensive training and technical assistance components have been
Included in the project. In addition, a proposed new incentive systems for
TANESC& personnel (para. 2.30) would help the company retain qualified
individuals and improve work performance in general.
4.07       Not all of the specific project components can be evaluated in
terms of economic rates of return.   However, efforts have been made to
cover the most  significant physical components of  the project.   The
economic analysis of these components, by extension, can be assumed to
provide an indication of the value of other, similar components not
specifically evaluated.
4.08      The economic analysis of the various project components is based
on a comparison of the present value of costs of each evaluated component
with its specific, projected present value of benefits. The latter consist
of estimates of the net costs of not having power supplies atailable when
needed or expected, or of receiving supplies at voltage levels that are
either unusable for certain power consuming purposes, or are damaging to
equipment. For productive activities, these estimates of the net costs of
outages are based on detailed evaluations of the reductions in value added,
net of potential recuperations of initial losses through possible
rescheduling of activities. These net outage costs are estimated to range
between TSh 13 to TSh 25/kWh (US$0.70 - US$1.40) for industry and TSh
18/kWh  (US$1.00)  for  commercial  enterprises.    The  costs  to domestic
consumers are mainly based on estimates of the required use of alternative
fuels and/or appliances, e.g. kerosene for lighting and charcoal, kerosene
or LPG for cooking.   They were estimated to average about TSh 9/kWh
(US$0.50).   The values thus estimated were subjected to a variety of
sensitivity tests.   A more detailed description of these estimates, the
methodologies applied and data used can be found in Annex 4.2 and the
underlying consultant's report (see project file).   A summary of the
estimated internal economic rates of return for all evaluated components is
presented in para. 4.18.
4.09      Distribution Network Rehabilitation.  For the economic analysis
of the benefits from rehabilitating the distribution network, specific
evaluations were undertaken of the four major load centers of the TANESC0
system.    Together,  these  accounted  for about  62%  of  total national
electricity consumption in  1984.   The respective costs and benefits,
evaluated at discount rates of 102 and 12% respectively, have been shown in
Table 4.2.

With the exception of the low-voltage system In Moshi, the net present
worth are positive.   They are particularly high in Tanga and Dar es
Salaam.   In Moshi and Arusha the distribution systems are currently in
better condition, which is reflected by the lower or slightly negative net
present worth benefits. The sensitivity of the results were tested against
reductions in the values assumed for unserved energy.   Apart from the
low-voltage system in Moshi, the sub-project most sensitive is the one in
Arusha.  But even there the value of unserved energy would have to be as
low as US$0.3/kWh in order to reduce net benefits to zero at a discount
rate of 12%.
4.10         Transmission Network Rehabilitation.   Expenditures for this
subcomponent fall into two categories:   the first is for rehabilitation
work to be undertaken on specific lines. To the extent that outage records
are available for them, direct evaluations of the economic costs and
benefits could be undertaken.   The second is basically for maintenance
equipment, spares and vehicles that are to be for preventive maintenance
activities in the future, including maintenance on lines rehabilitated
under this project. For this category, evaluations had to be based on a
sensitivity analysis of possible future increases in outage rates in the
absence of these preventive maintenance activities. The same methodology
had to be applied to those lines for which reliable outage record could not
be ascertained.   A summary of the economic analysis of those lines and
substations for which adequate records were available is shown in Table
4.3. The more detailed data, assumptions and results of the evaluations
can be found in Annex 4.2 while the ERR is shown in para. 4.18. As can be
seen, the net benefits at both 10% and 12X rates _f discount far outweigh
the costs of undertaking the rehabilitation work.   However,  there are
nevertheless significant differences in the rates of return of individual
lines, a factor that has to be taken into account in any rankings of
project priorities if total financial resources are insufficient to finance
the project as cutrrently conceived.

4.11      Rehabilitation of the Tbungo Thermal Station.  The Ubungo thermal
power station in Dar es Salaam provides the only local back-up power
facility protecting the Dar es Salaam area from transmission line outages.
It consists of 8 diesel generator sets with a combined nominal capacity of
46.2 MW and a gas turbine with a capacity of 14.8 MW. Of these units, at
present only two diesel sets with a combined, rated output of 6 MW are
operational, and those only for limited services not exceeding two hours
because of excessive temperature build-up.
4.12        While it would be possible to rehabilitate all of these units
except one (an initial objective of the Mtera Power Project which could not
be achieved because of lack of expected cofinancing), detailed economic
evaluations undertaken by EPD have shown that this would not be warranted
on economic grounds. The reasons are that the station could only be used
for stand-by services until the generating surplus capacity of the ICS has
been fully utilized, and that the probability of outages of the main
transmission network supplying the Dar es Salaam region will be low after
rehabilitation under  this project  has  been  completed.    However,  the
existence of at least a minimum standby capacity to serve the most
important needs such as water supply and hospitals in case of a major
transmission line failure would be highly desirable (para. 2.03). It has
been estimated, for example, that a three-day interruption of all power
supplies to Dar es Salaam would result in economic losses of more than US$3
million, apart from the human suffering and threat to life that could be
the consequence of such a failure.
4.13        A second, and important economic reason for rehabilitating at
least some of the Ubungo facilities to reliable stand-by service capability
now is that the station could be upgraded at modest costs to full base-load
capability in the future to providing the first needed increment in firm
ICS capacity when the limits of the firm hydro-based energy capabilities of
the system are being reached in the early to mid-1990s. At that time, the
upgraded station could provide insurance in the form of firm energy
capability against the risk of low flow during drought years. This would
postpone the need for earlier additions of new generating capacity by up to
three years (Acres, Draft Power Sector Masterplan, Chapter 13).   The
economic net benefits of this postponement would be quite significant.
However, given the present, very poor condition of the Ubungo facilities at
present, a first-stage rehabilitation of the more valuable units of the
station now is mandatory if it is to be saved at all.



- 36 -
4.14        It has been proposed, therefore, to rehabilitate three of the
diesel generating sets with a total capacity of 13.2 MW and the gas turbine
of 14.8 MW to stand-by capability, with upgrading to full base-load
capability and possible conversion to the use of natural gas (if and when
it becomes available in Dar es Salaam) to follow later (but not under this
project). Such a limited program Is justifiable because dedicated supply
lines and switching facilities exist that could channel these emergency
supplies to the critically important power users such as water supply.
4.15       A summary of the economic benefits has been shown in TaUle 4.4.
A more detailed analysis has been presented in Annex 4.2. As the data in
Table  4.4  show,  the  initial  net  benefits  of  conversion  to  stand-by
capability under this project are negative, with the equalizing discount
rate equal to three percent.   However, it must be remembered that the
purpose of this rehabilitation (at the relatively modest costs of US$1.7
million) is to protect Dar es Salaam against a catastrophic transmission
line failure, and to preserve the Ubungo station for future baseload
services. If the costs and benefits of the latter use are included in the
analysis, the combined total present values of net benefits of US$6.8
million ara quite high compared to the total combined present value of
costs of only US$3.3 million.

4.16       Rehabilitation of the Mwanza Nyakato Diesel Station.  The Mwanza
Nyakato diesel generating station is the major source of electric power in
Mwanza, an important industrial ar.d trading center on Lake Victoria. The
electricity supply system servicing Mwanza is facing serious problems. By
the end of 1985 there were only 12 MW of working capacity available and the
rate of power outages was extremely high. Mwanza is to be connected to the
ICS by 1988 (para. 2.25) and it has been assumed in the economic analysis
that this interconnection would take place on schedule. The benefits to be
derived from rehabilitation of the station, therefore, would initially be
limited to a period of only 18 months, from early M1R7 to mid-1988.  No
benefits were assigned to the subsequent role of the plant as a stand-by
facility.  However, as in the case of the Ubungo station, the potential
exists for its utilization at a later date for baseload service (para.
4.13).  This would provide additional future benefits.  A summary of the
economic analysis has been presented in Table 4.5.   The more detailed
evaluation can be found in Annex 4.2.

As can be seen, the immediate net benefits from rehabilitating the station
are extremely high, and the work should be undertaken as soon as possible.
A sensitivity analysis undertaken to test the results against lower values
from power losses indicates that these would have to be as low as US$0.19
per kWh not supplied, to reduce net benefits to zero at a rate of discount
of 12%. However, if this project is substantially delayed (by one year or
more) and completion of the Dodoma/Mwanza line were to be on schedule with
completion by 1988 (para. 2.19) the rehabilitation of the station as part
of this project may no longer be justified and would have to be eliminated.
Economic Rates of Return; Power Rehabilitation
4.17      Two types of economic rates of return have been calculated.  The
first is based on an evaluation of TANESCO's overall investment program of
which this project forms an integral and non-separable part.   Average
tariff revenue was used as the measure of benefits.   This ERR is 12%,
reflecting the significant increases in current tariff levels needed to
meet the large cash requirements of TANESOD during the next few years of
heavy investments and lagging sales.  This rate of return indicates that
tariffs could be adjusted downwards in real terms once the current
investments are completed and sales have recovered.
4.18      The second calculation of the economic rate of return (ERR) has
been based on the analysis of the benefits from prevention of outage losses
of the project components analyzed in paras. 4.06 to 4.10 and 4.16. Their
economic costs account for about 46X of the total costs of the physical
rehabilitation  components of  this  project.    The  specific  assumptions
underlying the analysis have been discussed in Annex 4.3, as well as in the
preceding sections of this chapter and their respective annexes. The ERR
for the major components and their combined total are as shown in Table
4.6.  As can be seen, these rates of return are very high.   This is a
reflection of the fact that the costs of electricity, including the costs
of the rehabilitation investment, are only a small fraction of the value of
output or consumption lost if it is not available when needed.

Technical Assistance Components
4.19      The main technical assistance components consist of the services
of  twelve advisors/trainers  (pars. 3.04 f) and two financial experts
(para. 3.04 i). As discussed elsewhere (para. 2.29) there is a pervasive
lack of mid-level management and supervisory capability in TAHESC0, and
proper supervision of project implementation is a critical issue for the
success of the project (para. 3.12).  Pence, the services of these twelve
advisors are essential for undertaking  he rehabilitation components of the
project.   The two financial expert  are needed to improve TANESCO's
financial management (para. 5.07).
Training Components
4.20      The training components, consisting both of .he strengthening of
local training of TANESCO technical personnel at TTI (para. 3.04 g) and
specialized overseas training (para. 3.04 h) are part of the longer-term
strategy of the rehabilitation components of the project to bring about
permanent improvements in the technical competence and actual performance
of TANESCO staff (para. 2.32).
Charcoal Production and Charcoal Cooker Components
4.21        The household energy program under the project has two pilot
components: the development of a fuel-efficient charcoal production process
and the introduction of fuel-efficient stoves. The savings resulting from
the  use  of  more  efficient  technology  and  production  methods  are
substantial. By increasing kiln efficiency from 10% to 20%, the production
of every 1,000 tons of charcoal would save 10,000 m3 (stacked) wood per
year.  This is the equivalent of the clear felling of 175 ha of natural
forest.  It is expected that the activities initiated under the project
will lead to the commercial production of about 20,000 tons of charcoal
annually within 4-5 years of its inception.  For further details see the
TISCO study on "Production and Marketing of Charcoal in Dar es Salaam' in
the project file.  Similarly, by introducing more fuel-efficient stoves,
charcoal and wood consumption could be reduced by 25% to 40%. The project
would provide technical assistance and seed money for local artisans to
produce more efficient stoves, and funding for initial marketing and
cooking demonstration activities. Asstming that 100,000 stoves are sold to
households over the project life, savings of around 100,000 m3 (stacked)
annually of wood could be achieved.   This is the equivalent of clear
felling 2,000 ha of natural forest.
4.22        Charcoal Production.   The overall objective of this project
component is to conserve wood and thereby arrest the rapid rise in charcoal



- 39 -
prices to consumers by introducing more efficient technology and production
methods and to determine whether it is financially attractive to organize
an efficient charcoal production system on a private basis. The charcoal
component would be implemented in two phases: The first phase would be the
establishment of two or three pilot charcoal production centers over a
period of 15 months. The pilot production phase is intended to introduce
and demonstrate the use of efficient kilnas and wood handling methods in
indigenous forests and existing sawmills. The project would provide
initially for 21 kilns, most of them portable, management of the pilot
scheme, training of personnel, tools, equipment, and vehicles.   Charcoal
produced during the pilot period would be marketed through the existing
dealer network.  In the second phase of about six months, the project would
provide for the evaluation of the pilot phase and preparation of full-scale
commercial production by private producers.   Because this is a pilot
operation no economic analysis has been prepared at this stage. It will be
provided after completion of the first phase of the project.
4.23      Introduction of Fuel-Efficient Stoves.  The project would help to
transfer fuel conservation technology to Tanzania and introduce the
ccmmercial production of stoves. It would provide ; !chnical assistance in
establishing pilot production units for charcoal stoves mainly in Dar es
Salaam, setting up a small extension capability at the MEM as well as
providing training for artisans, potters and other stove entrepreneurs to
enable them to manufacture and market the improved stoves. Production and
distribution of the improved stoves would be carried out by the private
sector. The MEM would provide the technical packages necessary to initiate
the production of about 100,000 stoves over the project period.
4.24          The stove technology to be introduced under this project
component is well established elsewhere in Eastern Africa, where more than
200,000 stoves of this type have been produced and marketed in the last few
years.   These are being produced by individual artisans and/or small
manufacturing plants.   The production techniques that are required to
produce them are quite similar to those already employed ln Tanzania in the
production of traditional stoves. Hence the task of retraining is greatly
simplified and there is a ready pool of skilled artisans available in the
country.
4.25      There will be no problems in converting households to the use of
the new stoves, because they have essentially the same shape, function and
operating characteristics as the traditional ones.   The estimated net
benefits from the program to both households and the economy as a whole
will be substantial. To individual households the estimated savings are as
follows:
Charcoal Stoves
Traditional    Iproved
Market Price of Stoves, TSh                             100          330
Average Stove Efficiency, Z                              20           27
Annual Consumption of Charcoal/Stove, kg               1100          815
Annual Cost of Charcoal, (TSh 9/kg)                    9900         7335
Annual Net Savings/stove TSh                              0         2335
In addition, the new stoves have a life expectancy about three times longer
(1-1/2 years) than the traditional ones. They can be repaired thereafter,



- 40 -
which the traditional ones cannot.  In a national context, the estimated
cumulative savings of the combined fuelwood and charcoal stove components
over the project's four year time span would be as follows:
Savings of Natural Woodlands (ha)                           7,200
These savings would, of course, continue indefinitely after completion of
the project, because by then the new technologles would be firmly
established. A detailed feasibility study by TISCO i8 available from the
project file.
Economic Analysis of Transmission Line Expansion Program
4.26       A major part of TANESCO's current expansion program consists of
the extension of  the ICS-based  transmission network to isolated load
centers in the northwest of the country (para. 2.19). Because of the heavy
financial burden that these investments impose both on TANESCO and the
country's foreign exchange reserves (para. 2.20), an extensive review of
the economic merits of these three transmission lines was undertaken.
These evaluations assessed (in present value terms) the optimum year for
replacing the present (and possible future) diesel generating stations at
the respective load centers by these transmission interconnections.   The
results of this analysis have been summarized in the following two
paragraphs. A more detailed analysis can be found in Annex 4.4.
4.27        (A) Dodoma/Mwanza Line.  Evaluated at a discount rate of 12%
completion of the line could be postponed until 1993 or even later if the
marginal costs of ICS energy are no longer assumed to be zero.  However,
the difference in present value terms between any of these alternatives
does not exceed 10. A significant portion of the line has already been
built.   This means that the remaining capital costs of the line are at
least 25 to 30% lower than those assumed in the analysis.   This makes
completion of the line the economically least cost solution, provided
actual completion can be assured (para. 2.20 b).
4.28      (B) Mwanza/Musoma and Shinyanga/Tabora Line.  The two lines were
scheduled for construction start-up by 1986, with completion to coincide
with the completion of the DodomafMwanza Line in 1988. The analysis found
that completion of these lines by 1988 is not the economically optimal
strategy even under the most optimistic assumptions of load growth,
non-fungibility of foreign financing and zero [CS energy costs. Given the
uncertainties surrounding the actual completion of the Dodoma/Mwanza Line,
it would be prudent to postpone their construction start-up until this
completion is fully assured.   At that time, the load forecasts for the
regions to be served by these two lines as well as the various assumptions
underlying the analysis should be reviewed in order to determine whether
construction should get underway then or later.
V. TANESCO: FINANCIAL ASPECTS AND COST RECOVERY
Financial Position and Past Operating Results
5.01      After several years of reasonably satisfactory results, TANESCO's
financial performance deteriorated during the 1982-1984 period.   Several



- 41 -
factors contributed to this decline.   Fuel costs almost doubled between
1983 and 1984 due to increases in generation in the isolated areas and
higher fuel prices.   Devaluation of the TSb had an adverse effect on
TANESCO's debt service capability, and the company was not able to meet its
full debt service obligations during that period. High domestic inflation
and large increases in unaccounted-for electricity consumption caused
TANESCO's other operating costs to increase.   These adverse factors were
not offset by adequate revenues, due to the depressed demand outlined
earlier (para. 2.07) and also due to inadequate tariff Increases, as can be
seen from Table 5.1:
TABLE 5.1
Comparative Price and Tariff Indices
1981    1982    1183    1984

Index (relative to US$)                    100   115.7   149.5   214.7

Index (avg. revenue; TSh/kWh sold)         100   100.0   150.0   180.0
Just as TANESCO's financial performance started to deteriorate, it embarked
on  an  ambitious  investment  program.    In  1984,  TANESCO  started  the
construction of the Mtera Hydroelectric Project in addition to the
extensive transmission system expansion program (para. 2.19), and its
capital expenditures for that year almost quadrupled compared to those in
1983. The huge build-up of receivables due to non-collection of bills also
exacerbated the cash flow situation (para. 5.10).
5.02         The operating rasults of TANESCO for 1982 through 1984 are
summarized below and shown in detail in Annex 5.1. The results for 1982
and 1983 are based on audited accounts while those for 1984 are based on
latest estimates prepared by the mission and TANESC0 (para. 5.07).
5.03         TANESCO ended these three years with negative net working
capital.   The reasons for this unsatisfactory situation were TANESCO's
inability to generate sufficient cash in relation to its investment, debt
service and working  capital  requirements.    Furthermore,  increases  in
debtors on account of non payment of electricity bills further exacerbated
its cash position. Delayed action by the Government on tariff increases, a
lack of sound billing and collection management, and inadequate enforcement
regarding overdue accounts (especially those of government agencies) were
major contributing factors. Thls forced the company to rely more and more
on bank overdrafts, to default on due debt payments and delay payments of
its bills. As of December 31, 1984, TANESCO's overdue debt service to the
Government was about TSh 535 million (Table 5.2).

5.04      TANESCO's financial position on December 31, 1982, 1983, and 1984
are summarized in Table 5.3 and shown in detail in Annex 5.3.
5.05       As a consequence of the poor financial performance of TANESCO,
neither the company nor the Government are at present in conformance with
agreements reached under CR 1405-TA for the Mtera Project, which requires,
Inter alia, that cash generated from operations is to contribute 25% of the
costs of investment (40% by 1986), and that receivables are to be kept at
60 days of billing.  During negotiations, a number of actions that will
rectify the situation were agreed upon between IDA, the Government and
TANESCO (paras. 5.06, 5.11, 5.14 and 5.24).
5.06         To help ensure TANESCO's financial viability in the future,
during negotiations agreements were reached that: I) overdue principal
payments due the Government as of December 31, 1985 will be rescheduled
over the life of the various loans and/or fully paid by 1992; ii) overdue
interest charges due the Government as of December 31, 1985 will gradually
be paid off by the end of 1988 iii) TANESCO shall not incur any new debt
unless a reasonable forecast of its revenues and expenditures shows that

projected internal cash generations will be 1.4 times the projected debt
service requirement on all debt for the succeeding years, including the
debt to be incurred and iv) the grant portion of foreign financing for the
Mtera project (US$29.5 million) will continue to be passed on to TANESCO as
equity capital.  Additional measures needed, particularly with respect to
tariffs, are discussed In para. 5.17.

Accounting and Audit
5.07       Due mainly to the lack of reliable and consistent information on
past performance and long delays in closing the books of account,
considerable difficulty was experienced in obtaining data required for
evaluating TANESCO's finances.   In -ecent years, TAVESCO has encountered



- 44 -
serlous difficulties in maintaining its accounts and closing them in a
timely fashion. Audited accounts Lor 1983 were not completed until July
1985, and the 1984 books of account have just recently been closed. Under
such circumstances, meaningful financial management informatton for
decision making purposes is virtually non-existent. The problems stem
mainly from the lack of experienced accounting staff and Inadequate sata
processing facilities. A major factor contributing to the relative lack of
experienced personnel is that in 1983 TANESCO was forced to dismiss its
entire accounting staff-including the managers--because of serious
irregularities.  To help improve performance in the future, financing of
the services of a senior financial advisor is included in the proposed
project. In terms of data processing, at present only billing, payroll and
inventory are  fully computerized.    TANESCO needs  to develop a fully
computerized accounting system so that information will be readily
available to management.  In order to do so, TANESCO has to upgrade its
existing computer facilities and staff capabilities. The financing of the
required additional hardware and software, and the services of a consultant
who would assist in the implementation of a fully computerized accounting
system as well as the training of staff, are included in the proposed
project (para. 3.04).
5.08           Since  1971,  TANESCO's  external  auditors  have  been  the
Government-owned Tanzania Audit Corporation (TAC).   The present auditing
arrangement is satisfactory to IDA.  The audit covenant under CR 1405-TA
requires TANESCO to have its audited financial statements submitted to IDA
within five months after the end of each calendar year. This covenant has
never been met due to the problems explained in para. 5.07.   In view of
the assistance to be provided under the proposed project (paras. 3M02 and
5.07), the following timetable appears realistic:

During negotiations, agreement was reached that TANES00 will continue to
employ qualified auditors and adhere to the above timetable with respect to
closing its books and forwarding reports to IDA.
Billing and Collection
5.09      TANESC0 is experiencing serious difficulties with the accuracy of
its billing data.   This, in part, is due to frequent errors in meter
reading. Meters are not read on a regular basis because TANESCO does not
have an adequate number of meter readers and inspectors and lacks
transportation for them.   Also, many meters are damaged and need to be
repaired or replaced. While TANESCO has its own meter repair shop, it is
largely non-operational because of the lack of foreign exchange for buying
parts and tools.   The comupany has virtually no inspectors to check the



- 45 -
accuracy of reported meter readings.  The financing of meters, motorcycles
for meter readers and inspectors, and vehicles for disconnection crews has
been included in the proposed project (para. 3.04).
5.10      A major problem for the financial performance nf TANESCO has been
the poor payment record by its major customers. As of December 31, 1985,
TANESCO's accounts receivable were estimated at TSh 662 million, equivalent
to about 160 days of the last 12 months' sales.    Table 5.4 shows a
breakdown of the debtors and the percentages overdue for more than 60 days.

a/ Zanzibar State Fuel and Power Corporation buys energy in bulk from
TANESCO and distributes it on the Island of Zanzibar.
5.11      The largest single outstanding account is that of the former Dar
es Salaam Water Supply Organization (WSO). While it is no longer in
existence and in October 1984 has been replaced by a new organization, the
National Urban Water Supply Authority (NUWA), bills by the latter also are
paid only sporadically.  The main problem appears to be a poor organization
and chaotic and inconsistent billing and collection procedures by NUWA. To
help improve this situation this project is making provision foir a
US$300,000 technical assistance component to NUWA (para. 3.04). Recently,
the Government settled TSh 109 million of NUWA's outstanding electricity
bills with TANESCO.   During negotiations agreement was reached that the
Government shall furnish to IDA a plan of action, satisfactory to IDA, for
the reduction of the remaining outstanding electricity accounts of NUWA.
Furthermore, it was agreed that the submission of such a plan, satisfactory
to IDA, is a condition of effectiveness of the proposed credit.
5.12       It is estimated that about 35% of the overdue private accounts
have been outstanding for more than two years and are not recoverable.  In
the past, the company  ias not  in  a position  to maintain  a  proper
disconnectioa po!icy, because it had no legal authority to disconnect most
governmental and parastatal customers for non-payment of bills.   TANESCO
also experienced serious difficulties in collecting from private consumers
because of f-equent disputes about the amounts billed as well as slow
follow-up procedures (para. 5.10).
5. 1 3.   Recently, TANESCO has been formally authorized by the Government
to dicconnect almost all types of consumers, including most Government



- 46 -
agencies (but excluding NUWA), who do not pay their bills within two months
after they have been issued.   TANESCO also has recently increased its
reconnection fee from TSh 50 to TSh 250 and has started to charge 12%
interest on all outstanding accounts above TSh 500 which have not been
settled within 30 days.  These new regulations should lead to better pay
discipline in the future and reduce the time it has taken in the past to
settle disputes with regard to Inaccurate bitts.
5.14           During  negotiations,  agreement was reached  that:  I) the
Government shall guarantee prompt payment of bills outstanding for more
than 45 days of those customers who, as specified by Government, cannot be
disconnected for safety and humanitarian reasons; ii) commencing on June
30, 1906, TANESCO shall prepare every three months a report summarizing its
outstanding consumer accounts stating the actions it proposes to take, and
send a copy to IDA, and iii) TANESCO shall reduce its accounts receivable
to no more than 75 days of sales as of December 31, 1987 and maintain it at
no higher than that level thereafter.   Furthermore, it was agreed that
2ANESCO shall reduce its accounts receivable, except that of NUWA, to no
more than 90 days of sales prior to making the credit effective.
Tariffs, Structure and Levels
5.15           Uniform  power  tariffs apply  throughout  Tanzania.   As a
consequence, a substantial cross-subsidy exists between consumers supplied
by the ICS and those from isolared diesel plants, where costs are much
higher.    This  tariff  structure does  not give  appropriate  signals  to
electricity users in high-cost areas about the real costs of their
consumption. Also, the present structure is strongly distorted in favor of
domestic consumers and (to a lesser degree) to industry, and highly
discriminatory with respect to commercial users, with rates for the latter
more than four times higher than domestic ones. This apparently has led to
widespread misuse and faulty end-use classifications.  For example, there
are about 1,000 domestic users with consumption rates in excess of 7,000
kWh/month.   The financing of a tariff study based on LRMC was included in
the most recent credit (CR 1405-TA) and has recently been completed, but
not reviewed 4n depth so far.  However, some of its recommendations have
already been incorporated in the new tariff structure announced as part of
the March 1, 1986 tariff increase (para.  5.16).   After reviewing its
findings, agreements will be reached between IDA and TANESCO about
implementing agreed-upon recommendations by December 31, 1986.
5.16      TANESCO's recent electricity tariffs, in part as a result of the
depressed electricity demand, were neither adequate to provide sufficient
funds to meet its requirements for operating expenses, debt services and
normal capital expenditures, nor to meet the cost-recovery covenant of
CR 1405-TA. Therefore, an average tariff increase of 67% was approved by
the Government  and  implemented as of March  1,  1986.   This increase,
together with further increases and other agreed-upon measures, will be
sufficient to restore the company's financial viability in the immediate
future (para. 5.17).
5.17        To maintain its financial viability, and to meet its future
operating costs and debt service requirements, as well as financing a
reasonable part of its construction program from internally generated
funds, TANESCO will require Government approval of future timely tariff



- 47 -
increases in addition to the measures agreed upon and outlined in para.
5.06.   Based on the financial projections and the assumptions shown in
Annex 5.1 through Annex 5.4, tariff increases at rates of 10% in January
1987, to be followed by average increases of 29% in January of each year,
from 1988 through 1990 respectively, would be required. No increase would
be needed in 1991. The large increase implemented on March 1, 1986 was in
part a reflection of the delay in tariff adjustments required earlier. It
was  needed  to  eliminate  the  overdrafts  upon  which TANESCO  has  been
dependent in the past, and to provide sufficient cash to enable TANESCO to
meet its debt obligations when they fall due.
5.18      While these projected tariff increases may appear to be high, it
must be recognized that they reflect current TSh prices. After adjustment
for projected domestic inflation, the increases would be on average
about 4% p.a. between 1987 and 1990, and a decline of 6% in 1991.  Such
increases in constant terms are quite modest, given the heavy investment
program and sluggish rate of load growth. Moreover, they are likely to be
followed by several years of decline in constant terms after 1990 because
of the much lower investment program.
5.19       As an indication of an appropriate tariff level, an estimate of
the economic cost of power has been derived, based on the expansion program
described in paras 2.25 & 2.26. These average incremental economic costs
are estimated at TSh 5.4 kWh, (USe 16.0) expressed in end-1985 prices and
at a discount rate of 12% (para. 4.04). As pointed out before, these costs
are about twice as high as those that would have prevailed if the earlier,
more optimistic load forecasts had materialized. Other factors that affect
average cost levels are the small size of the system, low average
consumption per connection, the high costs of operating the separate,
diesel-supplied load centers and the extensive transmission network
required.
Future Financial Position and operations
5.20        The projected financial statements of TANESCO for 1986 through
1991, together with notes and assumptions used in these statements, are
shown in Annexes 5.1 through 5.4. However, these projections are based on
a number of overall assumptions with respect to domestic inflation,
currency exchange rates and load growth, which are subject to considerable
uncertainty (Annex 5.4).   In particular,  it should be noted that the
assumption with respect to future devaluations and domestic inflation
reflect trenda that may not prevail in the future. Additional adjustments
may be needed if these projected values change (paras. 5.22 and 5.24).
Because of the uncertainty surrounding a potential econolmic recovery, the
low growth load forecast (B) was used as basis for revenue projections
(para. 2.07). Projected balance sheets for the years ending December 31,
1986 through 1991 show that the current ratio during these years would
increase from 0.9 in 1986 to 1.2 in 1991. The debt equity ratio would vary
from 51:49 for 1986 to a peak of 61:39 in 1988, but then decline to 44:56
in 1991, reflecting the need for less borrowings beyond 1988 as TANESCO's
investment expenditures decrease   sharply and debt repayments overtake
drawdowns. These levels are within acceptable range.
5.21        The recent and proposed future tariff revisions, coupled with
projected sales, operating costs ind asset levels, are expected to generate



- 48 -
adequate funds to meet the financial targets set out in para. 5.17 and
would result in rates of return on TANESCo's average revalued net fixed
assets of 16X in 1986, and about 101 thereafter. The projected operations
of TANESCO indicate that its financial performance would be satisfactory
for the years 1986-1991, based on currently projected sales, costs and the
proposed tariff levels, with the working ratio decreasing steadily from
0.40 to 0.23, and debt service coverage projected to be about 1.8 in 1986,
1.4 to 1.5 between 1987 and 1990b and 1.3 in 1991.   Although the debt
service coverage appears to be low for the later years, TANESCO's cash
position at that time is projected to be adequate. The company would not
need to generate more cash because of the low projected level of its
capital expenditures at that time (para. 2.19). 6/
5.22          Because these projected operating results are subject to
considerable   variations,   given   the  uncertainties   surrounding   the
projected, major macro-economic variables, TANESCO will need to review
regularly the level of its tariffs. TANESCO and the Government have agreed
to institute such regular reviews (para. 5.24).
5.23      Under CR 1405-TA, TANESCO's financial performance has been linked
to a cash contribution toward investment, under which the company is
required to generate from internal sources not less than 251 of the annual
average of its capital expenditures for 1985 and 1986, and 401 thereafter.
This covenant is based on a three year average: two actual years and one
projected. It is preferable, however, to relate TANESCO's future financial
performance to an annual rate of return on revalued assets, which would be
less cumbersome to monitor because it would be based only on the actual
result for one year. Under CR 1405-TA, TANESCO is required to revalue its
assets by January 1, 1986, and regularly thereafter, based on an index
acceptable to TANESCO and IDA.   Such an index was agreed upon during
appraisal of the proposed project. Consequently, the above cash covenant
has been replaced by a rate of return covenant (para. 5.24).
5.24      During negotiations, agreement was reached that i) TANESCO shall
earn an annual rate of return on average net revalued plant in operation of
10 in 1987 and thereafter, ii) before September 30 each year TANESCO shall
review with IDA whether TANESCO will meet the requirements set out in (i)
above in respect of such year, iii) TANESCO shall review semi-annually the
adequacy of its tariffs and make recommendations to the Government based on
such reviews, and iv) in the event the semi-annual review shows that the
requirement set out in (i) will not be met, the Government shall review
TANESCO's tariffs and take appropriate action within 60 days.
TANESCO's Financing Plan
5.25       A detailed funds flow statement for TANESCO is shown in Annex
5.2. A summary financing plan for 1986 through 1989 (based on assumptions
outlined in Annex 5.4) is shown in Table 5.5.
5.26        During the project period from 1986 through 1989, TANESCO's
construction program is expected to cost TSh 11,444 million (US$340
6/ From 1989 onwards, annual debt service payments are projected to be
larger than annual investment expenditures.



- 49 -
million),  including  interest  during  construction  of  TSh  1,725 (US$47
million).  The proposed project represents about 29M, or TSh-3,276.2 (US$86
million) of the total construction prograa.   Internal cash generation,
after covering debt service, deferred interest and increases In working
capital, will produce 15X of the funds required for construction
expenditures during the 1986-1989 period.   All of the foreign exchange
expenditures is expected to be financed from external financial sources.
Borrowing will ptovide 78X of TANRSCO's total requirements of funds of
which -70X (US$182 million) of total borrowing required has already been
committed to fin8nce on-going works. Consumers' contribution and deposits
will finance 1X, and the remaining 61 represents grants from the Government
passed on to TANESCO as 3quity contribution to help finance works currently
under construction.

VI. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
Agreements with and Actions by the Government and TANESOD
6.01      Prior to Negotiations:
(i) Average tariff levels were increased by 67Z as of March 1, 1986
(para. 5.16).
(ii) Outstanding debts of the predecessor of NUWA in the amount of
TSh 109 were settled by the Government (para. 5.11).
6.02      During Negotiations:
Agreements were reached:
TANESCO's Investment Program:-
(i) on an investment program, particularly with respect to the
scope and timing of the transmission line construction
program (para. 2.21); any changes in the investment
program in excess of US$5 million equivalent for any
individual project or for any given year to be agreed with
IDA.
TANESOD's Finances:
(i) that  TANESCO's  overdue  principal  payments  due  the
Government as of December 31, 1985 would be rescheduled
over the life of the various loans and/or fully paid by
1992 (para. 5.06);
(ii) that overdue interest charges due the Government as of
December 31, 1985 would be gradually paid off by the end
of 1988 (para. 5.06);

POWER REHABILITATION PROJECT
Tanesco Power System Load Forecasts
1.        As part of the IDA-financed Power Sector Master Plan now nearing
completion, two detailed load forecasts were prepared for. the TANESCO
System.   They were based on a detailed analysis of the various load
categories for each individual load center. For larger industrial loads,
detailed plant-by-plant surveys were carried out to provide a 'bottom-up'
forecast for this sector.   This was done because,- in total,  industry
accounted for slightly more than 50% of total sales in 1984, but for as
much as 68% in 1978, the last year of reasonable economic growth and
performance. In 1984, industrial plant utilization factors throughout the
country  were  generally  below  30% of potential  capacity.   It can  be
expected, therefore,  that a general economic recovery could lead to a
significant and quite rapid expansion of industrial power demand, even
though a number of existing industrial plants may have to be shut down
permanently because they appear to be uneconomic.
2.         Two forecasts were prepared.  The first, identified as Scenario
(A), is considered to represent an upper bound.   It is based on the
expectation that substantial economic recovery will get underway in 1986 .
The second, called Scenario (B), is more conscrvative and is based on the
expectation that recovery, particularly of the industrial sectors, will be
much slower and will not really get underway until about 1988.
3.         In this analysis, the original Acres forecasts were modified to
account for the anticipated improvements in meter reading, billing
procedures and loss reduction measures resulting from this project. It was
assumed that the current differences between generation and sales,
amounting to over 21% of generation, would be reduced to about 16% by 1988
and 15% by 1990 and beyond.
4.          It must be recognized that any forecast made at this time is
highly uncertain, given the macro-economic conditions currently affecting
Tanzania's economy. It is also not clear whether any economy-wide recovery
program will at the same time lead to a rapid recovery and expansion of
industrial/commercial activities, given the high-cost, non-competitive
characteristics of many of Tanzania's industrial plants.   On the other
hand, It is possible that specific measures, such as the systematic
introduction of electric cookers, the installation of electric boilers or
a power export agreement with Kenya (paras. 2.12 - 2.17) could create new
loads that are currently not accounted for.  However, if any, or even all
of these potential additional loads were to materialize, the currently
available generating capacity, plus the potential output from the Mtera
Project after 1988, will be ample to supply all needs until at least the
early to mid 1990's.
5.            A summary of the two forecast scenarios is contained in
Tables 2.3.1 and 2.3.2. More detailed data by individual load centers and
selected major industrial users can be found in the Project Files in
Appendix C of the Acres Power Sector Master Plan.

provided and tentatively to be financed by CIDA: Equipment and training
material for the TTI-Kidatu; funds for eighteen staff years of training
personnel to improve the teaching programs at TTI; the services of twelve
experienced maintenance experts for the duration of the project.   These
experts  will  be  responsible  for  the  supervision  of  the  project
implementation and at the same time, provide on-the-job training to their
TANESCO counterparts. These experts will consist of five engineers (one
for advising the rehabilitation department, one for distribution planning,
one for generation, one for lineman's training, one for stores and
warehouses) and seven distribution and/or diesel plant technicians.
15.         A senior financial advisor, to work closely with the general
manager, to assist TANESCO in improving its financial systems and
procedures.
16.            A computer advisor with extensive experience in utility
accounting and control systems, to assist TANESCO in improving its systems
and procedures, and to develop fully computerized systems.
17.             All  of  these  experts will  have  to meet  standards  of
qualifications and experience satisfactory to IDA.  Their services will be
required from the beginning of project implementation for a period of 42
months. If actual completion of the project is delayed beyond this period,
it is reasonable to assum that the counterpart staff trained by these
advisors will be able to complete the remaining tasks on their own.
Hlousehold Energy Components
18.       Charcoal Production: This component will consist of two or three
efficient, commercially-sized pilot charcoal production operations.  They
will be based on the use of natural forests that have to be cleared to make
room for proposed fuelwood plantations, and on the utilization of waste
wood from sawmills. The operations will introduce energy-efficient kilns
and will include the construction of access roads or trails where needed,
camps, vehicles, tools and operator training.   The aim is to establish
commercially viable, privately-run, financially sound operations that will
help alleviate the growing scarcity of cooking fuels in urban areas, and in
creating new sources of employment and income. This project component will
be administered by the Energy Department of MEM in close cooperation with
the Forestry Department of MNRT.
19.         Charcoal Cookers:  This project component will consist of the
systematic introduction of more energy-efficient charcoal cookers (jikos)



*69                               ANNEX 3.1
Page 5 of 6
of proven design into the Dar es Salaam market.   It will include the
training of cooker manufacturers and/or artisans and the propagation and
demonstration of cookers in the market place. This project component will
be administered by the Energy Department of MEM.
20.       Electric Cookers:  This project component will consist of a study
of the potential for the manufacture or import of low-cost, 2-burner
electric cookers for supply to existing power consumers within TANESCO's
ICS.   Until the mid-1990's,  such a program could help to reduce the
existing, hydro-based generating surplus.
21.       Technical-Assistance to the National Urban Water Supply Authority
(NUWA):  Technical assistance is to be provided to NUWA in order to enable
this -organization to develop a proper billing, accounting, and bill
collection system.   These appear to be main problems inhibiting NUWA's
ability to generate sufficient revenues to pay its accounts, particularly
its arrears to TANESCO.

Economic Costs of ElectricitY
Introduction
1.         A major criteria for electricity tariffs is that they should be
set at levels that adequately reflect the economic costs of supplying
electricity.   The usual measure  of these economic costs are Long-Run
Marginal Costs (LRMC).  However, under present circumstances, the use of
strict LRMC would be inappropriate as a measure of true economic costs.
This is so because of the heavy, already committed power investment
program, which will be sufficient to satisfy projected demands until the
mid-1990s. Once this program is completed, future additions to generating
capacity will be much less costly on a per unit basis than the current
investment program, which means that strict LRMC (excluding already
committed investments) would also be quite low.   However,  it is the
committed investment program that is determining the actual resource costs
of the power sector to the economy until the mid-1990's and beyond.
Therefore, the costs of this program, as measured by its Average
Incremental Costs (AIC), are used here as a measure of the economic cost of
power consumption.
Definitions and Methodology
2.        The AIC for the entire TANESCO system represents an average value
of the AIC's of the various sub-systems that make up the total power
utility complex. These consist of the hydro-based ICS and the 25 isolated
diesel generating stations (as of 1984). By the end of 1991, however, the
number of the latter will have been reduced to 9 stations, accounting for
only about 3% of total generation, a result of the ongoing transmission
line expansion program.
3.         The AIC as calculated include the full costs of all ongoing and
committed projects.    However,  planned investments  that would not  be
completed within the 1984-1992 time horizon of the evaluation have been
excluded, except for additional investments in distribution facilities
required to absorb the remaining surplus generating capacity at the end of
1992.
4.        The AIC have ,een calculated as the ratio of the present value of
Incremental Coste (Capital + 0 & M + Customer Costs + Fuel) to the Present
Value of Incremental Sales.   To estimate the economic penalty of the
,current overinvestments relative to actual and projected power demand, a
hypothetical AIC based on the demand forecasts of the 1983 Mtera Project
was also calculated.   The latter also represents a demonstration of the
votential value of additional power sales (e.g. exports, electric cooker
penetration, etc.).

Table A 4.1.2. More specific details of the underlying assumptions and
calculations can be found in the working papers of the Project Files
(Annex 6.1). The key assumptions are the following:
(a) Price level:  December 1985
(b)  Exchange Rate:  TSh 16.415   Us$1.00
(c)  Standard conversion factor:  0.47
(d)  Discount rates 9%, 102, 12%, 152
(e)  Period of analysis:  39 years (to account for 1988
completion of Mtera)
(f) Life expectancy of hydro components: 50 years
(g) Life expectancy of transmission and distribution components:
35 years;
(h)  0 & M costs as a % of capital costs:
- generation:         22 p.a.
- transmission:        1 1/2 p.a.
- distribution:       5% p.a.
- diesel plants:      5% p.a.
(i)  Incremental customer administrative costs:  40X of current
average customer costs;
(j)   Demand growth:   As per demand projection (B) contained in
para. 1.26 until full capacity utilization is reached by
1997; constant thereafter.
Average Incremental Costs (AIC)
6.        The estimated AIC for the overall TANESCO system based on current
and on previous demand projections are as follows:

POWER REHABILITATION PROJECT
Economic Analysls of Power Rehabilitation Components
Introduction
1.         This Annex presents a summary 1/ of the economic analyses of the
major proposed rehabilitation components, consisting of.
(a) the -distribution networks in Dat es Salaam, Tanga, Amusha and
-   oshi;
(b) the ICS transmission system;
(e) the Ubungo power station; and
(d) the Mwanza Nyakato power station.
2.         In the case of each of the above the aim of rehabilitation is to
improve  the  reliability  of  electricity  supply.    The  TANESCO  system
currently suffers from frequent and rapidly rising power failures which
result in a significant amount of electricity demand not being met. The
real economic value of unserved energy is equal to the net reduction in the
value added of the productive sectors (net of value added that can be
recovered through rescheduling of production), and the net losses private
power consumers suffer from power not supplied, as indicated by their
willingness to pay for electricity as measured by the costs of connection
fees, or their costs of using alternatives such as charcoal or kerosene for
cooking,  lighting,  etc.    A  detailed discussion of the methodologies,
assumptions made and specific dates used can be found in the consultant's
report (para. 1).
Average Value of Unserved Energy
3.         The analysis estimated the following values for unserved erergy
in Tanzania, expressed in December 1985 (shadow-priced) border prices:

5.         The estimates of benefits are based on the average outage record
of  the  period  1981-1983.    It  was  conservatively  assumed  that  this
informat.on is representative of the current state of the systems.   Any
deterioration  in  reliability  that  has  occurred,  or  would  occur
subsequently, will, of course, enhance the case for rehabilitation.
6.        The net present value of the benefits that would be obtaizned from
the rehabilitation programs and improved maintenance is shown in Table

7.           Improving the supply to LV consumer areas that are currently
overextended (for sowe consumers the supply voltage has been found to be as
low as 100 V) will have two significant effects:
(a) it will increase consumer demand; and
(b) it will reduce losses on the distribution system.
The combined effect will be to reduce significantly the level of unserved
energy, while at the same time leading to little or no increase in
generation.  Based on a number -of spot checks and field investigations, it
is estimated that losses in the overextended areas are currently of the
order of 14.5%, and that after rehabilitation, they should be reduced to
3.42.  The present values of the anticipated benefits over the period
1986-95 are presented in Table A.4.2.5.

With the exception of the LV system in Moshi, the net present values of
rehahilitation are positive and the sum of the net benefits on both
netvorks exceed the capital expenditure on maintenance equipment. The net
benefits of rehabilitation are particularly pronounced in the case of Tanga
and Dar es Salaam.   In Moshi and Arusha the distribution systems are
currently in better condition and this is reflected in lower net present
values for these tou'ns.
9.         The sensitivity of the results was tested against reductions in
the values assumed from unserved energy.  Leaving aside the LV system in
Moshi, the LV rehabilitation program in Arusha is the sub-project most
sensitive to a lower value for unserved energy. However, even in this case
the value of unserved energy would have to be as low as US$0.3/kWh in order
to reduce net benefits to zero at a discount rate of 12%.
Transmission System Rehabilitation
10.        The economic analysis is based on the calculation of the costs
incurred as a resul. of an outage on any section of the transmission
system. A proportion of the overall expenditure is for the rehabilitation
of specific sections of transmission line and specific substations, to
improve the existing level of reliability. In this instance, the case for
rehabilitation has been assessed independently.  However, a large part of
the expenditure is on maintenance equipment that is intended to prevent
deterioration of the system as a whole rather than to increase the current
level of reliability.  For this tranche of expenditures an assessment was
made of the potential benefits over a range of possible deterioration
rates.
11.       The current level of outages on each section of the transmission
system  and  the  expected  level  after  rehabilitation  are  shown  in
Table A.4.2.7. The outage data are based on statistics co-ering only the
years 1981 to 1983. Serious outages lasting three days or more, which are
caused by the collapse of towers, have been experienced on older sections
of transmission lines.   However,  because of the small number of these
events this type of outage was not considered in the analysis.

12.             Table A.4.2.8 shows the cost and estimated benefits of
rehabilitation and maintenance equipment in 1985 border prices.   Because
o;.tage rates of -some of the components of the system currently are low, it
was not always possible to project actual benefits for rehabilitation.
Instead, the rate of increase in hours of outages required to recover costs
at a discount rate of either 10% or 12% were estimated over a 10 year
period.    In  the  considered  opinion  of  the  consultants,  without  the
rehabilitation project these minimum outage growth rates are likely to be
exceeded in all cases, given the current state of preventive maintenance of
the TANESCO sys em,
13.        The exipenditures under the last item in Table A.4.2.8 comprise
the items listed in Table A.4.2.9:

14.        The aim of the maintenance program is to avoid an increase in
outage hours on all parts of the transmission system, including those that
are rehabilitated. The annual increase in outage hours on each section is
expressed as a percentage of the current outage rate, It was assumed that
reliability would not deteriorate after 1985 if the maintenance program was
undertaken.
15.             Table  A.4.2.10  shows,  for example,  that  at a rate of
deterioration of 20% (which is a rate not unreasonable in light of the
general neglect of maintenance on these lines in recent years), the
benefits would be US$1.91 million.   There will be additional benefits
because the maintenance equipment will help to maintain the transmission
lines on the grid extension to Mbeya and Mwanza.  It should be noted that
this analysis does not take account of major outages.   If, for example,
improved maintenance avoids a major outage lasting three days on the
Kidatu-Morogoro line, the benefit of this alone would be in the region of
$2 million to $3 million,

Rehabilitation of the Ubungo Thermal Station
16.       The installed capacity of the Ubungo power station comprises:
3 x 4.4 KW Mirrlees diesel
3 x 6 MW Pielstick PC2 diesel
2 x 7.5 MW Pielstick PC3 diesel
1 x 14.8 KW gas turbine
Of these, the only sets now in working order are two of the three Mirrlees
which can achieve a combined output of 6 KW and can run for up to two hours
before excessive temperatures make it dangerous to continue.   Without
rehabilitation it is expected that these engines will become unusable
within a relatively short period of time.
17.        The basic rehabilitation proposed under the project will allow
the engines to operate as standby plant but a full rehabilitation would be
required to reach a standard sufficient for baseload operation. The costs
of initial and full rehabilitation and conversion to natural gas are
presented in Table A.4.2.11.

Rehabilitation of the Mwanza Nyakato Station
19.         The Nwanza area is served by two power stations, dwanza South
and Mwanza Nyakato. The installed capacity of these stations is:
Mwanza South                    Mwanza Nyakato
6 x 1.5 MW Ruston               4 x 4.56 MW Mirrlees
3 x 0.64 KW Wartsila
Four of the Mwanza South engines have been rehabilitated in 1985 but are
available only on a limited basis due to their age (1969).   The three
diesel-fired Wartsila engines at Mwanza Ny2kato have only recently been
installed to ease the current supply difficulties and are in good
condition. Most recently, only one of the Mirrlees units was operational
on a limited basis.
20.          The electricity supply system serving the Mwanza region is
currently facing serious problems.   By the end of 1985 there were only
12 MW of working capacity serving Mwanza, (6 MW at each of Mwanza South and
Mwanza Nyakato).   Rehabilitation work at Mwanza  Nyakato will provide
benefits by reducing the level of unserved energy.  It has been assumed
that interconnection will be effected by mid-1988  (see Annex 4.4 for
qualifications). However, these benefits will only apply up to the time at
which the northwest extension connects Mwanza to the ICS. After this time
the benefits will be reduced for several years since all diesel capacity at
Mwanza will be relegated to the role of standby generation.   However, by
the mid-1990s, availability of these units will make it possible to
postpone additional investments in new ICS generation facilities by up to
three years.  /   These benefits are quite significant in present value
terms.

21.        In assessing the value of unserved energy in Mwanza it must be
noted that its electricity load is dominated by two large users, the water
supply industry and the textile producer NWATEX, who together account for
almost two thirds of unsuppressed electricity demand. For MWATEX, it was
calculated that only 60% of power otutages would lead to an actual loss in
output.   The value added of this lost output has been estimated to be
$1.47/KWh. A higher value has been assumed for losses of water supply and
a much lower one for domestic losses. The weighted average loss from power
outages in the Mwanza area has been estimated to be $1.50/KWh.
22.        As the data of Table A.4.2.15 indicate the economic case for an
mmediate rehabilitation of the Nyakato diesel powerplant is very strong
and the work should be undertaken as soon as possible.

TANZANIA
POWER REHRILITATION PROJECT
Economic Rates of Return
1.         Because the power rehabilitation components of the project form
an integral part of TANESCO's overall investments and operations, it is not
possible  to establish  a separate  economic  rate  of  return  for  them.
Instead, two evaluations were undertaken:   One of the overall expansion
program of TANESCO, for which projected, average revenues represent the
measure of benefits, and system's total incremental capital operating and
maintenance expenditures represent the measure of costs. The second one is
based on an explicit evaluation of the real economic benefits and costs of
the specific project components analysed in Annex 4.2, which use the
estimated economic losses caused by power outages and unreliable supply as
the measure of benefits.
systems Expansion Program
2.          The calculation of the economic rate of return for TANESCO's
system expansion program is based on the agreed-upon investment program
between 1985 and 1992, taking into account the accumulated costs of works
in progress as of December, 1985. The methodology applied and assumptions
used are the same as those detailed in Annex 4.1.   Projected average
tariffs, converted into constant terms, and multiplied by projected net
sales are used as a measure of benefits. The result is as follows:
ERR of 1985-1992 system expansion program: 12%
3.        This average rate of 12% over the economic life expectancy of the
assets is higher than the agreed-upon financial rate of return of 10%.  The
reason for this difference is that tariffs, in current terms, between now
and 1990 have to be set to meet the cash requirements during this period of
heavy investments and lagging sales. In the analysis it was assumed that
tariffs after rising annually between 1985 and 1990, would drop by about
30% in real terms between 1990 and 1992 (remaining unchanged in current
terms in that period) and remain constant thereafter. The results indicate
that after 1992 additional declines in real tariff levels could be
accommodated if the target rate of return is less than 12%.
Power Rehabilitation
4.        Definition and Methodology.  The calculation of the Economic Rate
of Return (ERR) of the electric power system rehabilitation components has
been based on the analysis of the benefits and costs of the project
components analyzed in Annex 4.2. Their total economic costs account for
about 46% of the total costs of the physical rehabilitation components of
the project. For the remaining 54% of rehabilitation expenditures, lack of
detailed data about the type of customers served and the costs of power
outages to them make it impossible to calculate a specific rate of return.
However, the rates of return estimated here are so high that even
substantially lower benef4 e; fJr the remaining components of the project



- 96 -
ANMEX 4.3
Page 2 of 6
can be expected to still yield very high rates.  The reasons for these -high
rates are simple: First, rehabilitation restores valuable assets to proper
operating conditions at costs  that, by their very nature, are only a
fraction of the actual costs of the asset itself; second, the cost of

TANZANIA
POWER RERABILITATION PROJECT
Economic Analysis of Transmission Line Expansion Program
Introduction
1.         A major part of TANESCO's current expansion program consists of,
the extension of -the hydro-based, 220 kV ICS to major, diesel-based load
centers in the southwest and northwest of the country.   The southwest
system extension from the Kidatu power station to Iringa, Mufindi and Mbeya
has been completed. -The northwest extension from Iringa via Mtera to
Dodoma has recently been energized. Work is under way on the extension of
this line from Dodoma to Mwanza, with the section from Dodoma to Singida
under actual construction.   Contracts have also been signed with two
Italian suppliers for the construction of two 132 kV lines, one from
Shinyanga to Tabora and the other from Mwanza to Musoma.   They will be
supplied through the Dodoua-Mwanza line.
Basic Economic Assumptions
2.         The following assumptions and analytical approach are common to
all three cases:
Exchange Rate: TSh 16.4 - US$1.00
Shadow Rate of Foreign Exchange: TSh 35 - US$1.00
Discount Rates: 9%, 10%, 12%, 15X
Marginal Costs of Energy from the ICS: zero until 1994
(because of available surplus), TSh 1.4/kWh thereafter.
Objectives of analysis:
a) To find the optimal transmission line completion year as
determined by least-cost criteria.
b) To identify the resulting net foreign exchange cash flow
resulting from completion of the transmission line as planned.
Dodoma-Mwanza 220 kV Transmission Line
3.         The Dodoma-Mwanza line is currently under construction.  It is
being built at a cost of US$47.2 million (in 1985 constant prices without
interest during construction) and is being financed at an interest rate of
7.5% over a period of 12 years, with about US$17 million payable prior to
completion by 1988. In addition, line compensation equipment with a total
cost estimated at US$8 million will be required.   Italy appears to be
prepared to finance the supply of some US$6 million of this equipment, with
the balance (financing yet to be arranged) to come from other suppliers.
The line is a continuation of the 220 kV transmission line from
Iringa/Mtera to Dodoma.   It will connect the presently isolated load
centers of  Shinyanga,  Iringa and Mhanza to the ICS.   Completion is
scheduled for early 1988.

4.          If the line were not to be completed, it would be necessary to
expend additional funds for a more permanent rehabilitation of the existing
diesel power station than that provided under the project, plus upkeep, and
ultimate replacement and/or expansion.  Also, additional equipment for fuel
transportation and storage, as well as technical assistance, would be
needed to increase the reliability of the diesel stations to acceptable
standards.   These costs have been taken into account in the comparative
analysis.
5.         The foreign financing resources made available for the project
were assumed to be not fungible. Therefore, their actual costs, based on
agreed-upon repayment terms, including interest charges, were taken to be
the actual opportunity costs of funds to Tanzania.
6.          As the results indicate, 1988, the current scheduled year of
completion, is not quite the least-cost year of line completion.   For
example, at a discount rate of 12%, total costs are slightly lower in
subsequent years, reaching a present value some 8% lower by 1993, and
turning up thereafter. However, a further, modest decline occurs in 1995
when the marginal costs of energy are assumed no longer to be equal to
zero. However, the differences in costs are so slight that they are well
within the error range of the data used. Also, it must be considered that
a substantial portion of the line has already been built by now, and that
the reliabi'ity of a hydro-based supply is significantly greater than that
of diesel stations. For all of these reasons, it appears that completion
of the line is the economically optimal strategy at this time.  A summary
of the results is presented in Table A.4.4.1. More detailed infcrmation
can be found in the project file.

7.         The foreign exchange implications of completing the line by 1988
are as follows:

As can be seen, some US$26 million must be committed prior to completion of
the line between 1985 and 1987.  Of this total, some US$22 million are
actual or potential cash outlays. The balance consists of committed grant
funds from Canada. In 1988, the first year of transmission line operation,
the cash flow turns positive, i.e. the total foreign exchange costs of
continued operation of the diesel generating plants would exceed the
foreign exchange payments for the transmission line.
Mwanza-Husoma 132 kV Transmission Line
8.        The Nwanza-Musoma line was planned for construction in 1986, with
completion to coincide with the completion of the Dodoma-Hvanza Line. A
conditional contract was signed with an Italian contractor in April 1985
and agreement In principle was reached in August 1985 with the Italian
Government for the concessional financing of the line. Total costs were
US$16.4 million in foreign exchange and TSh 99.6 million in local costs.
The latter were subject to substantial financial contingency clauses.
9.           This economic analysis was based on the more optimistic load
forecast (A) (para. 1.24). This forecast does not only assume a rapid load
build-up starting in 1986, it also assumes the re-opening and expansion of
the Musoma Textile Plant, which has been closed for some time, and whose
economic viability is in doubt. Use of this optimistic forecast is likely
to overstate actual demand growth and, hence the early viability of the
line.
10.           Because it is difficult to determine whether the Italian
financing should be considered to be fungible or non-fungible (Italy
supports a wide  range of activities in many different  fields in the
country), the economic analysis of the optimal timing of this line has
evaluated both alternatives.

As the results shown In Table A.4.4.3 indicate, in none of the cases is
completion of the line in 1988 economically justified. Even under the most
optimistic assumptions- (non-fungibility of funds, zero marginal energy
costs and high load forecast) should completion be delayed to 1992 or
1993.  Should other markets for surplus energy become avallable, so that
marginal ICS energy costs are no longer zero, then completion of the line
within the whole forecasting period until 1996 is never the least cost
solution. Under the most optimistic assumptions, with non-fungible funds,
completion of the line should be delayed at least to 1989; if funds were
found to be fungible, even with the very optimistic load forecast, net
savings would -be around 171 if the line were to be delayed to 1996 or
beyond.
11.       The foreign exchange implications of completing the line by 1988
are shown in Table A.4.4.4.

Because of the concessional financing terms promised, net cash flow would
be positive for the first two years after completion of the line,
thereafter turning negative for two years, positive again for three years,
followed by two years of negative cash flows until finally, in 1997, the
rising foreign expenses of alternative diesel generation would exceed
repayment commitments for the transmission line.

Project Files, including sensitivity cases with discount rates of 102 and

As can be seen in none of the cases is completion of the line in 1988
economically  optimal.    Only  under  the  most  optimistic  assumptions
(non-fungibility of funds, zero marginal energy costs and high load
forcast) could it be justified to complete the line by 1990 or thereafter,
but positive marginal energy cost would make the line unattractive
throughout  the  forecasting  period.    However,  granted  the  optimistic
assumptions regarding load growth, the differences in costs are very small,
amounting to no more than 4% in the non-fungible and 12% in the fungible
cost of funds cases (at a discount rate of 12%).
14.        The foreign exchange implications of completing the line by 1988
are shown in Table A.4.4.6.

after completion of the line, turning negative thereafter for five years.

Notes and Assumptions for Financial Statements
Sales and Revenues
1.        Sales for the period 1985-1991 are calculated on the basis of the
demand forecast Scenario B prepared by Acres and agreed with TANESCO
(Annex 2.3).   The projected annual average growth is 4.7% from 1985 to
1991.
2.          TANESCO's revenues in current terms are based on yearly tariff
increases of 10.0%, 28.6.%, 27.1%, and 30.2% effective every January 1,
1987 through 1990, respectively.  It is estimated that no tariff increase
will be required for 1991.
Operating Costs
3.             Estimated requirements of fuel for diesel generation are
projected to decrease with the completion of various transmission lines.
The following fuel consumption forecast was prepared:
(Thousand Tons)
1986  1987  1988  1989  1990  1991
Gas-oil                               1.5   1.5   1.5   1.5   1.5   0.4
Industrial diesel oil               19.3  17.5  12.6  12.6  12.6   6.7
Fuel oil                             7.9   8.2   6.8    -       -     -
Total                               28.7  27.2  20.9  14.1  14.l   7.1
Total Thermal Generation (GWh)    106.0  99.0  79.0  54.4  54.4  24.1
The current average fuel oil price to TANESCO of TSh 10,225 (US$565) per
ton was used for 1985 and adjusted for international price escalation for
1986 through 1991. The cost of lubricants was estimated to be 10% of the
cost of fuel, according to past experience.
4.            Increases in TANESCO's personnel cost have been related to
increases in installed capacity and adjusted for annual local inflation
starting in 1987. For 1986, an increase of only 4% was provided for in view
of the large reduction of staff which took place in 1985.
5.         Repairs and maintenance have been calculated at an average of
about 0.75% based on the preceding years' gross revalued assets. From 1989
onwards, when the Mtera hydvoelectric plant is expected to be in
operation but assumed not to require much repair and maintenance, the
percentage was decreased to about 0.6. Administrative and other costs have
been adjusted for local inflation only. Doubtful accounts for 1985 reflect
the write-off of TSh 10.0 million estimated to he non recoverable accounts.

ANNEX 5.4

6.         Depreciation is charged at an average of 3.5% of revalued gross
fixed assets, in accordance with the straight line method and the useful
life of the assets. This is consistent with past experience.
Fixed Assets
7.        TANESCO's assets, as shown in their books for 1984, are stated at
historical costs.  In 1985, IANESCO carried out a revaluation of its I984
fixed assets and accumulated depreciation to reflect replacement cost for
that year.  For the future, fixed assets and accumulated depreciation have
been adjusted to reflect estimated replacement values based on foreign
components of 85X and a local component of 15% for fixed assets and the
following estimated international and local inflation and exchange rates:
1985   1986   1987   1988   1989   1990  .1991
Domestic infl.(%)        30     25     20     20      20     20     20
International infl.(%)  1.3    7.2    6.8    6.8    7.0    7.1    4.0
US$1TSh                16.4   25.3   35.5   49.7   55.8   62.7   72.4
Devaluation of TSh
against US$ (X)         0.0   54.0   40.0   40.0   12.3   12.4   15.5
It should be noted that the assumptions regarding devaluations are based on
historical trends only.   These may not reflect actual changes in the
future. Therefore, the projected values are illustrative only. They will
have to be adjusted according to actual events.
Current Assets
8.          Improvement in TANESCO's billing and collection is assumed to
reduce the accounts receivable to 75 days of sales at the end of 1987 and
thereafter.  Inventories are calculated at 3% of gross revalued plant in
operation, in accordance with past experience. Chargeable workorders have
been adjusted for local inflation only.  "Other' current assets represent
mostly salary advances to staff. These have been estimated at two months'
personnel cost.
Current Liabilities
9.            TANESCO's liquidity position wo.ld improve as a result of
declining accounts receivable position.   Hence, accounts payable would
gradually decrease to 45 days of TANESCO's operating expenses in
1987 excluding salaries, depreciation and doubtful accounts. Furthermore,
deferred  interest, which  represents  overdue  interest payments to  the
Government on loans on-lent to TANESCO, would gradually be paid, with final
payments in 1988. For the future, 'other' payables have been assumed to be
mostly retention money on contracts.  They have been estimated at 5% of
TANESCO's investment cost.
Consumer's Contribution
10.        The average, present connection charge is about TSh 1,000 per
consumer.  This amount has been adjusted for future domestic inflation and
related to estimated growth of new consumers.

Long-Term Debt
11.         The future foreign exchange debt, including the proposed IDA
credit, would arise from grants and credits to the Government and be onlent
to TANESCO to finance the foreign exhange cost of its investment program.
The proceeds of future grants and credits, including the proposed IDA
credit, are assumed to be onlent to TANESCO at 9% annual interest, the
ongoing IBRD lending rate, and are assumed to be repayable in 20 years,
including 3 to 5 years grace, depending on the Construction period of the
works financed.
Grants
12.          Future grants include those already obtained from Norwegian
Agency for International Development (Norad) and SIDA (totaling US$29.5
million) to finance part of the foreign exchange cost of the ongoing
construction of the Mtera hydroelectric plant, and an additional grant from
Norway (US$4.5 million) to finance the rehabilitation of an existing
hydroplant. These works are already under construction.
