rehabilitation, to reasonable levels of reliability and\n            service, and (2) to encourage efficient domestic energy\n            resource development and management. The Power\n            Rehabilitation Project will help the Government and the\n            Tanzania Electricity Supply Company, Ltd. (TANESCO) to\n            develop an investment program for the power sector based on\n            least cost criteria, consistent with Tanzania's\n            available financial and foreign exchange resources. It is\n            also designed to improve availability and production of\n            household energy supplies by pilot activities in more\n            efficient commercial charcoal and charcoal stove production.\n            Technical assistance will be provided for project\n            implementation, financial operations, engineering, and\n            training programs in all areas of TANESCO's operations."}, "docdt": "1986-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
