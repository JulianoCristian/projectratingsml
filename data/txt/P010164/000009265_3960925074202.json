The project contributed positively to private\n            industrial investment, its sustainability is likely with\n            certain changes, and both the Bank and Borrower performed\n            satisfactorily. However, the institutional objectives were\n            only partially achieved due to the extreme ambitions of the\n            project. Several lessons can be learned from this project.\n            First multi-institutional lending operations allow a broader\n            and more effective policy dialogue with GOP and serve as a\n            more effective vehicle for broader institutional and\n            sectoral objectives. Second, a DFC that continues to\n            specialize in a single product operation will find it\n            difficult to survive in a more competitive environment.\n            Adequate response in product and resource diversification is\n            needed to enable it to find its market niche. Third,\n            restructuring and rehabilitation of Government controlled\n            institutions requires substantial supervision by the Bank,\n            strong management, and full support from the Government.\n            Lastly, appropriate development of project implementation\n            and follow-up capacity of financial institutions is an\n            important objective of industrial development and requires\n            serious attention during Bank supervision."}, "docdt": "1989-05-17T00:00:00Z"}
