In\n            addition, attention is directed towards improving resource\n            use, particularly in the public sector, and direct resources\n            to key areas of adjustment, while ensuring fiscal and\n            monetary stability. The incentive framework to be\n            established will focus on trade liberalization, cocoa sector\n            policies, public expenditure policy, state owned enterprise\n            reform, and public sector management."}, "docdt": "1987-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
