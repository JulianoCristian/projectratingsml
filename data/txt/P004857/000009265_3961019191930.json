Institutional development\n            impact is rated as negligible given the remaining financial\n            problems and poor operating and monitoring capacity of the\n            executing agency (the Electric Power Corporation, EPC). The\n            performance of the Borrower (the Government) was\n            satisfactory while that of the EPC was less than\n            satisfactory. Continuing institutional weaknesses at EPC,\n            including prolonged vacancies in its key engineering and\n            financial positions, resulted in weak administration of EPC\n            and the project. The performance of the Bank was generally\n            satisfactory. Some of the cost and time overrun difficulties\n            may have been avoided if the Bank had proceeded to Project\n            approval with a detailed Project design in hand. However,\n            the Bank took noteworthy steps to reassess, revise, and\n            expedite reappraisal. The lessons learned are as follows. By\n            ceding project administration to the Asian Development Bank\n            (ADB) and not participating in supervising missions, IDA was\n            not in a position to exercise quality control. IDA was not\n            intimately involved in the procurement exercise for the\n            civil works, nor involved in the change in the project\n            design, which brought about large increases in costs\n            compared to the appraisal estimates. At the time of\n            appraisal the project design depended on the results of a\n            feasibility report. Some of the costs and time over-run\n            probably could have been avoided if the financiers had\n            proceeded to project approval on the basis of a detailed\n            project design, or better still, waited for the results of\n            the civil works procurement procedure to be known."}, "docdt": "1995-12-29T00:00:00Z"}
