supports the Government's energy policy of developing\n            indigenous renewable energy resources for generating\n            electricity to replace high cost diesel fuel. The project\n            consists of the following components: 1) civil works which\n            include a composite gravity concrete and rockfilled dam, an\n            intake structure, a pipeline, a surge chamber, a tailrace, a\n            powerhouse, and a switchyard.  Further to this, the project\n            entails 2) the installation of electrical and mechanical\n            equipment which includes a 4 MW turbine generator, auxiliary\n            equipment, a set up transformer, and switchgear; 3) the\n            construction of 23 km of 22 kV tranmission line, and\n            upgrading of a 28 km section of a transmission line from 22\n            kV to 33 kV.  Finally, the project involves 4) provisions\n            for consulting services for detailed engineering and\n            construction supervision. The project's overall\n            objectives are to support the energy policy Government of\n            Western Samoa of developing indigenous renewable energy\n            resources for generating electricity at an economic cost to\n            displace h electricity generated by burning imported diesel\n            at Upolu's diesel pow station which consumes expensive\n            imported spare parts and consumables. output of the project\n            will supplement electricity generated by run-of-the-river\n            hydrostations during the dry season, when output from is\n            reduced due to low stream flows, requiring diesel generation\n            to mee electricity demand.  The project, which is currently\n            under constructio about 65% complete, is located in the\n            Upper Salani Basin some 26 km so of Apia.  Afulilo will be\n            the first hydroelectric development in Upolu provide\n            over-season storage and will substantially increase hydro\n            ener firm capacity during the dry season.  The project\n            involves constructio 20 meter high dam, together with a\n            tunnel headrace and penstock to con water to a power station\n            with two 2 MW turbine generators located at F Bay on the\n            northeast coast of Upolu.  The output from Afulilo will be\n            transmitted to Apia via an existing feeder which is being\n            upgraded fro to 33 kV as part of the project.  It is\n            estimated that the Afulilo pro will add approximately 24\n            GWh/year of average energy potential to the system."}, "docdt": "1986-11-30T00:00:00Z"}
