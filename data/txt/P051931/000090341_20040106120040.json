ratings for the Community\n            Reintegration and Development project for Rwanda were as\n            follows: the outcome was highly satisfactory, the\n            sustainability was highly likely, the institutional\n            development was substantial, and the Bank and borrower\n            performance were both satisfactory. The lessons learned\n            indicate that timing is very important. The project came at\n            a time when the government was toying with the idea of\n            decentralization and people's participation for\n            community development, but did not know how to put it into\n            action. Timely availability of fund at the grass root level\n            is important for implementing sub-project activities. It is\n            important to be patient when working at community level,\n            where people lack knowledge and skills. Building their\n            capacity to improve skills and understand procedures is time\n            consuming. In a community development project, capacity\n            building should be given to district council and local\n            population upfront, so that they can start project\n            activities soon after effectiveness. When the Bank is\n            flexible, willing to take risks, and repose trust and\n            confidence on people at grass roots level, they become\n            empowered and capable of executing activities themselves\n            with sufficient cost effectiveness Government commitment and\n            ownership of the project were important factors in the\n            success of the project. The project also demonstrated that\n            with good governance, transparency, and willingness, the\n            government will be able to make incredible achievements.\n            Having a strong and efficient team with dedicated national\n            staff at Project Coordination and Monitoring Unit (PCMU)\n            level played a major role in the success of the project The\n            project demonstrated its relevance and applicability for the\n            country's socio-economic development"}, "docdt": "2003-11-24T00:00:00Z"}
