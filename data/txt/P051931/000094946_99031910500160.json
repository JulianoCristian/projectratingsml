development; and b) strengthen the\n            capacity of local communities and the administration at the\n            communal and national levels for the implementation of\n            development projects. The project consists of four\n            components. First, community initiatives will enable each of\n            the participating community to receive funds for\n            infrastructure subprojects, income-generating subprojects,\n            and capacity building subprojects. Second, institution and\n            capacity building will finance participatory rural\n            appraisals and training activities to build local capacities\n            for sustainable, self-reliant development. The training\n            program will include: 1) participatory and rural appraisal\n            methods; 2) organizational management; 3) project\n            management; 4) financial management; and 5) environmental\n            awareness and training. The third component will finance\n            studies to deepen the understanding of the concept of\n            decentralization and participation. Fourth, project\n            coordination and monitoring will provide critical equipment,\n            materials and supplies to the Project Coordination and\n            Monitoring Unit."}, "docdt": "1998-10-15T00:00:00Z"}
