The project should have\n            been focused on the secondary objective of building capacity\n            in the public and private sectors, and providing distance\n            learning opportunities and knowledge sharing events, rather\n            than attempting to have a significant impact on the\n            environment for policy reforms. The evaluation of the\n            performance of this project must be viewed, in part, in the\n            context of the Global Development Learning Network (GDLN)\n            initiative as a whole, and in comparison to other Centers\n            around the world. Among all 74 Centers in the network, the\n            average utilization rate was 12.43 percent, compared to\n            25.28 percent for Sri Lanka. While this seems to be a very\n            favorable figure for Sri Lanka, it is not a realistic\n            comparison. The average for the six African Centers funded\n            by Bank loans, was 27 percent utilization, slightly higher\n            than Sri Lanka. However this small difference in performance\n            must be put in the perspective of the varying support that\n            centers in different regions received from the Bank. In\n            comparison, the South Asia region of the Bank was the only\n            region that did not, until recently, have a GDLN coordinator\n            to support the business development of the centers. Taking\n            this into account, the project successfully created and\n            equipped the DLC, despite the video conferencing (VC)\n            facilities being under utilized. Given the objective of the\n            project to introduce an emerging method of delivery of the\n            training program, using modern information communication\n            technology in the country, the issue of immediate financial\n            sustainability, cost effectiveness, and using cost per\n            student per day as an indicator to measure comparative costs\n            should be re-examined."}, "docdt": "2005-10-25T00:00:00Z"}
