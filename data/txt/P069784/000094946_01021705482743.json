Distance Learning will increase the dissemination\n            of the latest technical information and cross-country\n            experience in support of market reforms. Senior public and\n            private sector decision-makers will access interactive\n            multi-media and internet-based training programs developed\n            by the World Bank Institute, major universities, private\n            corporations, and technical organizations around the world.\n            This exposure to global knowledge will enhance the capacity\n            of Sri Lankan decison-makers to conceptualize and implement\n            reforms. Better policies will, in turn, lead to improved\n            governance, poverty reduction, and economic growth. This\n            project has only one component: support for establishing and\n            operating the Distance Learning Company (DLC). The single\n            component includes several activities: 1) selecting and\n            relaying distance learning course material; 2) financing of\n            DLC operating costs on a decreasing basis over the first 4\n            years of operation; 3) technical assistance for staff\n            training, a market survey, development of a business plan, a\n            market campaign, and periodic evaluation of center\n            operation/management effectiveness; 4) establishing\n            financial accounts/annnual audits; 5) civil works; and 6)\n            purchasing, installing, and maintaining distance learning\n            technology. A center will be built with a videoconference room."}, "docdt": "2001-02-01T00:00:00Z"}
