Transmission lines will help create a reliable,\n            economical power supply in the South. Construction\n            activities such as cutting trees, clearing routes, digging\n            foundation holes, transporting material, and tensioning\n            conductors can cause soil erosion. Mitigating options\n            include soil replacing, and tree and grass planting. To\n            offset hunting and poaching, fences will be erected and\n            foresty controllers will increase their supervision and\n            inspections. To prevent fire or explosion caused by\n            hazardous spills, construction crews will be supplied\n            protection equipment. To reduce disease risk in construction\n            camps, medical and hygienic measures for handling water and\n            foodstuffs will be firmly adhered to. During the operational\n            phase, the threat of soil erosion around the towers can be\n            alleviated by building a foundation embankment or contouring\n            on sloping land. Trees posing a safety hazard because they\n            are too close to transmission lines will be cut down\n            periodically.
