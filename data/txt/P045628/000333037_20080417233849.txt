1.1     Context at Appraisal
(brief summary of country and sector background, rationale for Bank assistance)

Ten years after the watershed doi moi restructuring of the economy, Vietnam's progress was
tangible: in 1997 GDP stood at $24 billion and had grown at 8.2 percent per year for the past
five years; annual per capita GNI was around $300. Poverty had been reduced fronn 58 percent
to 37 percent. In 1995- 1997, investment had run at about 24 percent of GDP, of which foreign
direct investment made up ten percent. Though the Asian financial crisis was to break later in
1998, the project was prepared against a backdrop of solid macroeconomic growth.

The energy sector mirrored the macroeconomic picture. On average each person used quite
small amounts of energy but rising demand for energy was forecast on the back of strong
industrial sector growth, which had consistentlyoutpaced GDP, and reached 13 percent in 1997.
Demand for electricitywas forecast to grow about 70 percent faster than GDP fiom 1997 to 2010.

The main issues facingthe electricitysector were:

    (a) Need for investment. Large sector investments, estimated to cost around $6 billion, were
        predicted for the period 1997 - 2002. The Government of Vietnam (GoV) planned a
        twin-track approach of increasing electricity tariffs and attracting foreign investment
        including the private sector;

    (b) Inadequate and inefficient electricitv infrastructure. Seasonal and locational differences
        in generation and demand indicated the need to strengthen the north-south extra high
        voltage transmission system while distribution losses in the range of 15 --    30 percent
        pointed to the need for extensive rehabilitation, to reduce the need for additional
        investment in generation;

    (c) Impediments to commercial operation. Although the power sector was consolidated
        under Electricity of Vietnam (EVN) in 1995, commercialized operation was hindered by
        the need to unbundle the generation, transmission and distribution hctions and
        encourages diversified participation;
                                    .
    (d) Inadequate regulatory regme. Government finctioned as policy maker and regulator
        while also being involved in operational decisions that would have been better devolved
        to EVN; and       '

    (e) Need to improve demand side efficiency. Although there was some awart:ness of the
        potential there was limited capacity, information and incentive for initiatives in demand
        side management (DSM).


On November 3, 1997, after appraisal, Typhoon Linda struck southern Vietnam. Nine provinces
were affected, 432 people were killed and 3,800 missing, 76,537 houses 2,250 school rooms and
358,000 hectares of paddy land were ruined. Damage to the electrical distribution network was
estimated at $13 million and included 180km of low voltage (LV), 160km of medium voltage

(MV) lines and 320 distribution substations destroyed. Supply to about 100,000 consumers was
disrupted.

The investment and reform objectives of the project were covered in the Country Assistance
Strategy (CAS) dated October 25, 1995 (report 15053). Support for the transition to a market
economy including investments in the power sector was identified as a priority for IDA; in
recognition that neither other donors nor the private sector would be able meet all the financing
needs of the sector.      The CAS was consistent with the GoV's plans to invest in basic
infrastructureand the Bank's strategy in the power sector to focus on needs in transmission and
distribution, including high-return rehabilitation, while addressing reform to attract the private
sector.

The Bank supported the project for three reasons. First, by providing $189 million of IDA
funding, it would help meet Vietnam's needs for investment, focusing on reinforcing the
transmission and distribution grids to improve their efficiency; it would also introduce DSM to
the sector. Second it would broaden and deepen the Bank's policy dialogue on badly needed
sector-wide reform and commercialization of EVN. Third, it would provide urgently-needed
assistance to reconstruct distributionsystemsfollowingTyphoon Linda.

1.2     Original Project DevelopmentObjectives (PDOs) and Key Indicators (as approved)

The PDOs were to:

   (a) Strengthen the high voltage transmission network in Vietnam to facilitate evacuation of
        power from generatingstations to the load centers;

   (b) Rehabilitate distribution systems to meet demand, reduce losses and improve reliability;

   (c) Support power sector reform and restructuring through:               (i) the separation of
        "transmission" and "generation"functions; (ii) the implementation of regulatory reforms;
        (iii) the introduction of tariff reforms; and (iv) exploring financing of distribution from
        diversified sources;

   (d) Support institutional strengthening and commercialization through: (i) securing greater
        autonomy for the distribution companies; and (ii) introducing planning capabilities for
        demand side management; and

   (e) Help normalize economic activity in the Typhoon Linda affected areas through the
        reconstructionof the electricity distributionnetwork.

The key performance indicatorswere improvements in transmission system reliability, losses and
usage; improvements in distribution system reliability and losses; qualitative measures of the
progress of reform including the operation of transmission as a cost center, presentation of an
electricity law to the national assembly, and creation of a regulatory ofice and regulatory
procedures; and qualitative measures of the autonomy of the distribution companies,
improvementsto EVN's financial management systems and the measurements in the reduction in
peak demand and electricityconsumption.

1.3     Revised PDO (as approved by original approvingauthority) and Key Indicators,
and reasons/justiiication

The PDOs were unchanged on restructuringin May 2005.

1.4     Main Beneficiaries

The main beneficiarieswere the Ministry of Industry, on behalf of the Government, IEVN and its
subsidiary Power Companies (PCs), No. 1 (PCl), responsible for electricity distribution in the
northern part of the country, No. 2 (PC2) responsible for electricity distribution in the southern
part of the country and Ho Chi Minh City PC (HCMC PC) responsible for the metropolitan area
of Ho Chi Minh City.

EVN directly benefited fiom the investments in the transmission system, by improving stable
and reliable operation of the power system, by increasing the capacity to transport power
between north to south in line with seasonal demand and generation availability, by enabling
connection of additionalgeneration capacity and by reduction in transmission losses. PCs 1 and
2 and HCMC PC benefited through investments designed to improve the capacity and efficiency
of their systems, thus enabling them better to meet demand and to improve service to consumers.

The Ministry of Industry (MoI), EVN and the PCs benefitedfrom support,during preparation, of
the development of a medium term power sector policy. During the project, technical assistance
(TA) supported the first steps in implementing the policy to separate generation fiom
transmission, to improve transparency and autonomy in the commercial managemeint of power
transmission and distribution operations and to establish a legal and regulatory framework. The
introduction of a DSM action plan and program further improved the efficiency of EVN and the
PCsin meeting consumer demand.

Secondary beneficiaries were electricity consumers, primarily in the north and south of the
country served by PCs 1 and 2 and in particular in the cities of Ha Long, Ha Tinh, Hai Duong
and Vinh in the north and Ho Chi Minh City and Vung Tau in the south. Indirectly, electricity
consumers throughout the country were beneficiaries. The gains to consumers in improved
quality of power service as a result of the investments can be inferred fiom fewer interruptionsin
supply and greater quantitiesof power flowing in the system.

The main and secondarybeneficiarieswere not changed by the project restructuring,howeverthe
larger number of investments possible through cost savings increased the number o:lsecondary
beneficiariesand the benefitsthey gained.

1.5    Original Components

The Transmission and Distribution Component was divided into six subcompo~nents:               (i)
construction of the second circuit of the Pleiku-Phu Lam 500 kV transmission line (TL) and
associatedsubstations(SS); (ii) constructionof the Ha Tinh 5001220/1l0kV SS; (iii) construction
of the 220 kV Nha Be to Tao Dan circuit and 2201110kV gas insulated switchgear (GIs) Tao

Dan substation in Ho Chi Minh City; (iv) rehabilitation of distribution networks in the cities of
Halong, Vinh, and Vung Tau; (v) consultant services for the Pleiku - Phu Lam 5OOkV line and
the 220kV Nha Be to Tao Dan circuit and substation; and (vi) technical assistance for improving
the regulatory framework and for the demand side management (DSM) program.                     This
component supported the first four of the project development objectives, by strengthening the
high voltage transmission network, rehabilitating distribution systems, supporting sector reform,
and restructuring and supportingcommercializationand institutionaldevelopment.

An associated TA component, financed by Japan, initiated the work on sector reform and
restructuring. The component financed studies to improve the transmission2anddistribution
functions.

The Disaster Reconstruction Component consisted of the reconstruction of 180km of LV and
160km of MV distribution lines and 320 distribution substations with an aggregate capacity of
25MVA. The component supported the fifth project development objective of normalizing
activityin the Typhoon Linda affected area.

1.6     Revised Components

Formal Restructuring withoutChangesto PDO

In May 2005, a restructuring of the project was approved by the Board. The PDOs were not
changed. The reasons for the restructuringwas to permit additional important and badly-needed
investmentsto be included for financing under the project, which would contribute fixher to the
PDOs whle also using substantial project cost savings that had built up. The restructuring
introduced a more flexible approach which allowed EVN and the PCs to include (and drop)
subprojects in response to their investment priorities. A more generic project description was
adopted, and appraisal criteria agreed for the subprojects, including their contributionto the PDO,
technical, economic and financial efficiency, and compliance with the World Bank's safeguards
policies.

Three subcomponents under the Transmission and Distribution Component were modified and a
further 28 subprojects were proposed for financing with a total cost of $160.6 million, of which
$88.3 million was proposed to be financed by IDA. In the event 20 subprojects were financed,
with a total cost of $96.30 million, of which $48.70 million was from IDA. The subcomponents
modified are detailed in Table1.

To reflect the changes in the project, the results framework was also modified in May 2005, and
aligned with monitoring indicators collected by EVN.

 1.7     OtherSignificant Changes

 Changesin Timing

 The project was originally scheduled to become effective in March 1998 and close in June 2002.
 The project was extended a total of five times asfollows:

         June 2002         To December 31,2003
         May 2003          To December 31,2004
         December2004 To June30,2005
         June 2005         To December31,2006
         December2006       Partial, to June 30,2007

 Extensions to the closing date of the Credit agreed in June 2002 and in May 2003 were primarily
 targeted at allowing the completionof the Pleiku to Phu Lam TL and Nha Be to Tao Dan TL and
 Tao Dan SS subcomponents following a slow start and slow implementation. The third was to
 allow completion of project restructuring. The fourth extension was given at the time of
 restructuring in May 2005 to give time to implement the subprojects that were introduced into
 the project. The fifth was to permit completion of those contracts which had been delayed or
 rebid ka result of materialsprice increases that occurred duringthe second half of 2006.

 Covenants

 At negotiations, the project covenanted a scheduleof increases to bring the averageretail tariff to
 7 US cents1kWh by March 1, 2001. This had become contentious even before the start of
 implementation and was to be the subject of discussion on several occasions during the lifetime
 of the project, without reaching substantive agreement between IDA and GoV. In consequence,
 the tariff covenant was replaced by a covenants for EVN to maintain three key ratios: self
 financing ratio (SFR), of 25 percent or better; debt service coverage ratio (DSCR), of 1.5 times
-or more; and debt: equity ratio of no more than 70:30. The same covenants were applied to all
 projectsin the IDA portfolio providingfinance to EVN.

 Cancellation

 After the restructuring, EVN and the PCs were unable to bring forward sufficient subprojects to
 allow the full balance of the credit amount to be committed and disbursed before the revised
 closing date of December 31, 2006. Thus on June 30, 2006, IDA cancelled Special Drawing
 Rights (SDR) 27 million, (equivalentto about $40 million) from the credit.

 As of December 13, 2007, the actual amount disbursed from the credit was SDR106 million.
 SDR 11.4 million or about $17 million was thus left unused, mainly accounted for by savings on
 the estimated costs of subprojectsimplementedfollowing the May 2005 restructuringbut also by
 the significant depreciationin the dollar against the SDR in the latter stages of the project.

2.      Key Factors Affecting Implementationand Outcomes

2.1     Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

Project design was straightforward, with one subcomponent per investment subproject. Swedish
International Development Agency (SIDA) was the co-financier for two subcomponents, the
500kV Ha Tinh substation extension and the DSM component but this did not present a
substantial complicationin the project.

The project was underpinned by a major piece of analytical work which was being undertaken
simultaneously1. The analysis identified the potential for transmission and distribution system
investments to contribute to electricity system growth and efficiency, and the importance of
effective policy and regulation. Other studies supported project design. A significant piece of
sector work to support the preparation of an electricity law was also started during preparation.
Comprehensive feasibility studies were carried out by international consultants fc~rthe major
investments at 500 and 220kV.

There were multiple dimensions to the PDOs. Taken together these dimensions supported the
CAS objective of providing investment support to the power sector and hence the GoV's
objective of investment in basic infrastructure as well as helping to increase private sector
participation. The parts relating to reform were broad and ambitious and had some:linkages to
activities outside the project, such as the preparation of the electricity law. Nonetheless the
PDOs areconsidered appropriate and were achievable.

Appraisal appears to have relied on cost estimates based on previous procurement of 500kV and
220kV equipment in Vietnam. These had taken place some years before, and had been based on
negotiated prices and thus were higher than could be expected from competitive bidding. In
addition, high levels of contingencies were included,because of strong institutional and personal
incentivesto avoid project costs over-runningestimates.

At appraisal risks to the development objective namely: timely availability of counterpartsfunds,
implementing agencies' management commitment, Government commitment to sector reform
were identified and assessed as moderate. Risks to implementation progress: lack of resources
for land acquisition; slow procurement; and delays in appointing consultants, were well
identified but their impact - in terms of the length of delays possible - was, with hindsight,
somewhat optimistic. Appraisal was based on load forecasts known at the time, but with local
demand growth rates sometimes exceeding the national average by a substantial margin, the risk
of underestimating or overestimating demand growth was not assessed. The re-evaluation of
risks at project restructuring downgraded several, but identified new ones, including subprojects
not being identified or appraised in a timely fashion and insufficient attention to safeguards and
again may have been over optimistic.




1  Later published as 'Fueling Vietnam's Development- New Challenges for the Energy Sector, Report No. 19037
   VN' in December 1998.

A weakness in the project design was how it dealt with raising retail tariffs. Staged rises in the
average retail were covenanted on EVN, yet it was unable to influence tariff rises directly, since
any increase was subject to government approval. Its value as a means of ensuring adequate
financial performance by EVN was also questionable. The Government's commitment to raising
tariffs was not explicitly identified as a risk to the PDO or to implementation progress, unless
inferred as part of 'waning of Government commitment to push with reforms and of EVN
commitment to institutional strengthening programs'which was rated moderate.

There was a Quality Assessment Group (QAG) review at entry but there are no records of its
findings on the project files.

2.2     Implementation

Design for initial implementation was straightforward, wifh each subcomponent to be carried out
by identified implementing agencies. The technically more complex subcomponents were
planned to be supported by international consultants to prepare feasibility studies, support
procurement and supervise implementation. Ministry of Industry and EVN were the main
agencies involved in the technical assistance activities. They and HCMC PC had some
experience of Bank procedures, including procurement and disbursement, gained through
previous projects. Mo1 had been engaged with the Bank on policy dialogue for a number of
years. No fiduciaryor safeguardsissues were new to the project.

Tariffs

The level and the timing of tariff increases were discussed extensivelyduring project preparation
and were supported by a study carried out by international consultants. Shortly after the project
was approved by the World Bank's Board of Directors in January 1998, GoV seems to have had
misgivings about committing itself to the level of 7 centskWh by December 31,1999 and thus
the signing of the project documentswasdelayed.

A fhther round of negotiations resulting in agreement of staged increases such that the tariff
would reach 7 cents/kWh by March 1, 2001. This schedule was reflected in the Development
Credit Agreement signed in November 1998. During project implementationthere were at least
two slippages in the schedule: in May 1999, the tariff of 7 centskWh was expected to be
reached by 2002; and in June 2001 only by July 1, 2005. Reflecting tariff concerns, the DO
progress indicator was downgraded to unsatisfactoryon three occasions.

In VND terms, average tariffs did rise over the project period from VND 680kWh in 1998 to
VND 842/kWh from January 1, 2007. In dollar terms it stood still: at the exchange rate
prevailing in mid 1998 the tariff was 5.24 cents and at the exchange rate in mid 2007, it was 5.22
centskWh. Although EVN is in some respects financially more exposed today than it was in
1997, in 2005, the last year for which a full analysis has been completed, it maintained its three
key performance indicatorsof SFR, DSCR and debt:equity ratio at covenantedlevels.

Slow Implementation Progress

Implementation of the original subcomponents started slowly, delayed by late signing and
effectiveness, since final approvals to subproject technical designs were not giver1 until then.
There was also a delay because of uncertainties within government about the timing of the
second circuit for the Pleiku - Phu Lam 500kV line. When under way, progress was slow but
without major difficulties. There were delays in hiring the consultants to suppoirt EVN and
HCMC PC on the Pleiku to Phu Lam TL and the Nha Be to Tao Dan TL and Tao Dan SS. There
were significant delaysin procurement.

Cost Savings

The original subcomponentswere acheved at substantiallylower cost than identifiedat appraisal,
not whollyas a result of the East Asian financial crisis. As early as August 2001, GoV requested
IDA to use the cost savings, implicitly about $20 million. Estimates of saving rose by stages
from then until, by December 2004, they were estimated at $87.5 million, or about 44 percent of
the original credit amount. A workshop in early 2004 was held to review progress and to
identify subprojects that could be included in a restructured project. This workshop identified a
substantial number of subprojects, including those requested by SBV in 2001 that wire at a
sufficiently advanced state of preparation to be included in the project. The amendment took a
further year to finalize.

Other Issues in Implementation

The May 2005 restructuringmade the EVN/IDAprocess easier to manage with the rninimum of
formalities, but EVN and the PCs remained exposed to the complex and extended GoV
approvals process for each subproject. To prepare the restructuring on the Vietrlarnese side
required approval of the Prime Minister, and subprojects still required a process of feasibility
study, detailed design and preparation of procurement documents which required separate,
sequential approvals. The approval of the restructuring by GoV delegated approvals for EVN
subprojectsto MoI and for PCs' subprojectsto EVN while all procurement could be approved by
EVN. This was a significant improvementcompared with project preparation when ,approvalby
the Prime Minister was required at several stages.

Towards the end of project implementation,a sharp increase in the prices of several clommodities
including aluminum, copper, nickel, steel and zinc further slowed procurement. .A11 are key
constituents of electrical systems equipment and as a result a number of procureme~ntpackages
had to be rebid. It was the result of this rebidding that the final extension from December 31,
2006 to June 30, 2006 was granted. Price adjustment formulae were not adopted in the project,
because it was considered incompatible with the procurement law in Vietnam which only
permits deviations from it if a donor's procurement guidelines require it; price adjustment
formulaeare not mandated in the Bank's procurement guidelines.

There appears to have been a QAG assessment of supervision but there are no records of its
findingson the project files.

2.3     Monitoringand Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

M&E Design

The indicators for measuring the PDOs were of reasonable quality. Those related to the
investment components were specific, measurable and relied on EVN's and the PCs' own
performancemonitoring system. Thoselinked to the sector reform and institutional development
of EVN could have been more rigorous. The emergency recovery component was not included
in the project logical framework and no indicators for its objective appear to have been
developed.

The restructuring of the project in May 2005 introduced some additional indicators and revisited
the original ones. M&E for the physical investment was aligned with the data collected by EVN
for its own internal monitoring purposes and is considered reliable and sustainable. Indicators
introduced during the restructuring are less easily attributed to the project. There was also some
lack of clarityon which of the originalindicators was retained at the restructuring.

The financial performance of EVN and the PCs was designed to be monitored on a consistent
basis for each project in the portfolio. An International Creditors' Model (ICM) was developed
under a separate project initially to verify appropriate tariff levels and subsequently used to
ensure the key financial indicators wereconsistentlycalculated.

Implementing agencies were also required to hire independent monitoring consultants, on terms
of reference satisfactory to the Bank for monitoring of implementation of environment
assessments and environment management plans (EAEMPs) and resettlement plans W s ) . The
independent consultants' reports were sent to the Bank for review.

M&E Implementation

Implementation progress data were captured quarterly. Data on outcomes were collected as the
subprojects were completed. Data for all indicators were collected as part of the implementation
completion reporting process. Financial indicators were monitored as an annual exercise for all
projectsin the portfolio.

Data quality for the investment subcomponentshas generally been acceptable. Methods for data
collection have generallybeen appropriate, using a 'bottom up' reporting process which is linked
to the management hierarchy in EVN and the PCs. Independent monitoring of EMPs has
provided data of mixed quality with the main difficulty being insufficient field-based monitoring
using appropriatetechniques.

M&E Utilization

Implementationdata were used to review progress of the project against agreed timetables and to
revise the timetables as necessary. Use of the outcome-level indicators has proved problematic,
because the indicators chosen are at system level and it is hard to distinguish impact of the
project fiom other non-project related factors. It has become increasingly difficult as the system

     has grown, and consequently the impact of any single subproject is less significant. Financial
I
I    monitoring data have been the basis for dialogue with EVN and the Government on a variety of
I
     issues including tariff levels, forecast future investment needs, and the impactsof equitization2.

     2.4     Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

     Environment

     An EA/EMP was carried out for the second circuit of the Pleiku to Phu Lam 500kV itransmission
     line. It is not clear what level of environment assessment was carried out for the remaining
     subprojects. Subprojects that were appraised following the restructuring in May 2005 followed
     agreed guidelinesfor the preparationof environment assessments.

     In general the impacts of transmission and distribution lines and substations on the environment
     were of a mainly temporary nature associated with construction and included noise, dust,
     disruption to traffic, excavation operations and the need to accommodate workers. Permanent
     effects were mainly confined to the right of way of the line, which must be kept cllear of high-
     growing plants and trees. Alignments of lines and siting of substations were chosen to minimize
     the combined environment and social impacts.

     Supervision of the implementation of environment management plans (EMPs) by independent
     monitoringconsultantsand Bank staff revealed no major issues.

     Indigenous Peoples

     The project appraisal document noted that a few ethnic minority households wouldl be affected
     by the Pleiku to Phu Lam TL but "because of the relatively minor nature of the impact, no
     separate Indigenous People's Development Plan is considered necessary." The EIA alsoincluded                         .

     sections that constituted a full ethnic minorities development plan (EMDP). EMLDPs do not
     appear to have been prepared for the other original subprojects.

     Followingthe restructuringin May 2005, EMDPs were required based on a framework that was
     agreed with the GoV and adopted by EVN. EMDPs were prepared for 3 subprojects,affectinga
     total of 1445 ethnic minorities households,mainly on a single 11OkV TL from LangSon to Cao
     Bang in the north of the country. All EMDPs have been satisfactorily implemented.

     Resettlement

     Just over 2,000 households were identified at appraisal as being affected by the various
     subprojects, of which about 530 needed to be relocated, based on a resettlement Plan (RP) that
     was an integral part of the EIA. Most of the affected households and nearly all the relocations
     were linked to the Pleiku to Phu Lam TL. In the event, nearly 9,000 households were affected
     by the line, the large discrepancybeing the result of under-estimationat appraisal.



     2  Equitizationis the process of creation of a joint stock company and sale of a proportion of shares to the public
        and employees.

  Following the restructuringin May 2005, a framework for resettlementplanning was agreed with
  the Government of Vietnam and adopted by EVN and applied to all additional subprojects.
  Subsequent subprojects affected around 8,700 households, the majority in a minor way. In most
  cases appraisal estimates of numbers of households affected, land acquisition and compensation
  were close to the actual values on implementation.

  Resettlement was on the whole well implemented by the responsible agencies. Most households
  that were relocated were allowed to remain in their old houses until the new ones were ready,
  and all were moved as short a distance as possible, resulting in minimal disruption to livelihoods.
  No grievances or complaints were brought to the attention of Bank staff during implementation
  which included independent site visits. Independent monitoring of the RPs revealed no major
  issues.

  Procurement

  Procurement was effectively organized; at the start of the project a procurement management
  group involving the Ministry of Industry and EVN was used to support EVN's executing
  agencies and the PCs in the early stages when they were not familiar with some of the in the
  more complex procurement processes. Procurement progressed slowly, especially with the large
  packages at the start of the project, which required multiple levels of approval up to the Prime
  Minister. There were four complaints during procurement of which two were dropped by the
  complainant, one was invalidated and one resulted in rebidding. There were no instances of
  procurement irregularities.

  Financial Management

  Financial management was generally satisfactory though there were two recurrent issues during
 the project. One was late submission of financial management reports (FMRs)and audit reports.
 Towards the end of the project reporting improved but there were still instances of late
- submission by the PCs and by EVN itself. Audits were satisfactory throughout the project and
 continuing entity financial statements were generally unqualified.

 The second recurrent issue was slow processing of disbursement requests within the Vietnamese
  system and delays in payments. Under Ministry of Finance rules, all ODA projects must have a
 controller which, amongst other things, checks disbursement requests made by implementing
 agencies. For this project, the controller was the Vietnam Development Bank (VDB, formerly
  the Development Assistance Fund). Some VDB branches' checking was excessive,requiringfor
 example all contracts (including standard parts) to be translated into Vietnamese and notarized.
 The effect was for the implementing agencies, which for the most part had to pay their suppliers
 before the checking was complete, to have to wait long periods for reimbursement by IDA; in
  late 2006 it was estimated that implementing agencies were waiting for VDB to release $25
 million in payments for goods financed under the project. In some cases this had a noticeable
 effect on financial performance of the PCs since they had built up significant levels of
 receivables.

2.5     Post-completion OperationINextPhase

Each investment subcomponent or subproject was implemented by a Project Management Board
(PMB), which is a special purpose, permanent entity within the overall management:structure of
EVN or the participating Power Companies. On completion of commissioning the subproject
was handed over to the operations department of the implementing agency. Each of the
subprojects formed part of the investment plan of the implementing agency, which is also the
project's ultimateowner.

Each transmission project has been handed over fiom the PMB to one of four .transmission
companies which together operate all the transmission assets in the EVN. They are now cost
centers of EVN and thus staffing, operations and maintenance are the responsibilityof EVN, the
asset owners. EVN recovers its costs from electricityconsumers and thus has adequateresources
to ensure proper operation and maintenanceof the entities. By the end of 2007 transmissionwill
be merged into a single, national transmission company as part of the reforms to the power
market. It will be under separate ownership and will have a regulated tariff structure that will
ensure cost recoveryand permit future investment.

Power Companies are currently wholly-ownedsubsidiaries of the EVN group and as such profit
centers in their own right. The tariff regime now in place ensures that they recover costs and
have sufficient retained income for future investment. Policies and standards are !m place that
ensuresadequate maintenance.

Both EVN and the PCs maintain a reporting system to monitor system performance;(the project
M&E indicators are drawn fiom these) though these are not systematic or widespread enough to
develop benchmarks or comparative performance by area, supply level or consumer type. As
part of the market reforms, the Electricity Regulatory Authority of Vietnam (ERA'V) will have
oversight of the performance of all entities in the power sector and will require reports to enable
it to monitor system performance. The most relevant indicators remain transmission and
distribution system reliability and efficiency, in aggregate covering faults, losses; and power
flows. More detailed indicators, which can help prioritize investments, would look at these at
specified poinfs (for reliability and efficiency) and parts of the system (for efficiency). These
indicatorswill be accessibleto the Bank for future monitoring.

Further operations supporting the efficient development of the transmission and distribution
system are under way (System Efficiency Improvement, Equitization and Renewables Project,
Cr. 3680 VN and Second Transmission and Distribution Project, Cr. 4107 VN). The system is
forecast to continue to grow at 15 percent per year, and neither transmission nor diistributionis
likely to enter private ownership in Vietnam for some years to come. Sustainedl ZDNIBRD
involvement and investment financing to ensure efficient development of the transmission and
distribution systems is expected to remain a priority for GoV and EVN. The Bank, through a
stand-alone Global Environment Facility (GEF) project has continued to support DSM (Demand
Side Management and Energy Efficiency, GEF TF 051256), and the GoV is now preparing an
energy efficiency law now that reforms are more advanced.

3.      Assessmentof Outcomes

3.1     Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
(to current country and global priorities,and Bankassistance strategy)

The need for physical infiastructure is still as strong; demand has continued to grow much as
predicted at appraisal, at an average of about 15 percent per year. Investment in basic power
infiastructureis a priorityof the government'sSocio-EconomicDevelopment Plan for 2006-2010.'
The current Country Partnership Strategy (CPS, reviewed by the World Bank's Board of
Executive Directors on January 3, 2007) reflects this priority; one of its objectives is to ensure
efficient and reliable provision of infiastructureservices. The investment-related PDOs remain
highly relevant.

The reform objective remains relevant. Reform is a process, not a single action and the project
set out the broad direction of power sector reform, which is still being pursued today and
initiated many of the essential tasks. The objectives the project espoused were over-ambitious
and so the project aimed too far into the future, hence many of the tasks it had hoped to
accomplish by1999or 2000 were not completed until 2004 or later.

The institutional development objectives were relevant at the time of the project but are less so
now, because pushed by the project, much has been decentralized, giving greater autonomy and
broadening ownership by implementing agencies. The objective for the disaster reconstruction
component was highly relevant at the time of preparation and implementation but following
normalization is no longer so.

3.2     Achievementof Project DevelopmentObjectives

The project substantiallymet its PDOs and is rated satisfactory in this dimension:

        StrenHhen the hi& voltage transmission network. Achievement of this objective is
        satisfactory. There have been gains in transmission reliability and efficiency, and larger
        power flows are taking place between the central and southern areas of Vietnam.
        Additional subprojects have further contributed to this objective beyond that which was
        originally envisaged.
        Rehabilitate and expand distribution systems.         Achievement of this objective is
        satisfactory.  Distribution systems have reduced losses and improved reliability.
        Anecdotal evidence points to substantial improvementin the quality of supply during the
        project. Additional subprojects have further contributed to this objective beyond that
        which was originallyenvisaged.
        Support power sector reforms. Achievement of this objective is moderately satisfactory.
        With the exception of the tariff revision to 7 centsIkWh,all the indicators were achieved,
        though they were significantly delayed from the original timetable. A more rapid
        implementation may not have been realistic or desirable. Tariffs have increased by 25%
        in VND terms, about the same amount as originally envisaged in dollar terms

        Support institutional strengthening and commercialization.                      Achievement of this
        objective is satisfactory. The PCs, at which this component was largely (aimed,have
        become increasingly commercially and manageriallyindependent throughout the lifetime
        of the project. Accounting systems have been continuously improved. The ongoing
        follow-onDSM project bears out the achievement of the DSM objective.
        Normalization of economic activity following Typhoon Linda. Achievement of this
                                                               - .

        objective is satisfactory. The component was completed under difficult circumstances
        and in reasonable time. No indicators are available to assess 'before' and 'after' the
        Typhoon, however the outputs indicate oee-for-one replacement of MV and LV systems
        and equipment and thus it may be inferred that at least a similar standard of service was
        being providedfollowing completion of the component.

3.3     Efficiency

The economic analysis for the project components at appraisal and at completion has been
carried out using two scenarios: (i) with the project; and (ii) without the project. The ex ante
'with' project scenario assumed that the project as described was carried out based on forecast
costs. For investments at 500kV, the 'without' project alternative was to strengthen the 220kV
system. For investments at 220kV and below, the 'without' project analysis assumed that no
investment would be made. The ex post 'with' project scenario used actual investrrlent costs of
the project. The 'without' project scenario assumed that no investment had been made. The
same methodology was used for both the original and the new subprojects. A.ll costs are
presented in constant 1995 US dollars, to allow comparison. The analysis covers about 88
percent of final project baseline costs, the main items being excluded being the consultant
services for physical investments, technical assistance and the rehabilitation of distribution
networks in Ha Long and Vinh.

The key economic and financial indicators of the first and second phases of the project are
summarizedin Table 2 and provided for each subprojectin Annex 3.




      p At 1995 price levels
       Not inclided in PAD analysis
     Note: Appraisal of additional subprojects was done on a subproject-by-subprojectbasis. No overall
     analysisof the economic and financialbenefits of the set of additional subprojects was undertakenex
      ante.

At appraisal the costs of the original subprojects were over-estimated. The completion analysis
takes into account the cost savings - of the order of 30 percent of the original estimates - and
shows a much higher rate of return than at appraisal. The net present value of the original
subprojects, however, is not as high, principally because of the delays in completion which in
some cases were four years longer than the original implementationschedule. During those four
years the benefits were reduced by more than could be made up fkom the reduced costs. There
may also have been a wider economic impact of overestimating costs since the size of the credit
tied up some IDA allocation that may, perhaps, have been used for some other investment.

The impact at the financiallevel is less marked, because the financialrevenuesare lower than the
economic benefits. Notwithstanding the reduced benefits because of delays, the subprojects
were still financially efficient, except possibly the renovation of Halong and Vinh distribution
systems for which information is not available.

3.4    Justificationof OverallOutcomeRating

Rating: Satisfactory.

The overall satisfactory rating for the project is justified on three grounds. The first is that the
project maintainedits relevance throughout its (long) lifetime, particularlythe investment aspects,
which are responsible for the bulk of the project costs, but also the reform objectives. The
second is that four of the five project development objectives were satisfactorily and one
moderately satisfactorily achieved.      In some respects the project achieved more than its
objectives in terms of physical investment, by the inclusion of an additional 20 subprojects. The
third reason is that the project was more economically efficient than expected at appraisal,
notwithstandingthe delays to implementation and the reduction in benefits, which was offset by
use of cost savings for the additional subprojectswhich were also economicallyefficient.

There were modest shortcomings in the achievement of the objective: slow implementation
reduced the potential benefits of the project. Arguably some of the institutional development
objectives such as separation of transmission from generation could have been more fully
achieved- there are degreesof separation- but as these are difficult to quantifl.

No beneficiarysurvey has been carried out.

4.      Assessmentof Risk to DevelopmentOutcome

Rating: Moderate.

The physical investment aspects of the project are not inherently risky in technical, economic,
financialor institutional terms. For the foreseeable future, Vietnam will continue to (dependon a
power transmission and distribution network, and, the investments will continue to fulfill an
important role. The transmission company, when it is formed and the Power Companies will be
regulated by ERAV, with appropriate transmission and distribution tariff methodologies to
ensure long term sustained operation of the assets. Experience has shown that the environment
and social impacts of transmission and distribution construction are broadly accepted as a price
worth paying for the benefits, even by those who are most immediately affected. The physical
investments are exposed to some risk of natural disasters, even though design standards
incorporatethe extreme weatherconditions frequentlyexperienced in EVN.

The reforms that the project championed do not appear to be at risk. Much of the more recent
developments in power sector reform are set on the foundations laid by the project, includingthe
development of the Electricity Law in 2004 and the roadrnap for reform in 2006. So far, the
steady implementation of the law over the past three years, and the political and institutional
stability in Vietnam gives confidence that the institutional development and market reform will
continuein a positive direction.

5.      Assessmentof Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1     Bank Performance

(a)     Bank Performance in Ensuring Qualityat Entry

Rating: Moderately satisfactory.

The project responded to identifiedCAS objectives and the Government's plans for investment in
basic infrastructure. The project was in line with the Bank's strategy for the poweir sector and
was coordinated with other donors, in particular Sweden, which cofinanced the project. From a
technical point of view, the investment projects were well prepared. The range of policy and
institutional development activitieswere appropriate for the time; indeed this project set the tone
for a broad ranging policy dialogue with government and EVN that continues today. The Bank
was highly responsive to the needs for reconstruction of the southern area and the reconstruction
subcomponent was prepared in a short time.

It seems unlikely that a more flexible project design - which could have included a mechanism
to use project cost savings through the addition of firthersubprojectsor by financing more of the
ones under implementation    -  would have been acceptable to the Government. Concepts for
flexible designs were new and untested, and neither the Government nor the Bank side had much
incentive to introduce such a complication for what appeared to be quite a straightfonvard
operation. For similar reasons, it would probably not have been possible for the project to have

been further advanced during preparation, with the result that upon approval, a time-consuming
two step process was needed to implement the major investment componentsof the project. First,
consultants to support the project had to be hired and only then could work start on implementing
the projects.

The shortcomingin Bank performanceduring preparation was the handling of the tariff issue. It
is questionable that a tariff level as high as 7 cents/kWh was appropriate and the risks to the rest
of the project of trying to introduce it were poorly assessed. In addition any breach of the
covenant permitted only two basic options: either to waive it or to suspend the project. The task
team was thus left without leverage to persuade the Government to take action, leaving EVN
stuck in the middle.

(b)     Quality of Supervision

Rating: Unsatisfactory.

Several of the subcomponents were well supported during implementation, particularly those
dealing with reform and restructuring, demand side management, the relatively simple
investmentsin rehabilitationof the cities' distribution network and the rehabilitationof typhoon-
affected areas. Financial supervision of the project was satisfactory, but the tariff issue was not
fully resolved. Although slow in implementation, the two major investment subprojects were
well-supported and most of the delay appears to have been on the side of the Government,
becauseof the extensive approvals system.

The shortcomings in the Bank's supervision were its lack of candor in reporting implementation
progress, and slowness in addressing the issue of cost savings and how the project could be
adapted to cope with them. By the time the first extension was processed, in June 2002, the
project was six months from its original closing date and only 13 percent disbursed. It is
understandable that the Government and the Bank were reluctant to contemplate the possibility
of 'losing' the savings through cancellation. In addition the extent of the savings only emerged
slowly and in the early stages a full-scale restructuring may not have seemed worthwhile given
the comparatively small amount of savings and the possibility of cost overruns in the larger
subprojects. Nonetheless greater proactivity could have been possible.

The opportunity was thus missed for an early, systematic and substantial review of project
performance beyond normal supervision reporting. Amore proactive stance by the Bank, with
the possibility of a major restructuring and substantial extension  -  of as much as four years,
effectively treating i tas a new project  - could have created an environment more conducive to
smooth project implementationand offered better chances of full use of the credit amount and a
shorter project implementationperiod. As it was, the restructuringin May 2005 was worthwhile,
but arguably too late to have the full impactit might have had.

   (c)     Justification of Rating for OverallBank Performance

   Rating: Moderatelyunsatisfactory.

   The moderately satisfactory Bank performance during preparation balanced against the
   unsatisfactory performance during supervision but satisfactory overall outcome suggests an
   overall rating of moderately unsatisfactory.

   5.2     Borrower Performance

   (a)     Government Performance

   Rating: Moderatelysatisfactory.

   The Government cooperated closely with the Bank during preparation, and there was significant
   policy dialogue as a result, which was carried on subsequently throughout the project. That
   dialogue has formed a solid foundationfor subsequent engagement in the sector. In elddition,the
   Government has, during the course of the project, tackled issues of excessive centralization and
   control, and showed it willing to adopt more flexible approaches to project implementation,
   including delegation of investment decisions and day to day investment management to EVN
   and the PCs, acceptanceof the phased approach to project implementation

   The main weaknessconcerns the reforms to the retail tariff. While it seems quite lkely that the
   increases were too steep and aimed at a higher level than necessary, a more open dialogue than
   took place with the Bank was warranted. If the Government did have reservations about the
   ultimate intention of reaching 7 centsIkWh,it does not seem to have been expressed to the Bank
   clearly. The Government relied communicating the results of wide consultation within the
   Government, based on proposals by EVN rather than a more transparent process to agree the
   basis on which tariffs should be set.


   (b)     ImplementingAgency or Agencies Performance

   Rating: Satisfactory.

  Strong commitment and action within the implementing agencies enabled the subprojects and
  components to be completed. From a technical standpoint, the projects have been well
= implemented, with thorough consultation, proper preparation and implementationof engineering,
   environment and resettlement plans, good fiduciary control and smooth transition to operating
   mode. There was a high degree of ownership of the project. Over the lifetime of the project
   there has been a noticeable improvement in the professionalism and quality of the work
   undertaken by the implementing agencies.

(c)     Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

Rating: Satisfactory.

The weighting applied to the implementing agencies - and recognizing the substantial
improvements in both Government and implementing agencies' performance over the lifetime of
the project suggestsan overall ratingof satisfactory.

6.      Lessons Learned

The lessons from project design are:

The tariff issue. While it is important to ensure that pricing is set at proper levels, the approach
of agreeing a targeted level of tariffs and a schedule by which they are achieved does not appear
to have been successhl. Apart from the possibilities that the level and timing may be set
incorrectly or that circumstances might change, ensuring that they are implemented as agreed is
difficult. It may be better to avoid tariff covenants altogether and only look at financial
performance, since this then opens up the range of options including to cut costs. Better still
might be the introduction of an agreed tariff methodology which removes the political dimension
to tariff setting; in practice this is the basis on which utility regulators often agree tariffs. If
financial performance targets are used, however, they must still be backed by covenants, and
again they should not be of the 'all or nothing' kind implied by suspension.

Smarter covenants. The adoption of covenants- at least as they were formulated in the project
legal agreements - presents difficulties because of the extreme nature of the remedy that is
applied. More nuanced covenants, for example by applying interest rate or grace period
penalties for the time that the covenant is breached, may be more effective at sustaining the
dialogue while providinga clear incentive for action.

The lessons from implementationare:

Better cost estimates and demand forecasts. The cost estimates used at appraisal were evidently
flawed, and, notwithstanding the price decreases resulting from the East Asian financial crisis,
could have been developed using more up to date information and a more realistic basis.
Demand forecasts,which affect the sizing of equipment (and thus the cost estimates),are risky in
a system that is growing as rapidlyas Vietnam's.

Delay in taking action had high costs. The second lesson is that early and decisive action to deal
with slow project implementation and costs savings are essential. Failing to do so sends mixed
signals to the Borrower (and to some extent within the Bank itself) and threatens the project's
value. Putting off action, however hard the choices that it may present are, benefits no-one.
Incentivesto review and, where necessary, restructure have improved since the early days of this
project.

Pilots can be usehl low-risk market tests. A positive lesson is the way in which the piloting of
DSM was used to assess interest and capacity. This enabled it to be scaled up to a standalone
project later, thus reducing risks while learning important lessons about how best to design the
project. Several other aspects of the dialogue have also been developed into subcomponentsin
other projects, and this technique appears to work well in Vietnam.

Outputsfrom TechnicalAssistance

The technical assistance componentwas implemented by EVN and the outputs fiom this are as
follows:

ConsultantSupport for Pleiku-Phu Lam and Nha Be- Tao Dan. International conslultantswere
hired to support the technical design, preparation of bidding documents, procurement and
construction. ~&xultantoutputs included a system study, basicdesigns, procurement documents
and progress reports.

Transmission Operations Study. International consultants were hired by EVN to undertake a
study on how to improve the efficiency of transmission operations. There were fom-main tasks
undertaken: a review of the organizationstructure for management of the transmission business;
a more technical evaluation of the National Load Dispatch Center (NLDC) and their regional
counterparts to evaluate options to improve transmission operations; establish a timetablefor the
establishment of separate transmission operations; and to set out the commercial arrangements
between the proposed business units. The main outputs from the study were:

        A recommendation for a phased transition to a consolidated transmission business unit,
        consisting of the four transmission companies that then existed, and the NLDC. The
        formation of an independent regulator was also recommended.
        The formation of a primary control center to undertake the NLDC and regional load
        dispatch center (RLDC) functions.       It also recommended the introduction of a
        Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) and Energy Management System
        (EMS) and updating of short term planning software.
        An action plan, integratingthe recommendations of the consultant.
        Legal instruments to: consolidate the assets of the transmission units'and NLDC into a
       single business unit; establish corporatized distribution companies; and devolve power

         plants into separate generation companies transacting wholesale power business with
         distributioncompanies.

In many ways this report foreshadowed the subsequent dialogue which is still ongoing. EVN
plans to establish a separate, single transmission company by the end of 2007. The detailed
market design is under preparation now, and that will determine what other parts of the
electricity system are grouped with the transmission company (for example the NLDC and the
market system operator). The regulator is now active, having been created in October 2005. The
quality of these outputs is rated as satisfactory.

Technical Assistance for Demand Side Management. The activities consisted of three main
components: (i) a DSM program within EVN; (ii) development of energy-efficientlighting and
motor standards for Ministry of Science and Technology; and (iii) development of an energy-
efficient building code under Ministry of Construction. Outputs and ratings for each are
summarized below:

        EVN's DSM Promam. Under ths component, a DSM cell was established within EVN
        with five full-time staff, DSM working groups were created within each PC, a DSM
        policy framework was fully developed, five pilot lighting programs were developed and
        evaluated, about 30 energy audits were conducted, a pilot load research program was
        implemented in 150 customer premises and corresponding load profiles developed, a
        pilot time-of-use (TOU) metering program was launched and evaluated and a second
        phase investment program was prepared. One planned component, a pilot street lighting
        program, was cancelled due to the currency devaluation. This did not represent a major
        reduction in the overall project deliverables.
        MoST Standards. Minimum energy performance standards (MEPS) were developed for
        3-phase industrial motors, fluorescent tube lamps, ballasts, and incandescent light bulbs.
        Thesestandards were reviewed by a Technical Committee and MoST is now preparing to
        issue these standards. An Implementation Plan and Future Development Plan for further
        standards development and implementation of the MEPS was also prepared and
        submitted.
        MoC BuildinnCode. The rating of the achievement of deliverables for this component is
        satisfactory. Following an extensive building survey exercise covering Hanoi, HCMC
        and Danang, an energy-efficient building code was developed for high-rise office
        buildings and hotels.     The draft code was reviewed by a Technical Stakeholder
        Committee and MoC is now preparing to issue the code. An Implementation Plan was
        also developed and submitted under the project.

The quality of the project outputs were all rated as satisfactoiy. Each report was carefully
reviewed by the implementing agency (e.g., EVN, MoST, MoC), MoI and the Bank team and, in
most cases, detailed comments were provided. Those reports that included more technical
information or required consensus building, such as the various policy-related documents,
extensive consultations were required along with appropriate stakeholder workshops to ensure
that all views were considered and concerns addressed as much as possible. Those reports that
required broader consultationor public awareness were appropriately disseminated.

                              Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis



"  Economic Analysis

. The economic analysis for the project components at appraisal and at completion has been
   carried out using two scenarios: (i) with the project; and (ii) without the project. The ex ante
   'with' project scenario assumed that the project as described was carried out based on forecast
   costs. For investments at 500kV, the 'without' project alternative was to strengthen the 220kV
   system. For investments at 220kV and below, the 'without' project analysis assunned that no
   investment would be made. The ex post 'with' project scenario used actual investment costs of
   the project. The 'without' project scenario assumed that no investment had been made. The
   same methodologywas used for both the original and the new subprojects.

   Financial Analysis

   Financial analysis for the original subprojects with costs based on investment cost estimates,
   operations and maintenance costs of two percent of investment cost, cost of incremental energy
-  purchased at bulk purchase prices for each power company. Revenues were based on energy
   sales, after allowing for losses, at the averagesales prices for each power company.

   The values of the financial rate of return and NPV at 7 percent for each original subproject are as
   shown in Table A3.4 and for the additional subprojects in Table A3.5. The IRR aid NPV for
   each of the participating companies at completion and for the whole project at appraisal and
   completionare presented in Table A3.6.

At appraisal the costs of the original subprojects were over-estimated. The completion analysis
takes into account the cost savings    -  of the order of 30 percent of the original estimates - and
shows a much higher rate of return than at appraisal. The net present value of the original
subprojects, however, is not as high, principally because of the delays in completion which in
some cases were four years longer than the original implementation schedule. The impact at the
financial level is less marked, because the financial revenues are lower than the economic
benefits. Notwithstanding the reduced benefits because of delays, the subprojects were still
financially efficient, except possibly the renovation of Halong and Vinh distribution systems for
which information is not available.

The estimates at appraisal and completion for the disaster reconstruction component are quite
close. This may reflect both the short time between appraisal and implementation and the

relatively short period of implementation. The actual costs were somewhat lower thm appraised
but closer: this may be a consequence of the equipment purchased largely being MV and LV
distribution,of which PC2 had greater experienceand more recent price information.

The additional subprojects were overall less economically and financially attractive than the
original ones. This may be the consequenceof the basis for their selection- an advanced state of
preparation was an important criterion- but may also be an indicator that marginal investment in
transmission and distribution is less attractive in 2004 than in 1997. Notwithstanding that the
projects were economically and financially efficient

The project was financiallyworth while doing from the standpoint of each of the implementing
agencies, as shown in Table A3.6. Each of the agencies has achieved financial returns well
abovetheir cost of capital (for this kind of project, estimated to be 5.75%).

Assessmentof Outcome

1.      PhysicalInvestment

The transmissionand medium-voltagedistribution system, which is owned and operated by EVN,
has undergone substantial improvementin the past decade. Highlights include the construction in
1997 of a 500 kV North-South link, which has been strengthened by a second circuit and
additional substations. The overall outcome of the transmission and distribution component is
rated as satisfactory.Although having suffered much delay during preparationand bidding stages,
the contract implementationstage has gone at acceptable speed. The 1lOkV and 220 kV system
has been expanded and upgraded, particularly in major load centers, including cities and
provinces in regional areas. These improvements of the system under the project, combined with
rehabilitation of urban distribution networks, have reduced losses from 21.4 percent in 1995 to
11.78 percent in 2005. The improvements have also increased stability and permitted better
control of the system. The 110 kV system, the highest voltage level at which power distribution
takes place, has been expanded to meet growth in local power demand, particularly in urban
areas.

Commissioned transmission and distribution subcomponents have injected a remarkably
dependable output to EVN7spower network, has been signilicantlycontributingto strengthening
the high voltage transmission. The line also contributed to reduction of losses and improvement
of the system operation and control, thus improving the efficiency and sustainability of EVN's
power network.

The subcomponents are in line with EVN's Master Plan of 6th for the period 2006-2015 with
prospective to 2025 which emphasized the development of hydropower sources in parallel with
thermal power sources. After energizing the lines the intervals between blackouts became much
longer, and the load centers, especially big cities and provinces, have no longer suffered sudden
power shortages. Upgrading the system with new equipment installed replacing old ones
contributed improvement of quality and credibility of the power supply. Thanks to the 500kV
transmissionline subcomponent,North-Southexchange of power was facilitated. This possibility
was clearly seen in Summer of 2005, when the line transmitted a large output to the North and
helped to relieve the situation of power shortage there which was caused by severe droughts that
rendered the predominantlyhydro based generation system overloaded.

The projects were economically efficient and met environment and social safeguards
requirementsof the World Bank and of the GoV.

2.      Technical Assistance for the Project

With assistance of consultants, the System Study was recognized as helpful as those carried out
for the North-South 500kV Transmission Project. Moreover, it helped to consolidate the results
already obtained and, in the meantime, to find out the ways for designing of the new line in a
cost-effective manner. The consultant also carried out evaluation of bids and performed other
tasks.   Through cooperation with the foreign consultants, the knowledge and skills of
implementing agency's staff in engineering and management were improved considerably,
especially for projects at 500kV level. Through working with the consultants, the technical
design capacity of EVN staff for 500kV projects has improved and has subsequently allowed
local consultantsto undertake other projects at 500kV level.

In addition, with latest technology on gas-insulated switchgear for 220kV substations the
subproject is very helpful in terms of training skilled human resource for EVN. Some engineers
had the opportunity to participateoverseas training courses at leading GIs technologycompanies.
This has helped many of the staff improve their knowledge of GIs technology in particular and
the latest technology general during implementation and operation stage.

3.      Project Sustainability

With 500kV transmission as the back-bone in the national network, evacuation of power from
power plants in the central region via Pleiku substation and the North-South 500kV line and
transmitting it to the South, the line can meet the additional demand for power, with higher
quality of service. Since the high voltage sptem was expanded and upgraded, the quality of
power supply is much improved, contributed to reduction of losses and improvement of the
system operation and control, thus improving the eficiency and sustainabilityof ETJlV's power
network.

Most steel towers and all conductors for the line came from local manufacturers. This has meant
more jobs for people involving in manufacturing of such goods and improved the skills and
competence of local manufacturers. The substation extensions were equipped with up-to-date
equipment and technologies and expected to have a long service-life.

The project was prepared and implemented in accordance with Vietnamese Envin~nmentand
World Bank safeguard policies would help Vietnam in general and EVN in particular step by
step approach to the international practice and standard in terns of environmental sustainable
development. The compensation provided was acceptable to PAPS, ensuring that their living
after project completion would be better or at least equal to that before project comnencement.
Together with the distribution network rehabilitation, people in provinces obtaining access to
improved quality and availability of power in rural areas, which is a long-standing Government
commitment, and is seen as a source of national unity. The benefits of improvements in the
quality of the life of the local people are well understood, including increasing their income
through access to improvements in productivity. In addition, the quality of life improvements
have positive, but indirect, social benefits.

The government is committed to sector reform as evidenced by the passing of the Electricity
Law by the National Assembly at the end of 2004 and the start it has made in implementing its
provisions. It has given further evidence of its understanding of the need for meeting the
financing challenge by launching its equitization program and announcement of its plans to
equitize a number of other subsidiaries.

At the project level, the government has demonstrated commitment through its approvalsprocess.
With the project restructure in June 2005, each subproject has been identified by EVN as a
priority and EVN itself has demonstrated commitment to improved service quality and meeting
increasingdemand. Besides continued EVN commitment, the sustainability of the project relies
on continued growth in demand for power in Vietnam and matching the transmission system
growth with expansion of generation capacity. Demand growth appears robust, while the issue
of increasinggenerationcapacity is well understood at all levels of government and EVN.

PerformanceAssessment

1.      Bank Performance

The Bank performance of the project initial stages was recognized as satisfactory:         fiom
preparation of environmental impacts assessment, preparation of RFP for selection of
international consultant, bidding documents for goods, to the evaluation of bids. All work was
implemented with the Bank's comments being taken into account and the Bank's Guidelines
being followed.

The Bank's supervision performance was satisfactory. It is clear evidence that through
supervision missions and working visits, the work progress and matters arisen were monitored        J



and measures were recommended. Also, through the Bank's supervision, the implementing
agency could make necessary adjustment to develop a realistic work schedule. In order to
complete and fulfill the development objectives of the project, the Bank team has contributed
and played a very important role. With their strong support and close cooperation, project
implementation has been improved in terns of progressspeeding up and avoids longer delays.

2.      Borrower performance

The transmission and distribution subsector portfolio has generally performed well during the
past 10 years. Closed projects have met their objectivesand TD1 has been rated satisfactorywith
respect to their development objectives throughout its lifetime. Implementation progress for the
project is satisfactoryand has mostly been so during their lifetimes.

The good project implementationrecord reflects the increasingcapacity of the EVN subsidiaries.
Implementing agencies now manage subprojects throughout the investment cycle, from
identification through appraisal, procurement, implementation, and commissioning. International
consultant support and "turnkey" approaches are confined to deployment of newer technologies,
and they have become the exceptionrather than the rule.

      Transmission and distribution system must keep up with rapid growth and change in patterns of
      electricity demand. EVN has respo,nded to this by periodically reviewing and reassigning the
      priorities for individual sub-projects. The implementing agencies' improved capacity and greater
1  -
      responsivenessmake this possible.

1  -  Key Lessons Learned

      With very long period of the project implementation, covering sites along the counlry from the
      North to the South, and being one of the first IDA financed transmissionand distribu1:ionprojects
      of EVN, implementing agencies have faced many difficulties during project preplaration and
      implementation. Experience from the project suggests that close cooperation with local
      authorities and services, departments, and sections would be advantages for agencies during
      implementing stage and it was a critical reason determining the success of the project.

      With many subprojects with a large volume of works and goods procurement, it is i,mportantto
      ensure acceptable packaging and well prepared procurement plans. This would minimize delay
      in procurement processing. The supply of materials and equipment for overhead lines should be
      done by National Competitive Bidding and should be included in packages for founclations, pole
      erection and installation of overhead lines.

      It is very important to anticipate delay in approval stage of the project documents such as FIS,
      Technical Design and Cost Estimates in order to have a project implementation plan prepared
      precisely and realistically. Project implementation was often slower than the schedu.leset out in
      the feasibility study; the major reason being that changes to the project and direction of
      undergroundcables and overhead lines was very common.

      Specific responsibilities of consultant have to be agreed clearly during negotiation arid preparing
      the contract. For example, the consultants have to take full responsibility for the entire process
      including design, agreement of intersection between transmission lines and underground works
      construction, waterway and road construction; preparing bidding documents, evaluation,
      negotiation and contract signing; review and approval for technical documents, supervision and
      checking before acceptance stage. The performance of contracts for consulting services must be
      controlledclosely to avoid expenses rising above the signed and approved total contriict value.

      All of the high and medium voltage equipment, control, and measurement and protection
      systems of GIs substationshould be designed simultaneously.
