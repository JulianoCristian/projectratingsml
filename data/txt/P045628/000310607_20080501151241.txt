F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
(a) Strengthen the high voltage transmission network to facilitate evacuation of power
from generating stations to the load centers;
  (b) Rehabilitate and expand distribution systems to meet demand, reduce losses and
improve reliability;
  (c) Support sector reform and restructuring through: (i) unbundling "transmission" and
"generation" functions; (ii) the implementation of regulatory reforms; (iii) the
introduction of tariff reforms; and (iv) exploring financing of distribution from
diversified sources.
  (d) Support institutional strengthening and commercialization through: (i) securing
greater autonomy for the distribution companies; and (ii) introducing planning
capabilities for Demand Side Management.

1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design
(this section is descriptive, taken from other documents, e.g., PAD/ISR, not evaluative)

1.1 Context at Appraisal
(brief summary of country and sector background, rationale for Bank assistance)

Ten years after the watershed doi moi restructuring of the economy, Vietnam's progress
was tangible: in 1997 GDP stood at $24 billion and had grown at 8.2 percent per year for
the past five years; annual per capita GNI was around $300. Poverty had been reduced
from 58 percent to 37 percent. In 1995 ­ 1997, investment had run at about 24 percent of
GDP, of which foreign direct investment made up ten percent. Though the Asian
financial crisis was to break later in 1998, the project was prepared against a backdrop of
solid macroeconomic growth.

The energy sector mirrored the macroeconomic picture. On average each person used
quite small amounts of energy but rising demand for energy was forecast on the back of
strong industrial sector growth, which had consistently outpaced GDP, and reached 13
percent in 1997. Demand for electricity was forecast to grow about 70 percent faster than
GDP from 1997 to 2010.

The main issues facing the electricity sector were:

    (a) Need for investment. Large sector investments, estimated to cost around $6
    billion, were predicted for the period 1997 ­ 2002. The Government of Vietnam
    (GoV) planned a twin-track approach of increasing electricity tariffs and attracting
    foreign investment including the private sector.
    (b) Inadequate and inefficient electricity infrastructure.    Seasonal and locational
    differences in generation and demand indicated the need to strengthen the north-south
    extra high voltage transmission system while distribution losses in the range of 15 ­
    30 percent pointed to the need for extensive rehabilitation, to reduce the need for
    additional investment in generation.
    (c) Impediments to commercial operation.            Although the power sector was
    consolidated under Electricity of Vietnam (EVN) in 1995, commercialized operation
    was hindered by the need to unbundle the generation, transmission and distribution
    functions and encourage diversified participation.
    (d) Inadequate regulatory regime.       Government functioned as policy maker and
    regulator while also being involved in operational decisions that would have been
    better devolved to EVN.
    (e) Need to improve demand side efficiency. Although there was some awareness of
    the potential there was limited capacity, information and incentive for initiatives in
    demand side management (DSM).

On November 3, 1997, after appraisal, Typhoon Linda struck southern Vietnam. Nine
provinces were affected, 432 people were killed and 3,800 missing, 76,537 houses 2,250
school rooms and 358,000 hectares of paddy land were ruined. Damage to the electrical



                                              1

distribution network was estimated at $13 million and included 180km of low voltage
(LV), 160km of medium voltage (MV) lines and 320 distribution substations destroyed.
Supply to about 100,000 consumers was disrupted.

The investment and reform objectives of the project were covered in the Country
Assistance Strategy (CAS) dated October 25, 1995 (report 15053). Support for the
transition to a market economy including investments in the power sector was identified
as a priority for IDA, in recognition that neither other donors nor the private sector would
be able meet all the financing needs of the sector. The CAS was consistent with the
GoV's plans to invest in basic infrastructure and the Bank's strategy in the power sector to
focus on needs in transmission and distribution, including high-return rehabilitation,
while addressing reform to attract the private sector.

The Bank supported the project for three reasons. First, by providing $189 million of
IDA funding, it would help meet Vietnam's needs for investment, focusing on reinforcing
the transmission and distribution grids to improve their efficiency; it would also introduce
DSM to the sector. Second it would broaden and deepen the Bank's policy dialogue on
badly needed sector-wide reform and commercialization of EVN.              Third, it would
provide urgently-needed assistance to reconstruct distribution systems following
Typhoon Linda.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDOs) and Key Indicators (as approved)

The PDOs were to:




                                              2

    (a) Strengthen the high voltage transmission network in Vietnam to facilitate
    evacuation of power from generating stations to the load centers.
    (b) Rehabilitate distribution systems to meet demand, reduce losses and improve
    reliability.
    (c) Support power sector reform and restructuring through: (i) the separation of
    "transmission" and "generation" functions; (ii) the implementation of regulatory
    reforms; (iii) the introduction of tariff reforms; and (iv) exploring financing of
    distribution from diversified sources.
    (d) Support institutional strengthening and commercialization through: (i) securing
    greater autonomy for the distribution companies; and (ii) introducing planning
    capabilities for demand side management.
    (e) Help normalize economic activity in the Typhoon Linda affected areas through the
    reconstruction of the electricity distribution network.

The key performance indicators were improvements in transmission system reliability,
losses and usage; improvements in distribution system reliability and losses; qualitative
measures of the progress of reform including the operation of transmission as a cost
center, presentation of an electricity law to the national assembly, and creation of a
regulatory office and regulatory procedures; and qualitative measures of the autonomy of
the distribution companies, improvements to EVN's financial management systems and
the measurements in the reduction in peak demand and electricity consumption.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification

The PDOs were unchanged on restructuring in May 2005.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries,

The main beneficiaries were the Ministry of Industry, on behalf of the Government, EVN
and its subsidiary Power Companies (PCs), No. 1 (PC1), responsible for electricity
distribution in the northern part of the country, No. 2 (PC2) responsible for electricity
distribution in the southern part of the country and Ho Chi Minh City PC (HCMC PC)
responsible for the metropolitan area of Ho Chi Minh City.

EVN directly benefited from the investments in the transmission system, by improving
stable and reliable operation of the power system, by increasing the capacity to transport
power between north to south in line with seasonal demand and generation availability,
by enabling connection of additional generation capacity and by reduction in
transmission losses. PCs 1 and 2 and HCMC PC benefited through investments designed
to improve the capacity and efficiency of their systems, thus enabling them better to meet
demand and to improve service to consumers.

The Ministry of Industry (MoI), EVN and the PCs benefited from support, during
preparation, of the development of a medium term power sector policy. During the
project, technical assistance (TA) supported the first steps in implementing the policy to
separate generation from transmission, to improve transparency and autonomy in the


                                               3

commercial management of power transmission and distribution operations and to
establish a legal and regulatory framework. The introduction of a DSM action plan and
program further improved the efficiency of EVN and the PCs in meeting consumer
demand.

Secondary beneficiaries were electricity consumers, primarily in the north and south of
the country served by PCs 1 and 2 and in particular in the cities of Ha Long, Ha Tinh, Hai
Duong and Vinh in the north and Ho Chi Minh City and Vung Tau in the south.
Indirectly, electricity consumers throughout the country were beneficiaries. The gains to
consumers in improved quality of power service as a result of the investments can be
inferred from fewer interruptions in supply and greater quantities of power flowing in the
system.

The main and secondary beneficiaries were not changed by the project restructuring,
however the larger number of investments possible through cost savings increased the
number of secondary beneficiaries and the benefits they gained.

1.5 Original Components

The Transmission and Distribution Component was divided into six subcomponents: (i)
construction of the second circuit of the Pleiku-Phu Lam 500 kV transmission line (TL)
and associated substations (SS); (ii) construction of the Ha Tinh 500/220/110kV SS; (iii)
construction of the 220 kV Nha Be to Tao Dan circuit and 220/110kV gas insulated
switchgear (GIS) Tao Dan substation in Ho Chi Minh City; (iv) rehabilitation of
distribution networks in the cities of Halong, Vinh, and Vung Tau; (v) consultant services
for the Pleiku ­ Phu Lam 500kV line and the 220kV Nha Be to Tao Dan circuit and
substation; and (vi) technical assistance for improving the regulatory framework and for
the demand side management (DSM) program. This component supported the first four
of the project development objectives, by strengthening the high voltage transmission
network, rehabilitating distribution systems, supporting sector reform, and restructuring
and supporting commercialization and institutional development.

An associated TA component, financed by Japan, initiated the work on sector reform and
restructuring.    The component financed studies to improve the transmission and
distribution functions.

The Disaster Reconstruction Component consisted of the reconstruction of 180km of LV
and 160km of MV distribution lines and 320 distribution substations with an aggregate
capacity of 25MVA. The component supported the fifth project development objective
of normalizing activity in the Typhoon Linda affected area.

1.6 Revised Components

Formal Restructuring Without Changes to PDO

In May 2005, a restructuring of the project was approved by the Board. The PDOs were
not changed. The reasons for the restructuring was to permit additional important and


                                             4

badly-needed investments to be included for financing under the project, which would
contribute further to the PDOs while also using substantial project cost savings that had
built up. The restructuring introduced a more flexible approach which allowed EVN and
the PCs to include (and drop) subprojects in response to their investment priorities. A
more generic project description was adopted, and appraisal criteria agreed for the
subprojects, including their contribution to the PDO, technical, economic and financial
efficiency, and compliance with the World Bank's safeguards policies.

Three subcomponents under the Transmission and Distribution Component were
modified and a further 28 subprojects were proposed for financing with a total cost of
$160.6 million, of which $88.3 million was proposed to be financed by IDA. In the event
20 subprojects were financed, with a total cost of $96.30 million, of which $48.70 million
was from IDA. The subcomponents modified are detailed in Table 1.

To reflect the changes in the project, the results framework was also modified in May
2005, and aligned with monitoring indicators collected by EVN.

1.7 Other significant changes

Changes in Timing

The project was originally scheduled to become effective in March 1998 and close in
June 2002. The project was extended a total of five times as follows:

        June 2002         To December 31, 2003.
        May 2003          To December 31, 2004.
        December 2004     To June 30, 2005.
        June 2005         To December 31, 2006.
        December 2006     Partial, to June 30, 2007.

Extensions to the closing date of the Credit agreed in June 2002 and in May 2003 were
primarily targeted at allowing the completion of the Pleiku to Phu Lam TL and Nha Be to
Tao Dan TL and Tao Dan SS subcomponents following a slow start and slow
implementation. The third was to allow completion of project restructuring. The fourth
extension was given at the time of restructuring in May 2005 to give time to implement
the subprojects that were introduced into the project. The fifth was to permit completion
of those contracts which had been delayed or rebid as a result of materials price increases
that occurred during the second half of 2006.

Covenants

At negotiations, the project covenanted a schedule of increases to bring the average retail
tariff to 7 US cents/kWh by March 1, 2001. This had become contentious even before
the start of implementation and was to be the subject of discussion on several occasions
during the lifetime of the project, without reaching substantive agreement between IDA
and GoV. In consequence, the tariff covenant was replaced by a covenants for EVN to
maintain three key ratios: self financing ratio (SFR), of 25 percent or better; debt service
coverage ratio (DSCR), of 1.5 times or more; and debt: equity ratio of no more than



                                              6

70:30. The same covenants were applied to all projects in the IDA portfolio providing
finance to EVN.

Cancellation

After the restructuring, EVN and the PCs were unable to bring forward sufficient
subprojects to allow the full balance of the credit amount to be committed and disbursed
before the revised closing date of December 31, 2006. Thus on June 30, 2006, IDA
cancelled Special Drawing Rights (SDR) 27 million, (equivalent to about $40 million)
from the credit.

As of December 13, 2007, the actual amount disbursed from the credit was SDR106
million. SDR 11.4 million, or about $17 million was thus left unused, mainly accounted
for by savings on the estimated costs of subprojects implemented following the May
2005 restructuring but also by the significant depreciation in the dollar against the SDR in
the latter stages of the project.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

Project design was straightforward, with one subcomponent per investment subproject.
Swedish International Development Agency (SIDA) was the co-financier for two
subcomponents, the 500kV Ha Tinh substation extension and the DSM component but
this did not present a substantial complication in the project.

The project was underpinned by a major piece of analytical work which was being
undertaken simultaneously1. The analysis identified the potential for transmission and
distribution system investments to contribute to electricity system growth and efficiency,
and the importance of effective policy and regulation. Other studies supported project
design. A significant piece of sector work to support the preparation of an electricity law
was also started during preparation. Comprehensive feasibility studies were carried out
by international consultants for the major investments at 500 and 220kV.

There were multiple dimensions to the PDOs.                 Taken together these dimensions
supported the CAS objective of providing investment support to the power sector and
hence the GoV's objective of investment in basic infrastructure as well as helping to
increase private sector participation.        The parts relating to reform were broad and
ambitious and had some linkages to activities outside the project, such as the preparation
of the electricity law.       Nonetheless the PDOs are considered appropriate and were
achievable.

                                                  7

Appraisal appears to have relied on cost estimates based on previous procurement of
500kV and 220kV equipment in Vietnam. These had taken place some years before, and
had been based on negotiated prices and thus were higher than could be expected from
competitive bidding. In addition, high levels of contingencies were included, because of
strong institutional and personal incentives to avoid project costs over-running estimates.

At appraisal risks to the development objective namely: timely availability of
counterparts funds, implementing agencies' management commitment, Government
commitment to sector reform were identified and assessed as moderate.             Risks to
implementation progress: lack of resources for land acquisition; slow procurement; and
delays in appointing consultants, were well identified but their impact ­ in terms of the
length of delays possible ­ was, with hindsight, somewhat optimistic.        Appraisal was
based on load forecasts known at the time, but with local demand growth rates sometimes
exceeding the national average by a substantial margin, the risk of underestimating or
overestimating demand growth was not assessed. The re-evaluation of risks at project
restructuring downgraded several, but identified new ones, including subprojects not
being identified or appraised in a timely fashion and insufficient attention to safeguards
and again may have been over optimistic.

A weakness in the project design was how it dealt with raising retail tariffs. Staged rises
in the average retail were covenanted on EVN, yet it was unable to influence tariff rises
directly, since any increase was subject to government approval. Its value as a means of
ensuring adequate financial performance by EVN was also questionable.                  The
Government's commitment to raising tariffs was not explicitly identified as a risk to the
PDO or to implementation progress, unless inferred as part of 'waning of Government
commitment to push with reforms and of EVN commitment to institutional strengthening
programs' which was rated moderate.

There was a Quality Assessment Group (QAG) review at entry but there are no records of
its findings on the project files.

2.2 Implementation

Design for initial implementation was straightforward, with each subcomponent to be
carried out by identified implementing agencies.          The technically more complex
subcomponents were planned to be supported by international consultants to prepare
feasibility studies, support procurement and supervise implementation.         Ministry of
Industry and EVN were the main agencies involved in the technical assistance activities.
They and HCMC PC had some experience of Bank procedures, including procurement
and disbursement, gained through previous projects. MoI had been engaged with the
Bank on policy dialogue for a number of years. No fiduciary or safeguards issues were
new to the project.

Tariffs

The level and the timing of tariff increases were discussed extensively during project
preparation and were supported by a study carried out by international consultants.


                                              8

Shortly after the project was approved by the World Bank's Board of Directors in January
1998, GoV seems to have had misgivings about committing itself to the level of 7
cents/kWh by December 31, 1999 and thus the signing of the project documents was
delayed.

A further round of negotiations resulting in agreement of staged increases such that the
tariff would reach 7 cents/kWh by March 1, 2001. This schedule was reflected in the
Development Credit Agreement signed in November 1998.                     During project
implementation there were at least two slippages in the schedule: in May 1999, the tariff
of 7 cents/kWh was expected to be reached by 2002; and in June 2001 only by July 1,
2005.    Reflecting tariff concerns, the DO progress indicator was downgraded to
unsatisfactory on three occasions.

In VND terms, average tariffs did rise over the project period from VND 680/kWh in
1998 to VND 842/kWh from January 1, 2007. In dollar terms it stood still: at the
exchange rate prevailing in mid 1998 the tariff was 5.24 cents and at the exchange rate in
mid 2007, it was 5.22 cents/kWh. Although EVN is in some respects financially more
exposed today than it was in 1997, in 2005, the last year for which a full analysis has
been completed, it maintained its three key performance indicators of SFR, DSCR and
debt:equity ratio at covenanted levels.

Slow Implementation Progress

Implementation of the original subcomponents started slowly, delayed by late signing and
effectiveness, since final approvals to subproject technical designs were not given until
then. There was also a delay because of uncertainties within government about the
timing of the second circuit for the Pleiku ­ Phu Lam 500kV line. When under way,
progress was slow but without major difficulties. There were delays in hiring the
consultants to support EVN and HCMC PC on the Pleiku to Phu Lam TL and the Nha Be
to Tao Dan TL and Tao Dan SS. There were significant delays in procurement.

Cost Savings

The original subcomponents were achieved at substantially lower cost than identified at
appraisal, not wholly as a result of the East Asian financial crisis. As early as August
2001, GoV requested IDA to use the cost savings, implicitly about $20 million.
Estimates of saving rose by stages from then until, by December 2004, they were
estimated at $87.5 million, or about 44 percent of the original credit amount.          A
workshop in early 2004 was held to review progress and to identify subprojects that could
be included in a restructured project. This workshop identified a substantial number of
subprojects, including those requested by SBV in 2001 that were at a sufficiently
advanced state of preparation to be included in the project. The amendment took a
further year to finalize.

Other Issues in Implementation




                                            9

The May 2005 restructuring made the EVN/IDA process easier to manage with the
minimum of formalities, but EVN and the PCs remained exposed to the complex and
extended GoV approvals process for each subproject. To prepare the restructuring on the
Vietnamese side required approval of the Prime Minister, and subprojects still required a
process of feasibility study, detailed design and preparation of procurement documents
which required separate, sequential approvals. The approval of the restructuring by GoV
delegated approvals for EVN subprojects to MoI and for PCs' subprojects to EVN while
all procurement could be approved by EVN.          This was a significant improvement
compared with project preparation when approval by the Prime Minister was required at
several stages.

Towards the end of project implementation, a sharp increase in the prices of several
commodities including aluminum, copper, nickel, steel and zinc further slowed
procurement. All are key constituents of electrical systems equipment and as a result a
number of procurement packages had to be rebid. It was the result of this rebidding that
the final extension from December 31, 2006 to June 30, 2006 was granted. Price
adjustment formulae were not adopted in the project, because it was considered
incompatible with the procurement law in Vietnam which only permits deviations from it
if a donor's procurement guidelines require it; price adjustment formulae are not
mandated in the Bank's procurement guidelines.

There appears to have been a QAG assessment of supervision but there are no records of
its findings on the project files.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

M&E Design

The indicators for measuring the PDOs were of reasonable quality. Those related to the
investment components were specific, measurable and relied on EVN's and the PCs' own
performance monitoring system. Those linked to the sector reform and institutional
development of EVN could have been more rigorous.               The emergency recovery
component was not included in the project logical framework and no indicators for its
objective appear to have been developed.

The restructuring of the project in May 2005 introduced some additional indicators and
revisited the original ones. M&E for the physical investment was aligned with the data
collected by EVN for its own internal monitoring purposes and is considered reliable and
sustainable. Indicators introduced during the restructuring are less easily attributed to the
project. There was also some lack of clarity on which of the original indicators were
retained at the restructuring.

The financial performance of EVN and the PCs was designed to be monitored on a
consistent basis for each project in the portfolio. An International Creditors' Model
(ICM) was developed under a separate project initially to verify appropriate tariff levels
and subsequently used to ensure the key financial indicators were consistently calculated.


                                            10

Implementing agencies were also required to hire independent monitoring consultants, on
terms of reference satisfactory to the Bank for monitoring of implementation of
environment assessments and environment management plans (EA/EMPs) and
resettlement plans (RPs). The independent consultants' reports were sent to the Bank for
review.

M&E Implementation

Implementation progress data were captured quarterly. Data on outcomes were collected
as the subprojects were completed. Data for all indicators were collected as part of the
implementation completion reporting process. Financial indicators were monitored as an
annual exercise for all projects in the portfolio.

Data quality for the investment subcomponents has generally been acceptable. Methods
for data collection have generally been appropriate, using a 'bottom up' reporting process
which is linked to the management hierarchy in EVN and the PCs.                               Independent
monitoring of EMPs has provided data of mixed quality with the main difficulty being
insufficient field-based monitoring using appropriate techniques.

M&E Utilization

Implementation data were used to review progress of the project against agreed
timetables and to revise the timetables as necessary. Use of the outcome-level indicators
has proved problematic, because the indicators chosen are at system level and it is hard to
distinguish impact of the project from other non-project related factors. It has become
increasingly difficult as the system has grown, and consequently the impact of any single
subproject is less significant. Financial monitoring data have been the basis for dialogue
with EVN and the Government on a variety of issues including tariff levels, forecast
future investment needs, and the impacts of equitization2.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

Environment

An EA/EMP was carried out for the second circuit of the Pleiku to Phu Lam 500kV
transmission line. It is not clear what level of environment assessment was carried out
for the remaining subprojects.                 Subprojects that were appraised following the
restructuring in May 2005 followed agreed guidelines for the preparation of environment
assessments.

In general the impacts of transmission and distribution lines and substations on the
environment were of a mainly temporary nature associated with construction and



2Equitization is the process of creation of a joint stock company and sale of a proportion of shares to the
public and employees.


                                                       11

included noise, dust, disruption to traffic, excavation operations and the need to
accommodate workers. Permanent effects were mainly confined to the right of way of
the line, which must be kept clear of high-growing plants and trees. Alignments of lines
and siting of substations were chosen to minimize the combined environment and social
impacts.

Supervision of the implementation of environment management plans (EMPs) by
independent monitoring consultants and Bank staff revealed no major issues.

Indigenous Peoples

The project appraisal document noted that a few ethnic minority households would be
affected by the Pleiku to Phu Lam TL but "because of the relatively minor nature of the
impact, no separate Indigenous People's Development Plan is considered necessary." The
EIA also included sections that constituted a full ethnic minorities development plan
(EMDP). EMDPs do not appear to have been prepared for the other original subprojects.

Following the restructuring in May 2005, EMDPs were required based on a framework
that was agreed with the GoV and adopted by EVN. EMDPs were prepared for 3
subprojects, affecting a total of 1445 ethnic minorities households, mainly on a single
110kV TL from Lang Son to Cao Bang in the north of the country. All EMDPs have
been satisfactorily implemented.

Resettlement

Just over 2,000 households were identified at appraisal as being affected by the various
subprojects, of which about 530 needed to be relocated, based on a resettlement Plan
(RP) that was an integral part of the EIA. Most of the affected households and nearly all
the relocations were linked to the Pleiku to Phu Lam TL. In the event, nearly 9,000
households were affected by the line, the large discrepancy being the result of under-
estimation at appraisal.

Following the restructuring in May 2005, a framework for resettlement planning was
agreed with the Government of Vietnam and adopted by EVN and applied to all
additional subprojects. Subsequent subprojects affected around 8,700 households, the
majority in a minor way. In most cases appraisal estimates of numbers of households
affected, land acquisition and compensation were close to the actual values on
implementation.

Resettlement was on the whole well implemented by the responsible agencies. Most
households that were relocated were allowed to remain in their old houses until the new
ones were ready, and all were moved as short a distance as possible, resulting in minimal
disruption to livelihoods. No grievances or complaints were brought to the attention of
Bank staff during implementation which included independent site visits. Independent
monitoring of the RPs revealed no major issues.




                                             12

Procurement

Procurement was effectively organized; at the start of the project a procurement
management group involving the Ministry of Industry and EVN was used to support
EVN's executing agencies and the PCs in the early stages when they were not familiar
with some of the in the more complex procurement processes. Procurement progressed
slowly, especially with the large packages at the start of the project, which required
multiple levels of approval up to the Prime Minister. There were four complaints during
procurement of which two were dropped by the complainant, one was invalidated and
one resulted in rebidding. There were no instances of procurement irregularities.

Financial Management

Financial management was generally satisfactory though there were two recurrent issues
during the project. One was late submission of financial management reports (FMRs)
and audit reports. Towards the end of the project reporting improved but there were still
instances of late submission by the PCs and by EVN itself. Audits were satisfactory
throughout the project and continuing entity financial statements were generally
unqualified.

The second recurrent issue was slow processing of disbursement requests within the
Vietnamese system and delays in payments. Under Ministry of Finance rules, all ODA
projects must have a controller which, amongst other things, checks disbursement
requests made by implementing agencies.        For this project, the controller was the
Vietnam Development Bank (VDB, formerly the Development Assistance Fund). Some
VDB branches' checking was excessive, requiring for example all contracts (including
standard parts) to be translated into Vietnamese and notarized. The effect was for the
implementing agencies, which for the most part had to pay their suppliers before the
checking was complete, to have to wait long periods for reimbursement by IDA; in late
2006 it was estimated that implementing agencies were waiting for VDB to release $25
million in payments for goods financed under the project. In some cases this had a
noticeable effect on financial performance of the PCs since they had built up significant
levels of receivables.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

Each investment subcomponent or subproject was implemented by a Project Management
Board (PMB), which is a special purpose, permanent entity within the overall
management structure of EVN or the participating Power Companies. On completion of
commissioning the subproject was handed over to the operations department of the
implementing agency. Each of the subprojects formed part of the investment plan of the
implementing agency, which is also the project's ultimate owner.

Each transmission project has been handed over from the PMB to one of four
transmission companies which together operate all the transmission assets in the EVN.
They are now cost centers of EVN and thus staffing, operations and maintenance are the
responsibility of EVN, the asset owners.      EVN recovers its costs from electricity


                                           13

consumers and thus has adequate resources to ensure proper operation and maintenance
of the entities. By the end of 2007 transmission will be merged into a single, national
transmission company as part of the reforms to the power market. It will be under
separate ownership and will have a regulated tariff structure that will ensure cost
recovery and permit future investment.

Power Companies are currently wholly-owned subsidiaries of the EVN group and as such
profit centers in their own right. The tariff regime now in place ensures that they recover
costs and have sufficient retained income for future investment. Policies and standards
are in place that ensure adequate maintenance.

Both EVN and the PCs maintain a reporting system to monitor system performance (the
project M&E indicators are drawn from these) though these are not systematic or
widespread enough to develop benchmarks or comparative performance by area, supply
level or consumer type. As part of the market reforms, the Electricity Regulatory
Authority of Vietnam (ERAV) will have oversight of the performance of all entities in
the power sector and will require reports to enable it to monitor system performance. The
most relevant indicators remain transmission and distribution system reliability and
efficiency, in aggregate covering faults, losses and power flows. More detailed indicators,
which can help prioritize investments, would look at these at specified points (for
reliability and efficiency) and parts of the system (for efficiency). These indicators will
be accessible to the Bank for future monitoring.

Further operations supporting the efficient development of the transmission and
distribution system are under way (System Efficiency Improvement, Equitization and
Renewables Project, Cr. 3680 VN and Second Transmission and Distribution Project, Cr.
4107 VN). The system is forecast to continue to grow at 15 percent per year, and neither
transmission nor distribution are likely to enter private ownership in Vietnam for some
years to come. Sustained IDA/IBRD involvement and investment financing to ensure
efficient development of the transmission and distribution systems is expected to remain
a priority for GoV and EVN. The Bank, through a stand-alone Global Environment
Facility (GEF) project has continued to support DSM (Demand Side Management and
Energy Efficiency, GEF TF 051256), and the GoV is now preparing an energy efficiency
law now that reforms are more advanced.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
(to current country and global priorities, and Bank assistance strategy)

The need for physical infrastructure is still as strong; demand has continued to grow
much as predicted at appraisal, at an average of about 15 percent per year. Investment in
basic power infrastructure is a priority of the government's Socio-Economic
Development Plan for 2006-2010.            The current Country Partnership Strategy (CPS,
reviewed by the World Bank's Board of Executive Directors on January 3, 2007) reflects
this priority; one of its objectives is to ensure efficient and reliable provision of
infrastructure services. The investment-related PDOs remain highly relevant.


                                                14

The reform objective remains relevant. Reform is a process, not a single action and the
project set out the broad direction of power sector reform, which is still being pursued
today and initiated many of the essential tasks. The objectives the project espoused were
over-ambitious and so the project aimed too far into the future, hence many of the tasks it
had hoped to accomplish by 1999 or 2000 were not completed until 2004 or later.

The institutional development objectives were relevant at the time of the project but are
less so now, because pushed by the project, much has been decentralized, giving greater
autonomy and broadening ownership by implementing agencies. The objective for the
disaster reconstruction component was highly relevant at the time of preparation and
implementation but following normalization is no longer so.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

The project substantially met its PDOs and is rated satisfactory in this dimension:

    · Strengthen the high voltage transmission network. Achievement of this objective
       is satisfactory. There have been gains in transmission reliability and efficiency,
       and larger power flows are taking place between the central and southern areas of
       Vietnam.     Additional subprojects have further contributed to this objective
       beyond that which was originally envisaged.
    · Rehabilitate and expand distribution systems. Achievement of this objective is
       satisfactory. Distribution systems have reduced losses and improved reliability.
       Anecdotal evidence points to substantial improvement in the quality of supply
       during the project.     Additional subprojects have further contributed to this
       objective beyond that which was originally envisaged.
    · Support power sector reforms. Achievement of this objective is moderately
       satisfactory. With the exception of the tariff revision to 7 cents/kWh, all the
       indicators were achieved, though they were significantly delayed from the
       original timetable. A more rapid implementation may not have been realistic or
       desirable. Tariffs have increased by 25% in VND terms, about the same amount
       as originally envisaged in dollar terms
    · Support institutional strengthening and commercialization. Achievement of this
       objective is satisfactory. The PCs, at which this component was largely aimed,
       have become increasingly commercially and managerially independent
       throughout the lifetime of the project.          Accounting systems have been
       continuously improved.      The ongoing follow-on DSM project bears out the
       achievement of the DSM objective.
    · Normalization of economic activity following Typhoon Linda. Achievement of
       this objective is satisfactory. The component was completed under difficult
       circumstances and in reasonable time. No indicators are available to assess
       'before' and 'after' the Typhoon, however the outputs indicate one-for-one
       replacement of MV and LV systems and equipment and thus it may be inferred
       that at least a similar standard of service was being provided following
       completion of the component.



                                            15

3.3 Efficiency

The economic analysis for the project components at appraisal and at completion has
been carried out using two scenarios: (i) with the project; and (ii) without the project. The
ex ante 'with' project scenario assumed that the project as described was carried out based
on forecast costs. For investments at 500kV, the 'without' project alternative was to
strengthen the 220kV system. For investments at 220kV and below, the 'without' project
analysis assumed that no investment would be made. The ex post 'with' project scenario
used actual investment costs of the project. The 'without' project scenario assumed that
no investment had been made. The same methodology was used for both the original and
the new subprojects. All costs are presented in constant 1995 US dollars, to allow
comparison. The analysis covers about 88 percent of final project baseline costs, the
main items being excluded being the consultant services for physical investments,
technical assistance and the rehabilitation of distribution networks in Ha Long and Vinh.

The key economic and financial indicators of the first and second phases of the project
are summarized in Table 2 and provided for each subproject in Annex 3.

    Note: appraisal of additional subprojects was done on a subproject-by-subproject basis. No
    overall analysis of the economic and financial benefits of the set of additional subprojects was
    undertaken ex ante.

At appraisal the costs of the original subprojects were over-estimated. The completion
analysis takes into account the cost savings ­ of the order of 30 percent of the original
estimates ­ and shows a much higher rate of return than at appraisal. The net present
value of the original subprojects, however, is not as high, principally because of the
delays in completion which in some cases were four years longer than the original
implementation schedule. During those four years the benefits were reduced by more
than could be made up from the reduced costs. There may also have been a wider
economic impact of overestimating costs since the size of the credit tied up some IDA
allocation that may, perhaps, have been used for some other investment.


                                                    16

The impact at the financial level is less marked, because the financial revenues are lower
than the economic benefits. Notwithstanding the reduced benefits because of delays, the
subprojects were still financially efficient, except possibly the renovation of Halong and
Vinh distribution systems for which information is not available.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: satisfactory.

The overall satisfactory rating for the project is justified on three grounds. The first is
that the project maintained its relevance throughout its (long) lifetime, particularly the
investment aspects, which are responsible for the bulk of the project costs, but also the
reform objectives. The second is that four of the five project development objectives
were satisfactorily and one moderately satisfactorily achieved. In some respects the
project achieved more than its objectives in terms of physical investment, by the
inclusion of an additional 20 subprojects. The third reason is that the project was more
economically efficient than expected at appraisal, notwithstanding the delays to
implementation and the reduction in benefits, which was offset by use of cost savings for
the additional subprojects which were also economically efficient.

There were modest shortcomings in the achievement of the objective: slow
implementation reduced the potential benefits of the project. Arguably some of the
institutional development objectives such as separation of transmission from generation
could have been more fully achieved ­ there are degrees of separation ­ but as these are
difficult to quantify.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

No other effects or impacts of the project have been identified.


3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

No beneficiary survey has been carried out.


4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: moderate

The physical investment aspects of the project are not inherently risky in technical,
economic, financial or institutional terms. For the foreseeable future, Vietnam will
continue to depend on a power transmission and distribution network, and, the
investments will continue to fulfill an important role. The transmission company, when it
is formed, and the Power Companies will be regulated by ERAV, with appropriate
transmission and distribution tariff methodologies to ensure long term sustained operation


                                              17

of the assets.    Experience has shown that the environment and social impacts of
transmission and distribution construction are broadly accepted as a price worth paying
for the benefits, even by those who are most immediately affected.            The physical
investments are exposed to some risk of natural disasters, even though design standards
incorporate the extreme weather conditions frequently experienced in EVN.

The reforms that the project championed do not appear to be at risk. Much of the more
recent developments in power sector reform are set on the foundations laid by the project,
including the development of the Electricity Law in 2004 and the roadmap for reform in
2006. So far, the steady implementation of the law over the past three years, and the
political and institutional stability in Vietnam gives confidence that the institutional
development and market reform will continue in a positive direction.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: moderately satisfactory

The project responded to identified CAS objectives and the Government's plans for
investment in basic infrastructure. The project was in line with the Bank's strategy for
the power sector and was coordinated with other donors, in particular Sweden, which
cofinanced the project. From a technical point of view, the investment projects were well
prepared. The range of policy and institutional development activities were appropriate
for the time; indeed this project set the tone for a broad ranging policy dialogue with
government and EVN that continues today. The Bank was highly responsive to the needs
for reconstruction of the southern area and the reconstruction subcomponent was
prepared in a short time.

It seems unlikely that a more flexible project design ­ which could have included a
mechanism to use project cost savings through the addition of further subprojects or by
financing more of the ones under implementation ­ would have been acceptable to the
Government. Concepts for flexible designs were new and untested, and neither the
Government nor the Bank side had much incentive to introduce such a complication for
what appeared to be quite a straightforward operation. For similar reasons, it would
probably not have been possible for the project to have been further advanced during
preparation, with the result that upon approval, a time-consuming two step process was
needed to implement the major investment components of the project. First, consultants
to support the project had to be hired and only then could work start on implementing the
projects.

The shortcoming in Bank performance during preparation was the handling of the tariff
issue. It is questionable that a tariff level as high as 7 cents/kWh was appropriate and the
risks to the rest of the project of trying to introduce it were poorly assessed. In addition
any breach of the covenant permitted only two basic options: either to waive it or to



                                               18

suspend the project. The task team was thus left without leverage to persuade the
Government to take action, leaving EVN stuck in the middle.

(b) Quality of Supervision

Rating: unsatisfactory

Several of the subcomponents were well supported during implementation, particularly
those dealing with reform and restructuring, demand side management, the relatively
simple investments in rehabilitation of the cities' distribution network and the
rehabilitation of typhoon-affected areas.        Financial supervision of the project was
satisfactory, but the tariff issue was not fully resolved. Although slow in implementation,
the two major investment subprojects were well-supported and most of the delay appears
to have been on the side of the Government, because of the extensive approvals system.

The shortcomings in the Bank's supervision were its lack of candor in reporting
implementation progress, and slowness in addressing the issue of cost savings and how
the project could be adapted to cope with them. By the time the first extension was
processed, in June 2002, the project was six months from its original closing date and
only 13 percent disbursed. It is understandable that the Government and the Bank were
reluctant to contemplate the possibility of 'losing' the savings through cancellation. In
addition the extent of the savings only emerged slowly and in the early stages a full-scale
restructuring may not have seemed worthwhile given the comparatively small amount of
savings and the possibility of cost overruns in the larger subprojects. Nonetheless greater
proactivity could have been possible.

The opportunity was thus missed for an early, systematic and substantial review of
project performance beyond normal supervision reporting. Amore proactive stance by
the Bank, with the possibility of a major restructuring and substantial extension ­ of as
much as four years, effectively treating it as a new project ­ could have created an
environment more conducive to smooth project implementation and offered better
chances of full use of the credit amount and a shorter project implementation period. As
it was, the restructuring in May 2005 was worthwhile, but arguably too late to have the
full impact it might have had.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Rating: moderately unsatisfactory

The moderately satisfactory Bank performance during preparation balanced against the
unsatisfactory performance during supervision but satisfactory overall outcome suggests
an overall rating of moderately unsatisfactory.

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance

Rating: moderately satisfactory


                                               19

The Government cooperated closely with the Bank during preparation, and there was
significant policy dialogue as a result, which was carried on subsequently throughout the
project. That dialogue has formed a solid foundation for subsequent engagement in the
sector. In addition, the Government has, during the course of the project, tackled issues
of excessive centralization and control, and showed itself willing to adopt more flexible
approaches to project implementation, including delegation of investment decisions and
day to day investment management to EVN and the PCs, acceptance of the phased
approach to project implementation

The main weakness concerns the reforms to the retail tariff. While it seems quite likely
that the increases were too steep and aimed at a higher level than necessary, a more open
dialogue than took place with the Bank was warranted. If the Government did have
reservations about the ultimate intention of reaching 7 cents/kWh, it does not seem to
have been expressed to the Bank clearly. The Government relied communicating the
results of wide consultation within the Government, based on proposals by EVN rather
than a more transparent process to agree the basis on which tariffs should be set.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

Rating: satisfactory

Strong commitment and action within the implementing agencies enabled the subprojects
and components to be completed. From a technical standpoint, the projects have been
well implemented, with thorough consultation, proper preparation and implementation of
engineering, environment and resettlement plans, good fiduciary control and smooth
transition to operating mode. There was a high degree of ownership of the project. Over
the lifetime of the project there has been a noticeable improvement in the professionalism
and quality of the work undertaken by the implementing agencies.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

Rating: satisfactory

The weighting applied to the implementing agencies ­ and recognizing the substantial
improvements in both Government and implementing agencies' performance over the
lifetime of the project suggests an overall rating of satisfactory.

6. Lessons Learned

The lessons from project design are:

The tariff issue. While it is important to ensure that pricing is set at proper levels, the
approach of agreeing a targeted level of tariffs and a schedule by which they are achieved
does not appear to have been successful. Apart from the possibilities that the level and
timing may be set incorrectly or that circumstances might change, ensuring that they are
implemented as agreed is difficult. It may be better to avoid tariff covenants altogether


                                             20

and only look at financial performance, since this then opens up the range of options
including to cut costs.       Better still might be the introduction of an agreed tariff
methodology which removes the political dimension to tariff setting; in practice this is
the basis on which utility regulators often agree tariffs. If financial performance targets
are used, however, they must still be backed by covenants, and again they should not be
of the 'all or nothing' kind implied by suspension.

Smarter covenants. The adoption of covenants ­ at least as they were formulated in the
project legal agreements ­ presents difficulties because of the extreme nature of the
remedy that is applied. More nuanced covenants, for example by applying interest rate or
grace period penalties for the time that the covenant is breached, may be more effective at
sustaining the dialogue while providing a clear incentive for action.

The lessons from implementation are:

Better cost estimates and demand forecasts. The cost estimates used at appraisal were
evidently flawed, and, notwithstanding the price decreases resulting from the East Asian
financial crisis, could have been developed using more up to date information and a more
realistic basis. Demand forecasts, which affect the sizing of equipment (and thus the cost
estimates) are risky in a system that is growing as rapidly as Vietnam's.

Delay in taking action had high costs. The second lesson is that early and decisive action
to deal with slow project implementation and costs savings are essential. Failing to do so
sends mixed signals to the Borrower (and to some extent within the Bank itself) and
threatens the project's value. Putting off action, however hard the choices that it may
present are, benefits no-one. Incentives to review and, where necessary, restructure have
improved since the early days of this project.

Pilots can be useful low-risk market tests. A positive lesson is the way in which the
piloting of DSM was used to assess interest and capacity. This enabled it to be scaled up
to a standalone project later, thus reducing risks while learning important lessons about
how best to design the project. Several other aspects of the dialogue have also been
developed into subcomponents in other projects, and this technique appears to work well
in Vietnam.

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners

were four main tasks undertaken: a review of the organization structure for management
of the transmission business; a more technical evaluation of the National Load Dispatch
Center (NLDC) and their regional counterparts to evaluate options to improve
transmission operations; establish a timetable for the establishment of separate
transmission operations; and to set out the commercial arrangements between the
proposed business units. The main outputs from the study were:

    · A recommendation for a phased transition to a consolidated transmission business
        unit, consisting of the four transmission companies that then existed, and the
        NLDC. The formation of an independent regulator was also recommended.
    · The formation of a primary control center to undertake the NLDC and regional
        load dispatch center (RLDC) functions. It also recommended the introduction of
        a Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) and Energy Management
        System (EMS) and updating of short term planning software.
    · An action plan, integrating the recommendations of the consultant.
    · Legal instruments to: consolidate the assets of the transmission units and NLDC
        into a single business unit; establish corporatized distribution companies; and
        devolve power plants into separate generation companies transacting wholesale
        power business with distribution companies.

In many ways this report foreshadowed the subsequent dialogue which is still ongoing.
EVN plans to establish a separate, single transmission company by the end of 2007. The
detailed market design is under preparation now, and that will determine what other parts
of the electricity system are grouped with the transmission company (for example the
NLDC and the market system operator). The regulator is now active, having been
created in October 2005. The quality of these outputs is rated as satisfactory.

Technical Assistance for Demand Side Management. The activities consisted of three
main components: (i) a DSM program within EVN; (ii) development of energy-efficient
lighting and motor standards for Ministry of Science and Technology; and (iii)
development of an energy-efficient building code under Ministry of Construction.
Outputs and ratings for each are summarized below:

    · EVN's DSM Program. Under this component, a DSM cell was established within
        EVN with five full-time staff, DSM working groups were created within each PC,
        a DSM policy framework was fully developed, five pilot lighting programs were
        developed and evaluated, about 30 energy audits were conducted, a pilot load
        research program was implemented in 150 customer premises and corresponding
        load profiles developed, a pilot time-of-use (TOU) metering program was
        launched and evaluated and a second phase investment program was prepared.
        One planned component, a pilot street lighting program, was cancelled due to the
        currency devaluation. This did not represent a major reduction in the overall
        project deliverables.
    · MoST Standards.         Minimum energy performance standards (MEPS) were
        developed for 3-phase industrial motors, fluorescent tube lamps, ballasts, and
        incandescent light bulbs.     These standards were reviewed by a Technical



                                            29

       Committee and MoST is now preparing to issue these standards.                An
       Implementation Plan and Future Development Plan for further standards
       development and implementation of the MEPS was also prepared and submitted.
   · MoC Building Code. The rating of the achievement of deliverables for this
       component is satisfactory.    Following an extensive building survey exercise
       covering Hanoi, HCMC and Danang, an energy-efficient building code was
       developed for high-rise office buildings and hotels. The draft code was reviewed
       by a Technical Stakeholder Committee and MoC is now preparing to issue the
       code. An Implementation Plan was also developed and submitted under the
       project.

The quality of the project outputs were all rated as satisfactory.     Each report was
carefully reviewed by the implementing agency (e.g., EVN, MoST, MoC), MoI and the
Bank team and, in most cases, detailed comments were provided. Those reports that
included more technical information or required consensus building, such as the various
policy-related documents, extensive consultations were required along with appropriate
stakeholder workshops to ensure that all views were considered and concerns addressed
as much as possible.     Those reports that required broader consultation or public
awareness were appropriately disseminated.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

Economic Analysis

The economic analysis for the project components at appraisal and at completion has
been carried out using two scenarios: (i) with the project; and (ii) without the project. The
ex ante 'with' project scenario assumed that the project as described was carried out based
on forecast costs. For investments at 500kV, the 'without' project alternative was to
strengthen the 220kV system. For investments at 220kV and below, the 'without' project
analysis assumed that no investment would be made. The ex post 'with' project scenario
used actual investment costs of the project. The 'without' project scenario assumed that
no investment had been made. The same methodology was used for both the original and
the new subprojects.

The costs and benefits were valued as shown in Table A3.1

            Table A3.1: Factor Costs and Benefits for Economic Analysis
        Cost/benefit                                     Value
        LRMC of energy at 500/220kV                      3.09 cents/kWh
        LRMC of system development at 500/220kV          2.34 cents/kWh
        LRMC of system development at 110kV              0.66 cents/kWh
        LRMC of system development at 22/35kV            1.09 cents/kWh
        LRMC of system development at LV                 2.27 cents/kWh
        Cost of unserved energy                          50 cents/kWh
        Operations and maintenance cost                  2% of investment/year

For the purposes of comparing the ex ante with the ex post costs, all costs were calculated
in constant 1995 US dollars, the base year chosen in the original appraisal. No shadow
wage rates or exchange rates were applied, and taxes and duties were excluded from the
calculation. The discount rate used was 10 percent.

The values of the economic rate of return and NPV at 10 percent for each original
subproject are as shown in Table A3.2. At appraisal, the NPV of the whole project was
$286.1million % and the EIRR 27.2%. Including the disaster reconstruction component,
the NPV was $350.6 million, and the ERR 26.3%.

Discussion

At appraisal the costs of the original subprojects were over-estimated. The completion
analysis takes into account the cost savings ­ of the order of 30 percent of the original
estimates ­ and shows a much higher rate of return than at appraisal. The net present
value of the original subprojects, however, is not as high, principally because of the
delays in completion which in some cases were four years longer than the original
implementation schedule. The impact at the financial level is less marked, because the
financial revenues are lower than the economic benefits. Notwithstanding the reduced
benefits because of delays, the subprojects were still financially efficient, except possibly
the renovation of Halong and Vinh distribution systems for which information is not
available.

The estimates at appraisal and completion for the disaster reconstruction component are
quite close. This may reflect both the short time between appraisal and implementation
and the relatively short period of implementation. The actual costs were somewhat lower
than appraised but closer: this may be a consequence of the equipment purchased largely




                                                 34

being MV and LV distribution, of which PC2 had greater experience and more recent
price information.

The additional subprojects were overall less economically and financially attractive than
the original ones. This may be the consequence of the basis for their selection ­ an
advanced state of preparation was an important criterion ­ but may also be an indicator
that marginal investment in transmission and distribution is less attractive in 2004 than in
1997. Notwithstanding that the projects were economically and financially efficient

The project was financially worth while doing from the standpoint of each of the
implementing agencies, as shown in Table A3.6. Each of the agencies has achieved
financial returns well above their cost of capital (for this kind of project, estimated to be
5.75%).

Assessment of Outcome

1. Physical investment

The transmission and medium-voltage distribution system, which is owned and operated
by EVN, has undergone substantial improvement in the past decade. Highlights include
the construction in 1997 of a 500 kV North­South link, which has been strengthened by a
second circuit and additional substations. The overall outcome of the transmission and
distribution component is rated as satisfactory. Although having suffered much delay
during preparation and bidding stages, the contract implementation stage has gone at
acceptable speed. The 110kV and 220 kV system has been expanded and upgraded,
particularly in major load centers, including cities and provinces in regional areas. These
improvements of the system under the project, combined with rehabilitation of urban
distribution networks, have reduced losses from 21.4 percent in 1995 to 11.78 percent in
2005. The improvements have also increased stability and permitted better control of the
system. The 110 kV system, the highest voltage level at which power distribution takes
place, has been expanded to meet growth in local power demand, particularly in urban
areas.

Commissioned transmission and distribution subcomponents have injected a remarkably
dependable output to EVN's power network, has been significantly contributing to
strengthening the high voltage transmission. The line also contributed to reduction of
losses and improvement of the system operation and control, thus improving the
efficiency and sustainability of EVN's power network.

The subcomponents are in line with EVN's Master Plan of 6th for the period 2006-2015
with prospective to 2025 which emphasized the development of hydropower sources in
parallel with thermal power sources. After energizing the lines the intervals between
blackouts became much longer, and the load centers, especially big cities and provinces,
have no longer suffered sudden power shortages. Upgrading the system with new
equipment installed replacing old ones contributed improvement of quality and credibility
of the power supply. Thanks to the 500kV transmission line subcomponent, North-South
exchange of power was facilitated. This possibility was clearly seen in Summer of 2005,
when the line transmitted a large output to the North and helped to relieve the situation of
power shortage there which was caused by severe droughts that rendered the
predominantly hydro based generation system overloaded.

The projects were economically efficient and met environment and social safeguards
requirements of the World Bank and of the GoV.

2. Technical Assistance for the project

With assistance of consultants, the System Study was recognized as helpful as those
carried out for the North-South 500kV Transmission Project. Moreover, it helped to


                                            41

consolidate the results already obtained and, in the meantime, to find out the ways for
designing of the new line in a cost-effective manner. The consultant also carried out
evaluation of bids and performed other tasks. Through cooperation with the foreign
consultants, the knowledge and skills of implementing agency`s staff in engineering and
management were improved considerably, especially for projects at 500kV level.
Through working with the consultants, the technical design capacity of EVN staff for
500kV projects has improved and has subsequently allowed local consultants to
undertake other projects at 500kV level.

In addition, with latest technology on gas-insulated switchgear for 220kV substations the
subproject is very helpful in terms of training skilled human resource for EVN. Some
engineers had the opportunity to participate overseas training courses at leading GIS
technology companies. This has helped many of the staff improve their knowledge of
GIS technology in particular and the latest technology general during implementation and
operation stage.

3. Project Sustainability

With 500kV transmission as the back-bone in the national network, evacuation of power
from power plants in the central region via Pleiku substation and the North-South 500kV
line and transmitting it to the South, the line can meet the additional demand for power,
with higher quality of service.     Since the high voltage system was expanded and
upgraded, the quality of power supply is much improved, contributed to reduction of
losses and improvement of the system operation and control, thus improving the
efficiency and sustainability of EVN's power network.

Most steel towers and all conductors for the line came from local manufacturers. This has
meant more jobs for people involving in manufacturing of such goods and improved the
skills and competence of local manufacturers. The substation extensions were equipped
with up-to-date equipment and technologies and expected to have a long service-life.

The project was prepared and implemented in accordance with Vietnamese Environment
and World Bank safeguard policies would help Vietnam in general and EVN in particular
step by step approach to the international practice and standard in terms of environmental
sustainable development. The compensation provided was acceptable to PAPs, ensuring
that their living after project completion would be better or at least equal to that before
project commencement. Together with the distribution network rehabilitation, people in
provinces obtaining access to improved quality and availability of power in rural areas,
which is a long-standing Government commitment, and is seen as a source of national
unity. The benefits of improvements in the quality of the life of the local people are well
understood, including increasing their income through access to improvements in
productivity. In addition, the quality of life improvements have positive, but indirect,
social benefits.

The government is committed to sector reform as evidenced by the passing of the
Electricity Law by the National Assembly at the end of 2004 and the start it has made in
implementing its provisions. It has given further evidence of its understanding of the


                                             42

need for meeting the financing challenge by launching its equitization program and
announcement of its plans to equitize a number of other subsidiaries.

At the project level, the government has demonstrated commitment through its approvals
process. With the project restructure in June 2005, each subproject has been identified by
EVN as a priority and EVN itself has demonstrated commitment to improved service
quality and meeting increasing demand.        Besides continued EVN commitment, the
sustainability of the project relies on continued growth in demand for power in Vietnam
and matching the transmission system growth with expansion of generation capacity.
Demand growth appears robust, while the issue of increasing generation capacity is well
understood at all levels of government and EVN.

Performance Assessment

1. Bank performance

The Bank performance of the project initial stages was recognized as satisfactory: from
preparation of environmental impacts assessment, preparation of RFP for selection of
international consultant, bidding documents for goods, to the evaluation of bids. All work
was implemented with the Bank's comments being taken into account and the Bank's
Guidelines being followed.

The Bank's supervision performance was satisfactory. It is clear evidence that through
supervision missions and working visits, the work progress and matters arisen were
monitored and measures were recommended. Also, through the Bank's supervision, the
implementing agency could make necessary adjustment to develop a realistic work
schedule. In order to complete and fulfill the development objectives of the project, the
Bank team has contributed and played a very important role. With their strong support
and close cooperation, project implementation has been improved in terms of progress
speeding up and avoids longer delays.

2. Borrower performance

The transmission and distribution subsector portfolio has generally performed well during
the past 10 years. Closed projects have met their objectives and TD1 has been rated
satisfactory with respect to their development objectives throughout its lifetime.
Implementation progress for the project is satisfactory and has mostly been so during
their lifetimes.

The good project implementation record reflects the increasing capacity of the EVN
subsidiaries. Implementing agencies now manage subprojects throughout the investment
cycle, from identification through appraisal, procurement, implementation, and
commissioning. International consultant support and "turnkey" approaches are confined
to deployment of newer technologies, and they have become the exception rather than the
rule.




                                             43

Transmission and distribution system must keep up with rapid growth and change in
patterns of electricity demand. EVN has responded to this by periodically reviewing and
reassigning the priorities for individual sub-projects. The implementing agencies'
improved capacity and greater responsiveness make this possible.

Key Lessons Learned

With very long period of the project implementation, covering sites along the country
from the North to the South, and being one of the first IDA financed transmission and
distribution projects of EVN, implementing agencies have faced many difficulties during
project preparation and implementation. Experience from the project suggests that close
cooperation with local authorities and services, departments, and sections would be
advantages for agencies during implementing stage and it was a critical reason
determining the success of the project.

With many subprojects with a large volume of works and goods procurement, it is
important to ensure acceptable packaging and well prepared procurement plans. This
would minimize delay in procurement processing. The supply of materials and equipment
for overhead lines should be done by National Competitive Bidding and should be
included in packages for foundations, pole erection and installation of overhead lines.

It is very important to anticipate delay in approval stage of the project documents such as
F/S, Technical Design and Cost Estimates in order to have a project implementation plan
prepared precisely and realistically. Project implementation was often slower than the
schedule set out in the feasibility study; the major reason being that changes to the project
and direction of underground cables and overhead lines was very common.

Specific responsibilities of consultant have to be agreed clearly during negotiation and
preparing the contract. For example, the consultants have to take full responsibility for
the entire process including design, agreement of intersection between transmission lines
and underground works construction, waterway and road construction; preparing bidding
documents, evaluation, negotiation and contract signing; review and approval for
technical documents, supervision and checking before acceptance stage.                  The
performance of contracts for consulting services must be controlled closely to avoid
expenses rising above the signed and approved total contract value.

All of the high and medium voltage equipment, control, and measurement and protection
systems of GIS substation should be designed simultaneously.
