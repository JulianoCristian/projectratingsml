                    OF
EMERGENCY SUPPORT FOR SOCIAL SERVICES PROJECT
                   LOAN

                 May 22, 2012
          GUATEMALA — EMERGENCY SUPPORT FOR SOCIAL SERVICES
                              P122370
                         LOAN NO. IBRD-79880

                                   Restructuring Paper



1. The closing date for Guatemala - Emergency Support for Social Services [Loan No.
   IBRD-79880, P122370] will be extended from June 30, 2012 until December 31,
   2012.

2. The loan was approved by the Guatemalan Congress on November 24, 2011, and
   became effective on December 22, 2011. A retroactive disbursement of US$40
   million was made on December 29, 2011, and the request for a second disbursement
   is currently being prepared. Project implementation has been satisfactory and
   progress towards achieving the project development objective remains on track.

3. The proposed extension is necessary in light of the delayed Congressional approval
   and the resulting delay in the effectiveness of the loan. The extension would give the
   Borrower a full 12 months for implementation of the project.

4. This will be the first extension of the project.
