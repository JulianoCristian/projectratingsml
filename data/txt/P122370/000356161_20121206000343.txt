                                RESTRUCTING PAPER

A. SUMMARY

1. The Borrower has requested a restructuring of the Project in order to facilitate the
   disbursement of the remaining loan proceeds within the 2012 budget and improve the
   monitoring of the project outcomes. The proposed changes include a reallocation of
   loan proceeds among existing categories as well as a revision of the results
   framework.


B. PROJECT STATUS

2. Project implementation is satisfactory. As of November 26, US$89.5 million of the
   US$100 million loan amount has been disbursed. Progress towards achieving the
   project development objective remains on track.

3. This is the second restructuring of the project. The first restructuring, approved in
   May 2012, extended the project closing date from June 30, 2012 to December 31,
   2012, to give the Borrower a full year of project implementation following a delay in
   the loan’s Congressional approval.


C. PROPOSED CHANGES

   Project outcome indicators: There are two sets of changes to the outcome
    indicators:

           o Baseline and target values for the two existing outcome indicators
             (number of teachers, Telesecundaria facilitators and health workers) have
             been adjusted based on official data received from the Ministry of
             Education and the Ministry of Public Health and Social Assistance.

           o Two results indicators were added to provide additional evidence that the
             project development objective is being met. These indicators measure the
             total wage bill for teachers, Telesecundaria facilitators and health workers
             in the 130 prioritized municipalities.

    The data for these two sets of indicators suggests that basic education and healthcare
    services have been maintained in the 130 prioritized municipalities. The revised
    results framework is presented in Annex 1.
