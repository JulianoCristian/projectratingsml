and education services following severe flooding and\n            other natural disasters that took place in Guatemala between\n            May and September 2010. The closing date for the project\n            will be extended from June 30, 2012 until December 31, 2012.\n            The loan was approved by the Guatemalan Congress on November\n            24, 2011, and became effective on December 22, 2011. A\n            retroactive disbursement of US$40 million was made on\n            December 29, 2011, and the request for a second disbursement\n            is currently being prepared. The project implementation has\n            been satisfactory and progress towards achieving the project\n            development objective remains on track. The extension is\n            necessary in light of the delayed Congressional approval and\n            the resulting delay in the effectiveness of the loan. The\n            extension will give the Borrower a full 12 months for\n            implementation of the project. This will be the first\n            extension of the project."}, "docdt": "2012-05-22T00:00:00Z"}
