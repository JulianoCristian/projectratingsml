Emergency Support for\n            Social Services Project for Guatemala were as follows:\n            outcomes were moderately satisfactory, risk to development\n            outcome was moderate, Bank performance was moderately\n            satisfactory, and Borrower performance was moderately\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: this Emergency\n            Recovery Loan (ERL) provides a means of designing a\n            fast-disbursing project with the aim of achieving\n            medium-term objectives that the government and the Bank are\n            in joint agreement on. This type of loan can also be useful\n            in the event of an emergency where the government is trying\n            to obtain funding quickly but not have the lead time to\n            implement development policy reforms. Project design should\n            take into account the country's existing reporting\n            systems. It is important to manage the administrative\n            burdens that come with ERL (as opposed to development policy\n            loans). These burdens include compliance with safeguards and\n            the preparation of operational manuals, even though the loan\n            did not finance any investments and only reimbursed teacher\n            and health worker salaries. The triggering of safeguards in\n            particular created substantial work- including environmental\n            plans, operational manuals, discussions and follow-up, in\n            order to deal with an issue that seemed beyond the scope of\n            the project. Such administrative requirements need to be\n            carefully considered upfront and explained to the client\n            during project preparation."}, "docdt": "2013-06-14T00:00:00Z"}
