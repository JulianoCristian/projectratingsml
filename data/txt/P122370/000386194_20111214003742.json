flooding and other\n            natural disasters that took place in Guatemala between May\n            and September 2010. The most relevant environmental issue\n            resulting from the implementation of this project is the\n            production of Hospital Solid Waste (HSW). Now the every\n            hospital and facility in the public health network is aware\n            and familiar with the regulatory framework and the standards\n            and practices to manage HSW properly. The general\n            comptroller conducted an environmental audit in the 43\n            public hospitals, to encourage compliance with the HSW and\n            waste water management regulations."}, "docdt": "2011-11-01T00:00:00Z"}
