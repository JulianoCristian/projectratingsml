This environmental assessment looked at 7\n            areas and drew the following conclusions: a) ground, soil,\n            and geologic assessment - no major environmental or\n            resettlement problems; b) hydrological characteristics -\n            possible problems due to area fragility and watershed\n            proximity, mitigated by water quality maintenance and\n            pre-treatment ponds and ditches; c) landscaping &\n            cultural heritage - impacts mitigated by visual and specific\n            measures during construction and operation; d) air &\n            noise pollution - expected to be below legal standards,\n            though noise levels will remain high due to increased\n            traffic and equipment noises; e) land use development plans\n            - the project is in accordance with the current land use\n            plan; f) health & stress - mitigated by the construction\n            of a direct access road to the site and a landscaped earthen\n            dike bordering the residential area; and g) potential for\n            birds to endanger air traffic - mitigated by closed refuse\n            containers and a waste separation system."}, "docdt": "1996-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
