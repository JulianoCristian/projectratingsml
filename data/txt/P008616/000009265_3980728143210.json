There are two components. The first\n            component 1) builds a fruit and vegetable hall complete with\n            buyers' walkways and a provisions hall; 2) builds a\n            flower hall with open stalls and storage rooms; 3)\n            constructs an office building for use by the PHCRS (Gdansk\n            wholesale market company) administration, maintenance, and\n            security staff; 4) constructs ancillary buildings composed\n            of a canopy covering the road, a toll booth, an office where\n            entry fees will be collected and departure checks carried\n            out, and a weighbridge with an inspection pit and customs\n            control point; 5) groundwork and infrastructure including\n            all heavy earth moving, creation of parking lots,\n            construction of the road to the main highway, and fencing as\n            well as installation of on-site water, sewage, electricity,\n            gas, and telecommunications; and 6) pre-start-up expenses,\n            working capital, and any fees and charges during\n            construction. The second component 1) sets up a surface\n            water drainage system that includes pipework to the existing\n            culvert and a treatment plant to treat vehicle spillage and\n            surface water; and 2) installs pipelines to connect the\n            sewage system and the drinking water system, and connects\n            the wholesale market to a gas supply line as well as\n            interfacing with the public electricity and\n            telecommunications networks."}, "docdt": "1998-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
