Rapid development of\n            other competing large markets affected achievement of\n            project outcome and objectives pertaining to sustainability.\n            Lessons drawn from the project include: 1) The rapid\n            development of contemporary private marketing\n            infrastructure, notably supermarkets and discount\n            wholesalers was not foreseen at the time that the project\n            concept was created. 2) It should not be taken for granted\n            that the clients, i.e. the traders and their customers, will\n            flock to the new market, merely by its being there. 3)\n            Legally binding agreements on enforcement of pertinent laws\n            with respect to market operations should be entered into\n            with national and local authorities. 4) Revenue of\n            traditional wholesale markets, i.e. those whose activities\n            are limited to trade in perishable agriculture products, is\n            insufficient to support investments required, notably when\n            the costs of contemporary requirements to fulfill sanitary\n            and environmental considerations are taken into account. 5)\n            As in any other business venture, the sustainability and\n            development of a wholesale market depends to a large degree\n            on the adaptive skills and creativity of its management. 6)\n            Projects based on joint stock companies as their\n            institutional structure are liable to exhibit all problems\n            that are inherent in corporate structures."}, "docdt": "2001-06-19T00:00:00Z"}
