F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
The development objective of the project is to reduce the participating country's financial
vulnerability to natural disasters (earthquakes and hurricanes). This is being achieved
through the provision of financing to allow these countries to join the Caribbean
Catastrophe Risk Insurance Facility and the purchase of financial protection against
catastrophic hurricane and/or earthquake losses.

 t. Project Conte~t, Development Objectives and Design

 1.1 Context at Appraisal

1.      Caribbean countries are highly exposed to adverse natural events (including
hurricanes, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, and tidal waves), which can result in
disasters affecting their entire economic, human, and physical environment. Based on the
experience since 1970, a natural disaster inflicting damage equivalent to more than 2
percent of the affected country's GDP can be expected to hit the Caribbean basin once
every two and half years.

2.      Larger countries can generally absorb the impact of these events by subsidizing an
affected region with revenues from unaffected parts of the country. This type of
geographic diversification of risk is limited in the small island states of the Caribbean.
Similarly; Caribbean countries have limited borrowing capacity, preventing them from
spreading risk over time by accessing credit. Finally, Caribbean island states· have
limited access to international insurance markets. High transaction costs, and the
relatively small business brought to the market keep insurance penetration in the region
to a minimum. Constrained by their size, limited borrowing capacity and poor access to
insurance, thest countries are less able to cope with losses from adverse natural events
and lack resilience to the onset of disasters.

3.      A critical need of the governments of small states in the aftermath of a disaster is
for short-term liquidity to maintain essential government services until additional
resources becOme available. With low level of fmancial reserves and limit~d access to
credit and insurance, mobilizing resources after a major disaster will often take months
and absorb energy that would be better used elsewhere. This translates into delayed
response, financial stress, and additional hardship for the afiected population.

4.     Following the devastation caused by hurricanes in the Caribbean in 2004, the
CARICOM Heads of State requested World Bank assistance to gain access to affordable
and effective disaster risk financing instruments. In January 2006, with· grant funding
from the Government of Japan and support from the Jamaican Social Development Fund
(JSDF). the World Bank initiated the preparatory studies for the establishment of the
CCRIF. The Facility was established in May 2007 and started operations one month later,
providing coverage to 16 Caribbean countries, including Dominica, Grenada, St. Lucia,
8t. Vincent. & the Grenadines, Anguilla,· Antigua and Barbuda, Belize, the Bahamas~
Barbados, Bermuda, the Cayman Islands,. Haiti, Jamaica, S1. Kitts and Nevis. Trinidad
and Tobago, and the Turks and Caicos Islands. The CCRIF receives support from a
Multi-donor Trust Fund (MDTF) established with contributions from Bermuda, Canada,
France, Ireland, the United Kingdom, the Caribbean Development Bank. the European
Union, and IBRD.

5.      The Caribbean Catastrophe Risk Insurance Facility (CCRIF) provides
participating countries with catastrophe insurance coverage against major earthquakes



                                           1
 and/or hurricanes (see Box 1). The Facility enables governments to purchase liquidity
 coverage that helps protect their .budget against the shock of natural disasters. The
 CCRIF provides rcash payout within weeks of an insured evertt (to date, within three
 weeks) to help the affected country address immediate financial needs. The 16 countries,
 that joined CCRIFat inception are still members of the Facility today.

 1.2 0rigiaaI Prejeet Development Objectives (POO) aDd Key IDdieators '

 6.      The project development objective .was to reduce the country financial
 vulnerability to natural disaSters (earthquakes and hurricanes) of Dominica, Grenada, St.
 Lucia, and St. Vincent & the Grenadines (SVG). This was achieved by providing IDA
 credit to allow the above-mentioned island countries to join the CCRIF and' purchase
 financial protection against catastrophic earthquake and/or hurricane perils. Given the
 islands' fragile economic and fiscal situation, it was unlikely that they would have joined
 this pilot initiative without this credit. As such, the 'project supported the eStablishment
 and viability of the CCRIF, which was believed to require at least eight members to
 become viable.

 7.     The key. intennediate indicators for the project were: (i)  Thetotal claims paying
 capacity of theCCRIF and (ii) the total sum insured for each country.

 1.4 Main Beneficiaries

 '9.      The main beneficiaries were the governments (Ministry of Finance) of Dominica,
  Grenada, 81. Lucia, and 8t. Vincent & the Grenadines. allowing these governments to
  respond more effectively to the initial needs of the affected population r~ulting from
  adverse natural events. In this regard, CCRIF was an efficient and cost-effective
  alternative to trying to obtain insuranCe in the market individually or retaining the
, financial risk by building own reserves.

 10.     The propo-sed project provided the. Borrowers with insurance coverage against
 natural disasters (earthquakes and hurricanes). .The project financed the participation fee
 and the annual country-specific insurance premiums (100 percent of the premium for the
 first two years· and 50 percent for the third year) necessary to join and obtain annual
 coverage from the CCRIF.

 11.    The IDA financing was provided in four installments issu~ to CCRIF at the
 request of each country's Ministry of Finance. The financing was 'withdrawn by the
 borrower from"its credit account for direct payment into the Facility. The project
 included the following two components: (a) payment of participation fee and (b)
 contribution to annual insurance premium for the flfSt three years.

14.     Component B, which is the contribution to annual insurance premium for the first
three years~ was revised during the project execution .to process a 50 percent
reimbursement of St. Lucia and Dominica~s respective 20101l I premiums. This was
made possible by savings generated due to their participation fees and premiums being.
less than estimated in the PAD and an increase in the U.S. dollar value of the SDR.

2. Key Faetors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 ProjeetPreparation, Design and Quality at Entry

16.     Lessons'from earlier operations, including the Turkish Catastrophe Insurance Pool
and previous attempts at designing catastrophe pools for the Caribbean region and
developing parametric insurance solutions were taken into account in the preparation of
this operation. '"

       •   Need for initial reserves: Previous experience in setting up insurance pools
           shows that there is a need for a minimum level of reserves in the pool to make
           it financially sustainable over the long run. Insufficient reserves in the CCRIF
           would have lead to over-dependence on costly risk transfer instruments,
           reducing the capacity of the Facility to increase its reserves over time. Initial
           donor contributions of US$67.4 million helped put the CCRIF 'on a sound
           financial track from the beginning by reimbursing CCRIF for certain
           administrative, operational, and R&D costs and for claims paid within its own
           risk retention. The expectation was to build up its reserves to USSIOO million
           within five years.
       •   Need for state-of-the-art catastrophe risk modeling: With support financing
           from the Government of Japan, support from JSDF. and specialized
           consultants, the team built a sophisticated catastrophe risk model for each
           Caribbean island country and for the region as a whole. This was essential to
           ensure the sound design and pricing of the parametric (earthquake and
           hurricane) insurance products that the CCRIF was to offer.            .
       •   Need for transparency: The CCRIF's country-specitic catastrophe fisk
           models allow for the transparent pricing of catastrophe insurance products.
           The pricing fonnula takes into account the specific risk profjle of each country.
      •    The need for e.arly involvement of donors and extensive consultation with
           member countries: The task team engaged early on in a gradual process of
           consultation and workshops with donors, officials~ and experts from the region
           to ensure that the CCRIF initiative would be tailored to the needs of the client
           countries and well understood.


                                          5
        •     Critical business volume: A minimum number of countries, estimated at eight,
              was reqpired to ensure that the Facility would .have the diversification in its
              portfolw necessary to offer competitive and affordable pricing on the
              coverage provided. The IDA financing under this project ensured that the
              poorest countries in the region could join the Facility at its inception.

, 2.2 Implementation

 17.    The 'credit proceeds were transferred annually from the Bank to the CCRIF
 account at the request of each country's Ministry of Finance. To effect the transfer, the
 Ministry of FinMlce submitted a withdrawal application for the value of the participation
 fee and/or premium. The value dates of the'direct payments to the CCRIF of the credit
 proceeds for the IDA-contribution to the beneficiary countries' participation fees and
 annual insurance premiums are presented in Table 3.

 18.     The CCRIF insurance policy period. that is the period during which the
 participating country is insured, is from June 1 to May 31 of the following year. Standard
 insurance contracts are effective once the premium is paid.
                       'f


 19.     In close cpllaboration with the Facility Supervisor, the Bank liaised with the
 participating Ministries of Finance and the CCRIF to ensure that the premium payments
 were made on time and the insurance policy issued for each country by the start of the
 season.

 20.     As a result of the financial crisis of 2008, Dominica, Orenada, and St. .Lucia chose
 to secure additional financing from the COB        to covet the 50 percent portion of their
 2008-2009 premium not paid by IDA. The IDA contribution to half of the country
 premium that year could only be processed once the country had paid the other half of the
 premium. Largely because of this, the direct payment of the IDA contribution to the
 CCRIF for the four countries occurred after the date of June 1. To avoid lapse in
 coverage, CCRIF established a premium payment warranty until the premiums were
 collected, so that the insurance coverage started on June 1. The additional IDA direct
 disbursements to CCRIF in 2010 and 2011 on behalf of St. Lucia and Dominica,
 respectively) were made after the countries had paid their premium in full and, as a result,
 the CCRIF made a corresponding refund to them.

2.3 MonitoriDgami Evaluation (M&E) J)esip, ImplemeDtatiH aDd Utilization

21.    Followmg 1be results monitoring framework approved in the Project Appraisal
Document (PAD), the Bank conducted in-depth reviews of the CCRIF's first. second, and
third years of operations, including interviews with CCRIF members. donors,· other
stakeholders, and CCRIF Directors and service providers. The Bank regularly reviewed
the CCRIF's quarterly and annual reports, including its unaudited and audited financial
statements. In addition, the Bank attended nearly all CCRIF Board meetings as an
observer.

2.4 Safeguard did Fiduciary CompHanee

22.    The project was classified under category C.

23.     Due to the specifics ofthe·project components and implementation arrangements.
most standard fiduciary requirements and procedures did not apply to the project.
Because the IDA disbursements went directly to the ·CCRIF's account, the countries'
participation ~ project financial management was limited to the annual submission of a
withdrawal application requesting direct payment from the World Bank to the CCRIF.
The Ministries of Finance of the· respective countries had sufficient capacity to do so.
The Bank closely monitored the project implementation process to ensure that payments
were requested and processed on time. A financial supervision mission to the CCRIF
Insurance Manager's office in the Cayman Islands verified his capacity to ensure that the
IDA disbursements were used for their intended purposes. The project components did
not finance works or consulting services and the only.contracts were the participation and
annual insurance contracts between the CCRIF and the four countries. Thus, there was.
no need for a procurement plan.

2.5 Post-completion OperationINext Phase

24.    The Bank will continue to supervise the CCRIF until the IDA~administered
MDTF is fully disbursed. As of the end of January 2011, $4.1 million remained available
to CCRIF under its Grant Agreement. An additional $1 million remained in the MDTF
which bas not yet been transferred to the Grant Agreement


3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

25.     The project was consistent with the. COl.U1try.Assistance Strategy (CAS) for the
OECS discussed by the Board on September 6, 2005, and specifically supported the
objective of reducing vulnerability to natural disasters (second pillar of the CAS).




                                         7
26.      The project also supported the Bank's declared objective to encourage regional
integration. The CCRIF is now widely known in the Caribbean and seen as a regional
institution establislfed for its members' common benefit.

27.     In the higher-level strategic context, the project contributed to the objective
spelled out in Section IV of the Millennium Development Goals. underscoring the need
"to intensity our collective effort to reduce the number and effects of natural and man-
made disasters."

28.     St. Lucia and Dominica were affected by a November 29, 2007, earthquake of
sufficient magnitude to trigger a payout under their CCRIF policies. S1. Lucia and Sf.
Vincent & the' Grenadines received CCRIF payouts following Hurricane Tomas in
October 2010. In each case, payouts from the CCRIF al,fhieved their objective of helping
the countries to address the immediate financial impact of the disaster.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

29.     The project development objective was to reduce the financial vulnerability to
natural disasters (earthquakes and hurricanes) of Dominica, Grenada, St. Lucia, and S1.
Vincent & the Grenadines. This objective was achieved by providing financing to allow
beneficiary cotmtries to join the CCRIF and pur9hase financial protection against
catastrophic earthquake and/or hurricane events.

30.    The IDA credit allowed the four OECS countries to join the CCRIF from its onset,
thus contributing to the Facility's viability. More specifically. the IDA credit financed
the participation fee for Dominica, Grenada, St. Lucia, and S1. Vincent & the Grenadines.
In addition, the IDA credit financed 100 percent of their premiums for hurricane and
earthquake insurance for 2007·2008 and 2008-2009, 50 percent of those premiums for
2009-2010 and, for Dominiea and St. Lucia, 50 percent of those premiums again for
2010·2011. This achieved the PDO because,by joining CCRIF and purchasing insurance,
the beneficiary countries reduced their financial vulnerability to hurricanes and
earthquakes.                              .

31.     Multiple payouts have shown the effectiveness of CCRIF insurance in terms of
reducing the country's financial vulnerability to natural disasters. st. Lucia and
Dominica received CCRIF payouts of US$419,000 and US$528,000, respectively,
following the November 29, 2007, earthquake. , They received these payouts on
December 12 and 13,2007, respectively, only two weeks after the insured event hit the
islands. After Hurricane Tomas in October 2010, St. Lucia and St. Vincent & the
Grenadines received CCRIF payouts of US$3,241,613 and OS$I,090,388 million,
respectively, within three weeks of the passage of the hurricane.




                                         8
32.     The Project also achieved its intenne<.iiate outcomes.

         •    First, C'XRIF bas become a sustainable facility. The indicator for this in the
              PAD was its claims paying capacity. As of end~November 2010~ CCRIF's
              unaudited financial statements indicated that it had shareholder equity of
              S82.6 million and total assets of S111.1 million. In contrast, the PAD seems
              not to have anticipated that the CCRIF's reserves would exceed $80.0 million
             (e.g., see Figure A.l L4~ page 41). For 2010-2011 (beginning June 1,2010),
             CCRIF obtained $111 million in reinsurance on top of the $20 million in risk
             that it retained. With this $131 million in claims paying capacity, the CCRIF
             is estimated to be able to withstand a series of events having a modeled
             probability of occurring only 1 in 1.000 years. Given its additional resources
             (over and above the first $20 million), the Facility is estimated'to have the
             capacity to pay claims above the top of its reinsurance associated with a
             series of events having a modeled probability of occurring only 1 inl 0,000
             y,ears, although it would need a recapitalization thereafter to continue
             operations, In contrast, the PAD did not anticipate that the Facility's claims
             paying capacity would go beyond a 1 in 250 year event over the first five
             years of its operation (see 1'8. 43). The CCRI.F's claims paying capacity
             significantly exceeds that of the California Earthquake Authority - 1 in 800
             yeats - which is considere<.i among the safest insurance facilities in the world.
             Thus~ the CCRIF should be able to continue to provide liquidity coverage to
             interested countries for the foreseeable future.
        •    Second, the countries are benefiting from partial coverage against hurricane
             and earthquake risks. The indicator for this in the PAD was the insured sum
             for each country (up to 20 percent of total losses)..For 2010-2011, the four
             project beneficiaries' aggregate .coverage stood' at $108 million ($83.6
             million for hurricanes and $24 million for earthquakes), compared with the
             expectation of $100 million in aggregate coverage by project end.

3.3 Efficlmcy

33.     The Bank and the Facility Supervisor worked closely with the participating
countries to design the most cost-effective coverage of the insured hazards through the
selection of the tenns and conditions of the insurance policies (e.g., attachment points,
exhaustion points and coverage).

34.    The cost of insurance (that is, the annual insimmcepremium) is driven by three
main factors: the annual expected loss, the operating cost and the cost of capital. The·
annual expected loss reflects the insured risk exposure of the country.

   •   The CCRIF's annual expected loss rises in line with its exposure andlor the
       modeled frequency of its claims payments.
   •   Th.e Operations Manual of the CCRIF establishes a guideline that- the annual
       operating costs (excluding the reinsurance co,sts. research and development, and
       technical assistance and broad stakeholder outreach activities) should not exceed


                                           9
       5 percent of the annw;d premium volume and the operating costs have remained
       within this guideline. In comparison, it should be noted that standard operating.
       costs in the1ion-life insurance market are usually close to 30 percent.
   •   Securing capital to· cover excess losses is another cost and the ·CCRIF has also
       been efficient in this regard. Through CCRIF, its 16 members have derived the
       benefits of regional risk diversification. It is estimated that, for CCRIF~s 2008-
       2009 portfolio, its aggregate probable maximum loss (PML) from a 1 in 1,500
       year event is 74 percent lower than the sum of the countries' individual policy
       limits. This means that the amount of capital which is needed to sustain such a
       remote event is 74 percent lower when countries pool their risks through the
       CCRIFthan if they were to go to the insurance market individually to cover such
       an event. The CCRIF is also efficient compared with the costs its members would
       incur if they retained the catastrophe risk themselves, i.e., built their own reserves
       to sustain the event -approximately 70 percent less expensive for hurricane risk
       and 50 percent less expensive for earthquake risk: In addition, due its transparent,
       wen structured, and diversified portfolio,the CCRIF has been able to access the
       reinsurance market on very good terms. The reinsurance multiples (reinsurance
       premiums/annual expected reinsurance loss) were lower than two for the CCRIF's
       first three seasons and, although the cost rose somewhat for the CCRIF's fourth
       season, due to its introduction of a new hazard loss estimation model, it remained
       advan~eous. As reinsurers are gaining familiarity with the new model. it is
       likely that costs will again decline.

35.     In addition, the CCRIF has been able to reduce its premium rates for its members
by 30 percent since its establisbment, because of its growing financial strength, supported
by the MDTF•. low reinsurance costs. and significantly lower than expected indemnity
payouts during its first three years of operation. More specifically, the premium
multiples (insurance premium/annual expected insurance loss) decreased successively by
10 percent from the first to the second season, 11 percent from the second to the third
season, and another 12.5. percent from the third to the fourth season. Most of the
participating countries decided to take advantage of the improved pricing by increasing
their insurance coverage and/or lowering their attachment point (insurance deductible),
rather than by lowering their premium payment.         '

36.    Table 4 summarizes the evolution of the catastrophe coverage of the four island
countries over the first three seasons, 2007-10. Dominica, Grenada and St Lucia and
have seen their hurricane and earthquake coverage limit increased while their total annual
premium remained constant, as a direct consequence of the annual decrease of the
insurance premium rate. The total annual insurance premium of Grenada increased from
USDl.125 million to USD1.425 million as a direct ~nsequence ofa higber coverage and
lower attachment points under its hurricane insurance policy. Finally, note that the.
attachment points of the earthquake and hurricane policies of St. Vincent & the
Grenadines increased slightly_

3.4 Justifieation of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Satisfactory

38.     The primary development objective of this project, i.e., the four countries are
eligible for insurance payouts (and have received payouts in case of an insured event),'
was fully met. Dominica, Grenada, S1. Lucia, and St. Vincent & the Grenadines joined
the CCRIF in May 2007 and have purchased catastrophe insurance coverage for each of
the CCRIF's four years of operation. Sf. Lucia and Dominica received an insurance

  payout (US$419,000 and U8$528,000, respectively) triggered by the earthquake that hit
  the Caribbean basin on November 29,2007. st. Lucia and St. Vincent &, the Grenadines
. respectively recei~ US$3,241~613 and US$.,090,388 million following Hurricane
  Tomas in October 2010. These payouts are believed to be the first significanffinancial
  inflowstbat the cOuntries received following the catastrophes.

 3.5 Overarehing Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

 (a> Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

39.    Natural'" disasters have a disproportional impact on poorer segments of the
populatioa Low-income households often settle in the most vulnerable areas and live in
poorly constructed housing. With .low savings, the poor are also less able to cope
economically with the loss of fixed assets or livelihoods that they are likely to suffer after
a catastrophe. Being more vulnerable, they are also more dependent on government
support and relief and recovery programs. Payouts to St. Lucia, Dominica and St.
Vincent &, the Grenadines ensured that an initial inflow of resources for such programs
was immediately available to them at a time when their fiscal pressures were particularly
acute. According to the Governments of these three countries, payouts helped to restore
quickly power grids, water systems. and other basic services.

 (b) Institutional ChangeiStreagtheDiDg

 40.     The project contributed to an increased awareness among the Finance Ministrie$
 about the economic and fiscal impacts of natural disasters on their countries and the role
 that financial risk transfer can play as part of a broader national disaster risk reduction
 and management strategy. It also contributed to build capacity in the area financial
 disaster risk management in the respective Caribbean islands. Ongoing dialogue between
 CCRlF and officials from the Ministries of Finance, including in some cases the
 insurance supervisors, particularly at the time of policy renewal, helped to inform them
 about their country's exposure to adverse natural events. Their participation in deci~ion­
 making regarding the terms of the CCRlF insurance policies (attachment points,
 exhaustion points, coverage limits, ceding percentages, etc.) helped build their
 understanding of the products. As officials of CCRlF members, they have had
 opportunities to participate in workshops and events organized or co-organized by
 CCRlF on comprehe11$ive disaster risk management and climate change. adaptation.
 Officials from the four OECS countries. including officials from the national emergency
 management agencies and/or meteorological institutes, participated in the comprehensive
 disaster management conferences in 2008, 2009, and 2010. They also attended a number
 of CCRIF-sponsored workshops on topics such as rainfall modeling and the economics of
 climate adaptation.

 41.   The CCRlF has also been promoting the appointment'designation of a Country
 Risk Officer in each country. The CRO would be responsible for the overall disaster risk
 management strategy of the country; including the ~sca1 protection of ,the state against



                                            12
natural disasters. This proposition is currently under discussion among the participating
countries.

(c) OtllerUnintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

42.    There is anecdotal evidence from interviews conducted during the Bank's FY
2011 supervision mission that the project has helped increase interactions among finance .
ministry, national emergency management, and meteorological and hydrological officials
regarding disaster risk exposure and disaSter risk financing.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: Moderate.

44.     The beneficiary countries' continuing fiscal constraints are the principal risk to
the sustainability of the PD~, but this risk is believed to be moderate. It is likely that the
value of CCRlF insurance will bea topic for discussion during the countries' annual
budget process; however. the recent CCRlF payouts to Haiti following January 2010
earthquake in Haiti,· to Antigua and Barbuda after Hurricane Earl. and to Barbados, St.
Lucia. and St. Vincent & the Grenadines in the aftermath of Hurricane Tomas provide a
powerful argument in favor of the benefits of fmancial risk transfer through purchase of
CCRlF insurance. Solidarity with other Caribbean countries. support for an increasingly
visible and important Caribbean institution. and access to CCRlF-funded technical
assistance and knowledge-sharing programs are additional incentives to continue
membership. Thus, while the countries will likely continue to look for possible financing
for their CCRlF premiums l , it is probable that they will make every effort to continue
their participation in CCRIF. It should be noted that even in the unlikely event that fiscal
pressures impelled one or more of the four beneficiary countries to leave the Facility, its
sustamability would not be seriously threatened. The CCRlF is estimated to need only
eight countries to have a sufficiently diversified, portfolio to be able to obtain reinsurance .
onaceeptable terms and offer affordable catastrophe coverage. In addition, it should be


 I For the third year of the project, IDA funding for the countries' premiums was reduced to 50 percent,
with the expectation that they would draw on their own resources to pay the balance. Dominica, Grenada,
and St. Lucia took advantage of the COB's offer of finance to defray the 50 percent not covered by IDA.
For 2010-2011, Dominica and St. Lucia unexpectedly were able to benefit from project savings and a
depreciation in the US$!SDR exchange rate to obtain IDA financing again for 50 percent of their premium.
In addition, with the CCRIF Board's decision to reduce the requirement for the participation deposit from
100 percent of the annuaJ premium to 50 percent, Dominica, Grenada, and St. Lucia drew on their deposits
to pay a portion of their premiums. Dominica, Grenada, and St. Vincent &. the Grenadines still have
participation deposits in excess of 50 percent of their premium, but St. Lucia does no~

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Satisfactory

  45.     The Bank responded efficiently to a request from the CARICOM Heads of State
to   gain access to affordable and effective disaster risk financing instrument by assisting in
  the establishment of the CCRIF. It mobilized and coordinated highly specialized
  expertise to design and implement the Caribbean Catastrophe Risk Insurance Facility.
  This was a path·breaking effort as the Facility is the first regional parametric'catastrophe
  risk pool in the world. One area where quality at entry could have been improved was
  the results framework, particularly the intermediate outcome indicators. which lacked
  specificity. For the first such outcome, '''CCRIF is created as a sustainable Facility," the
  indicator was '1otal claims-paying capacity." The PAD might have established a target
  for this capacity, expressed in terms of either an absolute amount of CCRIF assets or the
  return period of a series of events it should be able to withstand. For the second •
  intermediate outcome, "country benefits from partial coverage against hurricane and
. earthquake risks." the' indicator was "total sum insured for each country (UP to 20010 of
  total losses)." It was implicit that "losses" referred to those suffered by the government,
  rather than physical damage in the ~ountry, and to those incurred within the return period
  between the attachment and exhaustion points of the country's policies. It would have
  been preferable fo:r:,these matters to have been made explicit.

(b) Quality of Supervision

 Rating: Highly satisfactory

46.     The OECS Catastrophe Insurance Project itself required little direct supervision
because there was no procurement and funds did not pass through institutions or accounts
of the beneficiary countries, but rather went directly to the CCRIF. However, as Project
success depended crucially on the CCRIF's success and as the CCRIF was highly
innovative - the first regional catastrophe risk insurance pc>91 established worldwide - the
Bank supervised the Facility intensively. Accordingly, during the OECS Catastrophe
Insurance Project's three-year implementation period, the Bank conducted thfee in-depth
supervision missions and produced two mid-term review reports. These reports and their
recommendations were shared and discussed with the CCRIF Board of Directors and
service providers. some CCRIF members. and other stakeholders, including donors and
Caribbean regional organizations. The findings and recommendations of the third
supervision mission were discussed with the CCRIF Board of Directors in December

    but two of the CCRIF Boarers quarterly meetings as an observer to offer guidance and
    technical support•..... A major focus of the Bank during its on-going dialogue with the
    CCRIF, supervision missions, and participation in the CCRIF Board meetings has been to
    help the CCRIF strengthen its Operations Manual, notably with respect to the Facility's
    governance arrangements, including financial management and. procuremeIft processes.
    The Bank sent financial management missions to CCRIF headquarters in the Cayman
    Islands to supervise the FM aspects of the project and verify the Facility's capacity to use
    project funds f<;>r their intended purposes.     Other areas of emphasis in the Bank's
    supervision of the CCRIF have been on supporting the Facility's research and
    development activities and on advising it on pricing, risk transfer, and cash and asset
    management policies; strengthening its stakeholder outreach; and structuring its technical
    assistance program. In addition to the three in-depth mid-term evaluations, reports to
    management on the Board meetings and twice-yearly ISRs were. in accordance with LCR
    regional practice, produced, reviewed by management, and filed in IRIS.

 47.    In addition to the above~ the Bank. the CCRIF, and CCRIF's reinsurance
.providers conducted a joint test of the claims paym.ent process for a simulated hurricane
 to ensure that the respective roles were well understood and that the established
 procedures would work smoothly. The Bank has processed within 48 hours CCRIF's
 withdrawal applications associated with an insured events.

 6. Lessons Learned

 51.     This project offered the four Caribbean island countries the opportunity to join the
 first ever regional catastrophe insurance pool and thereby secure immediate liquidity i.n
 case of a covered disaster (earthquakes and hurricane~). It is part of a broader
 developm~t agenda of Bank support aimed at reducing the vulnerability of the
 Caribbean island countries to natural disasters. After three years of operations, several
 lessons can be drawn from this project.

 52.     Risk pooling is effective in significantly reducing the cost of individual
 countries' fmancial risk transfer tbrough insurance. The CCRIF's risk financing
 strategy relies on a strong reserve base (made of donors t initial contributions and the
 participating countries' participation fees and annual insurance premiums) and
  international reinsurance capacity. Achieving the optimum balance'betweenreserves and
  re.insurance is necessary both to ensure the Facility's financial strength·and to allow the
, participating countries to access catastrophe insurance at the lowest possible cost.

 53.    Extensive eommunicanon with participants is required not only leading up to
 the facility's inception, but also throughout its operations to ensure that its products
 are weD understood. Catastrophe insurance is a new tool for many Caribbean island
  countries, and thus requires extensive capacity building; Aggressive, targeted and
  continuous communications are required to explain the instrument and what it does and
  does not cover. Communications need to reach beyond the decision-makers to the
, general public. It is important for the public to understand that even though a disaster
  may result in personal losses. it may not meet the policy's parameters for 'triggering a
  payout and, further, that when a payout is triggered it is made to the governmen~ for
  general liquidity purposes and not to indemnify individuals for their losses. In addition to
  Quarterly and Annual Reports and website. proactive press outreach is important to
  supplement information provided directly to decision-makers. Technical assistance
  activities and workshops for persons from the participating countries can also build
  understandin& as can pmnering with other regional organizations.

 54.    Catastrophe. risk fmancing programs ean help bridge tile gap among
 Ministries of Finance and agencies involved in disaster risk management. Risk
 modeling tools to assess financial exposure to natural disasters can provide loss estimates



                                            16
in dollar terms that can help Ministries of Finance better understand and compare thr¢ats
to their fiscal balance and sensitize them to the need for more pro-active disaster risk
management. strategies. The analytical process can help increase interaction between
Ministries of Finance, national emergency management agencies~ and hydrological and
meteorological institutes.

55.     Even .witb msuraDee coverage,. COUDtries must coDtiIlue to iDvest iD risk
reduetioD measures. An important message to convey in stakeholder and public
communications is that catastrophe insurance is not and should not be considered a
sufficient risk management product, but has to be part of a broader risk management
strategy. While such insurance provides protection against financial loss, it cannot
reduce or avoid the impact of adverse natural events. With economic growth, the value
of asseJs exposed to natural disasters and the population affected by them increase.
Growth will become unsustainable - as will the cost of financial protection - without
proactive policy measures and physical investments to address the causes of risks, avoid
creating new risks, and mitigate existing risks and vulnerabilities.

56.    Tbe use of IDA resourees for targeted and· limited subsidies ean belp
eountries test and establisb insurance programs. In the present case, IDA financing
for the countries' participation fee and insurance premium during the first three to four
years of the ecRIrs operation allowed the four OECS countries to join the CCRlF and
test its value at lower cost and risk to themselves. The IDA finance also served as a
vehicle to deepen the Bank's dialogue with. th~ four countries on their broader and
longer-term disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation strategies. A gradual
reduction in the IDA contribution can help ease provision for the annual premium cost in
the country's budget appropriation process, although in a fiscally constrained
environment, the country will likely take advantage of other sources of finance Where
available to cover the cost.

57.     Rapid elaims settlement tbrough parametric insurance is feasible and
effeetive. Following the occurrence of insured· events, CCRIF made fun insurance
payouts within three weeks (that is less than the 90, days as specified in the insurance
policies), providing a rapid cash injection to assist the Government with its near-term
fmancial needs in service of the objectives for which CCRlF had been established.

58.    An efficient budget exeeutioD system is important. The quick cash injection
following a natural disaster is effective only if the country's post-disaster budget
execution system allows for an immediate use of these funds. Countries should be
encouraged to conduct a disbursement test for a simulated disaster and posSibly further
improve theirpost-disaster budget execution syst~m..

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

1.      While no empirical data are maintained that quantify the relationship between ex
ante risk financing instruments, such as catastrophe insurance and reduced impact of
disaster losses on a country's vulnerability, previous international experience tends to
confirm that ex ante risk financing arransements are more effective than post-disaster
mechanisms to finance immediate liquidity needs, because payments are based on
predefined rules and are usually quickly disbursed in (he aftermath of a disaster.

2.      Given the limited fiscal flexibility of the participating countries, particularly in the
afterm.ath of a disaster, these countries are particularly vulnerable to these events, and
thus the benefits of catastrophe insurance are expected to be higher than the cost of
insurance. In other words, the social cost of catastrophic risk bearing is expected to be
higher than the commercial premium, making them better off with catastrophe insurance
than without. Consequently, catastrophe insurance should generate, on average, a
positive rate of return.

3.      The financial benefits of the CCRIF can be estimated through the reduction in the
estimated insurance premium compared to (a) the case where the country would have to
buy the same coverage individually; and.(b) the case where the country should self~retain
the catastrophic risks. because insurance would not be available on the market.

4.      A simple but robust economic model was developed from the portfolio risk model
to illustrate the benefits of purchasing catastrophe insurance offered from the CCRIF.
Precise analysis is particularly difficult for catastrophe insurance where oosts (that is,
insurance premiums) are definitive while benefits (that is, insurance indemnity payouts)
are at best probabilistic. Hurricane insurance and earthquake insurance, when available.
are assumed to be offered with a 30-year return period attachment point, a 200-year
return period exhaustion point. The coverage level is the maximum payout a country
could receive.

5.      The price of coverage offered by the CCRIF is estimated through a portfolio risk
analysis coupled with a pricing model. It builds on the catastrophe risk models
developed during the preparation phase and updated by the CCRIF supervisor. It is
compared with the hypothetical insurance price if it were offered individually by direct
insurers. Such catastrophe insurance· coverage is currently not available for the
Caribbean countries. Hypothetical individual insurance premiums are derived through a
basic pricing equation based on the estimated annual average loss, the 200-year probable
maximum loss and the opportunity cost of capital (set at 12 percent).       '

6.      The estimated CCRIF insurance premium is also compared with· the cost of self-
retention if the country had to retain this risk (because insurance markets were not
available) through reserves. Should the country be risk neutral, the cost of self-retention
would be estimated through the annual average loss over a long period. This assumption




                                           21
is consi~nt with Arrow-Lind Public Investment Theorem (Arrow and Ljnd 1970). 3
which states that governments should be risk neutral toward natural disasters and thus
they should not invest in any risk financing strategies that are more expensive than the
expected losses caused by a natural disaster. This theory is in fact implemented by a
number of large developed countries that rely on post-disaster financing (including
budget reallocation and tax increases) to finance catastrophic losses. However. this
theory fails in the case of small and highly indebted· countries like the Caribbean
countries, because they can spread the risk neither across space (geographic spread) nor
across time (intertemporal spread), Therefore, the cost of self-retention is assumed to be
equal to the annual average loss plus the opportunity cost of reserves. The opportunity
cost of reserve is equal to the amount of reserves n~ssary to survive a l-in-200-yea.r
event, multiplied by the marginal opportunity Cost of capital (set at 12 percent).

7.       TIle cost of CCRIF insurance is Compared with the cost of individual insurance
(that is, if the country had purchased insurance individually) and the cost of self-retention.
CCRIF hurricane insurance is estimated to be approximately 50 percent less expensive
than individual hUrricane insurance, and approximately 70 percent less expensive than the
cost of country's self-retention. CCRIF earthquake insurance is estimated to be 45%
cheaper than individual earthquake insurance and 50% less expensive than self-retention.
This is a direct consequence of risk diversification.
