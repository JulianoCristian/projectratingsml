The CCRIF Trust\n            Fund will provide financing to cover establishment costs and\n            operating expenses, including insurance payouts of the\n            CCRIF. Such financing will provide an injection of funds\n            during the initial period o f the CCRIF, and help ensure its\n            financial viability and long-term sustainability. The CCRIF\n            is expected to become self sustainable within five years, by\n            which time funding support from the CCRIF Trust Fund is\n            expected to cease."}, "docdt": "2007-03-06T00:00:00Z"}
