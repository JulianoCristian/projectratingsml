7a.  Project Development Objectives/Outcomes 
Original/Current Project Development Objectives/Outcomes 
The development objective of the project is to reduce the participating country's financial vulnerability to 
natural disasters (earthquakes and hurricanes).  This is being achieved through the provision of financing to 
allow these countries to join the Caribbean Catastrophe Risk Insurance Facility and the purchase of 
financial protection against catastrophic hurricane and/or earthquake losses.

OECS-CATASTROPHE INSURANCE PROJECT 
RESTRUCTURING PAPER  
 
B. 
SUMMARY 
 
1. 
The Government of Dominica (GoD) would like to use project savings (SDR 
476,413.74) representing about US$748,746.13 to reimburse 50 percent ($374,373.07) of 
its 2010/2011 annual insurance premium for hurricane and earthquake insurance obtained 
from the Caribbean Catastrophe Risk Insurance Facility (CCRIF). 
 
2. 
On March 8, 2007, the Government of Dominica (GoD), signed a Financing 
Agreement for SDR 3.0 Million (US$4.5 Million equivalent) with the International 
Development Association (IDA), for the financing of the OECS Catastrophe Insurance 
Project.  The effective date for the Project was May 24, 2007, while the closing date for 
the Credit is December 31, 2010.  
 
3. 
The Project aims to provide Dominica with insurance coverage against natural 
disasters (earthquakes and hurricanes).  As originally designed, it consists of the 
following parts: 
 
A.  Provision of financing for the payment of the Recipient's entrance fee to 
participate in the CCRIF; and 
B. 
Provision of financing for the payment of 100 percent of the Recipient’s 
Annual catastrophe risk insurance premiums for the first two years of its 
participation in the CCRIF, and 50 percent of the Recipient's said 
premium for the third year of its participation in the CCRIF. 
 
C. 
PROJECT STATUS 
 
4. 
As stipulated under the current Financing Agreement, IDA made a payment for 
the recipient’s entrance fee to participate in the CCRIF as well as payments for its annual 
catastrophe risk insurance premiums (100 percent for the first two years of its 
participation in the CCRIF, and 50 percent of its premium for the third year).  A total of 
four (4) payments under the current Financing Agreement have already been made.  
Table 1 below provides the Estimated Entrance Fee and Premium payments for 
Dominica; while Table 2 presents the actual Entrance Fee and Premium payments.

5. 
The project has savings of approximately US$748.000.  These savings are mainly 
due to the fact that the estimated entrance fee and premium payments for Dominica were 
lower than projected by the insurance broker.  As a result, there is a difference of 
US$562,500 between the project cost estimates and the actual project cost (Table 2 vs. 
Table 1).  Moreover, the weakening of the US dollar against the SDR between 2007 and 
2009 generated additional savings of about US$185,500. 
 
6. 
The GoD would like to use a portion of these savings to reimburse 50 percent of 
its 2010/2011 annual insurance premium payment of US$733,704.  Dominica needs 
US$374,373.07 from IDA for this purpose.  These funds will be IDA’s fourth payment of 
annual insurance premiums, and it will represent its fifth contribution to the project for 
Dominica.  
 
7. 
The Project is performing satisfactorily.  Desired outcomes have been achieved.  
Dominica has remained eligible for CCRIF insurance since its inception and, indeed, 
received a payout following an earthquake that affected it in November 2007.  CCRIF’s 
financial strength has steadily increased and, with reinsurance and its own risk retention, 
is estimated to have the capacity to pay claims corresponding to a series of events with a 
Page  8

probability of occurring once in every 1,000 years.  All 16 countries and territories that 
joined CCRIF in 2007 have renewed policies for each successive year, including 2010-
2011.  There are no outstanding audit, financial management, procurement, or safeguards 
issues.  The Project closes on December 31, 2010. 
D. 
PROPOSED CHANGES  
 
8. 
In order to provide for reimbursement of 50 percent of the fourth premium for 
2010/2011 out of the proceeds of the Credit, the following changes are proposed to the 
Financing Agreement: (a) amendment of the Project Description to include the fourth 
installment in the second component (Part B) of the Project; (b) modification of the 
Institutional Arrangements to require a counterpart financing of 50 percent for the fourth 
installment; and (c) modification of the table of disbursement (Withdrawal of Proceeds of 
the Financing), to include an additional category for the fourth installment, and 
reallocation of the amount of the Credit among Categories to provide for the amount of 
the fourth installment.

The Table for Reallocation of Proceeds to reflect the changes in SDRs is as
