Vincent and the Grenadines were as follows: outcomes were\n            satisfactory; risk to development outcome was moderate; Bank\n            performance was satisfactory; borrower performance was also\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned includes: this project\n            offered the four Caribbean island countries the opportunity\n            to join the first ever regional catastrophe insurance pool\n            and thereby secure immediate liquidity in case of a covered\n            disaster (earthquakes and hurricane). It is part of a\n            broader development agenda of Bank support aimed at reducing\n            the vulnerability of the Caribbean island countries to\n            natural disasters. After three years of operations, several\n            lessons can be drawn from this project. Risk pooling is\n            effective in significantly reducing the cost of individual\n            countries' financial risk transfer brought insurance.\n            Extensive communicator with participants is required not\n            only leading up to the facility's inception, but also\n            throughout its operations to ensure that its products are we\n            understood. Catastrophe insurance is a new tool for many\n            Caribbean island countries, and thus requires extensive\n            capacity building. Catastrophe Risk financing programs can\n            help bridge tile gap among Ministries of Finance and\n            agencies involved in disaster risk management. Even The use\n            of International Development Association (IDA) resources for\n            targeted and\u00b7 limited subsidies can help countries test and\n            establish insurance programs. Rapid claims settlement\n            through parametric insurance is feasible and effective. An\n            efficient budget execution system is important. The quick\n            cash injection following a natural disaster is effective\n            only if the country's post-disaster budget execution\n            system allows for an immediate use of these funds."}, "docdt": "2011-05-13T00:00:00Z"}
