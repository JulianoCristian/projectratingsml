coverage of water and sanitation\n            services; b) strengthen the institutional capacity of the\n            National Water Commission to comply with its legal mandate\n            to assist the local water utilities (WUs) on technical\n            matters; c) reduce subsidies to the sector by promoting the\n            development of adequately sized WUs that are operationally\n            and financially autonomous; d) support the National\n            Development Bank for Public Works and Services' effort\n            to enhance its capacity to appraise and supervise\n            subprojects; e) encourage private sector participation; f)\n            improve the management of water resources overall; g)\n            strengthen the sector's capacity to enforce\n            environmental regulations and carry out environmental impact\n            assessments; and h) strengthen the institutional capacity of\n            the Mexican Institute of Water Technology. The project will\n            have three main components: 1) strengthening of the major\n            federal institutions that play a key role in management of\n            water resources; 2) supporting the investment/operational\n            plans of WUs; and 3) developing the planning and\n            environmental capabilities of the WUs to strengthen them as\n            viable and sustainable institutions."}, "docdt": "1994-05-16T00:00:00Z"}
