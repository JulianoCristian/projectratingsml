impacts, and, likewise, both\n            performances by the Bank, and Borrower are rated\n            unsatisfactory. Lessons address: 1) the lack of adequate\n            attention to regulatory, and sector reform issues, since\n            project design focused on coverage, and\n            decentralization/strengthening of the autonomous water\n            utilities and operating agencies, overlooking important\n            structural, sectoral issues which still hinder sector\n            development. Instead, had the regulatory framework,\n            including pricing and tariffs, and the respective role of\n            public institutions and private participation, been resolved\n            early on, constrained sector developments could have been\n            avoided; 2) the inadequacy of financial policies in the\n            allocation of public funds, where the weak enforcement of\n            quality services by the National Water Commission (CNA), and\n            state agencies, does not provide the incentives for local\n            governments to either increase cash generation, or borrow to\n            improve services; 3) the lack of credible monitoring\n            systems, reinforcing the need for (proven by the justified\n            attention the Bank gives to monitoring criteria) measurable\n            goals, through established mechanisms, i.e., appropriate\n            information systems, and project management reviews, in an\n            integrated monitoring, and information system; and, 4) the\n            ineffective conditionality; lack of timely action to\n            restructure, and adjust operations, and, an inadequate\n            dialogue with the new administration. All suggests the Bank\n            needs to rethink future support, based on an agreed, broad\n            sector policy strategy, setting realistic goals, focused on\n            technical assistance needs, in addition to financial\n            policies, addressing tariffs, and cost recovery as a key\n            structural sector issue."}, "docdt": "2001-07-23T00:00:00Z"}
