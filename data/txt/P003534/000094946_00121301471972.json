Key lessons address: 1) The\n            securitization of Bank financed assets, - in this case, the\n            ownership and management change of the Hangzhou-Ningbo\n            Highway (HNH) assets - was found to be a financial technique\n            liable to raise new capital from foreign investors,\n            including acceptance among investors in China's Stock\n            markets. Moreover, this technique lead to the approval of\n            the policy guidance \"Securitization and other Capital\n            Mobilization Transactions using Bank Financed Assets\"\n            in December 1997. 2) Since remedial works, needed to counter\n            the soil settlement problem were identified during\n            preparation, monitoring of the embankment settlement should\n            have been strictly enforced, delaying pavement works until\n            settlement stabilization. Nonetheless, this experience\n            proved beneficial to a later highway project in Zhejiang,\n            with fewer settlement problems. 3) Implementation delays\n            were largely attributed to the electrical and mechanical\n            works (E&M), conducive to the Bank's mandate that,\n            procurement and engineering designs for E&M works, be\n            completed simultaneously with civil works contracts, with\n            procurement activities commencing two years prior to civil\n            works completion. 4) The impulse of the Road Development\n            Program to poverty alleviation, proved appropriate for\n            inclusion in further rural roads projects."}, "docdt": "2000-11-16T00:00:00Z"}
