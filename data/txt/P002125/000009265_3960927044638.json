essential drugs policy, to ensure that the\n            public, particularly low-income groups, has access to a\n            sustainable supply of safe, effective and affordable drugs.\n            Due to significant demand, limited budgetary resources and\n            high prices, most public health facilities have had little\n            or no drugs in recent years. The project entails four main\n            strategies which correspond to those of the national policy\n            and address the major issues in the subsector. The\n            strategies involve: (a) developing an affordable and\n            sustainable supply of safe drugs, (b) improving the skills\n            of health workers in providing drugs, (c) changing the\n            harmful practices of beneficiaries, and (d) strengthening\n            institutional capacities to undertake essential drugs\n            programs (EDPs)."}, "docdt": "1989-08-10T00:00:00Z"}
