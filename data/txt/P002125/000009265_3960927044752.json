The project entails four main\n            strategies which correspond to those of the national policy\n            and address the major issues in the subsector. The\n            strategies involve: (a) developing an affordable and\n            sustainable supply of safe drugs, (b) improving the skills\n            of health workers in providing drugs, (c) changing the\n            harmful practices of beneficiaries, and (d) strengthening\n            institutional capacities to undertake essential drugs\n            programs (EDPs)."}, "docdt": "1989-08-10T00:00:00Z"}
