sustainability was uncertain, Bank performance was\n            satisfactory, and Borrower performance was also\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: a well defined\n            project is an appropriate way to lend in a new area, as was\n            done under this project. If the Borrower had allowed it, and\n            had there been better incentives in the Bank to make smaller\n            loans, it also would have been better to start smaller and\n            with fewer states. Baseline measurements are especially\n            needed when introducing innovations to better draw lessons.\n            Regular project review and re-planning are helpful, though\n            projects need to have an environment where they are able to\n            take advantage of this flexibility. The use of international\n            competitive bidding resulted in cost-effective, safe and\n            affordable drugs when procured in large quantities, though\n            also brought other problems. It exposed the States to the\n            international drug market and standards, but required better\n            communications infrastructure, and ability to deal with port\n            officials and suppliers. Other means of procurement are also\n            needed because of time constraints."}, "docdt": "1997-12-19T00:00:00Z"}
