Operation Type             Single tranche Development Policy Loan
Main Policy Areas          The proposed operation supports ongoing reforms to i) strengthen financial
                           prudential regulation and supervision ii) strengthen the framework for the
                           intervention and resolution of unauthorized financial intermediation
                           activities and iii) and to deepen capital markets.
Key Outcome Indicators (by 1. Strengthening Prudential Regulation and Supervision
end of 2011)                  · Under current macroeconomic assumptions, no systemic instability
                                   arises in 2009-2010.
                              · In case credit institutions incur in losses during the year, it will be
                                   determined what percentage of those losses can be absorbed by the
                                   reserved constituted with the capitalized 2008 profits without
                                   compromising the CAR of the institution. At the closing of the 2011
                                   financial accounts the remaining reserve for the system and the
                                   number of institutions for which the reserve has not covered the
                                   sustained losses will be reported.
                              · All financial institutions that collect resources from the public, with
                                   the exception of close-fund administrators, have adopted robust
                                   systems to monitor and administer liquidity risks. All credit
                                   institutions have a positive indicator of liquidity risk as defined by
                                   the SFC, or are adopting remedial actions to ensure they will have
                                   it.
                           2. Strengthening the Framework for the Intervention and Resolution of
                           unauthorized Financial Intermediation Activities
                              · The SS follows up on all requests from the SFC to investigate
                                   unauthorized financial intermediation activities.
                              · Assets recovered from intervened pyramids have been valued and
                                   liquidated, and the proceeds distributed among investors according
                                   to their creditor status. Assets confiscated in relation to money
                                   laundering activities will have been transferred to the appropriate
                                   authorities. Actions to recovered assets located abroad have been
                                   initiated.
                           3. Securities Market Reform
                              · Compliance with the current 19 CPSS-IOSCO principles.
                              · The SFC has real time information on the transactions liquidated
                                   through the CCCH.
                              · The range of standardized derivative products traded in Colombia
                                   has expanded to include exchange rate futures, Colombian stock
                                   market futures and commodities futures.
                              · The market has developed and trading volumes of standardized



                                                       1

                                  derivatives have increased as a share of spot transactions. In
                                  particular futures traded over Colombian sovereign bonds, the
                                  Colombian stock market index and the market exchange rate of the
                                  Colombian Peso vis-à-vis the US Dollar amount to a third of the
                                  spot transactions in those assets.

                      IBRD PROGRAM DOCUMENT FOR A PROPOSED
                   FINANCIAL SECTOR DEVELOPMENT POLICY LOAN
                              TO THE REPUBLIC OF COLOMBIA



                                     I.      INTRODUCTION

1.       This single-tranche US$300 Development Policy Loan (DPL) has been requested by the
Government of Colombia (GoC). The GoC is facing significant macroeconomic challenges from the
current global financial crisis, which has resulted in lower capital inflows and increased borrowing
costs. Recent growth and poverty reduction in Colombia has been supported by a stable expansion of
the financial system, following the financial crisis that Colombia suffered at the end of the 1990s. As
the ongoing global crisis impacts Colombia, the GoC is committed to preserving these gains in
financial sector development as part of its broader development strategy. This financing will provide
support for the two pronged combined approach the government has been implementing to tackle, in
the short run, the impact of the international crisis in the Colombian financial sector, while at the same
time proceed with the reforms needed to further develop financial markets in the long run. GoC's
commitment to face these issues and the soundness of the approach as well as the overall impact of
these reforms in the Colombian economy underpin the support of this loan.

2.       Due to the global crisis, Colombia is facing significant macroeconomic challenges,
although sound past macroeconomic policies and measures adopted by the authorities will
mitigate the impact of the global turbulence. The sustained period of strong growth and moderate
inflation experienced by the Colombian economy in recent years ended in 2008. Growth is expected to
contract by 0.7 percent in 2009 and remain subdued in 2010 with a forecasted 1.5 percent GDP
growth. Growth perspectives compare favorably to those of other large Latin American countries
which ­with the exception of Peru- are expected to experience a more severe contraction in 2009.
Colombia is relatively well positioned as traditional domestic amplifiers of crises - exchange rate,
financial, and fiscal - have been well managed and could help mitigate the impact of the crisis.

3.       Colombia's financial sector appears to be sound and well supervised but government
efforts to strengthen its foundations need to continue as the global crisis heightens existing
vulnerabilities. The main risk for the system is credit risk, particularly the consumer loan portfolio.
However, existing capital and provisions buffers appear adequate to cover potential losses and
preserve systemic financial stability. Nevertheless, some small financial companies specialized in car
loans could experience difficulties. Market and liquidity risks appear contained so far and systemic
risks arising from non-bank financial institutions (NBFIs) appear limited.

4.       Ongoing regulatory reforms to strengthen financial sector resilience are well structured.
The orientation of several measures implemented by the GoC was later validated by the
recommendations issued by the G-20. The increase of banks' capital and liquidity buffers as a
prudential countercyclical measure highlights the regulator's responsiveness and vision to fence off the
impact of the global crisis.

5.       The measures adopted in the wake of the collapse of pyramid schemes will discourage
unauthorized financial intermediation, preserving the strength of the system and protecting the
poor. The collapse of fraudulent pyramid schemes prompted swift action from the authorities -which
adopted a new and enhanced framework for the intervention of unauthorized financial intermediaries
- avoiding contagion effects to the supervised system. These measures will discourage unauthorized
financial intermediation, which will strengthen the financial sector and protect financial consumers and
especially the poor, which are disproportionally affected by the collapse of pyramids.


                                                   3

  6.       Further development of capital markets in Colombia is necessary to promote savings and
  to channel those savings efficiently to fund private sector investment and foster growth. The GoC
  has redoubled efforts to introduce additional regulations to keep on track the securities market reform
  initiated in 2005. To this end, the authorities issued regulation for an upgraded market infrastructure
  that increases efficiency and reduces systemic risks to create the conditions for solid market growth.
  The authorities have also advanced in regulating the securities market intermediaries and the type of
  transactions that can be negotiated and executed in the market. The regulations have made possible the
  creation of a central counterparty clearing house and the creation of an exchanged-trade derivatives
  market. The proposed operation would help achieve the objective of promoting savings and investment
  needed to sustain growth as identified in the Colombian National Development Program and supported
  by the current Country Partnership Strategy.

  7.       The World Bank engagement in Colombia, particularly with respect to policy areas
  supported by this DPL, has emphasized synergies of IBRD financing with other multilateral
  organizations. The request of this loan is part of the strategy of the GoC, which has increased its
  funding from multilateral organizations in the face of a deterioration of the external environment. In
  May 2009, Colombia obtained US$10.5 billion as a one-year precautionary arrangement under the
  IMF's Flexible Credit Line (FCL). Collaboration with other multilaterals is fluid. In particular, World
  Bank and IMF staff maintains strong coordination and cooperation on both macroeconomic issues as
  well as financial sector issues.




                                      II.     COUNTRY CONTEXT

  8.       Following the 1999 crisis, Colombia enjoyed a sustained period of growth that supported
  employment creation and poverty reduction. Real economic growth accelerated from 2.5 percent in
  2002 to 7.5 percent in 2007, inflation moderated, and private investment rose from 9.9 percent of GDP
  in 2002 to over 16 percent in 2007. Colombia's unemployment rate dropped from over 17 percent in
  2002 to approximately 12 percent in 2007. The country's recovery was driven by favorable external
  conditions, stable macroeconomic policies and wide-ranging structural reforms.

  9.       Political stability and improved security contributed to the economic recovery. President
  Uribe has been in power since 2002 and is credited for the economic comeback of Colombia amid
  increased security. Congress has approved a Law to call a referendum on changing the Constitution
  once again to allow President Uribe to run for a consecutive third term next year. The Constitutional
  Court still has to approve the referendum.

RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS1

  10.      The sustained period of strong growth and moderate inflation experienced by the
  Colombian economy in recent years ended in 2008. During 2004-2007, high external demand,
  improved terms of trade and lower cost of international credit created a favorable environment for
  growth. During 2008 economic growth slowed down, reflecting past monetary tightening that resulted
  in a significant reduction in credit growth (from 34.4 percent y-o-y in March 2007 to 18 percent in
  August 2008) and weakening commodities prices and global demand. In particular, export growth -
  which had remained relatively resilient- collapsed due to the ongoing global slowdown. The
  deceleration intensified following the renewed global financial turbulence at end-September 2008. In
  the last quarter of 2008, GDP contracted by 1 percent y-o-y, and growth for the year as a whole stood

   at 2.5 percent -a third of the growth rate in the previous year. Shocks to fuel and food prices pushed
   inflation to 7.7 percent at end-2008 well in excess of the Central Bank (Banco de la República, BdR)
   target of 5 percent for 2009. Positive terms of trade developments in first half of the year were
   compensated by a collapse in export volume in the second half and declining oil prices. Thus, the
   current account for 2008 as a whole ended up in a deficit of 2.8 percent of GDP, a similar figure to the
   one in 2007 (see Table 1).

   11.       Fiscal discipline resulted in low deficits and a reduction in public sector debt as a share
   of GDP, although concerns remain regarding expenditure rigidities. In recent years, fiscal policy
   aimed at reducing public sector and external vulnerabilities by ensuring debt sustainability. The
   combination of domestic economic growth, improved international conditions, peso appreciation
   (which reduces the cost of servicing foreign currency-denominated debt), and revenue-enhancing
   policy reforms improved the fiscal accounts.2 As a result, the combined public sector deficit improved
   from 3.7 percent of GDP in 2002 to a balance in 2005. However, budget and legal rigidities that resist
   spending cuts have slowed the progress of policy reforms on the expenditure side. Despite the strong
   revenue performance, expenditure dynamics -especially pension expenditures and transfers to sub
   national governments- have resulted in modest fiscal deficits during 2006-2007. Transfers to the main
   state-run pension system will continue to expand over the next decade -as payouts greatly exceed new
   contributions- despite the 2005 constitutional reform that reduced the net present value of pension
   liabilities by 19 percentage points of GDP. This reform eliminated special regimes for state employees
   and imposed ceilings on benefits in the public-sector pension system. In 2008, the non- financial
   public sector reached a surplus of 0.1 percent of GDP  the highest balance since 2005 well above the
   government's target of -0.9 percent of GDP. This improvement over the government's target is

  Policy reforms have concentrated on the revenue side. In 2002, Congress approved Law 788, supported by the
Bank's Fiscal and Institutional Adjustment Loan (FIAL) Program (Loan 7163-CO, approved March 2003). The Law
expanded the revenue base for the government by eliminating tax exemptions related to VAT, personal and
corporate income taxes. The Law introduced a cap on wage exemptions for personal income tax and eliminated the
exemptions on capital gains from the sales of stock, mutual funds, real estate and privileged corporate contracts,
forms, funds or bonds.

explained primarily by 1.1 percent of GDP surplus by local governments, up from the government's
target of 0.3 percent of GDP. The latter is at least partially the result of the recent central government's
policies to enforce fiscal discipline at the local level.

12.     The global financial crisis led to a sharp tightening of financing conditions in Colombia,
as well as in a large number of emerging market economies. As the global financial turbulence
intensified in the second half of 2008, Colombian financial markets were negatively affected in line
with developments in other Latin American countries. The withdrawal of liquidity in financial markets
amid increased risk aversion resulted in larger sovereign spreads and stock market losses across the
region (see Figure 1). In Colombia, the EMBI spread increased to 740 b.p. at end October, The stock
market index declined by a third in line with developments elsewhere. The exchange rate appreciation,
prompted in part by tightening monetary policy, reversed and the exchange rate depreciated by about
16 percent since end-August 2008, limiting the loss of reserves during 2008 to US$ 125 million (about
0.5 percent of total reserves). In this context the Central Bank removed the controls to capital inflows,
a temporary measure to prevent excessive exchange rate volatility. An increase in credit risk premiums
and funding costs pushed the lending rate up by 77 b.p. in the last quarter of 2008. However,
subsequent decline in policy rates have brought down lending rates to levels similar to those in early
2007.

13.     Markets normalized in the first half of 2009, and global sovereign bond issuance and
domestic corporate bond issuance increased. Since end-2008 the stock market index increased by
49 percent while the exchange rate has appreciated by 17 percent and reserves were broadly stable. As
market sentiment improved, partly due to the authorities' actions, the Colombian government was able
to successfully place a ten-year US$1 billion bond issue in January with a spread of 503 b.p. over US
treasuries, and an additional US$ 1 billion in April at a yield of 7.35 and 435 b.p. spread. Spreads have
declined further, standing at about 300 b.p. at end-June 2009. Lower inflation perspectives have
prompted a rally in government domestic securities, with the yield on the benchmark domestic paper
maturing in 2020 trading at the lowest levels since November 2006. In contrast to other emerging
markets, domestic commercial paper markets have been quite active. Issuance in 2009 so far reached
more than US$2 billion, about 80 percent of total issuance in 2008.

MACROECONOMIC OUTLOOK AND CHALLENGES

 14.     Ongoing deleveraging and continued high levels of uncertainty have prompted a sharp
 downturn in global economic activity, world trade and international commodity prices which
 will negatively affect Colombia through several channels. In light of external developments,
 economic activity and the prospects for near-term economic growth in Colombia have deteriorated
 significantly. The main channels of transmission of the global economic and financial shocks to the
 Colombian economy are the following:

     (a)    Weaker external demand. Colombia has a relatively open economy; exports of goods and
            services are equivalent to over 17 percent of GDP while total trade amounts to about 40
            percent. Although exports have become more geographically diversified (beyond the U.S),
            export volume growth has decelerated significantly. Global demand is expected to decline
            by 0.5 percent in 2009 compare to 2008. It is estimated that a 1 percent decline in export
            demand lowers GDP growth by 0.3 percent


    (b)     Lower oil prices. Colombia received a record-high level of revenue from oil exports in 2008
            (US$12.2 billion) as a result of a historically high average oil price for the Colombian mix
            of crude oil that reached US$134.3 per barrel. The dramatic drop of international oil prices
            has a significant impact on the country's public finances and the current account deficit. Oil
            accounts for about 20 percent of total public sector revenues and 24 percent of total exports
            on average. In 2009 oil prices are expected to average US$47.2 per barrel. The envisioned
            decline in oil prices -ceteris paribus- will increase the current account deficit and public
            sector deficit by 1.8 percent and 0.5 percent respectively.

     (c)   Lower workers remittances. Workers' remittances, mainly from Colombians living in the
           U.S and Spain, have started to decline since the last quarter of 2008. Remittances amounted
           to US$1 billion in the first quarter of 2009, 4.2 percent below last year. For the year as a
           whole they are expected to decline by 3 percent.

    (d)    Lower capital inflows. Capital flows are declining somewhat due to diminished global
           liquidity. Capital flows have declined by 3.5 percent in the last quarter of 2008 with respect


                                                                                   8

            to the previous quarter. Although FDI flows experienced a significant expansion during
            2008, current global conditions might impact negatively on the inflows during the year.


      (e)   Increased risk aversion. The deterioration in economic perspectives and market turbulence
            will likely have a negative impact on risk premiums and credit supply.


  15.      Factors that typically magnify external shocks resulting in severe economic disruptions
  do not play an important role in the case of Colombia. In some Latin American countries, external
  shocks have been typically amplified by severely appreciated real exchange rates, weak domestic
  financial sectors and public sector balance sheet vulnerabilities. Fortunately, in Colombia's case, the
  factors that typically magnify crisis mitigate the impact of the shock.

       (a)    Flexible exchange rate. Although the nominal exchange rate had appreciated
            considerably during 2007 and 2008, Colombia entered the turbulence period with an
            exchange rate value close to its equilibrium level3. The flexible exchange rate acts as a shock
            absorber helping to counter the deceleration in external demand.

       (b)  Resilient financial sector. The strength of the financial sector, with healthy financial
            indicators (see paragraph 25), has prevented a credit crunch, and credit to the private sector
            - although has decelerated due to lower demand and increased risk aversion- continues to
            grow at about 8 percent in real terms at end April 2009. Financial dollarization is not a
            destabilizing factor in Colombia, with foreign currency denominated loans amounting only
            to 6 percent of total loans. The dollarization ratio is even lower for deposits.

       (c)  Low public deficits and manageable external debt. Fiscal consolidation and the
            government public debt management strategy put public debt in a declining path and reduce
            the share of foreign denominated debt. External debt has almost halved since 2003 due to the
            sustained FDI flows. Reserves (over US$21 billion, or 11 percent of GDP at end-May 2009)
            more than doubles the annual external debt amortizations, contributing to ensure current
            account financing even in the difficult global conditions. Given limited external
            vulnerabilities, exchange rate pressures would likely be moderate..

  16.      Overall, Colombia is in a relative better position to confront the global crisis than other
  Latin American countries.         This outcome is a result of the factors discussed in the previous
  paragraph as well as the countercyclical policies implemented by the authorities (see paragraph 18 and
  Box 1).

    17.                In light of the global environment, economic growth is expected to continue decelerating
    in 2009. The Colombian economy is officially in recession, as GDP in the first quarter of 2009
    contracted by 0.6 percent (preliminary figures subject to revision). For the year as a whole, GDP is
    likely to contract by 0.7 percent. A modest rebound in economic activity is forecasted for 2010. Lower
    oil and food prices will reduce inflation to 4.3 percent. The current account deficit is expected to
    deteriorate to 3.3 percent of GDP. The Non-Financial Public Sector deficit, broadly balanced in 2008,
    will widen to 3.5 percent of GDP in 2009.

    18.        Countercyclical measures implemented by the authorities will mitigate the impact of a
    global slowdown on growth and employment generation. Monetary policy is, and will continue to
    be, actively used to counter the effects of the cycle as weakened demand and lower food and oil prices
    keep inflation on a downward trend. Regarding fiscal policy, the authorities will allow automatic
    stabilizers to fully operate. In addition, the sharp reduction in public sector debt to GDP ratio during
    the past years has provided room for some modest fiscal loosening. In this context expenditures are
    expected to increase by 1.7 percent of GDP. The main measures adopted by the authorities are
    included in Box 1.

    19.        The GoC is seeking to further reduce external vulnerabilities by requesting funding from
    multilaterals. Authorities indicated they plan to obtain US$2.4 billion from multilaterals this calendar
    year to help cover the envisioned external financing needs for 2009. Colombia also obtained an IMF
    precautionary flexible credit line to access US$10.5 billion. At end-May 2009, the World Bank has
    disbursed US$580 million (see Annex 7 for details on the World Bank program with Colombia).

    20.        While there remains considerable uncertainty as regards to the depth and length of the
    global recession, neither external nor fiscal sustainability appear at risk. Nevertheless, the current
    environment characterized by volatility in financial magnitudes and commodity prices poses several
    downside risks. A fall in oil prices would negatively affect the fiscal outlook and the current account
    balance. Intensification of the global liquidity squeeze further deteriorates the external balance. To
    gauge these risks a low growth scenario is evaluated. The scenario shows the impact of a drop of the
    oil price to a low of US$32 per barrel and a further deterioration of the external environment during
    2009. The simulation indicates that Colombia has enough reserves to cushion a potential external
    financing shock without severely affecting exchange rate stability. This scenario does not pose a

                 Box 1. Countercyclical measures to mitigate the Economic Slowdown

Expansive monetary policy. From mid-2006 to mid-2008, the policy rate was increased by 400 b.p.
amid concerns of possible overheating. As result of the renewed global financial turbulence, lending rates
increased further in the last quarter of 2008. To inject liquidity in the market BdR expanded monetary
base by reducing banks' reserve requirements and introduced a program of purchases of government
paper (US$500 million). From December 2008 to end-June 2009, the sharp moderation in inflation (from
7.9 in November 2008 to 4.8 percent at end-May 2009) has allowed the BdR to reduce interest rates by
550 b.p. and lending rates are now broadly at end-2006 levels. While credit growth has decelerated
sharply during the last 12 months, in the latest lending survey by the BdR (May 2009), the majority of
respondents particularly in service and manufacture firms anticipate that there will be no change in the
amount of credit availability within the next 6 months. The proportion of survey respondents who believe
there is sufficient credit in the system is increasing but is still lower than a year ago in April 2008
However, banks have tightened lending criteria with increased attention to the repayment capacity and
liquidity position of the borrowing firms. To avoid severe credit disruptions, the authorities have secured
US$850 million of funds from the IADB for Colombian public financial institutions (see paragraph 58).

Increased investment in infrastructure. The government has announced a series of measures to invest
in infrastructure. The "plan de choque" increases the budget for infrastructure by 25 percent with respect
to 2008 to an amount of US$ 2.7 billion. The World Bank will support infrastructure investments with
mainly 4 projects in 2009-2010, approximately amounting to USD $1.1 billion. These infrastructure
projects are labor intensive and are expected to have a significant impact on employment and growth.

Increased public expenditure in social assistance programs. With respect to the social assistance
programs, the government plans to expand the budget for these programs by 18 percent in 2009 reaching
US$1.45 billion. The expanded budget includes US$474 million for Familias en Acción a program of
cash transfers to poor families conditional on children attending school and meeting basic preventive
health care requirements, US$240 million for elderly programs, and US$330 million for programs
targeted towards the displaced population. These programs protect the poor from the impact of the crisis.
The World Bank is supporting Familias en Acción and other social programs with US$ $636.5 million in
FY09-10 (see Annex 7).

The Financial Sector

  21.      The Colombian financial system is dominated by domestic banks and it is highly
  concentrated. The system includes a variety financial intermediaries, including pension funds (AFPs),
  insurance companies, brokerage houses, trust funds and mutual funds. Credit institutions dominate the
  financial landscape with almost half of total financial sector assets. Banks are by far the largest credit
  institutions (about 85 percent of total credit institution assets), which also include finance and leasing
  companies, financial corporations - similar to investment banks, although regulated- and financial
  cooperatives. The 1999 crisis resulted in substantial consolidation of private banks, whose number
  declined from over 30 in 1998 to 17 at end 2008. The largest public banks were privatized and only a
  small public bank remains in the market (5 percent of the assets of credit institutions). The
  consolidation process resulted in the formation of large domestic financial conglomerates. The two
  largest conglomerates account for about half of financial sector assets. Foreign penetration is modest
  compared with other countries. Foreign owned banks control less than a fifth of banking assets but
  intensively compete with local banks.

  22.      After a long period of decline due to the crisis of the late 1990s, the banking sector begun
  to recover in 2004. The resolution of troubled institutions and a favorable external environment
  stimulated growth and propitiated the recovery of banking intermediation. Strong bank profitability-
  arising from valuation gains on the banks' government securities portfolio as interest rates declined
  from post-crisis highs- allowed for an expansion of loan supply. At the same time, the resumption of
  domestic economic growth, supported by a favorable external environment increased loan demand.
  Standard financial performance indicators ­ solvency, profitability, efficiency and asset quality ­
  significantly improved.

  23.      The level of financial development is in line with regional levels given the country
  characteristics. Credit to the private sector amounts to about 33 percent of GDP, still below the levels
  reached in the late 1990s before the crisis. It is lower than the levels for Chile and Brazil but higher
  than average regional levels, controlling for the country characteristics (see Figures 5 and 6). Efforts
  to reform and develop the securities market have activated the market, although number of issuers is
  relatively low and the market liquidity needs to improve.

  24.      The debt market has been growing in the last few years, dominated by public debt
  instruments. At the end of 2008, Colombia's outstanding stock of fixed income securities was US$ 81
  billion (equivalent to 56 percent of its GDP), of which US$ 44.6 billion was government debt. While it
  remains limited, the importance of corporate bonds as a source of financing for firms has increased
  slightly. While in 2005 there were 18 issuances, which were worth US$962 million (0.6 percent of
  GDP) in the first half of 2009 alone corporate bond issuance reached more than 1 percent of the
  forecasted GDP for the year.

  25.      At end-April 2009, the banking system appeared sound and well supervised. The
  Colombian banking system is well capitalized and very profitable. Following the 1999 crisis,
  supervision and regulation were revamped. The Financial Superintendence (Superintendencia
  Financiera de Colombia, SFC) currently supervises all financial intermediaries through on-site follow
  up and on-site visits (see section IV for details). The Banking system capital adequacy ratio (CAR)
  stood at 13.8, with all Colombian banks having a CAR well above the 9 percent regulatory minimum.
  However, it is important to notice that capital ratios include goodwill4. As a result, the loss absorption
  capacity of Colombian banks' capital buffers is lower than that of regional peers, leaving the banks
  more exposed to potential pressure on asset quality.5 Already asset quality has deteriorated due to the
  economic slowdown, and non-performing loans (NPLs) reach 5.1 percent of total loans while loans
  classified as on watch or worse amount to 9.7 percent of total loans in April 2009. Provisions cover all
  NPLs but only 53.7 percent of classified loans on average, with some banks having substantially lower
  coverage levels (see Figure 7). While those figures compared unfavorably with that of other Latin
  American countries, it is worth noting that the Colombian definition of NPLs is rather strict as it
  includes loans past-due 30 days as opposed to the standard 90 days. Despite increased credit losses,
  profitability remained strong in 2008. Rising interest rates for most of the year and less-than-perfectly
  competitive system resulted in higher net interest margins. Recently, valuation increases in the
  portfolio of government securities have boosted profitability. In the first quarter of 2009, credit
  institutions reported even bigger profits than in the first quarter of 2008.

  economic environment deteriorates further. CFCs -which hold 12.5 percent of the credit
  institutions' assets - grant credit and finance themselves mostly with certificates of deposit that are
  protected by the Deposit Insurance Fund (Fondo de Garantía de Instituciones Financieras,
  FOGAFIN). CFCs have seen NPLs almost double in the last year reaching 7.15 percent of total loans
  for the sector in April 2009, with proviiouns covering 77.4 percent of those NPLs. Particularly
  affected are those companies oriented to automotive sector loans, and some may need to increase
  regulatory capital if the portfolio continues to deteriorate. On the positive side most of the CFCs
  belong either to a foreign group or a large domestic group and should not have difficulties in raising
  capital. Some of the smaller independent CFCs, which altogether hold about 4 percent of credit
  institutions assets, may have to consolidate or liquidate, although such exit is unlikely to pose systemic
  consequences.

       27.               Systemic risks arising from other financial intermediaries appear limited. The value of
       AFPs' portfolio holdings were negatively affected by the decline in government securities prices (45
       percent of AFPs' investments) and stock market volatility, particularly in the second half of 2008. This
       issue was aggravated by the definition and measurement period for the minimum return benchmark. A
       few AFPs were close to being below the minimum return at the peak of market volatility, and could have
       had to increase capital. At the time, some market participants and regulators expressed concerns that
       portfolio reallocations by AFPs could put pressure in the government securities market, which would
       affect other financial intermediaries. However, these concerns have subsided as the market turn around
       and pension funds reported a profit of US$1.4 billion in the first quarter of 2009, compared to a loss of
       US$680 million during the same period last year. All other institutions are relatively small. Brokerage
       houses had been most affected by the decline in the stock market as mutual funds invest mostly in
       certificates of deposit from domestic financial institutions. While insurance companies technical
       margins' are slightly negative, they are in line with average values in the last 15 years. As in the case of
       AFPs, the recent rally in the government's Treasury bonds market has improved profitability for all
       intermediaries.

          28.            The collapse of fraudulent pyramid schemes prompted swift action from the authorities
          avoiding contagion effects to the supervised system. Some fraudulent pyramid schemes -which
          obtained resources from the public by promising exorbitant rates of return - had appeared in Colombia
          under sophisticated structures (see section VI for details). The companies masked their fraudulent
          money-collecting activities under the disguise of service provider companies and prepaid card sales.
          These fraudulent companies operated in 12 departments with a substantial number of investors, mostly
          in the low-income bracket. So far, the authorities have received more than 700,000 claims from
          investors amounting to about 1 percent of GDP. In November 2008, the government closed the
          pyramid schemes, enacted legislation to strengthen the powers of supervisors to act against such illegal
          operations (action supported by this operation), and began liquidating assets to return the recovered
          funds to investors. To help address the social costs, the authorities reallocated funds in the 2008 budget
          toward targeted social spending. Authorities also indicated investors of the pyramids will not be bailed

                out. Swift action from the authorities prevented contagion effects to credit cooperatives and other
                supervised institutions operating in the same market segments.

         Macro Financial Linkages

                29.      During 2005-2006, credit growth accelerated sharply. The favorable macroeconomic
                environment underpinned credit growth, with growth rates of almost 30 percent in real terms at the
                beginning of 2007. Credit grew particularly in the consumer segment, with real growth rates close to
                50 percent at the height of the credit boom. Increased competition among credit institutions has played
                an important role, aided by the decline in interest rates. For example, the 90-day fixed-term deposit
                rate (Depósito a Término Fijo or DTF), which forms the benchmark reference rate for most loans,
                declined from almost 8 percent in early 2005 to less than 5 percent at end-March 2006. The credit
                growth outpaced the strong deposit growth and as a result the loan to deposit ratio increased from 81
                percent at end-2005 to 93 percent at end-2008. The credit expansion was partly funded with the
                reduction in banks' investment portfolio. The decline in the banks' portfolio of government securities
                increased liquidity risks while decreasing exposure to market risks. The past credit boom increased
                corporate and household balance sheet vulnerabilities, which in the current economic environment
                could result in substantial credit losses for bank. Tightening monetary policy and economic
                deceleration reduced the real growth rate of credit to 10.6 percent at end-September 2008. Since the
                global financial turbulence erupted, the growth rate has declined further to 7.9 at end April-2009 due
                to the deceleration in consumer and housing loans, while commercial lending growth rates remained
                broadly stable.

   30.       Corporate balance sheets appear relatively resilient, although concerns regarding the
   quality of data remain. A recent IMF paper concluded that the Colombian corporate sector is well
   capitalized, with relatively low leverage, adequate liquidity, improved profitability, and well hedged6.
   Balance sheet data from over 20,000 firms revealed that the sector liabilities amount only to half of the
   assets. Liquid assets cover about 148 percent of short-term obligations mitigating default risks in this
   portfolio. While average corporate profitability does not compare well with the region, it is close to the
   maximum levels during the last decade, despite the recent economic deceleration. Data from a much
   smaller sample, accounting for a fifth of the sector liabilities, pointed to limited foreign exchange
   exposure (6.5 percent of capital). Further convergence toward international accounting standards, more
   stringent auditing practices, and effective regulatory enforcement are required to overcome limitations
   and inconsistencies in reported corporate financial information. These deficiencies might undermine
   the diagnosis of existing weaknesses across firms and sectors7. In fact, data from the SFC indicates that
   NPLs are growing fastest among commercial loans, although the NPL ratio for the segment remains
   modest (2.9 percent in April 2009).

   31.       Household balance sheets have stretched substantially as a result of past consumer
   growth. Although household indebtedness indicators remain well below the levels in the late 1990s,
   financial burden indicators have risen to the levels observed in the pre-crisis period of the mid 1990s
   (about 25 percent of disposable income). This is because consumer loans -with lower maturities than
   mortgages- constitute a larger share of household debt. About 75 percent of loans to households are
   fixed rate loans, thus being unaffected by policy rates declines. As economic conditions continue to
   deteriorate and unemployment increases, household debt repayment capacity will continue to decline.
   Consumer credit accounts for about 27 percent of total loans. On the positive side, the rate of growth

   of consumer NPLs has declined substantially as banks improved credit origination practices during
   2007.

   32.      The financial sector can cover the GoC's additional financing needs without crowding
   out private sector credit. Domestic financing requirements for the public sector deficit are expected
   to remain modest at about 4 percent of GDP (close to US$8.5 billion). In recent years, domestic
   issuance of Treasury bonds has been as high as 5.9 percent of GDP as external debt was substituted
   with domestic debt.

Main Financial Sector Risks

   33.      The deterioration of the loan portfolio in the event of a severe economic downturn poses
   the main risk to the financial system, although measures recently adopted by the SFC provide
   adequate buffers against such risk. The BdR periodically conducts stress tests using an error
   correction model to estimate the impact of changes in macroeconomic variables on delinquency rates
   for banks' commercial, consumer and household portfolios. The impact on profits is then calculated
   taking into account the effect of additional provisions and declined interest income due to the higher
   delinquency. Tests are conducted over a 1-year horizon. The latest tests indicate that in case of a
   severe macroeconomic shock ­similar to the one occurred during the financial crisis of the late 1990s­
   almost all banks in the system would incur losses amounting to COP$ 1.4 billion8. The SFC also
   conducts stress tests regularly to calibrate additional provisioning requirements. In the event of an
   increase in delinquency rates similar to those observed during the crisis, and given current exposures,
   credit institutions -including financial companies, cooperatives, and other specialized credit
   institutions- would have to increase provisions by about COP$ 2.2 billion over the next two years.
   Given concerns regarding the quality of the loan portfolio in the current uncertain macroeconomic
   environment, the SFC requested credit institutions to capitalize part of the 2008 utilities, a measure
   supported by this operation. As result of the measure, credit institutions constituted additional capital
   reserves of about COP$ 2.1 billion. This additional cushion would ensure a CAR level for the system
   above the 10 percent level during 2009-2010 even in case of severe economic contraction.

   34.      Market risk, although increasing, remains modest. Data from the SFC shows that banks'
   market risk -measured according to a Value-at Risk model- increased by 50 percent from November
   2008 to February 2009 (see Figure 10). The increment is mostly due to the increase in the holdings of
   government securities. The declining trend in the size of banks' investment portfolio has recently
   reversed as economic perspectives deteriorated, risk aversion increased and inflation expectations
   moderated. The BdR reports that from August 2008 to February 2009, credit institutions increased
   their holdings of Treasury bonds by US$2.6 billion. However, market risk remains modest as a
   percentage of regulatory capital (4 percent) and below the levels at end-2006.

   35.      Colombian financial institutions continue to maintain adequate liquidity buffers
   although sustained credit growth in past years has increased banks liquidity risks. A new
   liquidity regulation, supported by this operation (see paragraph 74), establishes requirements for the
   management of liquidity risks and forces credit institutions to maintain liquid assets to cover liabilities
   potentially due within one week. Additionally, the BdR's liquidity risk indicator ­current liabilities
   minus liquid assets and tradable investments (with prices adjusted by a haircut)- reflects that liquid
   assets exceed liquid liabilities for all institutions. Nevertheless, liquidity buffers have declined due to
   past credit growth (from -25.0 percent at end-2005 to -5.8 percent at end-2008). Only a severe stress


8The scenario considers a negative GDP growth of 6.8 percent, a 13.7 percent contraction in internal demand, a 4.2
percentage point increase in unemployment rates, a 450 b.p. increase in interest rates and an 8 percent decline in
housing prices. The tests used information on exposures at end-2008.

   scenario poses serious liquidity risks. In the event of a 12 percent withdrawal of deposits, institutions
   holding about 60 percent of total banking assets would have to recur to illiquid assets to met liquidity
   needs9.

   36.      The GoC's general strategy is laid out in two documents: the National Development Plan
   and Visión Colombia 2019. In anticipation of Colombia's bicentennial anniversary, the National
   Planning Department launched an initiative to develop a longer term vision for the country and a
   strategy to reach it. The process involved the development of a proposal, Visión Colombia II
   Centenario: 2019 - Propuesta para Discusión, followed by rounds of discussions with citizens and
   sub-national governments to refine the vision and generate national ownership. The process
   culminated in the elaboration of Visión Colombia 2019, a longer term policy planning document
   outlining objectives over the next fifteen years. The document considers several policy areas aiming to
   create an economic environment that guarantees greater levels of well-being. Visión Colombia 2019
   and the National Development Program (NDP) 2002-2006 which was based on the results of a broad
   consultative process, constituted two of the main inputs for the formulation of the NDP 2006-2010:
   Estado Comunitario: Desarrollo para Todos. The plan lays out a comprehensive set of programs to
   implement in these four years and provides guidance for monitoring results and outcomes. The new
   NDP was formally adopted through Law 1151 of July 2007.

   37.      Both documents identify financial development as key for improving competitiveness to
   ensure high sustainable growth. High sustainable growth constitutes one of the five pillars of Visión
   Colombia 2019, which also include peace and security, promotion of equity, environmental
   sustainability and state reform to better serve citizens. The program recognized that developing a
   competitive business sector requires increasing financing to private sector companies. To do so, it

 proposes to progressively deepen financial markets by raising the ratio of broad money to GDP from
 40 percent to 80 percent by 2019. The ongoing securities market reform supported by this DPL
 constitutes an essential block in the strategy to achieve this objective, and the subsequent NDP 2006-
 2010 explicitly referred to this reform. The NDP also indentifies securities market reform as a priority
 to deepen Colombian financial markets in order to promote high sustainable growth. To promote
 savings and to channel those savings efficiently to fund private sector investment and foster growth,
 the NDP envisions a comprehensive reform of the securities market regulatory framework. The NDP
 specific objective with respect to securities market development is to increase market capitalization
 and the value of transactions to the average level in Latin America by 2019.

 38.     Capital markets have a relevant impact on the productivity of the corporate sector,
 through the provision of financing and risk management tools. Capital markets have a direct
 impact on the business sector, offering an alternative to bank debt financing (i.e. bond instruments)
 and owners' capital contributions (i.e. equity instruments) as well as risk management instruments.
 Capital markets also have an indirect effect on business productivity, as the domestic public debt
 market and money market provide the basis for the effective pricing of corporate bonds.

 39.     As the global financial crisis erupted the authorities focused on mitigating the effects of
 the crisis to avoid economic recession and preserve social gains. In order to contain the effects of
 the crisis, the authorities adopted countercyclical monetary and fiscal policies and increased funding
 from multilaterals. In the financial sector area, the authorities focused on strengthening the financial
 sector so that financial instability would not amplify the impact of the shocks. To avoid dispersing
 government and regulators focus and efforts beyond controlling the impact of the crises, and to revise
 the mid-term strategy as necessary in light of developments, the draft Financial Reform Law was
 withdrawn from Congress and was reintroduced in May after including some amendments related to
 crisis management although unfortunately some of those amendments were not approved by Congress
 (see paragraph 52).




IV.    FINANCIAL SECTOR REFORMS IN THE LAST DECADE AND THE AGENDA
                                        FOR FUTURE REFORMS

 40.     Strengthening the financial sector and developing capital markets have been at the core
 of the financial development agenda in the last decade. The reforms have resulted in a different
 financial landscape with a consolidated banking sector, more prudent supervision and regulations, and
 the development of a capital market. Following the 1999 banking crisis, recovery efforts included
 addressing insolvent state-owned banks ­through privatization, liquidation or recapitalization­, and
 deleveraging risk in housing finance through securitization of the mortgage market. As the situation
 stabilized, focus shifted to revamping financial sector regulation and supervision in order to strengthen
 financial sector stability. In order to deepen financial intermediation and provide alternative and
 efficient sources of funding to corporations, the authorities launched a comprehensive securities
 market reform. The government efforts of the past 10 years have been extensively supported by the
 World Bank and other multilaterals through a number of operations including loans, technical
 assistance, analytical work and policy dialogue. This section summarizes some of the most important
 reforms undertaken in the last decade (see Annex 6 for details) as well as the most recent reform
 developments.

 41.     On the institutional side, a single financial supervisor was created in early 2006 to
 improve coordination, reduce the scope for regulatory arbitrage and strengthen overall financial
 regulation and supervision. Based on Decree 4327/2005, the banking, insurance and pension's

                                                   22

supervisory    agency    (Superintendencia    Bancaria)    and    the   securities  supervisory   agency
(Superintendencia de Valores) merged in January 2006 into an integrated financial supervisor (SFC).
This merger was supported by the Second Programmatic Financial Sector Adjustment Loan (PFSAL
II). Even though the technical and organizational challenges of integrating the two agencies were
significant, the merger process proceeded smoothly. Market participants indicated that the objectives
of the merger have been achieved to a large extent.

42.     In addition to regulatory reforms and capital market development, substantial efforts
have also been devoted to promote financial outreach and inclusion. A decree in 2006 established
a public-private partnership trust fund, Banca de las Oportunidades. The goals of this trust fund were
to increase access to finance to provide targeted financial education, as well as technical assistance for
financial intermediaries, partial credit guarantees for micro credit institutions, and targeted subsidies.
The Credit Information Law (Ley de Habeas Data) regulated the activities of the credit reporting
industry to improve the legal framework underpinning the supply of credit. Correspondent banking
arrangements, which refer to bank partnerships with typically non-bank commercial outlets in order to
provide a range of banking services through them, were allowed and regulated in order to expand
access to banking services. All these reforms were supported by the Business Productivity and
Efficiency DPL programmatic series. The introduction of differentiated interest rate ceilings for micro
loans has allowed the expansion of credit. However, interest rate caps on mortgages continue to
hamper the access to credit to low income households and banks cannot fully charge for the risks
associated to lending to this segment. A program of housing subsidies aimed to facilitate access to
finance was introduced, although the subsidies are poorly targeted and also benefit upper-income
households.

43.     Financial sector supervision and regulation has been substantially strengthened in the
last decade. The Financial Reform law of 1999 was instrumental in facilitating the resolution of
troubled institutions and in upgrading regulation. Supervision now covers all financial institutions on
a consistent basis, using on-site examination and off-site monitoring. The Financial Reform Law of
2003 further upgraded the regulatory framework as well as the banking resolution procedures.
Financial supervision has been revamped, with a movement towards a risk-based supervision
framework. Among the new regulations, financial institutions have been obliged to adopt, where
applicable, internal systems to manage credit, market, and more recently liquidity and operational
risks. Such systems comprise policies, procedures and a corporate governance structure to deal with
each type of risk - including internal limits, remedial actions, and contingency plans- as well as a
framework to measure each particular risk.

44.     Already prior to the global financial crisis, Colombia introduced countercyclical
provision regulations in line with recent recommendations by the G-20. Under the new
regulations, lending institutions constitute additional specific provisions in the boom part of the cycle
that can be used to compensate for higher expenses due to increased provisioning during the downturn.
At present, the SFC instructs each year whether the institutions need to provision in excess or below
expected losses. In 2007 and 2008, the SFC instructed institutions to constitute the countercyclical
provision according to the difference between two transition matrices (one with through-the-cycle
probabilities of default and other with probabilities of default based on more recent observations)
provided in the norm. The countercyclical provisions for commercial loans entered into effect in July
2007, while the countercyclical provisions for consumer loans entered into effect in July 2008. As of
end-March 2009, countercyclical provisions reached US$800 million. Currently, the SFC is
contemplating the possibility of allowing credit institutions to accumulate or deplete countercyclical
provisions according to their delinquency experiences and financial strength. The main drawback of
the scheme is that the specific nature of the provisions limits the flexibility for reallocation among



                                                  23

   delinquent loans and raises tax issues. The reform proposal aims at addressing these issues but in the
   future, the adoption of a generic countercyclical provision should be considered10.

   45.      As the global crisis erupted, the authorities took measures to increase their preparedness
   against an eventual emergency. In 2008, the financial supervisory authorities conducted a crisis
   simulation exercise designed and executed with the assistance of World Bank staff to test the
   framework for resolution, largely introduced after the 1999 crisis and therefore untested. The exercise
   pointed out the need for greater clarity in the sequencing of actions and responsibilities of the different
   institutions involved in the process. In light of the experience, the authorities have requested funding
   from FIRST to finance technical assistance to draft internal protocols to clarify resolution procedures.
   The Financial Surveillance Committee -including representatives of the SFC, the Ministry of Finance
   (Ministerio de Hacienda y Crédito Público, MHCP), the BdR and FOGAFIN- has intensified its
   activities to coordinate actions across agencies involved in financial sector stability issues and develop
   contingency plans.

   46.      To further strengthen the deposit insurance scheme, the copayment was eliminated in
   early 2008. FOGAFIN guarantees deposits and certificates of deposit issued by credit institutions up
   to about US$10,000 per person per institution11. This limit covers 98.5 percent of depositors and 20
   percent of total deposits. The institutions pay a risk-adjusted insurance premium. Currently, funds
   cover about 5 percent of total deposits. To increase confidence in the system, the copayment by
   depositors was eliminated in early 2009, in line with IMF recommendations12. To further strengthen
   the framework, consideration should be given to extend the premium to all debt liabilities and to better
   publicize the existence of the fund. FOGAFIN has recently launched a revision of the available tools to
   facilitate the resolution of insolvent institutions and to ensure prompt repayment of depositors.

   47.      World Bank has supported the development of Colombian capital markets in all its
   stages. Given the number of areas to be regulated and the complexity of issues involved, securities
   markets reform is typically a multi-year process. This reform requires substantial effort in the
   regulation and implementation of normative through supervision and the creation of new entities such
   as those responsible for the operation of the new clearance and settlement systems. The 2005
   Securities Law aimed at developing a regulatory framework flexible enough to deal with innovations.
   To implement the Securities Law, the GoC has been issuing a substantial body of regulatory decrees.
   Those decrees regulated important aspects of securities markets under four big areas: supervision and
   regulation, infrastructure, architecture and market operations. Recent regulations addressed the
   professionalization of market participants and clarified the framework for the resolution of securities
   intermediaries. A new and improved regulatory framework for collective investment vehicles is
   expected to promote securities market development. The authorities have also placed substantial
   efforts to develop government securities markets and the money market, which in turn will have a
   substantial effect on private sector issuances and the availability of longer term investment options.
   The World Bank has supported this reform through a variety of operations.




10In contrast to specific provisions, generic provisions are not allocated to any particular loan and thus its use is
quite flexible. Specific provisions are tax-exempt as they reflect expected incurred loans, in contrast to generic
provisions which provide a general buffer.
11FOGAFIN guarantees the difference between the actual and minimum return on mandatory pension funds
administer by AFPs. It also guarantees the payment of insurance annuities in case of insolvency of the insurer.

The Financial Sector Reform Agenda for the Future

  48.      The global financial crisis has prompted an ongoing revision of financial architecture
  and regulation issues that will shape the future reform agenda. In light of the experience from the
  current crisis, and to prevent future ones, G-20 leaders charged a working group (Working Group on
  Enhancing Sound Regulation and Strengthening Transparency) with the responsibility for making
  recommendations to (i) strengthen international regulatory standards, (ii) enhance transparency in
  global financial markets and (iii) ensure all financial markets, products and participants are
  appropriately regulated or subject to oversight, depending on their circumstances. The group issued a
  recent report with recommendations in several areas.

  49.      The World Bank is engaged with the Colombian authorities regarding the issues for
  reform identified by the G-20 in the context of the preparation of this operation. In addition to the
  call for coordination among standard setters, the report included recommendations regarding the scope
  of financial regulation and supervision, the need for supervision of systemic risks, enhanced capital
  and liquidity buffers once the crisis subsides, and the adoption of infrastructure supportive of financial
  stability. Box 2 summarizes the main issues and recommendations for future financial reform in
  Colombia in light of the global reform agenda, and reflects the Colombian response to some of these
  issues.

  50.      Areas where further reform is also needed include strengthening the independence of the
  superintendence and legal protection of supervisors. Generally, banking rules are established by the
  MHCP and enforced by the SFC. The current banking law provides autonomy to the Superintendency
  to regulate and provide technical guidance for the sector. However, in Colombia the chief bank
  regulatory is appointed by the President of the Republic, which leaves it susceptible to political
  pressures. The SFC budget is partially subjected to the discretion of the public sector expenditure
  guidelines. Supervisory authorities and their officers should be protected against lawsuits for actions
  taken in good faith while discharging their duties.

  51.      Implementation of effective consolidated supervision would eliminate an important
  regulatory gap. The SFC can categorize financial conglomerates and require their consolidation for
  certain reporting and prudential purposes. However, there are no consolidated minimum solvency
  requirements for the entire group, which currently apply only at the level of individual credit
  institutions and the bank holding company. In addition, there are still important legal gaps in the
  definition of a financial conglomerate (i.e. presumption of subordination or `dominant influence'), and
  the scope and conduct of consolidated supervision (e.g. development of a comprehensive and
  consistent risk assessment methodology), which do not allow supervisors to fully monitor all relevant
  dimensions of an economic group. The need for multiple institutional vehicles to undertake different
  activities, due to the absence of a universal banking license, and the restrictions on equity investments
  for certain financial institutions and other reasons (e.g. tax, security, control) have encouraged the
  proliferation of complex organizational structures, including several holding companies controlled by
  their ultimate beneficiary owners via "shell" investment-vehicles (often offshore). The banking and
  securities businesses tend to be concentrated under the bank holding company, while other financial
  and real sector activities are controlled through holdings above and/or parallel to the bank. There is
  currently no regulatory requirement for the creation of a separate financial holding company that
  would assemble together the different financial institutions of mixed-activity economic groups. The
  authorities have received technical assistance from the World Bank to develop a framework for
  consolidated supervision and regulation.

                 Box 2 Financial Reform Agenda in light of the G-20 Recommendations

Regulatory and Supervisory Scope. All financial intermediaries are licensed, regulated and supervised in
Colombia. Moreover, the existence of a sole supervisor (SFC) further reduces the scope for regulatory
arbitrage. However, in this strict regulatory environment, shadow financial intermediaries may arise
periodically in order to avoid regulation and supervision. To be able to expand the purview of regulation and
supervision, the legal definition of financial intermediation could be revised to include all leveraged credit
activities. To facilitate financial innovation and diminish the incentives for shadow intermediation,
consideration could be given to allow for unregulated financial institutions, as long as they can only borrow
funds from the regulated credit institutions. At the same time as reviewing the perimeter of regulation, some
adjustments to the regulation of the core would help enhance its effectiveness. Implementation of effective
consolidated supervision and regulation would eliminate an important gap in the existing framework and allow
for increased intergroup exposures, improving financial sector efficiency. Rationalization of some of the
existing financial intermediary licenses would also improve efficiency. It is also important to note that official
regulation of all financial intermediaries, as opposed to market regulation, imposes high burden on the
regulators and expands the scope of the safety net and lender of last resort facilities. Hence, for this regulatory
construct to work properly it is essential to ensure the independence of the SFC and legal protection for the
supervisors. The discretionary powers of the SFC should be enhanced by allowing it to request additional
capital charges to cover idiosyncratic risks. A wide set of tools to manage the resolution of failed institutions
and promptly repay protected depositors will also be key to preserve the credibility of the system.

Regulation and Supervision of Systemic Risks. Colombia, as most other countries, could improve its
framework to prevent the buildup of systemic risks. Ex-ante, prudential norms to internalize systemic liquidity
risks should be adopted. Ex-post, access to systemic liquidity facilities and deposit insurance should be
properly priced to account for these risks. Regarding systemic solvency risks, BdR measures to manage the
cycle and prevent credit booms could include capital and/or generic provisioning requirements to cover
unexpected tail risks for financial institutions, in addition to traditional monetary policy instruments. Decisions
regarding the adoption of these instruments should be taken jointly with the SFC. To strengthen the system and
properly manage incentives, prudential regulations and deposit insurance premium should be calculated
through-the-cycle and account for systemic risks. In this aspect, Colombia is ahead of the curve as it has
already implemented through-the-cycle provisioning regulations.

Enhance capital and liquidity buffers once the crisis subsides. Colombia's regulatory standards have yet to
align to Basel rules, as Tier 1 capital is not measured on the basis of full deduction of intangibles, which could
lead to an artificially overstated ratio. The authorities have prepared a norm to address this shortcoming to be
issued as the turbulence subsides. The recently issued liquidity regulation, supported by this operation, would
help improve liquidity management at the institutional level. Future adoption of systemic liquidity
requirements would increase liquidity buffers.

Enhancements to supporting policies and infrastructure: In this area recommendations include adopting
compensation practices to promote prudent risk taking; the greater standardization of derivatives contracts and
the use of risk-proofed central counterparties; improved accounting standards that better recognize loan-loss
provisions and dampen adverse dynamics associated with fair-value accounting and effective enforcement of
international standards including the IOSCO code of conduct for credit rating agencies. Colombia is already
advancing in some of these areas. A new Law on Accounting and Auditing standards ­which will replace
existing Colombian standards with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and ensure standards
adjust in line with developing international best practices­ was approved by Congress in early June. A
standardized derivatives market, supported by this operation, was launched in 2008. In addition, the authorities
are currently developing a proposal to settle OTC derivative transactions through a centralized clearing system.




                                                          26

  52.      Congress recently approved the Financial Reform Law, although its implementation
  requires substantial regulation and its main components do not enter into effect immediately.
  The main components of the Financial Reform Law (approved by Congress on June 18, 2009) include
  the introduction of a system of multiple alternative funds -known as multifondos- and consumer
  protection elements. The multifondos reform allows AFPs to constitute and manage different
  portfolios so younger workers can choose a higher risk and return portfolio than older workers. The
  consumer protection aspects regulates standards regarding information, customer service and dispute
  resolution mechanisms. It also forbids the inclusion of certain terms in financial contracts which would
  limit competition and restrict the freedom of consumers to terminate the contract and enables the SFC
  to establish sanctions for financial institutions which violate the requirements established in the Law.
  The World Bank provided technical assistance to the authorities in these areas ahead of the preparation
  of the Law. However, the Financial Reform Law is a framework Law, and needs substantial regulation
  to be implemented, in particular in the multifondos component. The consumer protection component
  of the Law is expected to enter in effect in July 2010 while the multifondos component is expected to
  enter into effect 14 months after the promulgation of the Law which is expected to occur by end-July
  2009. The MHCP has expressed interest in requesting technical assistance from the World Bank for
  the preparation of the necessary regulation.

  53.      Unfortunately, some of the provisions that were recently included in the Financial
  Reform to help address some of the issues related to the regulatory and supervisory scope were
  not approved. As the global financial crisis erupted the authorities withdrew the Law from Congress
  to be able to include new elements. In April, the authorities submitted a new version to Congress for
  approval which included provisions that would increase the discretionary powers of the SFC and allow
  it to impose differential requirements across institutions and request additional capital outside of the
  prompt corrective action framework. While legal protection of supervisors would have remained an
  issue, a provision would have allowed for the coverage of the legal costs incurred in the defense of
  supervisors, unless it were proved they acted in bad faith. Another provision enhanced the powers of
  the SFC to request information, including from abroad, regarding operations of institutions that form
  part of Colombian financial groups. However, none of these provisions was approved in the final
  version of the Law. However, the powers of the SFC have been improved somewhat to the extent that
  new provisions (i) allow the SFC to request external audits, (ii) decisions by the SFC in regards of
  intervention and resolution of institutions can only be subject to administrative recourse, and (iii) the
  SFC has to authorized the investments abroad of foreign subsidiaries of Colombian financial
  institutions. The Law did introduced a provision to provide emergency liquidity facilities trough a
  special fund administer by the MHCP to financial intermediaries other than credit institutions such as
  collective portfolios and brokerage houses, which do not have access to BdR facilities.




                 V.     BANK SUPPORT TO THE GOVERNMENT'S STRATEGY

LINK TO CPS

  54.      The current Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) covers fiscal years 2008-11 and is
  aligned with the country's development goals as expressed in the 2006-2010 NDP (Plan Nacional
  de Desarrollo) and Colombia Visión 2019. The authorities requested World Bank support for five
  pillars of the NDP. The current CPS provides a flexible menu-based mix of financial and analytical
  services for each pillar tailored to the country's evolving needs (see Annex 7).

55.       The proposed operation would help achieve the objective of growth identified in the NDP
and supported by the CPS. The NDP period and provides guidance for monitoring results and
outcomes. Since the CPS is driven by the Government's NDP, the Bank evaluates as one dimension
under its results-monitoring of the CPS how effective the Government is in achieving its own
development vision and objectives. The proposed operation supports the pillar related with achieving
sustainable growth by strengthening the financial sector and developing the capital markets. The
outcome to which the CPS expected to contribute in this area was the achievement of a private sector
credit to GDP level of 27 percent, in order to support an average growth rate of 5.2 percent during the
period and a yearly average investment rate over 25 percent of GDP. The current global crisis will
prevent from achieving the ultimate growth objectives, but the proposed operation would contribute to
maintain a level of private sector credit to GDP above 27 percent (private sector credit amounted to 33
percent of GDP at end-2008) mitigating the negative impacts on the crisis.

  56.         The proposed operation is within the envelope envisioned in the current CPS. The CPS
  proposes to maintain an active IBRD lending program of up to US$4 billion. Programming is
  done on an annual basis, synchronized with the national budget process, and based on a demand-driven
  "menu" approach.



COLLABORATION WITH THE IMF AND OTHER DONORS


  57.         Bank and IMF staff maintains strong coordination and cooperation on macroeconomic
  policies. The Fund had a US$613 million precautionary stand-by arrangement with Colombia through
  the end of 2006, and no disbursements were made during the period. Colombia recently obtained
  US$10.5 billion as a one-year precautionary arrangement under the IMF's Flexible Credit Line (FCL).
  The Fund conducted the mission for the 2008 Article IV the first week of November. Bank staff
  attended the IMF team's Article IV pre-mission briefing and there have been frequent consultations
  both on macroeconomic issues and financial sector issues.



                                                                                     28

   58.      The Inter-American Development Bank (IADB) also supports the Government agenda to
   foster competitiveness to ensure high sustainable growth. The IADB Operational Strategy 2007-
   2010 for Colombia supports as well the main pillars of the Governments NDP. Specifically, in the area
   of developing mechanisms to ensure access to finance for private corporations, recent IADB projects
   have focused on ensuring a sustained flow of credit to the private sector and sub-national governments.
   Collaboration between Bank staff and IADB staff working on these operations has been fluid.

         · In 2008, the IADB approved a US$650 million for BANCOLDEX, a second tier public
             development bank. The operation provides domestic and foreign currency funds through
             credit lines that will in turn be provided to domestic financial institutions to extend
             commercial credit. It also provides co-financing and risk-sharing products and technical
             assistance.

         · In 2008, the IADB also granted a credit line of US$200 million to FINDETER a public
             financial institution that provides funding for investment programs of sub-national
             governments, to finance the program "Financiamiento a Entidades Prestadoras de Servicios
             Públicos". The objective of this program is to fund infrastructure projects and the provision
             of public services in different Colombian Departments.

         · In 2009, IADB has undertaken two programs to provide funds for SMEs. They launched a
             program for small and medium businesses to become more competitive, thereby facilitating
             access to finance for them (FINPYME). Also Bancolombia joined IADB's Trade Finance
             Facilitation Program (TFFP). FINPYME is part of the Inter-American Investment
             Corporation and is a collaboration of Colombian universities, the Chamber of Commerce and
             Banks. The program will perform diagnostic reviews of SMEs by management experts.
             Banks will be able to provide technical assistance for business improvements as well is offer
             a variety of financing options. The TFFP is a program that encourages economic growth
             through expanding financing availability for international trade activities of Latin American
             and Caribbean countries. As part of this program, IADB extends guarantees to cover letters of
             credit, promissory notes, bid bonds, performance bonds, advance payment bonds and other
             instruments used in international trade transactions that are issued by Bancolombia.

         · The Multilateral Investment Fund (MIF) has provided funding to various microfinance
             programs13. In 2007, the project "Creation of New Microfinance Institutions to Increase
             Access to Microentrepreneurs' was developed to increase the financial services to SMEs
             through the creation of specialized banks in microfinance in Colombia. Also, MIF investment
             in the Colombia Opportunity Fund a venture capital fund to support SMEs was approved in
             2008.

   59.      The US Agency for International Development (USAID) Economic Growth Strategy also
   addresses barriers to improve competitiveness in order to foster growth. Securing the Future: A
   Strategy for Economic Growth (2008) aims to (i) improve the environment for enterprise growth and
   competitiveness; (ii) strengthen economic policy and governance; (iii) create sound, well-governed
   financial systems; (iv) support legal and institutional reform; (v) support microfinance programs and
   business services for micro and small enterprises; and (vi) build trade capacity. The Bank team meets
   periodically with the USAID Mission in Colombia and there has been close collaboration particularly
   on areas related to financial sector reform and the potential impact of fiscal reforms on

13The MIF, part of the IADB group, provides technical assistance, grants and investment funding to public and
private organizations engaged in innovative development projects.

 competitiveness. USAID is also supporting, jointly with the IFC, the process of preparation and
 dissemination of regional (i.e., at the Colombian sub-national level) Doing Business reports.

RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER WORLD BANK GROUP OPERATIONS


 60.      This operation builds on the work conducted by several operations and non-lending
 services that have strengthened the financial system and developed the capital markets. During
 the last decade, several World Bank operations have supported the policies of the authorities regarding
 the financial sector in the context of a fluid and ongoing policy dialogue with the GoC. Several other
 bank operations support the other pillars of the NDP that are also included in the CPS. Some of the key
 operations in the financial sector area include (see Annex 6 for details):

      · The Financial Sector Adjustment Loan Series which supported the 2003 Financial System
           Reform Law as well as insurance and pension system reform. The loan series also supported
           the adoption of risk supervision framework, the creation of an integrated financial supervisor
           (the SFC), dismantling of insolvent state banks and the approval of the 2005 Securities Law.
      · The Business and Productivity and Efficiency DPL series which supported the merger
           between bank and securities supervisors into the SFC, and policies regarding (i) access to
           finance and money market development, (ii) regulations developing aspects of the 2005
           Securities Law and (iii) the reform of the framework to deal with ML/CFT.
      · NLTA on Financial Competitiveness, which looked at issues of financial deepening and
           competitiveness, including issues related to credit information, financial taxation, insolvency
           procedures and financial sector structure.
      · FIRST: Colombia Money market development, which aimed at strengthening the primary and
           secondary market for government securities. In the context of this project the World Bank
           provided technical assistance in the analysis, design, and implementation and testing of a
           technological platform for the securities borrowing and lending operation.
      · Financial Crisis Simulation exercise. The exercise tested how the authorities would work
           together in managing a financial crisis, and provided recommendations for follow-up work to
           strengthen crisis management arrangements in Colombia.
      · NLTA on Pensions and Financial Sector Deepening which provided input regarding (i) the
           introduction of multifondos schemes for mandatory retirement pensions (ii) supervision and
           regulation of financial conglomerates (iii) consumer protection legislation, and (iv) the
           regulation of OTC markets.

 61.      The IFC has also been promoting the development of capital markets and access to
 finance for underserved sectors. The IFC has sought to increase the efficiency of capital markets and
 develop a sound regulatory framework. This has included initiating the first Colombian Peso-
 denominated bonds issued by a multilateral financial institution, assisting with the establishment of
 Colombia's first secondary mortgage company, strengthening institutional investors, and consolidating
 the domestic capital market with partial credit guarantees for corporate bonds as well as debt and
 equity facilities to leading financial groups. Additionally, the IFC has provided support for housing
 finance, micro, small and medium enterprise financing, and the domestic securities market through
 equity investments and debt facilities. In housing finance, the IFC provided support for the
 development of the mortgage sector through partial credit guarantees, which included support for the
 issuance of nonperforming mortgage-backed securities. IFC also has projects in the pipeline that will
 help promote mortgage lending, standardize the underwriting criteria for loans and help build a pool of
 mortgage securities for the capital markets. The IFC is planning an equity investment to support
 Covinoc Equity. Covinoc specializes in the recovery of nonperforming assets in the financial system
 and will thereby help in maintaining its ability to administer loan and other financial asset portfolios.

LESSONS LEARNED

 62.    The design of the proposed operation takes into account the lessons learned from the
 overall program with Colombia and in general from Bank work with other middle-income
 countries. In particular, the most important lessons are the following:

     (a)    Operations should be focused and avoid large and complex policy matrices. Rather than
              seeking to cover an extensive list of measures the design of this DPL has sought to
              concentrate on those that address the cornerstones of financial sector strength ­including
              capital and liquidity buffers and powers to intervene in the sphere of financial
              intermediation- as well as the remaining key areas of securities market reform pending
              regulation.

     (b)    The importance of flexibility to respond to changing circumstances. In order to implement a
              lending program that best addresses Colombia's needs as a creditworthy middle income
              country, the Bank needs the flexibility to be able to respond quickly to changing
              circumstances. This is particularly important in the context of the current global financial
              and economic crisis.

     (c)    The value of prior strong analytical work. In preparing private sector development and
              financial sector policy-based operations, the Bank should lead with its comparative
              advantage which is bringing to bear strong technical capacity and ample cross-country
              experience. The Borrower must be confident that its dialogue with the Bank will add
              value to its own efforts. The Bank has maintained a very fruitful dialogue with the GoC
              during the current CPS period , as well as in previous years, leading to the preparation of
              analytical work that has assisted Colombia in the capital market reform supported by this
              DPL

     (d)    The need to take into account the political economy of reform. In designing a policy-based
              operation, political factors and the legislative needs of the country need to be understood
              and included in the dialogue with the client. To be able to address the needs of the
              borrower in a timely manner, the proposed operation contains a strong package of
              reforms that did not required Congressional approval.

     (e)    The commitment of the Government is central in ensuring the success of the program.
              Previous policy-based and investment operations all pointed to the important role of
              strong government leadership in their success. The proposed operation effectively
              responds to the GoC's own priorities and commitment as reflected in the actions already
              taken as well as the fact that the policy thrust supported by this operation lies directly
              along the key policy axes of the Government's NDP and the strategy to face the global
              financial crisis.

     (f)    Coordination with other international financial institutions, such as the IMF, is critical to
              ensure a consistent policy approach towards borrowers. This proposed operation builds
              on close collaboration with the IMF on overall economic policy and financial sector
              advice.

ANALYTICAL UNDERPINNINGS

 63.    Analytical work undertaken by the Basel Committee. As enhancing supervision of liquidity
 became more relevant, global bank supervisors from global central banks and supervisory agencies



                                                   31

  endorsed the Basel Committee's Principles for Sound Liquidity Risk Management and Supervision14.
  These principles underscore the importance of establishing a robust liquidity risk management
  framework that is well integrated into the bank-wide risk management process, as introduced in the
  regulation supported by this operation. The role of supervisors is highlighted, including the
  responsibility to intervene to require effective and timely remedial action by a bank to address liquidity
  risk management deficiencies.

  64.      Work undertaken by the international forums Financial Sector Working Groups. After
  the deepening of the current financial turmoil, the G30 Financial Regulatory Systems Working Group
  released the report "Financial Reform: A Framework for Financial Stability"15 where they proposed
  four core recommendations: i) gaps and weaknesses in the coverage of prudential regulation and
  supervision must be eliminated. ii) the quality and effectiveness of prudential regulation and
  supervision must be improved, including better-resourced prudential regulators and central banks
  operating within structures that afford much higher levels of national and international policy
  coordination; iii) institutional policies and standards must be strengthened, with particular emphasis on
  standards for governance, risk management, capital, and liquidity, and also guarding against
  procyclicality; iv) the infrastructure supporting financial markets must be made more transparent and
  much more robust and resistant to potential failures of even large financial institutions. The G-20
  Working Group on Enhancing Sound Regulation and Strengthening Transparency also has published
  several reports underlying the importance of such reforms (see paragraph 48). The "Financial Stability
  Forum Report on Addressing Procyclicality in the Financial System" notes that addressing
  procyclicality in the financial system is an essential component of strengthening the macroprudential
  orientation of regulatory and supervisory frameworks16. The report presents the importance of
  strengthening the regulatory capital framework so that the quality and level of capital in the banking
  system increases during strong economic conditions and can be drawn down during periods of
  economic and financial stress, as done in the regulation supported by the proposed operation.

  65.      The 2005 Colombia FSAP update identified the modernization of the regulatory
  framework for securities markets as key to increase liquidity, to stimulate investment and to
  promote economic growth. The report noted that the review of the securities regulatory regime
  would contribute to create an efficient institutional framework. Essential factors in the reform include
  the introduction of suitable regulations, supervision capable of enforcing the regulations and the
  implementation of international standards. The FSAP indicated that the amendment of regulatory
  framework planned by the GoC was in line with best international practices and would improve
  investor's rights protection, promote market efficiency, integrity and trustworthiness among parties,
  and prevent systemic risks. The 2005 FSAP noted that market depth and liquidity were attributable to
  the scarce supply of investment securities by local corporations, and deficiencies in the clearance and
  settlement systems, in addition to investment restrictions, issuance costs, taxation and the lack of fixed
  income hedging instruments. Some of these constraints are addressed in the policy actions supported
  by this operation.

  66.      World Bank Technical Assistance Reports. As previously discussed, the World Bank has
  provided extensive technical assistance in financial sector issues to Colombia. This operation has
  specially benefited from the inputs provided by two reports; (i) FIRST Money Market Development
  report discussion on securities trading platforms and (ii) NLTA Pensions and Financial Sector
  Deepening report regarding the regulation of OTC markets.

                     VI.     THE PROPOSED FINANCIAL SECTOR DPL

OPERATION DESCRIPTION

 67.     The proposed operation supports ongoing reforms to strengthen financial sector
 resilience and deepen securities markets to sustain growth. Recently adopted prudential measures
 increase banks' capital buffers and enhance the supervision of liquidity risks. Also, in the wake of the
 recent collapse of pyramid schemes, the framework for the intervention of unauthorized financial
 intermediaries has been substantially strengthened. The latest securities market regulations complete
 financial markets to ensure efficient risk-sharing and capital allocation and reduce systemic risks. The
 regulations have made possible the creation of a central counterparty clearing house and the creation of
 an exchanged-trade derivatives market. The upgrades in market infrastructure and its regulation, norms
 enhancing investor protection and the regulation of derivative activities will help develop further the
 Colombian securities market. The proposed operation would help achieve the objective of promoting
 savings, investment and finance to achieve sustainable growth as identified in the Colombian NDP and
 supported by the current CPS.

 68.     The proposed operation is single-tranche Development Policy Loan in the amount of
 US$300 million. At this stage, a US$300 million transaction is appropriate in light of the financing
 needs of the authorities and the strength of the package of financial sector reforms undertaken. The
 only condition of effectiveness will be the standard issuance to the Bank of the legal opinion referred
 to in Section 9.02 of the General Conditions. Such opinion shall be issued by the Head of the Legal
 Affairs Group of the Directorate of Public Credit and National Treasury of the MHCP.

 69.     In addition, the World Bank continues its dialogue with the authorities regarding future
 financial sector reforms. The dialogue is fluid regarding both reforms to be implemented in the
 medium-term arising from G-20 agenda as well as those related to the implementation of the Financial
 Reform Law. An additional DPL could be considered for the next year to support the implementation
 such reforms if necessary.

 Box 3: Good Practice Principles on Conditionality

 Principle 1: Ownership: The CPS is directly aligned with the country's development goals expressed in
 the 2006-2010 National Development Plan and Colombia Visión 2019. The government requested
 World Bank support for five pillars of the NDP. The proposed operation would help achieve the
 objective of growth-as identified in the National Development Plan-by supporting authorities' efforts to
 strengthen the financial sector and continue developing capital markets.

 Principle 2: Coordinated Accountability Framework: The program document defines the actions
 agreed with the government and summarizes expected outcomes in a program matrix. Contact with other
 multilaterals which also support policy actions in key program areas such as macroeconomic stability
 and financial sector development has been fluid, including during the preparation of the operation.

 Principle 3: Customization: The program document supports a substantial portion of the authorities'
 development strategy to strengthen the financial sector and develop the capital markets, which have been
 at the core of the financial development agenda for the government in the last decade. Furthermore, the
 DPL has been specifically designed around Colombia's current problems in face of the global financial
 turmoil and its recent challenges in adopting measures to discourage unregulated financial
 intermediation activities affecting the sector.

 Principle 4: Criticality Actions: The program matrix contains 5 prior actions considered to be the most
 critical policies to achieve the program's objectives.

 Principle 5: Transparency and Predictability: The program matrix clearly states expected outcomes
 and indicators in a transparent manner. Progress towards meeting the long term goals of the program will
 be monitored under the new FY12-FY15 CPS for Colombia.



POLICY REFORMS SUPPORTED BY THIS OPERATION

   70.      The reforms supported by this operation are summarized in the Policy Matrix contained
   in Annex II and have already been implemented by the authorities. The supported reforms cover
   three main areas and are described in the following paragraphs.

Strengthening Prudential Regulation and Supervision

   71.      Strengthening the financial system to withstand the headwinds of the global crisis is a
   priority for the authorities. Financial crises exert an important toll in terms of output decline, which
   in turn has negative consequences in terms of poverty and social indicators. Leaven and Valencia
   estimate that the average costs of financial crisis amount to 16 percent of GDP17. In addition to the
   costs in current GDP losses, financial crisis result in financial disintermediation which in turn has an
   important negative effect on potential output. While the 1999 Colombian financial crisis had a
   relatively modest effect in terms of GDP growth (about 4 percent contraction in 1999 followed by
   positive growth in 2000), private sector credit as a share of GDP remains modest and has yet to
   recover its pre-crisis level.

   72.      To improve the resilience of the Colombian credit institutions, the SFC adopted a
   countercyclical policy by instructing credit institutions to capitalize 2008 profits in December


17Laeven, L. and F. Valencia, 2008. "Systemic Banking Crises: A New Database", Working Paper No. 08/224,
International Monetary Fund.

                                                      34

   2008. To increase capital buffers, the SFC instructed credit institutions to retain part of the profits
   obtained during the period June-December 2008 to constitute a capital reserve18. Credit institutions
   will use the capital reserve to absorb eventual credit losses during the next two years. At end-2010, the
   unused part of the reserve could be used at the discretion of the institutions. The aim of the instruction,
   as in the case of the countercyclical provisions, is to strengthen institutions resiliency by constituting
   buffers in good times to mitigate the effect of the deterioration in credit quality during the downward
   part of the cycle.

   73.      Total retained profits for the system amounted to about COP$2.1 billion. The SFC, taking
   into account the results of the stress-tests to assess the potential impact of credit losses (see paragraph
   33), established the percentage of profits to be capitalized by credit institutions. The percentage
   -ranging from 90 percent to the average profit capitalization of the last three years- is a function of
   the institutions' non-performing loan portfolio, provisions and regulatory capital. If shareholder
   meetings failed to approve the retention of profits proposed by the SFC, a norm would be issued
   forcing the capitalization. All institutions approved the retention of profits for, at least, the amount
   indicated by the SFC. As a result of the measure, the CAR of the credit institutions increased to 15
   percent in January 2009, up from 13.4 percent at end-2008 while for the banks increased from 12.7
   percent to 14.1 percent. The measure brought the Colombian banking system's capital level close to
   the level in other countries in the region.

   74.      The SFC also introduced a norm to enhance liquidity buffers and improved the
   supervision of liquidity risks. The new regulation (Circular Externa 16/2008) mandates financial
   institutions, except for insurance companies, to develop and implement internal systems to measure
   and administer liquidity risks with a view to improve their preparation to manage such risks. The
   internal systems should comprise policies and procedures to deal with liquidity risk - including
   internal limits, remedial actions, and contingency plans- as well as a framework to measure such risk.
   In the case of credit institutions, the new regulation provided a standardized framework to compute the
   liquidity gap (assets minus liabilities) for different time brackets. To increase liquidity buffers and
   prevent reliance in short-term wholesale funding, credit institutions shall now hold enough liquid
   assets to cover liabilities potentially due within one week19.

Strengthening the Framework for the Intervention and Resolution of Unauthorized
Financial Intermediation Activities

   75.      Financial intermediation is strictly regulated in Colombia. Financial activities including
   deposit taking, securities intermediation and the public offering of securities require SFC
   authorization. In addition, Decree 1981/1988 states that collecting money from the public in a
   massive and habitual manner without the proper authorization is an administrative and criminal
   offense. The Banking Law (Estatuto Organico del Sistema Financiero, EOSF) provides the SFC with
   the authority to conduct on-site inspections on unregulated entities, as well as to examine their records,
   when there is evidence that the entity is undertaking a financial activity without authorization. In
   addition, it provides the SFC with the authority to impose certain precautionary measures on entities


18Evidenced by Letter No2009037259-000-000, issued by the SFC on May 8, 2009.
19The regulation mandates credit institutions to compute a liquidity risk indicator (Indicador de Riesgo de Líquidez,
IRL) as the difference between liquid assets and liquidity requirements. Liquid assets are defined as cash and
tradable securities (adjusted by a haircut) minus mandatory reserve requirements. Foreign currency and securities
denominated in foreign currency have also a haircut for exchange rate risk. The liquidity requirements are the
expected net cash-flows during the next seven days, including assets minus liabilities maturing within one week
(both on-balance and off-balance sheet) plus a proportion of current account and savings deposits (based on
historical observations of withdrawals). The IRL has to be positive.

that undertake financial activities without authorization, although it required that the evidence meet the
standards set by Decree 1981. Such measures include: (i) immediate suspension of the activities
undertaken; (ii) liquidation of the entity; and (iii) fast and progressive liquidation of the operations
undertaken illegally. Failure to comply with the order of suspension carried an administrative penalty
of up to 61 million pesos (Decree 2269/1987, which regulates Article 65 of the Administrative Code).
According to Article 316 of the Law 599/2000, taking money from the public in a massive and
habitual manner without authorization constitutes an offense punishable with up to six years in prison.

76.      A particular type of unauthorized financial intermediary, unregulated investment
schemes (UIS), had grown quickly in Colombia. The schemes had expanded quickly through a
system of referrals by existing members and offered unusually high returns (up to 300 percent within 6
months). Such schemes are pervasive and persistent phenomena and emerge on a regular basis even in
developed countries with strong regulatory frameworks, as shown by the recent experience in the
United States with an US$50 billion alleged Ponzi scheme run by Bernard Madoff. The Colombian
UIS drew funds mostly from the poor, but their appeal broadened over time. One of the largest
schemes, Grupo DMG, had been in operation for three years, and had over 60 branches in Colombia as
well as offices in Venezuela and Ecuador. DMG operated a sophisticated scheme; it distributed pre-
paid credit cards which investors could use to buy appliances and consumer electronics from selected
retailers. Customers could also collect points which could be redeemed for cash after several months.
The scheme offered a return of 150­300 percent on this investment. Customers also became salesmen.
It remained current on its obligations for three years, even after other schemes collapsed.

77.      The authorities had been aware of the existence of such UISs, but taking measures under
the existing legal framework proved difficult. As the SFC became aware of such activities, it issued
public warnings in newspapers regarding the unregulated nature of the schemes and imposed
precautionary measures for several UISs. Such measures mainly included an order to cease the illegal
activities and return the money collected from the public, based on a restitution plan to be submitted
by each entity to their regulatory agency or to the district court. In the case of DMG, the SFC also
passed the investigative file to the Prosecutor's office, specifically to the unit in charge of money
laundering crimes. However, the requirements established by the Decree 1981/1998 to consider that
such misconduct has taken place are quite onerous. The SFC had to extensively document and prove
that financial resources were being collected from the public over an extended time. Doing so requires
accounting information, which is difficult and time consuming to collect given the unreliability of the
accounting records of the UIS and the intensive use of cash that prevailed in such schemes, preventing
any traceability of transactions. In addition, in many cases sophisticated schemes were designed to
resemble legal activities, and this complicated the collection of evidence. Even in cases where the SFC
was able to impose precautionary measures, some of the schemes continued to operate by creating new
vehicles different from the ones initially penalized.

78.      The measures adopted by the GoC in late 2008 and supported by this operation
strengthened the framework for the intervention of UIS, allowing for swift action against
existing pyramid schemes. The collapse of a scheme called DRFE (the Spanish initials for "Fast,
Easy Money in Cash") led to rioting and violent protests in 13 cities in Colombia. On November 17,
2008 the Government declared a state of social emergency by Decree 4333/2008. According to the
Colombian constitution, it is possible to regulate certain topics by Decree under the state of
emergency. Under these powers, the government issued two other important decrees to strengthen its
ability to deal with UIS, stop their operation and recover funds. The Constitutional Court announced
that Decrees 4333, 4334 and 4335 were in compliance with constitutional requirements in all the
relevant issues supported by this operation.




                                                  36

    (a)       Decree 4334/2008 provides the government, via the Superintendency of Companies
              (Superintendencia de Sociedades, SS), the authority to intervene in the operations of any
              entity that undertakes the collection of resources or cash from the public without
              authorization. The SS can act "de motu propio" or at the request of the SFC. The burden of
              proof to intervene is substantially reduced. The SS can now intervene if there are "notorious
              and objective facts" that the SS considers proof of collection of resources from the public.
              Administrative intervention (a legal mechanism similar to conservatorship) comprises a wide
              range of measures aimed at halting the operation of UIS and establishing an organized
              procedure to return resources to the affected persons. Thus, it allows the SS to take strategic
              and precautionary measures, including taking control of the entity and possession of all its
              assets, ordering the freeze of assets, and returning funds to the affected persons. All those
              measures can be imposed by the SS directly, without the need for court approval.

    (b)       Decree 4335/2008 provides the heads of local governments (Mayors and Governors) with the
              power to impose certain precautionary measures (including closing of the premises) on
              entities located in their respective jurisdictions that are undertaking financial activities
              without authorization.

   79.       The    measures     adopted    in   this   area    will  discourage     unauthorized financial
   intermediation, preserving financial sector stability and protecting the poor. Unauthorized
   intermediaries, even if they are not fraudulent like the pyramid schemes, are more prone to failure
   given the lack of supervision and regulation. The collapse of these intermediaries could undermine the
   confidence in the regulated financial system and have potential sever consequences. Also the
   regulation will help prevent the socio-economic strife that occurs when a large number of households
   are suddenly exposed to losses. Finally, the regulation will protect financial consumers from these
   unregulated intermediaries. The poor, which according to anecdotic evidence are specially targeted by
   these intermediaries, would benefit most from these regulations20. With the powers provided by these
   regulations several smaller UIS have been intervened in the first half of 2009 sending a powerful
   signal on the consequences of such type of activities.

Securities Market Reform

   80.       The proposed operation supports the implementation of most of the remaining key
   aspects of securities market reform. Specifically, the supported reforms upgrade market
   infrastructure with a view to reduce systemic risks and encourage market development. The reforms
   also review the regulation of securities intermediation activities and, for the first time, regulated
   derivative operations.

Upgrading Market Infrastructure

   81.       Efficient market infrastructure fosters market development by reducing transaction
   costs and systemic risks. Transaction costs are reduced as volumes and market liquidity increase,
   which depends on confidence in the safety and reliability of the settlement and trading arrangements.
   Upgrades in market infrastructure are necessary to develop certain products such as exchange-traded
   derivatives. To ensure efficient and smooth functioning of the systems, the adoption of these
   infrastructure upgrades need to be properly regulated. This has been done through the approval of a
   package of decrees during 2007-2008.

Pattillo, C. and Wynter, B., 2009. "Ponzi Schemes in the Caribbean", Working Paper No. 09/95, International
Monetary Fund.

                                                        37

  82.      Securities settlement systems (SSSs) are a critical component of the infrastructure of
  securities markets and its function needs to be properly regulated. Weaknesses in SSSs can be a
  source of systemic disturbances to securities markets and to other payment and settlement systems. As
  pointed in the CPSS-IOSCO recommendations, problems at a major user of an SSS could result in
  significant liquidity pressures or credit losses for other participants. In addition, disruption of securities
  settlements can spill over to any payment system used by the SSS or any payment systems that use the
  SSS to transfer collateral21. The new regulation (Decree 1456/2007), strengthens SSSs by establishing
  the criteria to determine the finality of settlements in securities transactions, providing legal certainty
  to market participants undertaking said transactions. Previously, trades could be nullified although
  they had been agreed by participants creating market instability and insecurity. The reform forces
  participants to settle their positions executing the guarantees if necessary to secure payment and
  preventing the unwinding of positions in case of bankruptcy. The regulation also establishes
  requirements for the administrators of SSSs. The regulation also establishes the requirements for the
  bylaws of the SSSs, including procedures to ensure delivery-versus-payment for all securities
  transactions among domestic participants.

  83.      Another important infrastructure upgrade to foster market development is the adoption
  of automatic trading systems. To ensure the efficient functioning of the trading systems, the
  authorities regulated automatic trading and registration systems. Decree 1120/2008, establishes a series
  of requirements including authorization by the SFC, the duties of trading systems administrators,
  information technology, security and transparency requirements. The reform responds to the needs
  introduced by the technological changes with a view to protect investors' rights and reduce operational
  risks in trading systems.

  84.      Finally, a central counterparty clearing house (CCCH) was established and regulated to
  launch an exchange-traded derivative market. Exchange-traded derivatives (ETD) are those
  derivatives products that are traded via specialized derivatives exchanges or other exchanges. A
  derivatives exchange acts as an intermediary to all related transactions, and takes an initial margin
  from both sides of the trade to act as a guarantee. An ETD market requires a CCCH, which is a
  financial services company that provides clearing and settlement services for financial transactions (the
  payor actually pays the clearing house, which then pays the payee). Following the issuance of Decree
  2893/2007, which regulated the functioning of the CCCH -including its corporate structure and
  governance, registration and capital requirements- the standardized derivatives market started
  operating on September 1, 2008. So far, the only future traded in the standardized market is a future
  over a notional 5 year government bond. Soon it is expected that other futures begin to trade including
  futures on the stock market index, exchange rate futures and commodities futures. Currently, there is a
  proposal to settle OTC derivatives through the CCCH to improve transparency, reduce counterparty
  and systemic risks in line with G-20 recommendations.



Enhancing Market Architecture and operations

  85.      Capital markets cannot flourish without a solid market structure. Therefore, developing
  the securities markets requires appropriate regulation of intermediaries and the operations and
  transactions that can be negotiated and executed in the market. In this area, the authorities have placed
  substantial emphasis in the last two years.

  86.      The new regulation regarding intermediation activities reflects the stricter requirements
  for transparency, corporate governance and professionalism imposed by the Law 964/2005 in

21See CPSS-IOSC0 (2001) "Recommendations for Securities Settlement Systems", BIS, OISCU-IOSCO.

                                                     38

   order to protect investor rights. The regulation defines what constitute securities intermediation and
   securities operations. It establishes the principles, policies and procedures applicable to securities
   intermediaries    ­including    know-your-costumer       rules­   to   enhance  market   intermediaries'
   professionalism. In particular, the regulation establishes the distinction between "professional
   investors" and "investor clients". The latter need to be offered advice consistent with their lack of
   expertise (a measure to protect investor rights). Only brokerage houses can act as securities brokers.
   Proprietary investments of the brokerage house need to be strictly separated from clients' investments
   to protect their investments in case of legal actions against the broker and to avoid misuse of client
   resources on risky investments on behalf of the broker. (Decree 1121/2008).

   87.      The regulation also increases the transparency of OTC markets. The Decree 1121/2008,
   defines what is an OTC market, who can participate in the market and what type of operations can be
   performed. In order to increase transparency of the market, it requires mandatory reporting of all OTC
   transactions to a securities trading registry, regulated by the SFC. OTC derivative transactions shall be
   settled through systems that guarantee delivery-versus-payment.

   88.      Finally, derivative products have been regulated for the first time in Colombia to
   promote hedging of market exposures among market participants, particularly pension funds
   and insurance companies. To this end, the authorities regulated derivatives trading (both in OTC and
   ETD markets), including trough the issuance of accountancy criteria, as well as the treatment of
   exposures for the purpose of computing counterparty credit risks in line with international standards
   (Decree 1796/2008). Risk hedging products are fundamental to cope with the macroeconomic and
   financial volatility that characterizes emerging economies and pose significant growth risks. In
   addition, the development of derivative products fosters securities market development which in turn
   supports economic growth. Risk hedging will stimulate trading in other products as investors will be
   better equipped to manage their exposures to different risks while deep and liquid derivative markets
   enhance price formation for the underlying products.




                               VII.    OPERATION IMPLEMENTATION

POVERTY AND SOCIAL IMPACTS

   89.      The proposed operation supports policies that seek to reduce poverty, through fostering
   sustainable economic growth. A favorable stronger, more efficient, and more diversified financial
   system and capital market can provide the opportunity to private enterprises (the engine of economic
   expansion) to access a larger amount of resources. The relationship between capital market
   development and economic growth is well established in the economic literature. Schumpeter (1911)
   argued that the services provided by financial intermediaries are paramount for technical innovation
   and economic growth22. Hicks (1969) believed that technological innovation alone did not ignite the
   sustained growth in eighteenth century England; financial innovations were the sine-qua-non of the
   industrial revolution23. In a seminal paper, Levine and Zervos (1996) found a positive correlation
   between an index of capital market development -including factors such as market capitalization, total
   value traded and turnover ratios- and long term growth using panel data24. Several studies have also

   found feedback effects between financial development and macroeconomic growth25. Capital market
   development not only promotes economic growth but it can also improve income distribution as
   capital markets level the playing field facilitating the access to finance without the need of collateral.
   The proposed operation advances the CPS's aim of promoting fast and sustainable growth through
   stimulating private sector activity and investment.

   90.      Prevention of financial crises is also essential to poverty alleviation. Years of consistent
   economic growth throughout the 1980s and early 1990s lifted many households out of poverty in
   Colombia, but the macroeconomic crisis at the end of the 1990s eradicated more than a decade of
   progress. As previously indicated, Leaven and Valencia estimate that the average costs of financial
   crisis amount to 16 percent of GDP26. In addition to the costs in current GDP losses, financial crisis
   result in financial disintermediation which in turn has an important negative effect on potential output.
   In the case of Colombia, as stable economic growth resumed in the last few years national poverty
   measures have begun to improve again. The ongoing global financial and economic crisis has severely
   deteriorated macroeconomic conditions and heightens financial sector vulnerabilities. For example, in
   light of the recent crisis, Ravallion (2009) has estimated the global declining trend of poverty will be
   continue but at a less precipitous rate27. As the global economy continues to contract in 2009, he
   anticipates in absolute terms more than 64 million people will fall into further poverty measured at
   US$2 a day and the continued progress of global poverty decline will continue albeit at a slower pace
   with varying degrees of impacts on income distribution and inequality. In strengthening the financial
   system through greater market integrity and enhanced prudential regulation, the proposed program
   helps to reduce the risk of future financial crises.

   91.      The measures adopted to prevent the growth of unregulated financial intermediaries
   would help protect savings of low-income households. Although data on the earnings of investors of
   the failed pyramid schemes is not available, there is substantial anecdotic evidence that low-income
   households were the primary customers of the pyramid schemes that collapsed recently, and many
   modest families lost their savings as a result. The measures supported by this operation would help
   preventing the formation and growth of such fraudulent schemes by granting authorities the power to
   intervene swiftly.

   92.      The overall distributional effects of the policies supported by the program document are
   not likely to be significant. The program can be reasonably expected to contribute to reducing
   poverty in Colombia, but its impacts would be difficult to quantify because the drivers of economic
   growth and poverty reduction are multiple and intertwined. Many of them, including international
   economic conditions and commodity prices, are beyond the control of the GoC or the scope of this
   program (see reference to analytical work on poverty paragraph 63-66 and Annex 6).

ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECTS

   93.      This loan is not expected to have a significant effect on the environment. None of the three
   policy areas covered by this operation (strengthening prudential regulation and supervision,
   strengthening the framework for the intervention and resolution of unauthorized financial
   intermediation activities and reforming securities markets) are expected to have a direct and significant

 effect on the environment. They could have an indirect effect through increased economic growth and
 production but Colombia is well prepared to address them.

 94.     The GoC is better prepared to identify potential environmental impacts and to address
 them given an ongoing program of reforms to improve its environmental management capacity.
 The GoC has engaged in a number of activities to protect the environment and has embarked on an
 extensive environmental reform program with the support of the Bank. The government prepared a
 strategy outlined in the 2006-2010 NDP, which focuses on guaranteeing sustainable growth and
 reducing poverty by improving cross-sectoral planning and calling for the strengthening of the
 National Environment System (SINA). As a result, the GoC now has greater institutional capacity to
 plan and implement policies to ensure environmentally sustainable development. Institutional capacity
 is expected to keep improving in the future and the Bank plans to keep accompanying the GoC in this
 process through the Programmatic Series of Development Policy Loans for Sustainable Development
 and the Sustainable Development Investment Loan.

 95.     The Programmatic Series of Development Policy Loans for Sustainable Development is
 contributing to strengthen the GoC's environmental policy framework and institutional
 capacity. The first loan of the program was completed in FY06 and provided groundwork for many
 of the strategies and reforms included in the NDP. The second operation of the program, which was
 completed in June 2007, focused on the development and passage of sustainable development policies
 to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the SINA and integrate the principles of sustainable
 development into the key sectors of water and urban air quality. Finally, the third loan of the program
 focuses on the results of implementing the sustainable development policies supported by the previous
 operations.

CONSULTATIVE PROCESS

 96.     The value of a broad consultative process to feed in the design of the operation to ensure
 country ownership and the success of the reforms is necessary for broad social support. The
 World Bank, in its long engagement on financial sector issues with Colombia (see Annex 6), has
 maintained a close dialogue with financial authorities, financial institutions and the users of financial
 services (consumer associations as well as representatives of the corporate sector).         Such close
 dialogue was followed also in the preparation of this operation. The measures to strengthen the
 financial sector and to strengthen the framework to intervene in unauthorized financial intermediaries
 enjoy broad support among stakeholders. The securities market reform was identified as a key reform
 in the NDP 2002-2006 that was preceded by a broad consultative process with broad stakeholders,
 including several rounds of discussions with citizens and sub-national governments to ensure national
 ownership.

IMPLEMENTATION, MONITORING, AND EVALUATION

 97.     The objectives of the proposed operation are aligned with those identified by the civil
 society in creating the National Development Plan. The formulation of the NDP 2006-2010 was by
 Visión Colombia 2019 and the NDP 2002-2006. Both documents were results of an extensive
 consultative process with broad stakeholders, including several rounds of discussions with citizens and
 sub-national governments to ensure national ownership. NDP 2006-2010 long term goal is to achieve
 higher, sustainable economic development in Colombia. The proposed DPL is directly supporting the
 2006-2010 NDP's objective through the implementation of the securities reform, indentified as a
 prioritary reform in the DNP. Other measures supported by this DPL are motivated by the current
 financial crisis and the management of its effects, which prevents civil society consultations. However,
 the objectives of such measures are fully aligned with the objectives of identified in the NDP of
 promoting sustainable growth.

    98.      The MHCP is responsible for the implementation of the proposed DPL as well as for
    coordinating actions among the concerned agencies including, in particular, the SFC and the
    BdR. Together with the MHCP, these institutions will collect the necessary data to assess
    implementation progress and report it to the Bank, taking into account both process advances and
    service statistics, survey and other data that might be used to assess the achievement of the program's
    end outcomes.

    99.      Under the current dialogue with the GoC, Bank's staff will coordinate with a Financial
    Regulation division of MHCP to monitor the progress of the implementation of the proposed
    operation. This division of the MHCP will prepare reports on the progress in achieving the loan
    objectives towards the expected outcomes during the entire period of the loan. The indicators used to
    monitor the achievement of objectives are included in the Policy Matrix in Annex 2.

FIDUCIARY ASPECTS, DISBURSEMENT, AND AUDITING

Fiduciary Aspects

    100.     In general, Colombia's fiduciary environment for DPL operations is considered
    adequate. Particularly, important progress has been made in the modernization of the Public Financial
    Management (PFM) systems and institutions at the central government level, as explained in Box 3.
    The Bank continues to contribute to this effort, through PFM-related investment lending and
    analytical/advisory services support.



Box 4: Public Financial Management

Colombia has made important progress toward improving transparency and enhancing accountability in its public
financial management (PFM) systems. The national tax administration has undergone significant improvements over
the last five years in its systems and practices. Similarly, controls in public expenditure have been strengthened
through a comprehensive integrated financial management system, implementation of a standard internal control
model, and reforms to the procurement system, such as the recently approved Procurement Law. However, there is
still, room for reducing transaction costs and exposure to waste and abuse, through the implementation of risk
management tools, better procurement practices and audit mechanisms.

The administration's current strategy, documented in the National Development Plan's pillar of "A State at the
Service of its Citizens: Efficient and Effective Government", provides inter alia for the continuous improvement of
public sector administrative models and expenditure efficiency. The NDP explicitly addresses important PFM areas
such as budget management, asset administration, procurement reform, internal controls, and results-based
management.

Relevant improvements to the procurement system, such as the introduction of merit evaluation as criteria for
selection of consultant services, create an opportunity to converge with international good practice. Framework
contracts are also foreseen, which should translate into important savings in public procurement. However, there are
several aspects of the reform which are still underway and will need to be evaluated as their implementation
progresses.

A public financial management and procurement performance study is currently underway.


Disbursement and Auditing

    101.     Following the Borrower's request(s) for withdrawal from the loan account, the funds
    would be transferred into an account of the BdR denominated in US dollars. BdR would


                                                          42

  immediately credit the disbursed amounts to an MHCP National Treasury Account, thus becoming
  available to finance budgeted expenditures to be accounted for in the national integrated financial
  information system (SIIF). Upon request from the Bank, MHCP would provide written confirmation of
  the cited transaction.

  102.    An IMF central bank safeguards assessment of the BdR found no systematic
  vulnerabilities as of 2003 and 2005. Nothing further came to the attention of the DPL preparation
  team that caused it to believe that the control environment into which the loan proceeds will flow is
  other than adequate.

  103.    Because of the described conditions, no additional fiduciary arrangements (e.g. dedicated
  accounts subject to audit) are deemed necessary for this DPL.

RISKS AND RISK MITIGATION

  104.    The main risk to the operation arises from further deterioration of macroeconomic
  conditions, which would negatively affect the health of the financial system. The aim of the
  reforms supported by this operation is to strengthen the financial system and develop securities market
  to ensure high sustainable growth. A more protracted economic slowdown could hamper financial
  sector stability and limit trading volumes in the securities markets. In particular:

       · As conditions deteriorate, the authorities may be pressured to grant regulatory forbearance.
            Under the baseline growth scenario this risk has low probability and low impact. Under the
            low-growth case scenario the pressure will mount at the time that the deterioration in
            economic conditions impact the balance sheet of financial institution. In this case, this risk
            has medium probability and medium impact. In cases of systemic financial distress there
            could be a case for regulatory forbearance, tackling the problems through a well designed
            financial sector support program is the best solution to install confidence in the system and
            prevent financial disruptions. The authorities have proven in the past its ability to move
            market participants in the desired direction using either legal powers or moral suasion and
            have handled financial crisis efficiently and with relatively low costs.

       · There could be inability/lack of resources and/ or preparedness at the supervisory level to
            handle complex situations such as the eventual failure of a large institution. This risk has low
            probability and medium impact. The regulator has been monitoring the situation for some
            time now and has been preparing itself for critical situations (see paragraph 45).

       · The foreseeable weak macroeconomic environment, both domestic and global, over the
            medium term will likely delay the desired vibrant growth of securities market. This risk has
            medium probability and medium impact. The GoC has shown strong commitment to develop
            securities market despite delays.



  105.    Finally, there is a risk that Colombia's current level of public debt could pose a risk to
  the country's macroeconomic stability. On the basis of the sustainability analysis undertaken (see
  Annex 5), debt levels appear to be manageable in the near term, even when considering possible
  adverse economic shocks.

Mr.
ROBERT B. ZOELLICK
Presidente
Banco Mundial
Banco Internacional de Reconstrucción y Desarrollo
1818 H Street, N. W.
Washington, D. C. 20433
Estados Unidos de América



Dear Mr. Zoellick:

The second administration of President Álvaro Uribe Vélez remains committed to the implementation of
the structural reforms set forth in the 2006-2010 National Development Plan. These reforms aim at
preserving macroeconomic stability and the integration in the global economy. The implementation of
these reforms, as well as the reforms included in the structural reform program 2002-2006, prompted a
sustain period of growth, reduction in unemployment and poverty levels, declining inflation, improved
public debt management and fiscal deficit reduction. The reforms also strengthened the institutional
framework. Many of these reforms have been endorsed by the World Bank.

However, the global financial crisis has affected Colombia through several channels, including reduced
capital inflows and exports, weakened domestic demand, and lower fiscal revenues. To ensure the
sustainability of the economic program, the Government of Colombia is requesting a Financial Sector
Development Policy Loan to the World Bank. This operation will support ongoing reforms to strengthen
financial sector resilience and deepen securities markets to sustain growth. The reforms would help
achieve the objective of promoting savings, investment and finance to achieve sustainable growth.

The lessons from the economic crisis of the 1990s have been applied in the present circumstances. The
Colombian Government has adopted countercyclical policies to mitigate the effects of the global crisis.
The Government has sought the consistency of fiscal and monetary policies, respecting the autonomy of
the Central Bank.

Fiscal policy aimed to mitigate the impact of the crisis while preserving medium-term debt sustainability.
To this end, automatic stabilizers have fully adjusted; lower tax revenues have translated into higher fiscal
deficits while expenditures have been protected to sustain internal demand. Indentified expenditures
priorities include infrastructure, to promote productivity and competitiveness, and social expenditures to
sustain the consumption of the most vulnerable segments of the population. Monetary policy has been
loosened to counter the effects of the cycle as weakened demand and lower food and oil prices keep
inflation on a downward trend. Fiscal and monetary policy loosening have contributed to the exchange
rate flexibility.

In addition, the financing strategy adopted during this period has been proactive, flexible and transparent
for the markets. In the present circumstances, the Government is making all efforts to obtain the financing
necessary to implement its economic program. The investment plan funded by the Government is
designed to support economic growth and employment.

Regarding the financial system, the Government has improved the resilience of the sector by
strengthening financial supervision. In the current context, the government has intensified its efforts to
ensure financial sector resilience and reinforce the confidence in the system to avoid that deterioration in
economic conditions and could hamper financial intermediation, which in turn would have severe
consequences. The Government has also proceed with the implementation of the securities market reform,

                                                     48

which started in 2005 and has been supported by the World Bank through its different stages, to promote
savings and to channel those savings efficiently to fund private sector investment and foster growth.

The Government strategy of strengthening the financial sector has resulted in a series of measures and
regulations. To improve the solvency of the Colombian credit institutions, the Financial Superintendency
of Colombia (SFC) adopted a countercyclical policy by instructing credit institutions to retain part of the
profits obtained during the second semester of 2008 in a capital reserve. Credit institutions will use the
capital reserve to absorb eventual credit losses during the next two years. The SFC also introduced a
norm regarding liquidity risk management (Circular Externa 16/2008) establishing the requirements for
the internal liquidity risk management systems of the financial institutions. The internal systems should
comprise policies and procedures to deal with liquidity risk - including internal limits, remedial actions,
and contingency plans- as well as a framework to measure such risk. Credit institutions shall now hold
enough liquid assets to cover liabilities potentially due within one week. Said measure increases liquidity
buffers and prevents reliance in short-term wholesale funding.

Financial intermediation is strictly regulated in Colombia. According to article 333 of the Constitution
and the Colombian Laws, the activities related to the management, use and investment of resources
collected from the public are of public interest and the only entities legally authorized to conduct such
activities are those subject to the supervision, control and surveillance of the SFC or of the
Superintendence of the Cooperative Economic Sector. However, in the last years several schemes by
which resources were collected from the public outside the legal sphere had proliferated across the
country. A significant portion of the population had invested their savings in these schemes, which
expanded quickly thanks to the false expectations generated by the promised exorbitant returns. Such
investments carry great risks, as they are not subject to any prudential regulation and supervision and lack
the assurances and guarantees that apply to the authorized financial sector. The collapse of the entities
conducting such activities can also negatively affect the confidence on the regulated financial system
through contagion effects, with potentially severe consequences.

As such schemes grew in the different Colombian Departments, the judicial and administrative authorities
(including the SFC) adopted several measures. Nevertheless, the collapse of some of these unauthorized
investment schemes in late 2008 led to rioting and violent protests in several Departments which had a
significant number of investors in such schemes. These events underlined to the need to (i) adopt a
framework that allows for swift action in the event of illegal collection of resources from the public to
prevent the proliferation of such activities, and (ii) establish expedite procedures to promptly restitute
investors in such schemes (specially the poor) through the sale of the confiscated assets. In November
2008, the Government issued a series of Decrees for these purposes under the legal powers granted in the
case of "State of Social Emergency". Among these Decrees, it is worth noticing


    · Decree 4334/2008 which provides the Superintendency of Companies (Superintendencia de
         Sociedades, SS), the authority to intervene if there are "notorious and objective facts" that the SS
         considers proof of collection of resources from the public without authorization. The SS can act
         "de motu propio" or at the request of the SFC. Administrative intervention allows (without the
         need for court approval) for the adoption of a wide range of measures including halting the
         collection operations, taking control of the entity and possession of all its assets, and the orderly
         return of funds to investors.

    ·        Decree 4335/2008, which provides the heads of local governments (Mayors and Governors)
         with the power to impose certain precautionary measures (including closing of the
         establishments) on entities located in their respective jurisdictions that are undertaking financial
         activities without authorization. The SS would be notified immediately of such actions.

                                                      49

The Government has taken measures to act against the schemes that collected illegally resources from the
public and to compensate the affected investors through the administration and liquidation of the
confiscated assets and the prosecution of those responsible. We are confident that these measures will
discourage unauthorized financial intermediation.

Regarding securities market reform, a series of Decrees implemented some of the key areas of the
Securities Market Law of 2005 (Law 964/2005). The package of Decrees that regulate the upgraded
market infrastructure (Decrees 1456/2007, 2893/2007, 1120/2008), including securities settlement
systems, trading and registration systems and the central counterparty clearing house. The improvement
in the market infrastructure will reduce transaction costs, allow for the trading of standardized derivatives
products and will reduce systemic risks, fostering market development. It is also worth noticing the new
regulation of securities intermediation and securities operations (Decree 1121/2008). Such regulation
establishes the principles, policies and procedures applicable to the securities intermediaries including
"know your customer rules" to increase their professionalism. The regulation of derivatives (Decree
1796/2008) comprises accountancy criteria, as well as the treatment of exposures for the purpose of
computing counterparty credit risks in line with international standards. These regulations made possible
the creation of formal standardized derivatives markets, which started functioning in September 2008.

Reforms in the financial sector proceed, as the Government is aware of the remaining areas that need
revision. On June 18, 2008, Congress approved the Financial Reform Law which will be enacted within a
month. Nevertheless, the main components of the reform (financial consumer protection and the adoption
of a "multifondos" scheme for the pension capitalization plans) will not enter into effect until July 1, 2010
and fourteen (14) months after the enactment of the Law respectively. This is not only due to the
substantial regulatory efforts necessary to implement the Law, particularly on its "multifondos"
component, but also to the changes that need to be implemented in the institutions.

While the Colombian Laws include consumer protection aspects, it was necessary to formulate a legal
framework specific for the financial sector to establish consumer rights and the obligations of the
financial intermediaries, as well as to give legal status to the norms regarding the provision of financial
information. The reform introduces the figure of Financial Consumer Ombudsman and establishes stricter
transparency requirements for fees and a the requirement of Customer Service System (SAC).

The multifondos scheme aims at optimizing the risk-adjusted rate of return of the individual capitalization
pension plans. The multifondos will allow the Pension Fund Administrators (AFP) to offer different funds
(at most four, depending on the regulations issued by the Government), with different risk profiles
depending on the age and the risk tolerance of the investor.

In closing, the Government of the Republic of Colombia reiterates its commitment with the Financial
Sector Development Policy Loan program described in this document. The Government wishes to express
its gratitude for the technical support and financial assistance provided by the World Bank.



Yours sincerely

IMF Executive Board Approves US$10.5 Billion Arrangement for Colombia Under the Flexible
Credit Line
Press Release No. 09/161
May 11, 2009


The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) today approved a one-year SDR 6.966
billion (about US$10.5 billion) arrangement for Colombia under the Flexible Credit Line (FCL). The
Colombian authorities have stated they intend to treat the arrangement as precautionary and not draw on
the line.


The FCL is available to countries, such as Colombia, that have demonstrated a very strong track record
of sound macroeconomic policies and institutional frameworks. The arrangement for Colombia is the
second commitment in Latin America and the third overall (following arrangements for Mexico and
Poland) under the IMF's FCL, which was created in the context of a major overhaul of the Fund's
lending framework on March 24, 2009 (see Press Release No. 09/85 and Public Information Notice No.
09/40).

The FCL is designed to help countries' crisis prevention efforts by providing the flexibility to draw on
the credit line at any time. Disbursements are not phased nor conditioned on compliance with policy
targets as in traditional IMF-supported programs. This flexible access is justified on the basis that the
strict qualification criteria for the FCL provides assurances that sound economic policies will remain in
place to confront the challenges ahead.

Following the Executive Board discussion, Mr. John Lipsky, First Deputy Managing Director and Acting
Chair, made the following statement:

"During the last decade, Colombia has maintained a very strong macroeconomic performance,
underpinned by solid institutional policy frameworks. GDP growth has been robust. The inflation
targeting regime brought inflation down to single digits. Anchored on its medium term fiscal framework,
Colombia's debt ratios have declined substantially. The flexible exchange rate regime and prudent debt
management have helped to reduce balance sheet vulnerabilities. Strong supervision and regulation have
kept the financial system sound.

"Notwithstanding its very strong fundamentals, Colombia's near term outlook has been adversely
affected by the global environment. While the flexible exchange rate absorbed the first round effects of
the global crisis, weak external demand has led to a contraction of exports and a considerable slowdown
in economic activity. Nonetheless, the financial system has not experienced major strains since the onset
of the global crisis, and the Government of Colombia has maintained access to international capital
markets at favorable terms.

"The authorities' policy response to the global crisis has been prudent and appropriate. With inflation
abating, monetary policy has been eased. The authorities are also allowing automatic fiscal stabilizers to
operate fully, while preserving medium-term fiscal sustainability. The exchange rate has been an
effective shock absorber with limited rules-based intervention to smooth volatility, and reserve losses
have been small. The authorities have taken timely steps to protect the financial system by increasing the
deposit insurance coverage. They have also averted a possible liquidity crunch by securing external
financing to the state-owned foreign trade bank which is providing loans to banks and corporations
facing reduced access to external trade credit.

"The one-year arrangement under the IMF's Flexible Credit Line, which the authorities intend to treat as
precautionary, will play an important role in bolstering confidence in the authorities' policy framework

and strategy at a time of heightened global uncertainty. Colombia's strong fundamentals and institutional
frameworks, its proven track record of sound macroeconomic policies, and the additional insurance
provided by the FCL arrangement, give confidence that the authorities are well prepared to manage
potential risks and pressures in the event that the global environment deteriorates further," Mr. Lipsky
said.

Summary

  · The Colombian economy is facing the impacts of a sharp aggregate demand contraction in its
    major trading partners and continued strained global financial conditions. In the near term,
    economic activity is likely to contract as external demand drops and domestic and external
    credit conditions remain tight.

  · Sound macroeconomic policies implemented in recent years have substantially improved the
    country's economic resilience against crisis. The flexible exchange rate, the decline in foreign
    external debt (which has almost halved since 2003 due to the sustained FDI flows), and
    adequate reserve level (over US$21 billion, or 11 percent of GDP at end-May 2009) that
    more than doubles the annual external debt amortizations contribute to ensure current account
    financing even in the difficult global conditions. Fiscal consolidation and the government
    public debt management strategy put public debt in a declining path and reduce the share of
    foreign denominated debt. The authorities' successful placement of US$2 billion of 10 year
    bonds in international markets in addition to securing funds from multilaterals in order to
    meet public sector external financing requirements further reduces financial vulnerabilities.
    Given limited external vulnerabilities, exchange rate pressures would likely be moderate.

1.       The Colombian economy is in recession and it is facing the impacts of a sharp aggregate
demand contraction of its major trading partners and continuing strained global financial
conditions. Economic growth already decelerated in the first three quarters of 2008 and actually turned
negative during the last quarter, thereby bringing GDP growth for the year at a modest 2.5 percent. In the
near term, economic activity is likely to contract as external demand drops and domestic and external
credit conditions remain tight. On the basis of recent developments in economic activity, the Bank's base
scenario for Colombia includes GDP growth of -0.7 percent in 2009 and a modest rebound of economic
activity in 2010. Growth perspectives for 2009 are in line with the recent downward revision by the
Banco de la Republica, which places the economic pace for this year within a -1 percent to 1 percent
range.

2.       Prior to the onset of the global economic downturn, Colombia exhibited high economic
growth within a framework of enhanced macroeconomic stability.                          The Colombian economy
experienced strong and sustained growth over the 2003-2007 period supported by the favorable external
environment and sound economic policies. Real economic growth accelerated from 2.5 percent in 2002 to
7.5 percent in 2007, inflation moderated during the period, and the current account deficit remained
modest despite strong domestic demand, particularly in investment. Strong growth supported
unemployment reduction from over 17 percent in 2002 to approximately 12 percent in 2007. High
external demand, improved terms of trade and lower cost of international credit created a favorable
environment for growth, supported by the improved security situation in Colombia and stable
macroeconomic policies.

3.       In 2008 economic growth decelerated sharply as internal demand growth cooled down. In
the fourth quarter of 2008, y-o-y economic growth stood at -1 percent, the lowest growth rate since

2003, partly reflecting past monetary tightening that resulted in a significant deceleration in credit growth
(from 31.8 percent y-o-y at end-2006 to 17.1 percent y-o-y in December 2008). In the third quarter of
2008, export growth which had remained relatively resilient, collapsed due to the ongoing global
slowdown. The fourth quarter followed a similar negative path, and the current account for 2008 ended up
in a deficit of 2.8 percent of GDP, a similar figure to the one in 2007.

4.             Prices have been following a declining trend after the fuel and food price hikes. Shocks to
fuel and food prices pushed inflation to 7.7 percent at end-2008 well in excess of the Central Bank's
target of 5 percent for 2008. In spite of this, inflationary pressures have been decelerating already since
end-2008 as the external price shock was corrected. As a result, Banco de la Republica authorities have
lowered the policy interest rate aiming at a reactivation of the economy while prices are expected to
continue on a downward path.

5.       Continued low fiscal deficits propitiated a reduction in public sector debt, although
concerns remain regarding expenditure rigidities. In recent years, fiscal policy has aimed to reduce
public sector and external vulnerabilities by ensuring debt sustainability. The combination of domestic
economic growth, improved international conditions, peso appreciation (which reduces the cost of
servicing foreign currency-denominated debt), and revenue-enhancing policy reforms improved the fiscal
accounts.28 As a result, the combined public sector deficit decreased from 3.7 percent of GDP in 2002 to a
balance in 2005. However, budget and legal rigidities that resist spending cuts have slowed the progress
of policy reforms on the expenditure side. Despite the strong revenue performance, expenditure dynamics
-especially pension expenditures and transfers to sub national governments- have resulted in modest
fiscal deficits during 2006-2007. Transfers to the main state-run pension system will continue to expand
over the next decade -as payouts greatly exceed new contributions-, despite the 2005 constitutional
reform that reduced the net present value of pension liabilities by 19 percentage points of GDP by
eliminating special regimes for state employees and imposing ceilings on benefits in the public-sector
pension system. In 2008, the non financial public sector balance reached a surplus of 0.1 percent of GDP,
the highest balance since 2005. This figure was above the government's target of -0.9 percent of GDP.
This improvement over the government's target is explained primarily by 1.1 percent of GDP surplus by
local governments, up from the government's target of 0.3 percent of GDP. The latter is at least partially
the result of recent central government's policies to enforce fiscal discipline at the local level.

6.       As the global financial turbulence intensified in the second half of 2008, Colombian
financial markets were negatively affected in line with developments in other Latin American
countries although conditions have improved during 2009. The withdrawal of liquidity in financial
markets amid increased risk aversion resulted in larger sovereign spreads and stock market losses across
the region. In Colombia, the EMBI spread increased to 740 bps at end October, 2008 but since then it has
declined to 282 as of early June 2009. The Colombian government successfully placed a ten-year US$1
billion dollar bond issue, and another US$1 billion in April. The stock market index declined by a third in
line with developments elsewhere in 2008 but has since recovered by 49 percent by mid-June 2009. The
exchange rate appreciation, prompted in part by tightening monetary policy, reversed and the exchange
rate depreciated by about 16 percent from August 2008 to December 2008, limiting the loss of reserves
during 2008 to US$125 million (about 0.5 percent of total reserves). In this context the Central Bank
removed the controls to capital inflows, a temporary measure to prevent excessive exchange rate
volatility. To some extent, the exchange rate depreciation was a welcome development given its impact


28Policy reforms have concentrated on the revenue side. In 2002, Congress approved Law 788, supported by the
Bank's Fiscal and Institutional Adjustment Loan (FIAL) Program (Loan 7163-CO, approved March 2003).

on competitiveness. However since end-2008 to mid-June 2009 the exchange rate has appreciated by
about 17 percent. An increase in credit risk premiums and funding costs pushed the lending rate up by
around 77 basis points in the last quarter of 2008 with respect to the first quarter of the same year, but
declines in policy rates since December 2008 have brought lending rates down reaching levels similar to
those in early 2007.

                                 B. Macroeconomic Outlook and Debt Sustainability


7.      Ongoing deleveraging and continued high levels of uncertainty have prompted a sharp
downturn in global economic activity, world trade and international commodity prices which will
negatively affect Colombian through several channels. In light of external developments economic
activity in Colombia and the prospects for near-term economic growth have deteriorated significantly.
The main channels of transmission of the global economic and financial shocks to the Colombian
economy are the following:

(a)    Weaker export revenues. Colombia has a relatively open economy (exports of goods and services
       are equivalent to over 17 percent of GDP while total trade amounts to about 40 percent of GDP).
       In particular, oil exports represent on average about 24 percent of total exports. While exports
       have become more geographically diversified towards other countries/regions beyond the U.S.,
       export volumes have decelerated in the fourth quarter growing by only 6.3 percent, y/y, in real
       terms versus a strong expansion during the same period in 2007 (19 percent). This has translated
       into a deceleration in GDP, which contracted by -0.7 percent y-o-y during the fourth quarter of
       2008 (compared to 8 percent in the same period in 2007). Global demand is expected to decline by
       0.5 percent in 2009 compared to 2008. It is estimated that a 1 percent decline in US growth, the
       main trade partner of Colombia, lowers real export growth by 0.3 percent.

(b)    Lower oil prices. Colombia received a record-high level of revenue from oil exports at US$12.2
       billion in 2008 as a result of a historically high average oil price for the Colombian mix of crude
       oil at US$134.3 per barrel. The dramatic drop of international oil prices averaging US$41 per
       barrel for the Colombian mix has a significant impact on the country's public finances as oil
       accounts for about 20 percent of total public sector revenues. In 2009, oil prices are expected to
       average US$47.2 per barrel. The envisioned decline in oil prices -ceteris paribus- will increase the
       current account deficit and public sector deficit by 1.8 percent and 0.5 percent of GDP respectively
       (this is compared to the counterfactual that prices stay at 2009 levels).

    (c) Lower workers' remittances. Workers' remittances, mainly from Colombians living in the U.S
        and Spain, have started to decline since the last quarter of 2008. Remittances amounted to US$1
        billion in the first quarter of 2009, a 4.2 percent decline from a year ago. For the year as a whole
        they are expected to decline by 3 percent.

           (d) Lower capital flows. Capital flows are expected to decline somewhat due to diminished global
                          liquidity. Capital flows have declined by 3.5 percent from the third quarter to the last quarter of
                          2008.    Although FDI flows experienced a significant expansion during 2008 current global
                          conditions might impact negatively on the inflows during the current year.

           (e) Increased risk aversion. The deterioration in economic perspectives and market
                          turbulence will likely have a negative impact on risk premiums and credit supply. The
                          latest lending survey indicates that Colombian financial intermediaries expect a
                          contraction in credit supply.

8.                However, factors that typically magnify external shocks resulting in severe economic
disruptions are not present in Colombia. In some Latin American countries, external shocks have been
typically amplified by severely appreciated real exchange rates, weak domestic financial sectors and real
and financial dollarization. Fortunately, in the Colombian case, the factors that typically magnify crisis
act as a muffler. Colombia entered the turbulence period with an exchange rate value close to its
equilibrium level29. The flexible exchange rate acts as a shock absorber helping to counter the
deceleration in external demand. The strength of the financial sector, with healthy financial indicators, has
prevented a credit crunch, and credit to the private sector- although has decelerated reflected lower
demand and increased risk aversion- continued to grow at about 9 percent in real terms at end-April
2009. Financial dollarization is not a destabilizing factor in Colombia.

9.                Despite the impact of global conditions, Colombia is in a better position to confront the
global crisis than other LAC countries. This outcome is a result of the countercyclical monetary policy
together with the fiscal stimulus through higher public sector investment over 2009. However, growth
prospects in Colombia stand at negative levels for 2009.

10.               In light of the current environment, economic growth expected to continue decelerating in
2009. GDP growth is likely to contract by 0.7 percent in 2009, while lower oil and food prices will reduce
inflation to 4.3 percent. The current account deficit is expected to deteriorate to 3.4 percent of GDP. The
Non-Financial Public Sector balance, broadly balanced in 2008, will widen to -3.5 percent of GDP in
2009.

      11.        Despite limited space for pursuing an aggressive counter-cyclical policy, the measures
      implemented by the authorities will likely mitigate the impact of a global slowdown on growth and
      employment generation of the domestic economy. Monetary policy is, and will continue to be, actively
      used to counter the effects of the cycle as weaken demand and lower food and oil prices keep inflation on
      a downward trend. The sharp reduction in public sector debt to GDP ratio during the past years has
      provided room for some fiscal loosening and expenditures will increase by 1.7 percent of GDP. The main
      measures adopted by the authorities include:

                       · Expansive monetary policy. Monetary policy had been tightened substantially between
                              mid 2006 and mid-2008, the policy rate was increased by 400 b.p. amid concerns of
                              possible overheating of the economy. In the last quarter of 2008 a reduction in banks'
                              reserve requirements and the program of purchases of government paper (USD 500
                              million) reversed the stance of monetary policy and the monetary base has expanded
                              since end-September 2008. Since December 2008, the Central Bank has been reducing
                              interest rates to counteract the sharp economic deceleration, as inflation moderated.

                       · Increasing credit supply to buy durable goods. On March 9 the Banco de Comercio
                              Exterior de Colombia (Bancoldex) published a document on the financial mechanisms to
                              support retail of durable goods. The objective of the program is to inject liquidity into the
                              market and it is targeted for the automobile and electrical appliance sectors. Two main
                              aspects are questionable about this program: (i) it is not clear whether this measure will
                              help to boost consumption as consumers have been showing a resilience to purchase
                              durable goods even with dropping interest rates (see Encuesta de Opinion del
                              Consumidor); and, (ii) it is not clear the reasoning behind the selection of sectors to favor
                              with the program.

                       · Increasing public expenditure in social assistance programs. With respect to the
                              social assistance programs, the government plans to expand the budget for these
                              programs by 22 percent in 2009 reaching COP$$3,100 billion (includes COP$1,092
                              billions for Familias en Accion, COP$553 billion for elderly programs, and COP$760
                              billion for programs targeted towards the displaced population). The overall macro



                                                                            64

                 impact of these programs is small given that it will only affect the purchasing power of a
                 relatively small segment of the population. In this regard, it will be more useful for the
                 government to target employment generation programs as these could have a greater
                 impact in the economy.

             · Increasing investment in infrastructure. The government has announced a series of
                 measures to invest in infrastructure. The "plan de choque" increases the budget for
                 infrastructure by 25 percent with respect to 2008 to an amount of US$2.7 billion. The
                 World Bank is anticipating to support infrastructure investments with mainly 4 projects
                 pipelined in 2009-2010, approximately amounting to US$$1.1 billion These
                 infrastructure projects are labor intensive and are expected to have a significant impact on
                 employment and growth.

12.     Despite successful sovereign bonds placements in global markets, the GoC is seeking to
reduce external vulnerabilities by requesting funding from multilaterals. Authorities announced
plans to request US$2.4 billion from multilaterals this calendar year to help cover the envisioned external
financing needs for 2009. On April Colombia requested an IMF precautionary flexible credit line to
access US$10.5 billion.

13.     Sound macroeconomic policies implemented in recent years have substantially improved
the country's economic resilience against crisis. The flexible exchange rate, the decline in foreign
external debt (which has almost halved since 2003 due to the sustained FDI flows), and adequate reserve
level (over US$23 billion, or 11 percent of GDP at the end of May 2009) that more than doubles the
annual external debt amortizations contribute to ensure current account financing even in the difficult
global conditions. Fiscal consolidation and the government public debt management strategy put public
debt in a declining path and reduce the share of foreign denominated debt (see Table 1). Given limited
external vulnerabilities, exchange rate pressures would likely be moderate.

14.     While there remains considerable uncertainty as regards to the depth and length of the
global recession, neither external nor fiscal sustainability appear at risk. While risks to the
macroeconomic projections for 2009 and 2010 are on the downside, external and fiscal sustainability are
not a major concern. However, the current environment characterized by volatility in financial
magnitudes and commodity prices poses several downside risks. A fall in oil prices would negatively
affect the fiscal outlook and the current account balance. Intensification of the global liquidity squeeze
further deteriorates the external balance. To gauge these risks a low growth scenario is evaluated. The
scenario shows the impact of a drop of the oil price to a low of $32 per barrel and a further deterioration
of the external environment during 2009.The simulation indicates that Colombia has enough reserves to
cushion a potential external financing shock without severely affecting exchange rate stability. In
addition, NFPS expenditures are expected to increase in nominal terms keeping the ratio to GDP at the
same levels as in the baseline scenario; this is assuming that Government authorities would protect public
demand to help boost the economy in the event of a series contraction. This scenario does not pose a
serious problem to the public debt sustainability (See Table 4).

     Key Commodities: Recent Trends and Prospects

Commodity prices have been declining during the past months and expectations are that most
relevant prices will continue to soften and just a few will moderately increase. This is particularly
important for a country like Colombia where oil exports represent approximately 25 percent of total
merchandise exports, followed by coal (12 percent), coffee (6 percent) and ferronickel (6 percent). The
graphs that follow present the favorable recent trends that major commodities for Colombia have
exhibited in the past years and how they are expected to behave over the medium term.

                           ANNEX 5: COLOMBIA ­ DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS




                                           Debt Sustainability Analysis


Debt Sustainability Analysis. Colombia's present level of net public debt, at about 31.9 percent of GDP
(down from a peak of 49.5 percent in 2002) is manageable even when considering possible adverse
economic shocks. Many recognize (including the government) that debt needs to decline slightly further
as a share of GDP, due to its fiscal cost and the financing vulnerabilities to which it exposes the county.
The government's target is to reduce the level of net public debt to 21.9 percent of GDP by 2019, but
given the government's re-scheduling of the debt they could easily reach a target of 19.1 percent of GDP.
We analyze the debt prospects in four different ways: i) a baseline projection; ii) an analysis of policy
response that would be necessary for the government to meet the debt reduction target of 19.1 percent of
GDP in the face of a high case scenario; iii) projection of what would happen to debt ratio in a high case
scenario but there was no fiscal policy response, and iv) an analysis of the sustainability of total public
plus private external debt.

The baseline scenario makes the following key assumptions:

                                               2008         2009         2010          2011         2012          2013

Real GDP growth (%)                            2.5%        -0.7%         1.5%          3.0%         3.8%          4.4%
Inflation (%)                                  7.7%         4.3%         4.3%          3.9%         3.2%          3.1%

Oil price (US$ per barrel)                     97.0         47.2          52.7         57.9          63.3         69.3

Primary Balance (% GDP)                       2.6%          1.0%         1.7%          2.0%         2.0%          2.0%
Implicit Interest Rate                        10.5%         7.6%         7.4%          7.4%         7.6%          7.2%


In this scenario, the government achieves its target of reducing the debt ratio to 19.1 percent of GDP in
ten years.

The high case scenario makes the following assumptions:

                                            2008         2009         2010        2011        2012          2013

If these shocks materialized and policy remained passive, with primary balances unchanged at 2 percent,
debt ratios would jump initially and then decline, but the government would not achieve its target for
reducing the debt ratio to 19.1 percent of GDP. Under the high case scenario, the ratio would peak at
close to 37.1 percent of GDP in 2010, then slowly fall to about 25.9 percent in 2019. This level of debt is
certainly high and would put considerable fiscal pressure on the government, but it is not explosive and
could be contained by maintaining a primary balance of 2 percent of GDP, which is within the historical
experience of Colombia.

                                                      External Debt
Analyzing the sustainability of the external debt requires a model that incorporates another set of key
macroeconomic variables, such as Colombia's current account, and allows us to model another set of
different shocks, particularly one to inward international capital flows. Total external debt service (public
and private) has fallen from a high of above 67 percent in 2002 to more manageable levels of less than 30
percent now,

Colombia's total external debt profile (public and private) is likely to be sustainable. Total external debt
is expected to decline to 15.1 percent of GDP under our baseline scenario. Total external debt reached
nearly 48 percent in 2001 without a crisis, in an economic environment that was less favorable than today.
In our high case, a transitory peak of 24.4 percent total external debt in would put pressure on financing,
but is expected to be manageable.

     ANNEX 6: COLOMBIA- FINANCIAL SECTOR REFORMS IN THE LAST DECADE



Strengthening Financial Sector Supervision and Regulation

  1.       The Financial Reform law of 1999 was instrumental in facilitating the resolution of
  troubled institutions and in upgrading regulation. Immediately following the crisis, the
  Superintendency of Banks was given the legal authority to compel banks to improve their loan-
  portfolio quality and solvency levels and it was able to facilitate the liquidation or merger of
  institutions, provided certain conditions are met. Housing credit institutions -Corporaciones de Ahorro
  y Vivienda, at the heart of the banking crisis- were forced to convert into banks or liquidate. Financial
  cooperatives, previously unregulated and supervised by a less capable regulatory body, were brought
  under the umbrella of the Superintendency, and a deposit guarantee fund was created for this
  institution (FOGACOOP). Supervision now covers all financial institutions on a consistent basis, using
  on-site examination and off-site monitoring. The World Bank provided assistance towards this positive
  direction.

  2.       The Financial Reform Law of 2003 further upgraded the regulatory framework as well
  as the banking resolution procedures. The reform introduced a prompt corrective action framework
  including guidelines for disciplinary rules based on risk considerations, considering gradual levels of
  sanctions for varying breaches of regulatory compliance. Norms for the identification of risks
  associated with financial groups were revised. It also improved the bank resolution process and deposit
  insurance operational framework and supported the privatization and liquidation of state-owned banks
  through procedures such as the "carve-out." This process entailed FOGAFIN to take good assets from
  troubled banks placing them in a trust that in turn, backs the corresponding deposit liabilities of the
  intervened bank through a securitization scheme. This Financial Reform was supported by the World
  Bank's PFSAL I and II programs.

  3.       Financial supervision has also been revamped, with a movement towards a risk-based
  supervision framework. Among the new regulations, financial institutions have been obliged to
  adopt, where applicable, internal systems to manage credit, market, and more recently liquidity and
  operational risks. Such systems comprise policies, procedures and a corporate governance structure to
  deal with each type of risk - including internal limits, remedial actions, and contingency plans- as
  well as a framework to measure each particular risk. While the regulations allow for institutions to
  develop their own models to measure credit, liquidity and market risk, in practice all institutions still
  use the reference models provided in the regulation. Regulations regarding the adoption of internal
  systems were first issued in 2002 regarding credit risk and in 2007 for market risk, when a Value-at-
  Risk based market risk capital requirement was introduced for credit institutions and brokerage houses.
  In 2007 a regulation was issued regarding internal systems to manage operational risks. This regulation
  instructs institutions to set up a registry of events that cause such risks and the associated losses.
  Historical loss experiences will be used in the future to determine capital charges for operational risks.
  The regulation regarding the management of liquidity risks, supported by this operation, was
  introduced in 2008 (see paragraph 74).

  4.       Since the 1999 crisis, substantial reforms to the insurance sector regulatory and
  supervisory framework have been supported under various Bank operations.                   In 2003, the
  government determined the timing, risk and technical tools to determine the solvency margin. In terms
  of reserve requirements, insurance companies must have risk reserves, mathematical reserves,
  pending-claims reserves and reserves for deviation of claims. There are regulations as to what is
  permissible by the insurance companies. For example, insurers are able to make loans only against
  securities and the transfer of resources between banks and insurance companies are regulated like an



                                                    73

   intercompany investment. PSAL I focused on the insurance industry, linking insurance risks to
   solvency margins and technical requirements, while PSAL II encouraged transparency in the pension
   market by emphasizing disclosure of markets risks of investment portfolios and reform rules
   concerning investments in foreign securities. Currently, the solvency norm is being revised to include
   market and counterparty risk capital charges.

   5.       Important steps were introduced for the prevention of money laundering (ML) and
   financing of terrorism (FT). Combating ML/FT is a key element in promoting a strong and sound
   financial system by avoiding reputational and legal risks. The strategy to improve the framework for
   ML/FT supervision includes the coordination of regulators, legal enforcement agencies and financial
   sector authorities. To this end the GoG reorganized the Interinstitutional Coordination Commission on
   ML (Comisión de Coordinación Interinstitucional Contra el Lavado de Activos, CICLA), a measure
   supported by the First Programmatic Business and Productivity and Efficiency DPL. Budgetary and
   institutional capacities have been also improved. Financial institutions were obliged to adopt internal
   systems to manage ML/FT risks in 2007.

   6.       The new Bankruptcy Law, enacted in 2002, substantially improved corporate solvency
   procedures. In the emergency context of the crisis, the legal framework for insolvency and
   restructuring was adjusted to support distressed debtors. This imbalance away from creditors and
   financial creditor's rights hampered insolvency procedures and stymied the execution of restructuring
   plans30. Since then, improvements in the contractual framework, including the reform of the
   insolvency framework and the 2002 Bankruptcy Law have strengthened confidence in financial
   contracts. Improvements to strengthen creditor rights include (i) the possibility of judicial validation of
   out-of-court reorganization agreements, (ii) the simplification of procedures for an accelerated
   recognition of controversial claims in insolvency proceedings, (iii) the establishment of provisions to
   streamline and encourage actions seeking personal liability against directors and officers of the
   insolvent company, (iv) the adoption of modern rules for the treatment of the international aspects of
   insolvencies with cross-border impact and (iv) the suppression of "consensual priorities" and of
   "internal creditors" .

Capital Markets

   7.       The 2005 Securities Law aimed at developing a regulatory framework flexible enough to
   deal with innovations. The World Bank supported the merger of the three stock exchanges -Bogotá,
   Medellin and Cali- and aided in the drafting and implementation of a new Securities Law (Law
   964/2005) which established a new framework for the capital markets. The law was supported under
   the PFSAL II. In order to facilitate the development of efficient capital markets, the Securities Law
   provides a general framework to deal with key areas through the issuance of Decrees that could be
   easily amended (see Table 1). This flexibility would allow to adapting the regulations to advances in
   the technology and organization of the securities business, and to facilitate the development of new
   products and services. The Law applies to businesses on standard securities, such as stocks and bonds,
   as well as on standardized derivatives contracts traded in organized markets.




30For example, voting procedures in restructurings were creating artificial majority outcomes; because shareholders
were allowed voting rights with creditors. During insolvency actions, the proper identification of who was entitled to
be a creditor delayed the process.

                                                                               securities

   8.       To implement the Securities Law, the GoC has been issuing a substantial body of
   regulatory decrees. Those decrees regulated important aspects of securities markets under four big
   areas: supervision and regulation, infrastructure, architecture and market operations. These included
   public tender offers, repo31 and sell-buyback32 transactions -the most important money market


31A "Repurchase agreement", usually called "repo," represents a transaction in which a counterpart sells securities
to another with a simultaneous agreement to repurchase the same securities at a specified future date.

   operations currently in use in Colombia- and the formation of self-regulatory bodies. Some of those
   decrees received the support of the Second Programmatic Business Productivity and Efficiency
   Development Policy Loan. Another important milestone in the securities market reform was the
   regulation and organization of an Information System for the Securities Market (SIMEV)33.

   9.        Recent regulations addressed the professionalization of market participants and clarified
   the framework for the resolution of securities intermediaries. To increase the professionalization
   of securities market participants, new regulations require certification for certain activities (Decree
   4668/2007). The certification needs to be renewed periodically (every 2 or 3 years) through exams.
   The norm also regulates the functions of the institutions that certify securities professionals. A new
   Decree (2555/2008) clarifies the mechanism of resolution of failed securities brokerage firms. Prompt
   and effective resolution minimizes systemic risks, preserves the integrity and the efficiency of the
   system as well as the public confidence in it and protects investor rights. All of these factors will
   contribute to the securities market development. Under this regulation, FOGAFIN will appoint the
   management and liquidator of the failed institution, as in the case of banks, and will supervise their
   activities in this area, concurrently with the SFC. Before this decree was enacted, the responsibility for
   failed institutions was not clear.

   10.       The new regulatory framework for collective investment vehicles will contribute to
   promote securities market development. The new regulation (Decree 2175/2007) establishes an
   appropriate framework for collective investment vehicles -other than pension funds, which have their
   own regulatory regime- as collective investment mechanisms with collective results. Previously,
   inadequate regulation prevented an effective development of the sector. The regulation establishes the
   responsibilities of the administrator, the type of collective vehicles that can be established and their
   objectives. It also regulates the nature of the investors' participations and the need for contracts to
   align the interests of administrators and investors.

   11.       The authorities have also placed substantial efforts to develop government securities
   markets and the money market. The development of a liquid market of government securities may
   have a major effect on private sector issuances and the availability of longer term investment options.
   The GoC has been able to issue instruments in local currency at various maturities, ranging from 90
   days to approximately 15 years. This large spectrum of maturities, associated with increased volumes,
   provide benchmarks for private securities and distinct investment horizons for the several segments of
   the investor base. To develop a liquid and efficient money market the authorities developed a strategy
   for short-term debt issuance and developed local repurchase agreement and Treasury bills markets. A
   FIRST project assisted by World Bank staff, provided support on this area. In January, 2008 the
   Indicador Bancario de Referencia (IBR), a money market interbank reference rate was launched. IBR



32 A "sell-buyback" (or "simultaneas" in Colombia) used to be treated as two separate trades: a spot sale and a
forward repurchase. Since the economic rationale of repos and sell-buybacks are essentially the same, to avoid
different legal, accounting and tax treatment between these instruments, Decree 4708-2005 defines both as single
transactions between counterparties.

33SIMEV comprises three registries maintained by SFC: a) the National Registry of Securities and Issuers (RNVE),
b) the National Registry of Agents of the Securities Market (RNAMV), and c) the National Registry of Professionals
of the Securities Market (RNPMV). Registration at RNVE is mandatory for entities that intend to issue and sell
securities to the public, and to have these securities publicly traded in one of Colombia's trading systems. There are
presently 482 registered entities, and SFC publishes their institutional and financial information, as well as fines and
other administrative sanctions applied to them. RNAMV and RNPMV are registers for natural persons (individuals)
licensed to work in the securities market as intermediaries, risk managers, or investment advisors.

  would allow the development of money markets and the development of hedging tools which could
  reduce the volatility impacts.

  12.      GoC also authorized the creation of clearing and settlement systems for foreign exchange
  transactions to take place on organized exchanges and the basis for the development in the
  activity of commodity exchange(s).34 The former responds to the need of some categories of
  institutional investors to go through organized exchanges as opposed to over-the-counter (OTC) for
  their foreign exchange transactions. The latter could play a useful role in financing and risk mitigation
  of agro-related sectors. The World Bank has provided technical assistance in this area.

            ANNEX 7: COLOMBIA- UPDATE ON THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE

                                COUNTRY PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY

Background

  1.       The existing Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for Colombia, covering the FY08-11 period,
  was discussed by the Board on April 2008. The implementation of the strategy, now at the beginning
  of its second year, has proceeded along the lines proposed in the document, and the approach has been
  adapted slightly to respond to the changing circumstances in the country.

  2.       This annex provides a short summary of the progress made in the CPS implementation, as well
  as the changing conditions in the country due to the international economic crisis. The objectives are
  to provide an overview of the implementation of the strategy and to explain the role of the proposed
  operation within the CPS.

  3.       The CPS was initially designed to be flexible and innovative in responding to Colombia's
  financial and development needs. It also reflected the desire by the Authorities to maintain a strong
  financial and knowledge-based relationship with the Bank. The CPS was closely aligned with the
  National Development Plan, which established clearly defined priorities, following extensive
  consultations with the civil society.

  4.        The structure of the proposed program of support for Colombia was based on six pillars: i)
  Peace and Security, (ii) Equity, (iii) High and Sustainable Growth, (iv) Environmental Sustainability,
  (v) Good Governance and (vi) Transversal Themes. It was governed by five principles of engagement:
  (i) a base level of borrowing of around US$ 4 billion (for the FY08-11 period) with an increasingly
  active IFC program (in the range of US$300/400 million per year), complemented by a diverse set of
  analytical and advisory services as well as specialized grants; (ii) flexibility in delivering agreed
  volumes of lending to facilitate greater efficiency and to leverage global and sub national resources;
  (iii) selectivity in areas of support within the framework of the country's own National Development
  Plan to ensure value-added; (iv) responsiveness in meeting demands for knowledge with a broad range
  of instruments, and, (v) coordination within the World Bank Group, and with other donors, in support
  of the National Development Plan.

  5.       Colombia has made considerable progress in the implementation of its development program
  and has strengthened its solid partnership with the Bank to become one of the most active Middle-
  Income Countries institution-wide. The Bank in turn has responded with a support program that is
  helping the country confront the impact of the current international economic crisis, while maintaining
  the focus on long term development challenges.

The Evolving Program

  6.       The flexible design of the CPS has proven to be extremely helpful. It allowed the World Bank
  to respond in a timely and effective manner to the changing needs of Colombia. In the initial stages of
  the CPS, the authorities were focused on the innovative instruments available from the Bank, and were
  particularly interested in domestic currency financing, as well as mix of investment and development
  policy lending.      More recently, as the Colombian economy begun to feel the impact of the
  international financial crisis, the government has requested rapid responses that ensure the financing
  required to maintain crucial government programs. The international crisis has also triggered a major
  increase in the support being requested by the Government for both financial and technical support for
  confronting the negative effects of a worldwide economic downturn.



                                                     78

7.      Since the April 2008 discussion of the CPS, the Board has approved loans to Colombia in the
amount of US$ 1.85 billion. Net commitments, however, were US$ 1.7 billion due to the cancellation
of a large component of an existing loan. Most of these approvals took place on December 2008,
when the Board considered three important loans: (a) Social Safety Net II- Familias in Accion for
US$636.5 million; (b) Sustainable Development III for US$450 million; and (c) a CAT-DDO for
US$150 million. The first two loans were identified in the CPS, and their amounts were established
according to the financing needs required to protect the most vulnerable in society from the emerging
crisis. The CAT DDO was introduced to the program in order to provide the Government with a
contingency line, in case of a major natural disaster; however, this loan replaced the cancellation of
remaining balances of an investment loan that supported activities for natural disaster mitigation. The
overall approvals so far this fiscal year, have been slightly above the US$1.0 billion a year envelope
provided under the CPS, primarily due to the Bank's response to the Government's requests.

8.      Disbursements since the endorsement of the CPS have been around US$1.3 billion, while the
overall exposure to Colombia, following scheduled amortizations, has risen to approximately US$ 5.95
billion. The CPS had established a ceiling for the exposure of US$7.4 billion by the end of FY11. The
portfolio includes investment operations with an accelerated disbursement profile. Hence the Bank
has been in close consultation with the Authorities to ensure that the composition of the Bank's
lending program does not generate an excessive increase in their exposure to the Bank.

9.      Several grants have been approved since April 2008. They are designed to assist in a broad
range of topics, including environmental issues, peace and development, civil society voice and
participation, and labor re-integration. Currently there are 20 grants in effect for a total of $41 million
of undisbursed funds. All grants in the Colombia portfolio correspond to one or more CPS goals and
pillars. Given the predominance of GEF funds, a significant portion of the trust fund portfolio is
focused on environmental issues.

10.     The Bank has also been actively engaged in transferring knowledge through direct
involvement in key areas of policy dialogue and a broad AAA work program. The Bank's knowledge
work is covering many issues, from labor markets, health policy, social protection, to poverty
measurement and public sector reforms. One of the most successful mechanisms of support has been a
series of rapid assessments of public sector management that are being carried out in several
municipalities and departments. These assessments are becoming an effective instrument to expand
the engagement with sub-national governments. Noteworthy, has also been rapid response by the
Bank to the Government's request for assistance in reviewing its poverty figures. Overall, the Bank is
fully engaged in the process of helping establish systems of monitoring and evaluation, to measure the
effectiveness of public programs.

11.     The country's close engagement with the Bank, under the framework of this CPS period, has
placed Colombia as the 7th largest portfolio in the Bank Group (measured by level of exposure) and
the third in the region, behind Brazil and Mexico. With 17 active projects, covering a wide variety of
sectors (infrastructure, education, peace, rural development, environment, governance and budget
support), the Bank has built a solid basis in all pillars of the CPS.

  12.          The Bank's program, under this CPS, has also been responsive to the client's needs and its
  desire to innovate. Colombia was one of the first countries to make use of the Bank's new contingent
  financing under the revised DDO guidelines. This instrument has been used in two of the loans
  approved so far under the CPS. The Authorities have also taken advantage of many of the services
  provided by the Bank's Treasury. The authorities decided to fix the interest rate for most of the
  existing loans, at a time when international rates were at relatively low levels. They have also moved
  aggressively, with Treasury's support to swap domestic currency liabilities for the dollar liabilities
  incurred to the Bank. Colombia was also instrumental in the development of the new policy on
  extending IBRD maturities, first applied to the ICETEX loan, a student loan program supported by the
  Bank.



The IFC Program

  13.          To bolster the role of the private sector, the IFC has increased the level of its activities in
  recent years and the prospects look good for continued investments at the current pace of $250m per
  year. Commitments in FY08 totaled $264 million, comprising eight projects: US$31 million in
  infrastructure (1st port investment in Colombia), US$25 million in manufacturing, US$15million in a
  private equity fund (1st investment in Colombia), and US$209 million in the financial sector. In FY09,
  so far, IFC committed US$45 million for the Municipality of Bogota (street rehabilitation program),
  US$50m for the expansion of Colombia's leading airline, US$2.1 million in microfinance, US$30
  million to a fertilizer producer, US$16 million for the construction of two run-of-river hydropower
  plants and US$20 million for feasibility/environmental studies in a gold mine.

  14.          At the end of March 2009, IFC's disbursed and held portfolio totaled US$642 million and
  US$839 million, respectively, or more than 3 times the level of FY05. Syndicated loans (B loans) for
  which IFC is lender of record amounted to US$218 million. The Country is the third largest country
  exposure in LAC and 8th in the world.




                                                                                                                   80

The Emerging Future Lending Program

  15.      Given the lending envelop provided in the CPS, the Bank is working on a series of operations
  that could amount to US$2.3 billion for the next two fiscal years. These operations include continued
  support for the conditional cash transfer program (Familias in Acción); several infrastructure projects,
  such as Urban Mass Transit projects in six major cities; flood control of the Rio Bogota; solid waste
  management; support for public sector management and the justice sector; additional financing for the
  peace and development program; and agricultural and rural development. This proposed Financial
  Sector DPL is one of two possible policy based loans that might be extended during the next two fiscal
  years.

  16.      Several of the proposed loans under preparation could have accelerated disbursement profiles.
  As a result, the proposed program could easily reach the exposure level guidelines recommended
  under the CPS. Under the is expected disbursement profile for the loans recently approved, the Bank
  is ensuring that the Government can count on disbursements of approximately US$1.0 billion for
  calendar year 2009.      As of June, US$550 million had already been disbursed.         This pattern of
  disbursement could be maintained for calendar year 2010, depending on the financing needs of the
  Government. Such trend of disbursements would generally ensure that the Bank would remain within
  the current CPS guidelines on both commitments and exposure.

  17.      The Bank and IFC have been working closely together to foster the cooperation outlined in the
  CPS. Both institutions are working in a complementary program to support a large infrastructure
  initiative, Ruta del Sol, which will entail building a 1,000 km four lane highway from Bogota to the
  north coast of Colombia. This will be done under a public private partnership arrangement. The IFC
  is also exploring ways to complement the Bank's support for the ICETEX student loan program, by
  attracting the interest of local commercial banks in this area of lending. IFC's current pipeline for the
  last quarter of FY09 is $140m and includes one project in agribusiness, 3 in financial markets, one in
  general manufacturing, one in infrastructure, and one in health and education. The corporation is
  expecting to commit $250m this FY.

  18.      Given the fast disbursing nature of the Familias en Accion loan, along with the recently
  disbursed environmental DPL and proposed financial sector DPL, Bank exposure is projected to rise
  rapidly. The Country Department's projection for future exposure is displayed below and shows that
  at the end of FY11, total exposure could surpass the U$7.4 billion suggested in the CPS. The Bank is
  closely monitoring exposure and is maintaining an intensive dialogue with the Government on possible
