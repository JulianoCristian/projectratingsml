for the Finance and Private\n            Sector Development Policy Loan Project for Colombia were as\n            follows: outcomes were satisfactory; risk to development\n            outcome was moderate; Bank performance was satisfactory and\n            borrower performance was also satisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned includes: a key ingredient to program success is to\n            have government ownership, commitment and leadership over\n            the agenda for reform. It is important for the Bank to take\n            into account the political economy of policy reform and have\n            the flexibility to respond timely to new challenges imposed\n            by changing circumstances. It is important for the Bank to\n            have general knowledge of financial sector issues and\n            conduct strong prior analytical work on the key ones. It is\n            essential for the Bank to keep a rich and sustained dialogue\n            with the Borrower during periods of reform. Efficient,\n            dedicated and knowledgeable implementing agencies do matter\n            when far reaching institutional and policy reform are in order."}, "docdt": "2012-03-27T00:00:00Z"}
