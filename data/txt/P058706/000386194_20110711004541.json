Some lessons\n            learned included:  a reform agenda that depends on the\n            buy-in of key individuals can be stalled unless there is:\n            (a) a contingency plan for the loss of political will and\n            (b) sufficient flexibility in project design to enable\n            adjustments to changes in the level of ownership. The use of\n            demand-driven approaches for forestry or natural resources\n            management activities may be constrained by insufficient\n            demand, as communities often have other priorities. Small\n            grant monitoring that narrowly focuses on ensuring that\n            grant monies were used for their intended purpose is\n            insufficient to demonstrate outcome level results and is a\n            lost opportunity for learning. The financial sustainability\n            of endowment funds can be compromised without sufficient and\n            early attention to developing the fund-raising skills of\n            endowment fund staff. High quality analysis is insufficient\n            on its own to prompt action from government decision makers.\n            Reform of sectors in which responsibility cuts across\n            multiple agencies may be difficult without a sustained\n            dialogue through multiple sector units in the Bank\n            (forestry, environment, and energy)."}, "docdt": "2011-06-29T00:00:00Z"}
