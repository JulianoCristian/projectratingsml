I.      INTRODUCTORY STATEMENT

L       This Project Paper seeks the approval of the Regional Vice-President for Africa for the
restructuring of the Forest Conservation and Management Project (IDA Credit No. 3604-TA)
and the amendment to the Project's legal documents.

2.      The proposed restructuring is based on implementation experience and recommendations
of the Mid-Term Review in October 2006. The proposed changes will include the following: (i)
revise the Results Framework; (ii) adjust existing components (iii) reallocate the credit
proceeds; (iv) add a new disbursement category; and (v) increase the disbursement percentages.
The proposed restructuring would extend the original closing date by two years, from December
31, 2007, to December 31, 2009. The proposed restructuring will also provide support for the
implementation of the Resettlement Action Plan, including retroactive payment of costs
associated with resettlement and compensation for expropriated land.                The proposed
modification will neither affect the Project Development Objective (PDO) nor associated
outcome targets.

II.     BACKGROUND AND REASONS FOR RESTRUCTURING

3.      The Tanzania Forest Conservation and Management Project (TFCMP) was approved by
the Board on February 26, 2002, became effective on May 29,2002 and is currently scheduled
to close on December 31, 2007. The development objective of the Project was to assist the
Government of Tanzania (GOT) in implementing its forest policy by developing a framework
for the long-term sustainable management and conservation of Tanzania's mainland forest
resources. The project blends IDA resources of SDR24.6 million (US$31.1 million equivalent
at appraisal)i with a SDR5.54 (US$7 inillion equivalent at appraisal) Global Environment
Facility (GEF) grant to support the establishment and operation of a sustainable financing
mechanism through the Eastern Arc Mountains Conservation Endowment Fund (EAMCEF).
The project has the following three components: (1) Supporting institutional change and
improving service delivery through (a) establishing of the semi-autonomous Tanzania Forest
Service (TFS); (b) improving revenue collection from forests and woodlands, and (c) improving
service-delivery mechanisms for participatory forest management; (2) private sector
involvement in the management of industrial plantations; and (3) Eastern Arc forests
conservation and management.

4.      The project is aligned with the priorities outlined in the National Forest and Beekeeping
Program (NFBKP, approved by the Government in 2001), and consistent with the objectives of
MKUKUTA (Tanzania's National Strategy for Growth and Reduction of Poverty).
Implementation is mainstreamed in the Ministry of Natural Resources and Tourism (MNRT)
and closely coordinated with the support provided by other Development Partners (DPs),
namely Denmark, Finland and Germany. Under the leadership of the MNRT the development
of a Sector-Wide Approach in Forestry (SWAp Forestry) is underway, intending to gradually
move all DP support into a basket funding.

5.      From the IDA contribution, SDR9.99 million (40.6%) has been disbursed by June JO,
2007, while about SDR3.4 million are currently committed through existing contracts. In June
2006, a component of the Project was restructured to add a subcomponent, to support
participation of local communities in delivery of participatory forest management. The design

of the community development subcomponent is similar to the components under the Tanzania
Social Action Fund (TASAF), and the activities are implemented by the TASAF project
implementation unit since TASAF implementation. arrangements were established for the
subcomponent.       Pursuant to the June 2006 amendment, an amount equivalent to SDR2.8
million, which is approximately 11.4% of the total credit amount was reallocated to finance the
additional subcomponent.         SDR1.16 million are set aside for the implementation of a
Resettlement Action Plan prepared by the GOT to compensate fanners in Muheza District for
establishment of the "Derema Corridor" protected area. The GEF Grant has been fully disbursed
in early FY07.

6.      As a consequence of continued slow implementation progress of the overall project,
TFCMP by June 2007 has been in problem status for 30 months. Development Objective and
Implementation Progress are rated Moderately Unsatisfactory. Reasons include (i) an overly
ambitious project design focusing on institutional refonn (supporting the transition from the
Forest and Beekeeping Division (FBD) of MNRT into a semi-autonomous agency - the
Tanzania Forest Service (TFS)); and (ii) the failure of actively engaging with the private sector
as planned. Key milestones towards achieving the project's objectives have not been achieved
five y:ea,:s. after project launch. At ,the time of project preparatiol1 (FY2000/QD, there was a
strong commitment ofGOT to move towards executive agencies. TJiis process was disrupted by
frequent changes in leadership (at both the Bank and FBD) leading to the loss of institutional
memory and subsequent lack of ownership on the client side. In addition, serious capacity
constraints of the implementing agency to instigate agreed systems (such as financial
management and procurement) led to additional delays.

7.      The shift away from institutional sector refonn coincided with a move of the MNRT to
attend to pertinent issues such as (i) the degradation of water catchment areas; (ii) uncontrolled
illegal logging; as well as (iii) unsustainable production and use of charcoal, highlighted during
the 2006 drought and subsequent energy crisis.        The re-directing of staff to address these
challenges has resulted in further constraints ofalready overstretched FBD resources.

8.      In contrast, implementation ofthe Eastern Arc Forest Conservation component has been
on schedule, with the Endowment Fund launched and grants awarded. With all preconditions
met the US$7 million GEF funding for the fund has been released.               The fact that the
implementation for this component rests with EAMCEF (now a registered Non-Government
Organization and therefore outside FBD) has been crucial for its satisfactory implementation
progress.

9.      Tanzania lacks updated infonnation about the current status of its forest resource base
(i.e., forest assessments, digitized forest boundaries maps, etc.) for the major parts of the
country, which would be an important pre-condition to deal with the mentioned challenges in a
prioritized and strategic manner. In addition, most forest management plan have expired, thus
harvesting (even if authorized) is threatening the sustainability of the resource base.      With
illegal logging prevailing, there is a need to improve transparency and accountability in
harvesting, transporting, and marketing (including exporting) of forest products.

10.     To better reflect these priorities, the GOT has now requested to restmcture the Project
based on the aforementioned challenges.        Emphasis is being given to activities focusing on
assessing and consolidating the infonnation base of forest resources, improving transparency
and establishing accountability mechanisms which would benefit the envisaged service delivery
function of the forest sector. As a result, the GOT (regardless, whether TFS will be established,
or FBD will continue to be the responsible agency) will be enabled to implement a framework

                                                  5 



for a sustainable management and conservation of forest resources, in partnership with relevant
stakeholders, such as communities and private sector.

III.    PROPOSED CHANGES

11.     Project Development Objective. The introduced changes, appraised at the October 2006
Mid-Term Review, will not affect the PDO namely to "assist GOT in implementing its forest
policy by developing a framework for the long-term sustainable management and conservation
of Tanzania's forest resources, strengthening the role of individuals, communities, villages and
private sector in management and conservation of forests, and implementing this framework on
a pilot scale," but would align the project better to the present situation. Accordingly, the project
would deliver on improving enabling environment for sector reform through strengthening
existing and promoting new tools for sustainable forest management, rather than focusing on an
institutional change process in need of (but never provided) political leadership, outside the
Project's control. The changes would require (i) adding three new sUb-components under the
first and third Components; and (ii) revising the allocation of Credit Proceeds. The new sub
components have been appraised and the reallocation agreed upon during a Mid-Term Review
in October 2006. The revised Results Framework is provided in Annex 1.

12.     To allow for effective implementation ofthe Project (in particular for the National Forest
and Ecosystem Assessment), it is proposed to extend the closing date of the Credit by two years
(to close in December 2009). This would reflect the fact that the initial scope and focus of the
refonn program was overly ambitious. It would also allow the Government to consolidate recent
achievements (such as the fonnal establishment of the Tanzania Forest Service) and further
work on a strategy to ensure the sustainability of the reform, while at the same time undertake
steps to improve the existing implementation capacity. The procurement plan has been revised
accordingly and is attached in Annex 2. A closing of TFCMP was considered but rejected,
taking into account the need for improved governance of natural resources, to ensure (i) their

                                                   6 



  sustainable exploitation; and (ii) that benefits are shared more widely and equitably, as
  identified in the recently Board-discussed Joint Assistance Strategy for Tanzania (JAST).

  13.     Adjustments will include the following:

 Shifting primary resources from a focus on the institutionalframework towards the creation
 ofthe enabling environment will target activities necessary for obtaining updated information
  on the forest resource base and translating the latter into sustainable management plans. This
  would require adding a sub-component (see component 1.5), under the first component
  (Creating the enabling environment for SFM and improved service delivery). Credit proceeds
  will be used to fmance (i) the implementation of forest resources and ecosystem assessment; (ii)
  the preparation and pilot implementation of forest management plans; and (iii) strengthen fire
  surveillance and response capacities within the forest sector. These activities will be closely
  coordinated with ongoing and planned support from Finland and the UN's Food and Agriculture
  Organization (FAO). This will also help improve the governance of Tanzania's forest sector, to
  ensure that a more sustainable exploitation and utilization of forest resources takes place and
  benefits are shared more widely and equitably.

 Addressing the "charcoal challenge" through a new sub-component (see component 1.5), to
  support the GOT's increased emphasis on alternative sources of energy and associated
  strategies. Particular focus will be given to the unsustainable production and use of woodfuels,
  including charcoal (as a major energy source for the poor). Taking into account the current
  (unsuccessful) ad hoc approaches employed, the Project would help toward (i) integrating
  sustainable woodfuel utilization in the overall energy strategy of the country that also considers
  alternative sources of energy; and (ii) building on the potential of woodfuels to contribute to
  poverty alleviation and economic development and to use this as a means to stimulate
  sustainable land-use systems and long-term land-use planning. Support would be provided to
. activities ranging from (i) the improvement of charcoal production; (ii) studying the feasibility
 of woodfuel plantations; as well as (iii) piloting innovative economic instruments (e.g.; payment
  for environmental services schemes, carbon fmance, etc.).

 Supporting ongoing activities to formalize the protection ofcriticalforest areas, which would
  help to implement a strategy for conservation in the Eastern Arc Mountain Forests (supported
  by GEF) and address some of the challenges outlined in GOT's "Strategy for Urgent Action on
  Land Degradation and Water Catchments." Activities would be implemented under new sub
  component (see component 3.2) under the third Component (Eastern Arc Forests Conservation
  and Management) and would comprise of (i) consolidation of protected area forests and nature
  reserves; (ii) facilitation of preparation and pilot implementation of management plans of
  selected critical watershed forests; and (iii) compensation as part of a Resettlement Action Plan,
  to use SDRl.16 million of credit        proceeds to pay compensation to approximately 1,130
 farmers, willing to seize the cultivation of cash crops in an area to be declared protected area
 (the "Derema Corridor" ofMuheza District).

 Strengthening harmonization with GOT and Development Partners, with regard to the
 planned execution of forest assessments, strong interest has been expressed by Finland as well
 as the FAO to support this exercise through technical assistance, which would require a close
  coordination of activities. In addition, and to honor the commitment to working towards a better
 alignment in the forest sector, through the establishment of a Sector-Wide Approach (SWAp),
  the Bank will continue working closely with the recently created SWAp-Steering Committee
 (SWAp-SC).

                                                7 



RetrofiUing of Country Financing Parameters (CFPs).             The forest sector in Tanzania is
identified as one of the more visible productive sectors and well integrated in the GOT's
Medium-Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF). With help from the Project, the MNRT is
currently working on implementing a coherent forest revenue strategy to increase net revenues.
While the project coordination unit is mainstreamed and all technical staff are appointed by and
funded through the MNRT budget, there has been a persistent shortfall of counterpart funds for
the Project and the subsequent delays in implementation progress. It therefore proposed to
retrofit the CFPs to increase the percentage of expenditure to 100% for all categories. This is in
line with the Bank's agreed CFPs for Tanzania, which (on a case by case basis) allows Bank
financing of 100% of project costs in cases where counterpart financing requirements would
cause delays in project implementation. The proposed increase would be fully fmanced out of
the credit without the need to scale down any activity. The full financing of the IDA Project
will also complement the support by other development partners to the forest sector. The
activities financed under the IDA credit are not co-financed with other development partners.

14.     In addition, the fact that the GOT (together with most other DPs) has recently embarked
on the process of developing a SWAp will ultimately lead into General Budget Support to the
sector. While at this stage negotiations on a basket funding arrangement are pre-mature, the
Government has signaled to the Bank that it is more realistic continuing with the present
separate funding arrangements. Nevertheless, it is anticipated that the World Bank would join a
basket fund at a later stage.

15.     Implementation arrangements will remain unchanged with overall oversight being
provided by the National Forest and Beekeeping SWAp-Steering Committee (NFBK SWAp
SC), to ensure that the implementation ofProject activities is consistent with the National Forest
and Beekeeping Program (NFBKP). The SWAp-SC has in effect replaced the National Forest
Program (NFP) Steering Committee, a change which is reflected in the amendment of the DCA
(Schedule 4). It is foreseen that the compensation payments under the Resettlement Action Plan
for the Derema Corridor will be channeled through the National Microfinance Bank (NMB)
Branch office in Muheza (once a fmancial management assessment of NBM has been carried
out).    Day to day implementation remains the responsibility of the already existing
mainstreamed project coordination unit, led by a Project Coordinator, who is supported by
technical component leaders, procurement and financial management specialists appointed by
theMNRT.

IV.     ANALYSIS

16.     The restructured project is expected to better reflect current sector priorities set forward
by the GOT particularly the emphasis on the improvement of the enabling environment for
increasing the contribution of forest resources to economic growth while at the same time
permitting a more efficient and equitable distribution of benefits. These priorities are in line
with the recently approved JAST which follows closely MKUKUTA's growth clusters of (i)
growth and reduction of income poverty; (ii) improvement of quality of life and social well
being; and (iii) governance and accountability.

17.     Although some of the original expectations for the project were unrealistic in the given
time frame, the development objective and project design remain valid in principle.             The
original economic, financial, technical or social aspects have not changed.           The proposed
changes will therefore mainly to improve Project implementation. This has been reflected in a
revision of the overall results framework (Annex I). However, the requirements to introduce a

                                                8 



new institutional framework as appraised were underestimated. Activities accomplished under
the TFS sub-component so far have provided the basis for establishing this new executive
agency, concluded with the recent approval of the TFS framework documents by the Head of
the Public Service. Nevertheless, the expected launch ofTFS has been repeatedly delayed. The
Project has taken this into account by re-focusing activities under the sub-component, so that
activities supported under the Project would be under the control of technical staff of the
implementation agency, which has shown strong ownership of the project. Any further support
to MNRT for the finalization of the TFS establishment and associated change management
process would be provided through the "Restructure Ministries, Departments and Agencies
(MDAs) and Re-Engineer Service Delivery" sub-component of the planned second phase of the
Public Sector Reform Project (PSRP II).

Financial Management, Procurement and Safeguards

18.     Albeit after the deadline date of December 31, 2006, an independent audit report from
the National Audit Office was received, issuing an unqualified opinion for FY 2006. It was
reviewed by the Bank's fiduciary team. The review supports the unqualified audit opinion
rendered.    Over the past 12 months, MNRT has been implementing remedial activities to
address a number of fiduciary issues, highlighted in a Special Audit undertaken in May 2006.
Project management has been strengthened by the appointment of a capable accountant,
backstopping is being provided by a financial management consultant on a retainer basis. The
Ministry has refunded ineligible expenditures.     In addition, a Bank financed disbursement
assistant is providing additional support and capacity building assistance.

19.     The restructuring of the project will not affect existing contracts; moreover, the
reallocation between categories will ensure that the GOT can fulfill contract obligations. As
part ofthe restructuring the procurement plan was amended (Annex 2) and aligned with the new
work plan. To address persistent capacity shortcomings, the project procurement team will be
strengthened by additional procurement expertise, including contract administration and
management.

20.     With regard to other conditions (including financial covenants) stated in the Agreement,
they have been monitored regularly as part ofproject supervision. While slow project progress
has affected implementation to some extent, most conditions have been fulfilled.        Non- or
persistent late compliance delays have been experienced with (i) the establishment of the
Tanzania Forest Service; and (ii) the provision of counterpart funding respectively. Both issues
have been addressed by the restructuring.

21.     The restructuring proposal does not involve any exception to Bank policies.         The
safeguards arrangements are found sufficiently detailed enough to cover the additional
components.     Should there be the need of disclosure of those instruments they will be re
disclosed in accordance with Bank policy.        The ISDS has been revised to integrate the
restructuring and Resettlement Action Plan and re-disclosed. The safeguards assessment (i.e.,
environmental category "B") remains unchanged.

22.     Taking into account that the OP 4.36 (Forests) has changed since the inception of the
project, possible implications were reviewed in the context of the revised first component.
While not financing commercial harvesting operations directly, the changes have been found, to
be consistent with the objectives of OP 4.36, since the modifications will strengthen Tanzania's
framework for sustainable forest management.         In addition, the Project will support the
development and testing of sector specific Environmental Assessment (EA) guidelines

                                                 9 



(consistent with Tanzania's EA framework) to ensure that any intervention addresses the
potential impact on forests and/or the rights and welfare oflocal communities. Specifically, and
again consistent with the OP 4.36, it aims to harness the potential to reduce poverty in a
sustainable way, integrate forests effectively into sustainable economic development and protect
vital local and global services and values offorests.

23.     In order to allow compensation to approximately 1,130 farmers, willing to seize the
cultivation of cash crops in an area to be declared protected area (the "Derema Corridor") in the
Muheza District, the GOT prepared a Resettlement Action Plan, to comply with OP 4.12
(Involuntary Resettlement). As to the financing for costs associated with the compensation for
appropriated land, the approval of the Land Compensation Committee has been obtained in
accordance with the requirements of OP 6.00.           The Minutes of the Land Compensation
Committee are attached at Annex 3 to this Project Paper.              In relation to the proposed
compensation relevant covenants are included in the draft Letter of Amendment. The covenants
are designed to minimize the reputational risk to the Bank, which could arise if payments of
costs associated with involuntary resettlement are not properly handled.

V.      EXPECTED OUTCOMES

24.     The revised results matrix for the Project is provided in Annex 1. Expected outcomes
include (i) strengthened capacity in the forest sector in undertaking forest and ecosystem
inventory and mapping as well as management; (ii) more effective management of forest and
woodland cover by communities and individual in project areas; (iii) implementation of a
coherent forest revenue system to increase net revenues; (iv) GOT, private sector and
communities engaged in management and development of Plantation Forestry; (v) more
sustainable conservation and management for the Eastern Arc Mountains; and (vi) the
establishment of conservation financing. The introduced changes will concern sub-component
targets and indicators for the first and third component, the other outcome targets and indicators
will not be affected, although adjusted to better reflect the current situation. The new indicators
will be monitored through the recently launched National Forest and Beekeeping Database
(NAFOBEDA).

VI.     BENEFITS AND RISKS

25.     The Bank is facing a difficult choice in deciding whether to support Government's
request to restructure the project. On the one hand, the ambitious scope and the capacity
constraints in the first five years of the project have led to significant implementation delays.
These issues have been negatively impacted by the flaws in law enforcement and governance
leading to depletion of forest resources and massive revenue-collection shortfalls at every level
of government. On the other hand, forests - if managed well - will benefit present and future
generations, in particular the 87% of the poor living in rural areas and depend on forests for
their livelihoods. The achievements so far (together with activities supported by other DPs) are
now creating a momentum for GOT ownership, which is critical to be further supported.

26.     At the present stage, a withdrawal of the Bank would be considered inappropriate, in
particular in view of current discussions regarding a Forest Sector SWAp. It would also close
the door for the Bank in engaging beyond the current forest project in the broader natural
resources dialogue. It is therefore suggested to continue to provide assistance to the sector as
such support would enable the Bank to influence scope, focus and implementation ofthe reform
agenda with the objective of promoting sustainable forest management in the long term.
Nevertheless, it needs to be understood that the risk for continued delays in implementing the

                                               10 



forest sector refonn as well as for continuous capacity constraints in financial management and
procurement is high. Thus, the restructured project will give targeted support to activities which
would be beneficial to the implementing agency and the sector as a whole, regardless of the
status of the refonn. This restructuring will result in addressing the shortcomings of the
originally ambitious project design.     For example, it will downsize some of the earlier
objectives, such as the immediate launch of the Tanzania Forest Service. By providing support
to the assessing and consolidating the infonnation base of forest resources, the project will
improve transparency and monitoring which in turn is expected to provide new opportunities for
engaging with the private sector. As for the past 18 months targeted support will be given to
improving the capacity in financial management and procurement and further improve the
implementation progress. The restructuring is expected to increase the likelihood of the project
achieving its objectives.

                             Land Committee Decision Meeting, June 14, 2007
                                                   Minutes


The Committee convened in accordance with BP 6.00, Annex A, comprising Kristalina Georgieva, Director,
Strategy & Operations SDNVP (Chair), John Daniel Pollner, Operations Adviser OPCIL, Charles Di Leva,
ChiefCounsel LEGEN, Luis Constantino, Sector Manager MNSSD, Karen Mcconnell Brooks, Sector
Manager AFTS2, Radhika Srinivasan, Senior SD Specialist ECSSD, and Milen Dyoulgerov, Operations
Officer SDNVP. The Tanzania project TTL, Christian Peter, also participated via teleconference. Pursuant
to standard practice of the Committee, the decision reflects the views of all participants other than
participants from the region involved in the project, which recuses itself from the decision.


Review of proposed land acquisition under the Tanzania Forest Conservation and Management
Project (TFCMP):

The Committee was asked to consider the request to allow the Government of Tanzania (GoT) to use
US$1.75 million ofthe project proceeds to pay compensation to approximately 1,130 farmers in the Derema
Corridor ofTanzania's Muheza District for lost crops and loss offuture access (e.g. for non-land assets).
Following review ofthe record, including the legal and resettlement analysis provided by land law expert
Jon Lindsay (LEGEN) and social scientist and resettlement expert Radhika Srinivasan (ECCSD), the
Committee noted that some ofthe four key issues that the Committee normally reviews in determining
eligibility for expenditures are now moot, given that the most if not all ofthe affected farmers have now left
that area in question, and have been receiving compensation for lost crops. Thus, the normal review of two
ofthe four issues that the committee reviews, productivity of land purchase, and land market, are for the
most part moot.

The remaining issues concerning channeling of money, and risks, including political risks, monitoring
and evaluation, are addressed in more detail below.

In this light it was clarified that:
·  in the past, the farmers did not have land titles to the forested lands on which they cultivated crops,
·  a large number of farmers have already received compensation for lost crops,
·  in addition to the above-requested compensation, the GoT has already designated land that the farmers
    can begin to occupy immediately,
·  the TFCMP will employ a compensation coordinator to assist farmers with completing the
    compensation and land acquisition process, and
·  further (protracted) delays in the compensation process could entail increased reputation risk for the
    Bank.

Decision: The Committee approves the proposed TFCMP land acquisition, subject to
recommendations that should be reflected in the legal agreement (as part of the on-going restructuring
ofthe project). These recommendations are to assist in addressing channeling of money, and risks,
including political risks, as wellas monitoring and evaluation. The recommendations are as follows:


·  all farmers have received or will receive equitable compensation, in amounts and with a process
    acceptable to the World Bank,
·  to ensure proper arrangements will be in place to ensure the World Bank can monitor to ensure that the
    compensation and land acquisition process is executed in accordance with the Resettlement Action Plan
    and without further delays, and

    ·  an escrow account will be established to cover possible inflation-related increases resulting from any
        further delays ofthe compensation process.

Should the project lawyer have any questions, the Committee offers to assist and is assured ofthe continued
assistance ofMr. Lindsay and Ms. Srinivisan. The Committee would like to extend its sincere thanks to them for
their excellent assistance.
