environmental or social impacts. The\n            project supports the implementation of a series of\n            participatory forestry management activities, which the\n            Government has endorsed in its National Forest Program,\n            which are intended to bring about the proper management of\n            Government Forest reserves, industrial plantations, forests\n            on village lands, and community and private forests. As part\n            of this process, provisions will be made to bring about\n            sound forest management, and when required, the preservation\n            of critical biodiversity habitats. In particular, areas\n            classified as catchment forest that are important for\n            watershed protection and the Eastern Arc Montane Forests\n            will be targeted for priority protection and conservation.\n            Environmental risks are associated with well-known and\n            documented forest management constraints--encroachment into\n            forest reserves, difficulties in implementing practical\n            sustainable forest management plans and sometimes\n            ineffective traditional government policies and regulatory\n            measures. Furthermore, the project supports Government\n            initiatives more fully to involve the private sector in the\n            management of industrial forest plantations. Social and\n            economic impacts will be assessed for all plantation forests\n            expected to be directly affected by this project component,\n            and consultation will be undertaken with all stakeholders."}, "docdt": "2002-11-30T00:00:00Z"}
