assist the\n            Government of Tanzania (GOT) in implementing its forestry\n            policy by developing framework for the long-term sustainable\n            management and conservation of Tanzania's mainland\n            forestry resources. A resettlement action plan (RAP) was\n            prepared for the farm plots displaced for biodiversity\n            conservation in the Derema forest corridor. Some of the\n            mitigating measures included in the document are :\n            facilitate subdivision of estate lands into 3-acre plots;\n            visit each participating village for preliminary\n            explanations of resettlement steps to be taken; organize\n            workshops in each village in benefits, disadvantages, and\n            cost of each low land crop; ensure preparation and delivery\n            of titles or certificates of land transfer to new holders;\n            ensure monitoring of farm income recovery from lowland\n            farms; install mechanism (grievances redress) for resolution\n            of disputes that may arise from the compensation and\n            development process; and finally, adhere to the village Land\n            Act and Land Regulations no. 9, 10 and 13-18 which set out\n            the basis and procedures for compensation of village lands,\n            and the Bank operational policy 4.12 on involuntary resettlement."}, "docdt": "2006-09-01T00:00:00Z"}
