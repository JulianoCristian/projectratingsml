         strengthen Tanzania's capacity to coordinate forest\n            biodiversity conservation interventions. Through its\n            components, the project will support forest management\n            institutional change, and improve service delivery, by\n            providing resources to strengthen the capacity for\n            administration, and management of the Tanzania Forest\n            Service, which will be established, and supported (in part)\n            by the Global Environment Facility (GEF), and, by improving\n            as well revenue collection from forests and woodlands,\n            including service delivery mechanisms for a participatory\n            forest management. A framework will be developed, and\n            implemented to involve the private sector in the management\n            of existing industrial plantations by enabling an\n            institutional, and market environment, based on the\n            implementation of a communication strategy, and capacity\n            strengthening within the Ministry of Natural Resources and\n            Tourism. Additionally, the project will finance aerial\n            photography, mapping, and indicative inventories of\n            state-owned plantations, to improve the plantation resource\n            information base, and management planning capacity.\n            Alternative management of selected industrial plantations\n            will be piloted, emphasizing on the monitoring and\n            evaluation of operational performance indicators. Largely\n            financed by the GEF, institutional reforms of biodiversity\n            conservation will be supported, including development\n            strategies, pilot community-based conservation, and the\n            development of sustainable financing for tropical high\n            forest conservation in the country."}, "docdt": "2002-01-25T00:00:00Z"}
