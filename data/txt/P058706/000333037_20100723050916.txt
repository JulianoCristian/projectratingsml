1. Project Context, Development and Global Environmental Objectives and Design
1.1 Context at Appraisal
1.      Country and sector background. At the time of Project design (as is the case today), Tanzania's
extensive woodlands and forests were extremely important for mitigating the impact of rural poverty,
providing critical wood resources and other forest products to both rural and urban communities, and
perform important services such as watershed catchments and grazing areas. Most of the forests and
woodlands, between 30 and 40 million hectares (ha), are comprised of dry woodlands, primarily miombo.
Much of the country's forest biodiversity is found in the relatively small areas of humid tropical mountain
forest. Among the most important of these are the Eastern Arc Mountain forests representing one of the
oldest terrestrial ecosystems on the continent, with high concentrations of endemic species under
considerable threat. In addition to the natural forests, there were an estimated 135,000 ha of (mainly
industrial) plantations in Tanzania, of which 80,000 ha are under Government control and management.
In 1998, the export of wood products amounted to US$6.5 million while imports totaled around US$4.2
million. Tanzania's forests and woodlands were under growing pressure from population growth and
economic development. Many forested areas had no protection status, and many of those officially
categorized as protected were still under pressure.
2.      Institutional, policy and legal framework. The Forestry and Beekeeping Division (FBD) of the
Ministry of Natural Resources and Tourism (MNRT) provided overall policy guidance for the forestry
sector, and some technical oversight and supervision. Much of the management and protection of forest
reserves was the responsibility of the District Forest Officers (DFOs). The institutional framework was
considered to be problematic and in need of reform. The fundamental orientation was toward regulation
and enforcement of forest legislation, while forest protection and management could no longer be
undertaken independently of the needs of rural communities. At the same time, there was very limited
capacity to take on wider issues associated with biodiversity conservation. Resources to finance forest
management were tightly constrained, and the sector depended heavily on donors. The more effective
collection and use of revenues could have made a difference, but poor governance and the lack of
accountability and supervision were important constraints. In 1998, the Cabinet approved an innovative
National Forest Policy that recognized the need for substantive institutional reforms and proposed the
creation of a new Tanzania Forest Service (TFS). With regard to biodiversity conservation, the new policy
committed the Government of Tanzania (GOT) to establish nature reserves in areas of high biodiversity
value. Most importantly, however, the policy argued that local institutions and communities should have a
central role in forest conservation and management. The policy provided the framework for the
preparation of the National Forest and Bee-Keeping Program (NFBKP), which was approved by
Government in November 2001. The Project Appraisal Document (PAD) noted that the innovations
indicated in the policy had yet to be formally legislated.
3.      International conventions. At the time of Project design, Tanzania was already party to the
Convention on Biological Diversity, the African Convention on the Conservation of Nature and Natural
Resources, the Convention on the Protection of World Cultural and Natural Heritage, the Convention on
International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES), and the RAMSAR Convention on Wetlands of
International Importance.
4.       Project concept. Using a consultative process, proposals for Project preparation were an outcome
of a strategic planning workshop held in June 1999. Initially, a follow-on Project from the Bank-financed
Forest Resources Management Project (FRMP) was considered. However, it became apparent that forest
management and conservation, as well as village and community-based forestry would not succeed within
the existing institutional structure. Major institutional reform would be necessary for any future forestry
interventions to be successful.
5.      Project contribution to Government Strategy. The Project was designed to address a number of
pressing sector issues and to support GOT's efforts to move forward with: (i) substantive institutional
                                                    1
reforms; (ii) developing and implementing service standards to support village-based forest and
woodlands management and conservation; (iii) an institutional framework for biodiversity conservation;
(iv) improving financial and procurement management and a sustainable financing mechanism; (v) fuller
involvement of the private sector in industrial plantation management; and (vi) improving the framework
for planning and implementation of biodiversity conservation initiatives.
6.      Project contribution to the CAS. The Project was to address specifically the CAS objectives of
supporting sustainable rural development and private sector development through: (i) the promotion of
off-farm activities; (ii) the management of woodlands and forests by communities; and (iii) the
establishment of a framework for the involvement of the private sector in industrial plantation
management. The establishment of the TFS was to be consistent with the CAS goal of public sector
reform and institution building, to increase the effectiveness of public service delivery and improve
governance.
7.       Project consistency with GEF Strategic Priorities. The Project's GEF activities were to be
consistent with the GEF Strategy for Biodiversity Conservation, specifically the objectives of Operational
Programs 3 and 4 on Forest Ecosystems and Mountain Ecosystems. GEF support was to provide finance
to: (i) create and strengthen participatory and co-management schemes to build support and ownership for
biodiversity conservation; (ii) develop socio-economic activities to reconcile biodiversity conservation
with human needs; (iii) identify processes which were likely to have significant adverse impact on the
conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity; and (iv) support capacity building efforts while focusing
primarily on a mountain tropical forest ecosystem at risk.
8.      Two complementary PADs were prepared for this Project: the first, Report No 22743-TA dated
January 25, 2002, on a proposed IDA Credit for the (Tanzania) Forest Conservation and Management
Project (TFCMP ­ P058706); the second, Report No 23901-TA dated May 28, 2003, on a proposed GEF
Grant for the Eastern Arc Forest Conservation and Management Project (EAFCMP ­ P057234). TFCMP
became effective in May 2002, while the EAMCEF (Grant) became effective in April 2004.
1.2 Original Project Development Objective (PDO) and Key Indicators
9.      Considering the inconsistencies in scope and wording of the TFCMP PDO in Project Appraisal
Document and Development Credit Agreement, this ICR uses the PDO of the PAD LogFrame that has
been consistently used throughout implementation and as the basis for the restructurings in 2006 and
2007. This PDO was to assist Government in policy implementation, in particular by developing a
framework for the long-term sustainable management and conservation of Tanzania's forest resources,
strengthening the role of individuals, communities, villages, and the private sector in management and
conservation of forests, and implementing this framework on a pilot scale. EAMCEF, which uses the
same PDO was developed as a component of TFCMP, yet had been appraised separately from that Project
due to timing of the GEF approval process.
10.      Key Indicators as included in the Main Text of the TFCMP-PAD are formulated differently (and
are more numerous) from those included in Annex 1 "Project Design Summary" of the same PAD (the
different versions of the Indicators are included in Annex 5). In this particular case, the Development
Credit Agreement (DCA) included the Indicators as defined in the main text, rather than in the Project
Design Summary. Nevertheless, despite different formulation, indicators are substantially similar and/or
related. The Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) as outlined in Schedule 5 of the DCA were:
· A functioning TFS established with clearly defined service delivery functions and responsibilities
    with regard to natural forests, woodlands, and industrial plantations.
· Significant areas of natural forest and woodlands under effective management as an outcome of
    partnerships and initiatives with multiple partners (primarily communities and local governments).
· A range of mechanisms for improving revenue collection involving partners such as the Tanzania
    Revenue Authority and/or the private sector are tested and implemented; time-bound forest revenue

                                                    2
    collection targets established and achieved; and effective mechanisms for sharing revenues with
    villages put in place.
·   An institutional framework consistent with overall civil service reforms in place which enables
    Government to undertake forest biodiversity conservation initiatives, in particular in the Eastern Arc
    Mountains; institutional capacity strengthened.
·   The modalities for the establishment of a sustainable financial mechanism for conservation of Eastern
    Arc mountain forests developed and implemented.
·   A framework for the private sector participation in the management of industrial plantation
    established, including guidelines, incentives, regulatory monitoring and control mechanisms.
11.     By using the PDO as defined in Annex 1 of the PAD, the ICR assesses the project against the
associated PDO Outcome Indicators, which were (i) Forest and Woodland cover is brought under
effective management by communities and individuals in project area; (ii) Private sector is involved in
plantation management; and (iii) Mechanisms for forest biodiversity conservation are more fully
established. This approach is based on a number of issues that need to be highlighted. First, neither PAD
nor DCA provided any baselines against which results were to be assessed. Secondly, the KPIs provided
were a mix of Outcome and Output Indicators. Finally, as Annex 1 has been used to guide project
implementation during the early years, the Mid Term Review (MTR) in September 2006 based the
development of a new Results Framework (formalized at the 2007 Restructuring) on the LogFrame
provided in Annex 1.
1.3 Original Global Environmental Objectives (GEOs) and Key Indicators
12.     The GEO as defined in the Trust Fund Grant Agreement (TFGA), the EAFCMP is being used:
"The objective of this Project is to assist within the TFCMP, to promote sustainable conservation and
management of the biodiversity and ecosystems of the Eastern Arc Mountains Forest through; inter alia,
strengthened institutional capacity, pilot community-based conservation and development and
implementation of participatory forest conservation strategies." The related Indicator was: "The
Endowment Fund has been capitalized and the Eastern Arc Mountains Conservation Endowment Fund is
implementing the proposed conservation program."
1.4 Revised PDO and Key Indicators and reasons/justification
13.     June 2006 Restructuring. After the Project was launched in June 2002, Bank Supervision
Missions (Feb 2003) started expressing concern at the slow pace of implementation and disbursement. By
December 2004, the Project was downgraded to Unsatisfactory (U). A Supervision Quality Enhancement
Review (QER), carried out in April 2006 in preparation of the September 2006 Mid-Term Review
(MTR), anticipated the need for restructuring of the Project. However, as Participatory Forest
Management (PFM) had gained momentum, in June 2006 a Restructuring Memo to the Regional Vice
President was prepared to amend the DCA. The restructuring focused mainly on adjusting the
implementation modalities of the PFM sub-component. The PDO and associated outcome indicators
remained unchanged. It needs to be noted that the Amendment did not accurately reflect the approved
restructuring memo, rather than modifying the Component 1 by adding a sub-component, it created an
additional project component as well as inserted an additional KPI (see Annexes 5 and 6).
14.      June 2007 Restructuring. By June 2007, the Project had been in problem status for 30 months.
Development Objective and Implementation Progress were rated as Moderately Unsatisfactory and key
milestones had not been achieved five years after project launch. Stated reasons included: (i) an overly
ambitious project design focusing on institutional reform; (ii) the failure to engage actively with the
private sector; (iii) frequent changes in leadership at both the Bank and FBD, leading to the loss of
institutional memory and subsequent lack of ownership on the client side and disrupting the institutional
reform process; and (iv) serious capacity constraints of the implementing agency. This coincided with a
move by MNRT to attend to pertinent issues such as the degradation of water catchment areas;


                                                    3
uncontrolled logging; and unsustainable production and use of charcoal. Redirecting of staff to address
these challenges resulted in further constraints on already overstretched FBD resources.
15.    The June 2007 Restructuring Project Paper addressed these changes by strengthening existing and
promoting new tools for sustainable forest management, rather than focusing on an institutional change
process in need of political leadership, outside the Project's control. The restructuring (i) included a
Results Framework, (ii) adjusted Project components (see below), (iii) reallocated credit proceeds, (iv)
added a new disbursement category (to allow for land compensation), (v) changed the financing
parameters (to 100% of Expenditures, and (vi) extended the original closing date by two years, to
December 31, 2009. As PDO and associated indicators were essentially not changed, the restructuring
was approved at Regional Vice President Level.
16.     The Results Monitoring Matrix modified the Outcome Indicators of the original PAD Project
design summary to improve measurability:
· Area of forests on Tanzania Mainland managed according to approved forest management plans
    (including Community Based Forest Management (CBFM) and Joint Forest Management (JFM)
    Agreements).
· Area of forest plantations under private management agreements (concessions, co-management, or
    communities designated).
· Mechanisms for forest biodiversity conservation are more fully established (Areas of Forest Reserves
    Mountains managed according to IUCN Codes).
17.     The second DCA amendment signed in August 2007 also did not accurately reflect the approved
restructuring proposal; instead it expanded on the already existing divergence between DCA and Revised
Results Framework and added new KPIs, without adjusting existing Indicators. As a result, the
amendment did not use the opportunity to address discrepancies between the previous DCA and the
adjusted Results Framework.
1.5 Revised GEO and Key Indicators and Reasons/justification
18.   The GEO and related KPI were not revised.
1.6 Main Beneficiaries
19.     According to both PADs, the Project was to provide benefits to rural households that depend on
woodlots and forests to meet consumptive demands, as well as job seekers who would find employment
in a revitalized forest industry (based on sustainable plantation production). The Project was expected to
develop lessons from innovative pilot activities and as a result of institutional development, which was
supposed to have potential benefits for the vast majority of the country's population. Direct benefits that
would accrue to communities through the Project included improved consumption and income through
the use and sale of forest products obtained from sustainably managed resources, and an improved
environment associated with enhanced forest conservation and protection. National benefits of
biodiversity conservation were expected to accrue as a result of watershed catchment protection, which in
turn would yield significant benefits in terms of long-term hydroelectric energy production and urban
water supplies.
1.7 Original Components
20.   The Project was originally designed with the following four components and nine sub-
components (see Annex 6).
21.     Component One: Supporting institutional change and improving delivery service (US$ 25.6
Million), was to assist GOT with the design and establishment of the Tanzania Forest Service (TFS) as a
specialized "executive agency" as defined by the Executive Agencies Act (1997), and consistent with the
wider and on-going national program of civil service reform. It was envisaged that the TFS would have
responsibility for bringing about improvements in the protection and management of natural forests and
the development and management of industrial plantations. The concept was that an agency with a
                                                    4
national mandate would eventually be established. The component would have three sub-components: (i)
Establishment of the TFS; (ii) Improving service-delivery mechanisms for participatory forest and
woodland management; and (iii) Improving revenue collection from forests and woodlands.
22.     Component Two: Private sector involvement in the management of industrial plantations (US$
3.0 Million), would provide resources to develop and implement a framework for this initiative of the
management of existing industrial plantations, as well as to strengthen the potential for the development
and management of new plantations. There would be four sub-components: (i) Improving the plantation
resource information base and management planning capacity; (ii) Strengthening institutional support
services for private sector involvement; (iii) Piloting alternative management of selected industrial
plantations; and (iv) Monitoring and Evaluation.
23.     Component Three: Eastern Arc forests conservation and management (US$ 13.4 Million), which
was co-financed with US$ 7 Million by GEF. The component had sub-components: (i) Institutional
reforms for forest biodiversity conservation, in particular of the Eastern Arc forests; and (ii) Mechanisms
for sustainable financing of biodiversity conservation, including the establishment of the Eastern Arc
Mountains Conservation Endowment Fund (EAMCEF)1.
24.    Component Four: Project Administration and Management (US$ 2.7 Million), to finance the cost
of administration and management.
1.8 Revised Components
25.     The Project was restructured twice, in 2006 and in 2007, and this led to revisions of Project
components. However, as described above, the Amendments to the DCA did not accurately reflect the
introduced changes, which led to inconsistencies in the documentation and retroactively made the
assessment of the project outcomes difficult.
26.    The July 2006 First Amendment to the DCA reflected the restructuring memo by adjusting the
implementation modalities of the PFM sub-component. The restructuring introduced a new Expenditure
Category of "Sub-Projects" and reallocating Credit Proceeds.
27.     Rather than having the Forest and Beekeeping Division (FBD) directly implementing the
participatory forest component, a new sub-component was to enable sub-grants to communities through a
PFM window under the Tanzania Social Action Fund (TASAF) using Community-Driven Development
(CDD). Funds under the PFM sub-component that were not transferred to TASAF were used to create the
enabling environment, infrastructure and advice on sub-project development. The new CDD sub-
component was implemented by the TASAF Management Unit, under a MoU with the Ministry of
Natural Resources and Tourism (MNRT). The funds allocated to this component, under a separate special
account, were managed by the TASAF Management Unit. There was no transfer of funds among
projects.
28.     The restructuring memo makes no reference to the need for creating a new component. Rather
than changing scope of the existing sub-component and creating a new one, the DCA did create a new
component "Supporting community-based management of forests and woodland" (part D of the Project)
and introduced a new KPI, without considering the need for rectifying discrepancies within the legal
agreement.
29.    The 2007 restructuring formalized the shift of resources from a focus on the institutional
framework toward the creation of the enabling environment. Among the changes introduced were three
new sub-components, under Components 1 and 3 to (i) allow for the implementation of a National Forest

1
  Two additional sub-components to be implemented by UNDP were complementary to the Bank-implemented activities,
and are not formally reported upon in this report: (i) Development and preparation of an integrated Conservation Strategy
for the Eastern Arc Mountain Forests; and (ii) a forest conservation intervention through government and community
partnership initiatives.
                                                            5
Inventory and forest management plans, (ii) support the development and piloting of a fuelwood strategy;
and (iii) provide financing for the implementation of the Derema Corridor Resettlement Action Plan. The
latter was an activity, initially unforeseen, yet directly related to the GEO. GOT established the "Derema
Corridor", linking two protected forests in the Usambara Mountains, which are part of the Eastern Arc
Mountains. In this process, villagers had to cease farming in forestland, for which they were to be
compensated. Different development partners, including the Government of Finland and Conservation
International joined GOT and provided financial resources for the compensation. However, as financing
was insufficient, GOT requested the Bank to reallocate TFCMP credit proceeds toward this exercise. The
Derema Corridor RAP was subsequently included in the 2007 restructuring of the Project.
1.9 Other Significant Changes
30.     Financing and Funding Allocations. Credit proceeds were reallocated at several instances during
Project implementation and are detailed in Annex 8. Considering the significant exchange rate gains
(about US$6 million) over the implementation period, the additional funding allowed financing of
planned activities and also facilitated the inclusion of new priorities as outlined above.
31.     Implementation Arrangements. The 2006 Amendment to the DCA introduced the TASAF
Management Unit as additional Implementing Agency to support community-based management of
forests and woodlands. To that extent MNRT and TASAF entered a Memorandum of Understanding
(MoU) dated February 6, 2006. As the GOT had embarked on discussions with development Partners to
work toward a Forestry Sector Wide Approach (SWAp), it replaced its "National Forest Program Steering
Committee" with a "National Forest and Beekeeping SWAp Steering Committee". Considering that the
former had been the entity responsible for overall guidance of the Project, the 2007 DCA reflected this
change. The 2007 Amendment of the DCA also included specifications for the implementation of the
Derema Corridor Resettlement Action Plan.
32.    Implementation Schedule. The 2007 Amendment to the DCA extended the Project closing date by
two years, to December 31, 2009.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes
2.1 Project Preparation, Design, and Quality at Entry
Sound background analysis
33.     Overall reasoning, justification, strategic choices and design of TFCMP (and EAFCMP) were
based on sound analysis and genuine sector priorities, some of which are as relevant today as they were at
the time of Project preparation, The basic framework of the Project was developed at a Strategic Planning
Workshop convened by MNRT in June 1999, which focused on the findings of the Implementation
Completion Report (ICR) of the Forest Resource Management Project (FRMP), and used some of the
evaluation studies to provide strategic guidance for the design of TFCMP. This was followed by a series
of four missions, starting with identification in January 2000, and ending with appraisal in October 2001.
34.    The inclusion of the GEF component in TFCMP was an outcome of a UNDP-implemented
Project Identification Activity following the December 1997 International Conference on the
Conservation and Management of the Eastern Arc.
Lessons learned and incorporated in Project design
35.      Project preparation was influenced by the previous FRMP, which implemented a number of
activities on a pilot scale, in particular those related to Participatory Forest Management (PFM), forest
extension, forest collection and monitoring as well as regional and local planning of forest activities.
Considering these experiences, the TFCMP/EAFCMP was designed to upscale these pilot activities to a
national scale.



                                                    6
Assessment of Project Design
36.      The PDO (and GEO) captured the Government's vision of forest policy reform, strongly
influenced by the (at preparation) ongoing general Public Service Reform Program championed by the
UK Department for International Development (DFID) at the time. The PDO was adequately broad, given
the transition underway in the sector. The PDO was supported by the scope and composition of funded
activities. The Project's aim to support wide-ranging policy revisions was based on the 2002 Forest Act's
provision to establish a semi-autonomous agency in the forest sector, which was to be operationalized by
the Project. In hindsight, the ambitious focus on the implementation of institutional changes, that had not
yet taken place at appraisal and depended on continued political support outside the Project's control, was
one of the main contributors for experienced problems during Project implementation from the onset.
37.     The design did assume that the implementation of the new forest policy would take place within
two years of appraisal, with a framework and institutional set up for the long-term sustainable
management and conservation of forest resources in place. A number of critical activities were therefore
planned and depended on the establishment of TFS. This affected Project implementation early on, as the
assumption was that TFS would be the precondition to carry out other activities. In hindsight, the design
should have allowed a more flexible approach, considering that there was a need for: (i) assessing and
consolidating the information base of forest resources; (ii) improving transparency; as well as (iii)
establishing accountability mechanisms which would benefit the envisaged service delivery function of
the forest sector, regardless, whether TFS was in place, or FBD will continue to be the responsible GOT
agency. This would have enabled sustainable management and conservation of forest resources within the
existing legal and institutional framework, in partnership with relevant stakeholders, such as communities
and private sector, even in the absence of the TFS.
38.     The PAD provides references to the decentralization process and attempts to make use of and
contribute to this process. The actual decentralization took a different course than anticipated, with a
steeply increasing role of the Prime Minister's Office ­ Regional Administration and Local Government
(PMO-RALG) at the field level. Project design did not foresee these changes, which are affecting
reporting and resource distribution mechanisms, leading to a less prominent role of the central
government at district level. The Project also missed the opportunity to specify how TFS could have
operated in a decentralized environment.
Assessment of Risks
39.      The five "from output to objective" risks were reasonable but their assessment was not
sufficiently rigorous (and not formulated as risks). These included: (i) insufficient support for introducing
institutional reforms; (ii) underdeveloped revenue sharing mechanisms; (iii) encroachment of forest areas;
(iv) lack of commitment to engage with the private sector; and (v) insufficient commitment to biodiversity
conservation. As outlined above, the risk for non-establishment of the TFS should have been rated as
substantial as it required continued political level decision making. In this respect, the mitigation
measures should have taken into account what the consequences would have been of substantial delays in
the establishment of the agency. In addition, the design underestimated the risk that GOT would not
engage constructively with the private sector and seize opportunities for outsourcing/concession
development and management of forest areas. In retrospect, this had an impact on the performance under
this component as mitigation measures not being considered. While the GOT commitment was strong to
improve the mechanism for financial sustainability of forest conservation, the predicted difficulties of the
Endowment Fund to generate sufficient financial support should have been assessed as substantial.
Quality at Entry
40.    Quality at Entry was not recorded at the time of Project approval. In view of issues discussed
above and despite less rigorous criteria and instructions used at the time it would likely have been rated
Moderately Unsatisfactory.


                                                     7
2.2 Implementation
41.     The Project has been under implementation since July 2002. Even though the progress was not as
swift as expected the overall Project rating remained Satisfactory for almost 2.5 years. In December 2004,
the rating was strongly downgraded to Unsatisfactory. By June 2005, it was upgraded to Moderately
Unsatisfactory, where it remained until November 2007. In December 2007, it was again upgraded, to
Moderately Satisfactory, but by November 2008, it was once more downgraded to Moderately
Unsatisfactory, where it has remained until the closing date of the Project.
(a) Factors that have negatively affected Project implementation
42.     A Project design that depended too strongly on political commitment to innovations, in particular,
establishment of the TFS and private sector involvement in industrial forest plantations. The focus on
establishment of the TFS drew attention away from the other equally important innovative elements in the
Project (for instance community based forest management). In 2008 and again in 2009, the Bank
suggested a restructuring of the Project and withdrawal of the establishment of TFS as a Project
performance indicator, but senior FBD/MNRT staff advised against this, fearing that its withdrawal as an
indicator would give a negative signal to political decision makers and decrease the likelihood that TFS
would be established. The original commitment to involve the private sector in forest plantation
management was weakened as a result of: (i) a lack of inventory data, (ii) a reluctance to pursue
privatization in the absence of reliable information on the forest resource base; (iii) an inappropriate
regulatory and procedural framework to allocate concessions; and (iv) a more general backlash against
privatization after mixed results in other sectors; and (v) a widespread (but unrelated) illegal logging
practices (mainly in natural forests) and the high profile attention this received.
43.     Changes in leadership and weak supervision. Frequent changes of MNRT political and technical
leadership occurred during Project implementation. It has been argued that even if incoming leadership
wanted to establish TFS, they would have required time to understand all implications before actually
confirming such a decision. On the Bank side, the Task Team Leader (TTL) at preparation stage left the
region before the Project became effective. The incoming TTL was not familiar with the country, the
sector, and the implications of the institutional reforms proposed. Subsequently, supervision in initial
years was weak. Additional management changes happened between 2003 and 2005, with some stability
coming in October 2005 when the Project was managed from the Bank's Dar es Salaam Office.
44.     Capacity constraints. Although FBD, the main implementing agency, allocated financial and
human resources to a departmental (mainstreamed) implementation unit, the appointed accounting and
procurement staff lacked experience and understanding of Bank procedures. This negatively impacted
procurement activities, including contract management, and subsequently led to slow disbursement.
Frequent transfers of FBD fiduciary staff also made it difficult to provide incentives for staff working on
the project through the provision of training. The situation was eventually overcome with the contracting
of financial management and procurement consultant expertise.
45.      Delays caused by third parties. During Project preparation, it was expected that Denmark would
complement certain TFCMP supported activities. For instance, TFCMP would work at central
government level on awareness raising, engage and train a pool of service providers, as well as M&E of
community based forest management (CBFM), and Denmark was expected to support local level CBFM
implementation. Once TFCMP was approved, Finland joined Denmark in supporting CBFM at local level
through the provision of financing directly to a number of districts. However, the implementation
arrangements were different from what had been anticipated; their support was not nationwide and started
later than had been expected. In order to roll out CBFM on a larger scale, the GOT requested the Bank to
finance local level activities in addition. Considering the existing IDA financed TASAF II project, the
Bank responded positively to the request and financed sub-projects through a window for CBFM support
through TASAF, covering 25 districts, not covered by Danish/Finnish support. As this approach was


                                                    8
different from the one used by the other Development partners, required capacity building delayed the
actual approval and implementation of sub-project proposals by about one year.
(b) Factors that have positively contributed to Project implementation
46.    Improved supervision and stability in task team leadership. The appointment in 2005 of a
country-based TTL, supported by team members in the Country Office, made for more concerted
supervision; improved and timely dialogue with the government and responses to issues in real time.
47.     Pragmatic approach of the FBD-TFCMP team and the Bank's Task Team to "make the best of
it", even in the absence of the promised establishment of TFS, and the attitude to "move forward where
possible", resulted in overachievement of certain activities, while others could not be achieved.
48.     MTR and Restructuring exercises. The restructuring on Component One, helped refocus attention
from institutional change associated with the TFS, to service delivery in the field of sustainable (i.e.
participatory) forest management. This was supported by the development of a Results Framework and a
Results Monitoring Matrix to replace the earlier Project Design Summary and formal establishment of
existing baselines against which progress could be measured. In addition, the extension of the Project
duration by two years to December 2009 helped the Project to adjust the anticipated results and achieve
more than would have been the case had the earlier closing date been maintained. Finally, increasing to
the maximum the percentage of financing parameters to be financed by Credit Proceeds for all Categories
helped to overcome implementation delays caused by the lack of counterpart funding.
49.    Joint Development Partner approach to participatory forest management. This resulted in good
coordination, cooperation and information exchange with DPs in the forestry sector (in particular
Denmark, Finland, and Norway). It also facilitated increased joint policy level discussions, therefore,
eliminating potential duplication or opposing advice to the government; while leveraging each of the
donor's comparative strengths in the management of forest resources.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization
50.     The M&E arrangements of the Project were weak from the outset and suffered from divergent
indicator formulations. During the Supervision Mission (Sept. 2003), the lack of a system "that would
allow effective evaluation of the achievements of Project specific outputs and development objectives"
was noted and measures included to develop such a system. However, a serious attempt to address this
shortcoming was not undertaken until 2006.
51.     Original design. At the time of Project design, M&E was not as rigorous as it is today. The
original Project design had several M&E related weaknesses:
· The PDO was very broadly defined, but also referred to a "pilot scale";
· The PAD included indicators that were formulated differently from the ones in the DCA and Project
    design summary. The DCA used the KPIs as included in the Main Text, even though these consisted
    of not only indicators at PDO level, but also indicators at component and sub-component levels (such
    as for instance the establishment of the TFS)2;
· Original Project components included a sub-component on M&E to cover Component Two (private
    sector involvement in forest plantations), because of the innovative nature of that component. Since
    the whole Project design was innovative, the same reasoning could have justified an M&E system that
    would have covered the entire Project. However, both TFS and the restructured MNRT were expected
    to have clearly defined monitoring roles, which is probably why no comprehensive M&E system was
    included in TFCMP itself.
· The original set of indicators consisted of two types: a yes/no type (for instance, TFS established or
    not) and an open-ended type, such as "forest brought under effective management". The latter type

2
 This was not addressed properly and subsequent non-achievement of certain lower level indicators contributed to the
Project performance ratings as included in the ICR.
                                                           9
    would have required a baseline against which to measure progress, and a target value that should be
    achieved. But, there was no baseline and no targets.
52.      NAFOBEDA and Results Framework. As a consequence of the weak M&E system, the borrower
developed a proposal for a National Forest & Beekeeping Database (NAFOBEDA), which was designed
and field tested over the following two years. Nevertheless, the nationwide roll-out and implementation
was delayed due to capacity constraints and lack of enabling infrastructure at local level. The 2006 MTR
agreed on a proper Results Framework to replace the original Project Design Summary. It also took the
initiative to start sharpening the indicators and ­ belatedly ­ formally establish a baseline. The June 2007
restructuring Project Paper included a fully-fledged Results Framework and a Results Monitoring Matrix,
introducing systematic measurable Intermediate Outcome Indicators, mainly relying on already existing
baselines. Reporting against these baselines was done during supervision by utilizing data from existing
reports (both published and unpublished) to satisfy data requirements in the results framework to ensure
the availability of sufficient data as evidence for the achievements of the Project against its PDO. This
process was a result of the fact that the list of indicators that can be generated by NAFOBEDA (including
the majority of the performance indicators under TFCMP/EAFCMP) had yet to be fully entered into the
database.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance
(a) Social and Environmental Safeguards
53.      Overall, Project compliance with social and environmental safeguards has been satisfactory.
During preparation, the Project was categorized as a Category B Project under the Bank's Safeguard
policies and guidelines. Safeguard policies triggered by the Project at appraisal were: Environmental
Assessment (OP 4.01), Natural Habitats (OP 4.04) and Forestry (OP 4.36). An analysis of Environmental
and Social issues related to the Project was carried out during Project preparation and included as an
Annex to the PAD. This analysis recommended that: (i) an environmental and social safeguards checklist
should be incorporated into the Guidelines for the establishment of Village Forest Reserves, but that it
would not be necessary to prepare an Environmental Management Plan; (ii) detailed socio-economic
studies should be carried out in the pilot industrial plantation areas affected by private sector involvement;
and (iii) the impact of the Participatory Forest Management sub-component and other Project activities on
the integrity of tropical high forests should be monitored. The analysis concluded that overall Project
impact on environmental management and conservation in forests would be positive. Considering the
subsequent strengthening of the environmental compliance mechanism as stipulated in the Environmental
Management Act of 2004, as well as the development of Forest Sector-specific Environmental Impact
Assessment Guidelines, the compliance with the above mentioned safeguard policies was rated
"satisfactory".
54.    At appraisal, no social safeguard was triggered, which was confirmed by the GOT (as stated in the
PAD) that involuntary resettlement would not be carried out in conjunction with any Project
implementation activity. However, and as outlined above, the GOT's request to use credit proceeds to
compensate 1,130 local farmers who had seized cultivating inside a forest reserve targeted to become a
connector between two protected areas, triggered OP 4.12 (Involuntary Resettlement) and necessitated the
preparation of a Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) for the area. Once the RAP had been approved by the
Regional Safeguard Coordinator and been disclosed, a request was put forward to the Bank's Land
Acquisition Committee in March 2007 to review the request for financing land acquisition/compensation
under BP 6.00. The request was subsequently approved and RAP implementation started.
55.     As part of its due diligence, in May 2009 the Bank carried out an independent verification of the
RAP implementation. The verification report outlined the achievements reached at the time and drew
attention to some of the implementation constraints experienced (see Annex 7 for a more detailed
description of conclusions). It states that: (i) cash compensation had been duly paid out, grievance settling
mechanism was implemented and easily accessible; (ii) land compensation had not yet been finalized; (iii)
                                                     10
the resettlement and compensation exercise had been implemented in a piece-meal manner and with
delays, (iv) the M&E had not started; and (v) OP 4.10 (Indigenous Peoples) and OP 4.11 (Physical
Cultural Resources) did not apply.
56.     By December 2009, a number of activities highlighted in the verification report had been
addressed, such as: (i) developing and implementing a M&E system for the RAP; and (ii) identifying and
demarcating a total of 921 ha of land for compensation, currently forming part of an idle, state-owned
sisal plantation estate. The fact that the RAP has been incorporated into the District Development Plan
indicates strong local and regional commitment (including from the local Member of Parliament).
Furthermore, the Forest and Beekeeping Division will retain its RAP coordinator until the land
compensation exercise is concluded. During a meeting with affected farmers in late March 2010, the
Board of the Consolidated Holding Corporation (successor of the former Parastatal Sector Reform
Commission - in charge of administering former state holdings), agreed that the ownership of the farm
should be revoked by the President and distributed to the affected farmers as stipulated in the RAP. The
necessary follow up is being undertaken by the local MP through the Commissioner for Land at the
Ministry for Lands, Housing and Human Settlements.
57.     In order to resolve this last outstanding issue, the World Bank will continue to monitor the
progress with respect to the land compensation and work with all relevant stakeholders to ensure that the
affected farmers will be allocated the farm land as outlined in the Resettlement Action Plan.
(b) Fiduciary Compliance
58.     A Country Financial Accountability Assessment was completed at the time of Project preparation,
and a Financial Management Capacity Assessment of MNRT was undertaken in conjunction with the
Appraisal Mission. This, and the positive experience with the previous Bank operation in the sector, led to
the conclusion that there would be no major financial risks to the Project. Procurement would be carried
out using existing MNRT structures, and MNRT was to retain its Procurement Specialist. The overall
procurement risk assessment rate was "average".
59.      The MTR in 2006 found the Project's financial management to be weak: "the accounting systems
of the Project are inadequate and cannot be relied upon to produce understandable, relevant and reliable
financial information required by the Bank". Considering the fact that the Project was operated by a
"mainstreamed PIU", capacity constraints were mainly related to insufficient understanding and skill mix
of fiduciary staff in the Project office. In addition, high staff turnover at implementation made capacity
building and strengthening difficult, as capable staff seldom remained with the Project but were
transferred to other (Bank financed) Projects. By 2007, the situation had improved: ineligible expenses
prior to FY2005/06 were refunded in full by MNRT; and additional procurement and financial expertise
had been hired. The latter improved the capacity of the implementation team and resulted in a Satisfactory
rating (for FM) and Moderately Satisfactory rating for procurement at Project closure.
60.     Particular weaknesses existed in management of civil works contracts, specifically the
construction of the (TFS) offices. Notably, there was improper application of the exchange rate formula
and substantial cost over-runs, which were only formally reported at a very late stage, triggered complex
contract amendment procedures that could have been avoided by timely reporting.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase
61.     No direct follow-up operation is planned. The current Tanzania Joint Assistance Strategy (JAS)
covers 2007-2010, and it is uncertain to what extent forestry or natural resources management issues will
have a prominent place in the next CAS.

3. Assessment of Outcomes
3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
62.      The PDO remains relevant to Tanzania's "National Strategy for Growth and Reduction of
Poverty" 2005-2010 (MKUKUTA)3, particularly to its "Economic Growth and Reduction of Income
Poverty" cluster, which specifically mentions natural resources management, including forestry and is
currently under revision. This is also true for the Bank's Joint Assistance Strategy 2007-2010 (now
extended through a CAS Progress Report until June 2011). For the latter, governance and accountability
in the forest (and NRM) sector are important, as is the role of the sector in economic growth. Considering
the importance of the Eastern Arc Mountains, the GEO remains as relevant today as it was at appraisal.
63.      Based on solid preparatory work and preceding FRMP, the Project design was relevant at the
time, considering the ongoing public service reform processes championed by some Development
Partners and perceived strong GOT ownership. However, achieving the associated outcomes (such as the
establishment of TFS) was dependent on political commitment, which has been outside the Project's
control. The Project's focus on institutional reform assumed that other sector priorities would fall into
place once the TFS had been established, yet did not prepare for the possibility that this process could
stall or change. As some Development Partners changed funding modalities (to General Budget Support)
and frequent changes at FBD management level led to the loss of institutional memory and subsequent
lack of ownership on the client side, critical assumptions made at appraisal changed within the first 18
months of implementation. Once the institutional restructuring could not be achieved, the main factor to
success was lost and despite the achievement of the activities in some of the other components ­
sustainability in the long term remains questionable. In the absence of TFS, there is still a need to build
functional and long-term alternatives. The decentralization process is a factor that could help in the long-
term, but some work will need to be done to ensure that there will be adequate linkages between the
central and decentralized (local) government levels. In particular, there is a need for adequate provision
of human and financial resources, to ensure that joint planning and implementation can be done and
sustained in the future. As a result and regardless, whether TFS or FBD would be the responsible agency,
sustainable forest management and conservation approaches could have been developed, in partnership
with relevant stakeholders, such as communities and private sector as foreseen in the Project design.
While some of these ideas have been introduced into the Project through the 2007 restructuring,
considering the remaining implementation period, these changes could not make up for the time lost
during the first five years of implementation.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objective and Global Environmental Objectives
64.      Taking into account the broad PDO and the above discussed divergence of indicators, assessing
the achievement of indicators is done in two ways: (i) by assessing whether different sub-objectives
within the PDO have been achieved; and (ii) within the different components. The PDO (which remained
unchanged) contained four sub-objectives: (i) implementing Tanzania's forest policy, by developing a
framework for the long-term sustainable management and conservation of Tanzania's forest resources;
(ii) strengthening the role of individuals, communities, villages and (iii) the private sector in management
and conservation of forests; and (iv) implementing this framework on a pilot scale.
65.     Today more than 4.1 million hectares (or 13% of all forests in Tanzania) are under either
Community-based or Joint (GOT-Community) Forest Management, the Project clearly helped to
strengthen forest management by individuals, communities and villages. In addition, within the existing
framework a number of innovative activities have been implemented on a pilot scale (e.g. forest produce
pricing systems, decentralized revenue tracking system, establishment of NAFOBEDA, carbon projects
participating in the voluntary market). Revenues have increased by 33% over the last three years of the
project. As these results were achieved without TFS being established, a Moderately Satisfactory rating
was considered. However, the project's objective was the implementation of the policy and associated
framework, focusing on (i) providing more independence of the sector from Government Budget, (ii)
                                                    12
creating the autonomy to make strategic decisions for the allocation of resources, and (iii) ensuring a
commitment to engage with relevant stakeholders in the long-term. The establishment of this semi-
autonomous agency would have been an important milestone in sector reform process. The fact that even
management arrangements on a pilot were not formalized at project closure raises concern. Considering
that the overall policy and legal framework in the sector has not changed since the appraisal of the project,
with pressures on forest resources greater than ever due to increasing population impact, expansion of the
agricultural frontier and escalating demand for fuelwood in urban centers, the failure to change the
institutional set up of the sector raises concern about the sustainability of outcomes and outputs achieved.
As a result, the achievement of the PDO has been rated Moderately Unsatisfactory.
66.      Achievement of the GEO as measured by the single KPI formulated in the 2003 EAFCMP TFGA,
is rated Moderately Satisfactory. It is not fully Satisfactory because of the initial delays in meeting the
benchmark triggers for the disbursement of the endowment funds and the inability to raise additional
capital for the endowment fund. The GEF provided the initial US$7 million for the endowment with the
goal under the Project to raise at least an additional US$1 million. While there is no concern about the
institutional and financial sustainability of the EAMCEF, the revenue generated from the capital at US$7
million is well below what would be optimal to cater for conservation activities in all the forest blocks of
the Eastern Arc.

3.3 Efficiency
67.      The Project was a blended IDA Credit/GEF grant and counterpart funding from the Government
of Tanzania. During preparation of the Project economic and financial considerations were discussed,
focusing on: (i) community-based forest management; (ii) environmental values and the national
economy; (iii) carbon sequestration; (iv) industrial plantation production; and (v) fiscal revenue collection
in relation to FBD expenditures and budget allocation. Annex 3 revisits these considerations and attempts
to quantify the benefits achieved through the different activities undertaken by the project.
68.      Institutional management efficiency: The investment of US$10 million for the building enabled
not only the Forest and Beekeeping Division, but also the whole Ministry to consolidate staff previously
based in several locations around Dar es Salaam. In addition to the beneficial credit conditions (to be
repaid over 40 years at a minimal interest rate), the efficiency gain can also be measured in (i) lower
travel costs (fuel, maintenance, etc.), (ii) more time spent on productive tasks due to less time spent in
traffic, and (iii) better monitoring and evaluation of civil servants' performance by management.
69.     Plantation inventory: The inventory of the public plantation estate (of 80,000 hectares) has been
carried out incurring the expenses for (i) quality and supervision consultancy, (ii) incremental cost for
field crews for data collection and analysis, durable goods (vehicles, computers) and (iv) training of
crews. While the total cost of US$2.59 million seems relatively high, the inventory has not only provided
field data for all public plantations, established systems (including site stratification, permanent sample
plots, production of maps, and development of country-specific yield tables and set up of a databases).
Goods procured under this sub-component and training provided has not only benefitted the plantation
inventory, but also enabled FBD to set up, train and equip inventory crews, which will be used to carry
out the planned National Forest Monitoring and Assessment (NAFORMA). Therefore, the amount of
valuable information gained and systems established will make all subsequent inventories much more cost
effective.
70.      Improved Revenue Collection: Under this sub-component, a number of innovative consultancies
(e.g. redesign of log sale system, transport based fee system for charcoal and fuelwood) were developed
and implemented. Key support was provided in establishing and equipping Forest Surveillance Units
(FSUs) in strategic parts of the country. This strengthened the field presence and enforcement capacity of
FBD. As a result of the project's investment of US$ 3.68 million, a 33% increase in revenue collection
(from TShs.18 billion in 2007 to TShs. 24 billion in 2009) has been achieved. In addition, the introduced
tracking system of forest produce has become mandatory for all other departments in the Ministry.
                                                     13
71.    Management planning in Natural Forests: As a result of the 2007 restructuring, operational
support was provided to the FBD catchment office. The objective was to develop and implement
management plans for 1.3 million hectares of critical Nature Reserves (Kilombero, Nilo, and Uluguru).
With a cost of US$2 per hectare, this exercise was carried out efficiently, considering an average cost
between US$1.50 to US$4 per hectare for comparable forest ecosystems.
72.     Participatory Forest Management: Compared to the cost per unit of doing this through traditional
"project based approaches", PFM implemented under TFCMP (and parallel financed by Denmark and
Finland) represented a significant reduction in transaction cost, while subsequently increasing coverage
both of forest areas and villages. The funds implemented through TASAF under the credit (US$3.76
Million) reached 25 districts and around 100 villages. The cost for developing a sub-project under this
component was on average US$1,500, which is in the same range as ring fenced funds in other sectors. In
the eight districts where the local government capacity was low, the support provided under the project to
engage Local Service Providers has increased the efficiency of the delivery mechanism and sped up the
project development and approval process. Earlier support provided under a "traditional project" financed
by Denmark had a budget of US$5 Million and worked in 22 villages in one district. While there are
issues about quality versus quantity - and trade-offs to be made, the present model developed and
implemented by the GOT represents value for money. Compared with other countries Tanzania should be
considered in a stage between Nepal, where unit costs are lower and Cambodia or Kenya, where much of
implementation is being done at a pilot scale or by NGOs using project based models. However, Nepal
has over 40 years experience and PFM now operates in 14,000 villages and touches around 23% of the
total population. Recurrent costs are low because capacity, systems and modalities have been established.
The development of a national system for Tanzania is well on its way, but requires additional support to
make it sustainable.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome and GEO Outcome Rating
73.     The Overall Outcome Rating of the Project, measured by combining relevance, achievement of
PDO (including explicit or implicit key associated outcome targets), and efficiency is Moderately
Unsatisfactory. Reasons for this rating include:
· The institutional reform and enabling environment associated with Component One are insufficient to
    be confident about the sustainability of the achievements under the first KPI (area of forest under
    effective community management). The main pending issue is the sharing of benefits and revenues
    from participatory forest management between local communities, local government authorities,
    MNRT and the Treasury.
· Similarly the sustainability of the achievements under the private sector involvement indicator
    remains in doubt until the current MoUs are replaced by formal contracts.
· Project efficiency suffered as a result of unsatisfactory elements in Bank and Borrower performance,
    in particular: (i) political level decision making (or the lack thereof) by the Borrower regarding TFS
    establishment and (participatory managed) forest revenue sharing; and (ii) three years (2002 ­ 2005)
    of unsatisfactory Project supervision by the Bank and increasing deviation between revisions to the
    results framework and amendments to the DCA.
74.     Based on achievements made toward the GEO with respect to (i) establishing of the Eastern Arc
Mountain Conservation Endowment Fund (EAMCEF); (ii) selecting and implementing of a sound capital
investment strategy; as well as (iii) GOT's commitment in supporting the EAMCEF operation as well as
its grant facility, its outcome could be considered Satisfactory. However, the failure to ensure the
development and implementation of an effective fundraising strategy to secure necessary financing to
implement its long-term strategies resulted in an overall GEO rating of Moderately Satisfactory.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
75.     Natural resources from forests and woodlands (predominantly miombo) contribute significantly to
household economies in rural Tanzania. However, in the majority of cases, poor rural households are not
becoming rich by tapping into markets for forest and miombo woodland products, but are vitally
dependent on forests because of their role as a safety net. Forests are providing for a very substantial
proportion of total household consumption. This proportion increases significantly among households that
encounter serious income shocks because of illness or environmental stress. Forest and woodland
resources are a critical element of the rural household economy and contribute significantly to mitigating
the impacts of poverty. In cases where these resources are lost as a result of deforestation or other
proximate causes, the need for alternative safety nets is likely to place further and quite large burdens on
public service delivery institutions, already poorly equipped to handle the problem of rural poverty.
76.    The expansion of Participatory Forest Management has been a result of improving capacity for
local management of forest resources, supported under the TFCMP in collaboration with other
Development Partners. As communities take on responsibility, become owners of villages forests and
engage jointly with the GOT in managing and conserving forest and woodland resources sustainably, the
role of safety nets for mitigating the impacts of rural poverty can be greatly enhanced. While the
management of the dry woodlands is unlikely to provide a path out of poverty, it can help to reduce its
negative impacts.
(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
77.     Institutional change was the main focus of the original Project design, primarily the early
establishment of both the TFS and the EAFCMP and the subsequent strengthening of the capacity of these
new institutions to undertake a series of core functions. In the case of EAFCMP this was implemented as
planned, resulting in an established mechanism (operated as a NGO) that provides long-term support to
conservation and management of the Eastern Arc Mountain forest.
78.     In the case of the institutional reform, TFS was never established. Instead, the Project had to take
a pragmatic approach, formalized through the 2007 restructuring, and focused on the different core
functions, such as: (i) financing of sub-Projects ­ implemented through TASAF; (ii) carrying out of
natural and plantation forest inventories and the creation of relevant databases; (iii) ensuring the delivery
of improved forest services in for instance the formation of village forest land reserves and in the
management and utilization of industrial forest plantations; (iv) improving control of transport of forest
products and the associated increases in revenue collection as well as the tracking and utilization of these
revenues; (v) preparing woodfuel action plan; as well as (vi) operationalizing of a series of practical
manuals and guidelines.
(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts
79.     While the preparation and implementation of the Derema Corridor Resettlement Action Plan was
not intended at appraisal, the fact that it was directly related to the Project's GEO facilitated the Bank's
positive response to a GOT request to allocate credit proceeds and enable the GOT to overcome a
financing gap under a different (non Bank) operation.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops
80.   Not available.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development and GEO Outcome
Rating for Risk to Development Outcome: Substantial
81.     The Project consisted of many different activities, some more successful and sustainable than
others. With regards to major outcomes, i.e. those related to the actual management of forest and

                                                     15
woodland, in particular the sizable areas under CBFM and JFM, sustainability will depend to a large
extent on the use of the forest resources and the sharing of benefits. These issues are yet to be resolved at
policy level, and therefore all CBFM and JFM forests remain at significant risk.
Rating for Risk to GEO Outcome: Substantial
82.     Though the EAMCEF has been capitalized and is implementing its conservation program,
sustainability of both the general functioning of the Endowment Fund, as well as, the sustainability of
some of its sub-Projects remains questionable. The Endowment Fund has lost much of its value as a result
of the global financial crisis. Also, it has not been particularly successful in fund-raising. The current size
of the Fund is too small to effectively cover the whole EAMCEF target area.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
    Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory
83.     At the time of Project preparation, no Quality at Entry rating was recorded. Taking into account
the fact that the Project preparation team could not have foreseen some of the changes that would take
place, if measured against today's standards Quality at Entry would be considered Moderately
Unsatisfactory because of the following shortcomings: (i) the underestimation of the risk that the TFS
would not be established and the resulting impact on Project implementation; (ii) the absence of a
comprehensive M&E system; (ii) internal inconsistencies within the PAD and between PAD and DCA.
 (b) Quality of Supervision
     Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory
84.      During the first three years of Project implementation, supervision was Unsatisfactory and critical
momentum for institutional reform, generated during Project preparation, was completely lost. The
situation improved in early 2006 when the TTL relocated to Dar es Salaam. The 2006 and 2007
restructuring exercises included both satisfactory (e.g. revised Results Framework) and unsatisfactory
elements (e.g. lost opportunities in rectifying earlier shortcomings). Even the constructive and pragmatic
approach to "make the best of it" and "move forward wherever possible" with some considerable success
until the very end of the Project cannot justify a better rating.
(c) Justification of ratings for Overall Bank Performance
     Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory
85.     Both lending and supervision performances are rated Moderately Unsatisfactory, hence the rating
for the overall performance.

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
     Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory
86.      Satisfactory elements of GOT performance include among others: (i) the relatively quick approval
at all concerned levels, except MNRT itself, of TFS establishment, for instance the President's Office ­
Public Service Management; (ii) the approval by the Ministry of Finance, that a major share of revenues
generated by GOT owned forest plantations can now be retained for the management of these plantations;
(iii) the weight GOT gives to its commitment to respect social and environmental safeguards, as
exemplified by its request to include the Derema Corridor RAP in TFCMP.
87.    Unsatisfactory elements of GOT performance include among others: (i) the failure to establish
TFS despite all the obtained clearances; (ii) the indecision on the sharing of benefits and revenues derived
from CBFM and JFM; (iii) the problems of contract management, as demonstrated in particular by the
construction of the Mpingo House office building; and (iv) the weakness in delivering on funding


                                                      16
commitments as evidenced by its requests to fund the Derema Corridor RAP and its contribution to
NAFORMA from TFCMP Credit Proceeds.
88.   On balance, the impact of the unsatisfactory elements of GOT performance warrants an overall
GOT performance rating as Moderately Unsatisfactory.
(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
    Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory
89.    There have been three implementing agencies: FBD as the main implementing agency, TASAF
and EAMCEF. Satisfactory elements in its performance included: (i) a pragmatic approach to Project
implementation, despite the very much delayed formation of TFS; and (ii) much improved working
methods, both in natural forest management (i.e. JFM and CBFM) and plantation forest management.
Unsatisfactory elements in FBD performance (which outweigh the positive ones) included: (i) persistent
weakness in procurement, contract management, as well as financial management; (ii) lack of counterpart
funding during the first five years of implementation; as well as (iii) its isolation from other sectors and
mainstream decentralization initiatives.
90.     While the performances for TASAF and EAMCEF can be rated Moderately Satisfactory,
considering the fact that both relied heavily on FBD as the main implementing agency, (whose
performance has been Moderately Unsatisfactory at best due to the above outlined reasons), justifies an
overall performance of Moderately Unsatisfactory.
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
    Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory
91.    When comparing achievements (and considering the time it took to achieve those) with
opportunities lost, and the role the Borrower played in this, the overall Borrower performance rating
cannot be better than Moderately Unsatisfactory.

6. Lessons Learned
92.      Sustainable forest sector reforms require strong political and technical leadership. Reforms
also need to be in line with government priorities. Transparency in the consultative process ensures that
staff/employees, at all levels, feel ownership and consider change as an opportunity rather than a threat to
their livelihood.
93.      Projects implemented during times of significant policy change require enhanced, constant
engagement and supervision. This includes utilizing outside expertise with strong in-country experience,
mobilizing senior Bank management, and ensuring flexibility in the design to respond to changes in
priorities while retaining the overall goals.
94.      Forest sector projects tend to be overly ambitious, aiming to address multiple challenges (e.g.
sector reform, sustainable management, governance, community participation, etc.) in a single
operation. Recipient implementation capacity is often insufficient to address existing complexities within
the given timeframe and limited resources are spread too thinly. As a consequence, restructuring is often
required to adjust ambitious project designs to realities on the ground, helping to achieve a few tangible
results. So as to yield sustainable project outcomes, project designs should be more focused, allocating
sufficient and targeted financial resources.
95.     Although community involvement in forest management has become a mainstream activity in
Tanzania, it involves complex social, institutional and regulatory issues. Awareness and capacity
building during start up and implementation require time and expertise, which need to be identified during
Project design preparation. In addition, considering that community forestry at local government level
competes with other sectors (e.g. health, education, agriculture), incentives need to be provided in order to
ensure that forestry and natural resource management (NRM) remains a priority for long-term
development and growth. When cost-benefit sharing mechanisms between governments and communities
                                                     17
(e.g. in Joint Forest Management) are being considered, it is important the collaboration with the Ministry
of Finance is sought upfront. This is critical as the development of a sharing formula cannot be decided
within the sector alone, but would need to be based on established criteria that need to be transparent and
acceptable to all parties.
96.     Where Projects introduce innovative and technically sophisticated tools (such as Log Tracking
System, NAFOBEDA), capacity and infrastructure constraints need to be taken into account. This
could include the consideration of "low-tech" solutions, comprehensive training programs and investment
in necessary infrastructure improvement.
97.     Inconsistencies between different Project documents (PAD, Project Implementation Manual,
etc.) and Financing/Credit Agreements are likely to negatively affect Project implementation,
particularly where key performance indicators are incorporated in the Financing Agreement. While this
issue has been recognized and guidance has been provided for new Projects in the Africa Region3, the
restructuring of ongoing Projects with such problems require the country lawyer and TTL to collaborate
closely throughout the process. Such collaboration would help identify inconsistencies early on and
outline measures to overcome issues.
98.     Fundraising efforts for the endowment of conservation funds must be varied, and commence in
a timely fashion if targets for capitalization are to be achieved. There are often restrictions on bi-lateral
funds being invested directly into endowment funds and therefore alternative, creative ways to attract and
contribute to the overall fund must be developed. Fund-raising efforts must target all potential sources of
monies including bi-lateral, foundation and the private sector.

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agency
99.     The Borrower's Completion Report (summarized in Annex 9 A) provides an assessment similar to
the findings of the Bank's ICR. The Ministry of Natural Resources and Tourism (MNRT), in its
communication of June 14, 2010 principally agreed with the World Bank ratings and observations.
100. Nevertheless, the MNRT felt that an upgrading of its performance rating could be considered, as
the Tanzania Forest Service was established in April 2010, with an acting Chief Executive Officer in
place and the TFS budget prepared and to be tabled as part of MNRT's budget at the Parliament in June
2010. In addition, it was proposed to rate Implementation Agencies, in particular TASAF and EAMCEF
separately, subsequently obtaining a higher than Moderately Unsatisfactory rating.
100. While respecting the efforts undertaken by the MNRT, as the establishment of TFS is being
affected only after project closure, it could not be considered for the assessment under this ICR. The
comment regarding the individual performance assessment of the implementing agencies has been taken
into account under paragraph 90.

  The appreciation of the SDR value over the duration of the project was about US$6 million. These additional
resources allowed the GOT to dedicate significant added finance, beyond what was originally budgeted, to a number
of key activities under the Eastern Arc Forests Conservation and Management component without having to
jeopardize support for other components. The additional resources supported the following activities: establishment
and operation of the EAMCEF secretariat and field staff, implementation of the EAMCEF small grants program
giving grants for applied biodiversity research, improving the ecological function of the ecosystem and management
capacity, and community development activities in the Eastern Arc region. These additional resources also allowed
GOT to develop and implement the Derema Corridor Resettlement Action Plan, which created a corridor between
two established protected areas.
Annex 2. Outputs by Component

1.     The following undertakes an assessment of achievements under each of the component, providing
more detailed rationale for the PDO rating:
(a) Component One:       Creating an enabling environment for sustainable forest management and
improved service delivery.
2.       Sub-component 1.1: New institutional framework with clear service delivery functions and
responsibilities with regard to natural forest, woodlands and plantations (in other words, establishment
of the Tanzania Forest Service). The TFS framework documents were approved by the President's Office
­ Public Service Management in 2006. A valuation of FBD assets is available since 2007, a suitable
candidate for the post of Chief Executive (CE) was identified in 2007, and a substantial office building
was constructed for TFS by 2008. However, the appointment of the CE was not confirmed, the new office
building was occupied by MNRT (with the commitment to handover to TFS upon its establishment). The
process stalled and while an Acting CE was appointed in November of 2009, TFS had not been
established by the closing of the Project.
3.       Sub-component 1.2: Participatory forest and woodland management, which would put in place
effective mechanisms for sharing benefits and cost of forest management. TFCMP contributed to this in
two main ways:
· By supporting the preparation of relevant guidelines for: (i) Community-Based Forest Management,
    (ii) Preparation of Management Plans for natural forests; and (iii) Participatory Forest Management
    Legal Guidelines.
· By (i) establishing a window to finance PFM activities in 25 districts under TASAF, (ii) training
    some 400 Local Government and other local service providers to facilitate PFM processes. A total of
    273 sub-Projects were financed for a total of about US$3.8 million.
4.       Sub-component 1.3: Coherent forest revenue system designed and implemented to increase net
revenues was designed to be operated through TFS. Though good progress was made, the absence of TFS
hampered the final achievements: (i) a proposal on the redesign of forest goods and services revenue
collection system has been ready since 2006, but testing and full implementation was put on hold pending
TFS establishment; (ii) a transport fee based system for charcoal and firewood was developed in 2008 and
has since been tested and rolled out, including drafting of a Government Notice; (iii) a revenue tracking
system for decentralized district level utilization is now operational in 25 pilot districts; (iv) a log sales
and pricing system has been designed; and (v) forestry surveillance has been strengthened, and 12 forest
product checkpoints have been constructed in strategic locations.
5.       Checkpoints and improved surveillance had a positive impact, increasing overall revenues
collected and decreasing the unauthorized transport of forest products. However, it may be difficult to
statistically demonstrate these improvements since policy changes regarding the export of logs have also
had an impact on the quantities of logs and other products transported. Meanwhile, the annual revenue
collected from forest goods and services is likely to reach the set target of TShs.24 billion.
6.     Sub-component 1.4: Capacity of forest sector in undertaking forest and ecosystem inventory and
mapping as well as management planning reinforced (added in the 2007 restructuring). The intermediate
outcome is "capacity of forest sector in undertaking forest and ecosystem inventory and mapping as well
as management planning reinforced", achieved through:
·   Up-to date and reliable forest and ecosystem resource data available for mainland Tanzania, with
    50% of the National Forest Resource Monitoring and Assessment completed by December 2009. As
    the assessment was delayed and only started in 2009, the anticipated result was not achieved.
·   Forest and ecosystem data stored and publicly available in a central database. The National Forestry
    and Beekeeping Database (NAFOBEDA) was developed and field tested. NAFOBEDA is not fully
    functional yet and will require continued capacity development before being operational as intended.
·   Completion of 150,000 hectares of forest management plans for (natural) production forest by
    December 2009. Plans for some 1.3 million hectares including both production and protection forest
    have been prepared and approved, including management plans for eight critical ecosystems.
7.      Sub-component 1.5: Sustainable wood fuel utilization and development of energy strategy (added
in the 2007 restructuring). The intermediate outcome indicator is "sustainable woodfuel utilization
integrated in an overall energy strategy with a view to contributing to economic development and long-
term land-use planning". A Woodfuel Action Plan was prepared, and an area of 4,500 ha has been set
aside within Ruvu Plantation Scheme, while at least six sustainable woodfuel utilization Projects have
been initiated by different organizations.
(b) Component Two: Multi-stakeholder participation in plantation forestry
8.        The indicator for this component is "public and private sector as well as communities engaged in
management and development of plantation forestry". The component focused on the 16 existing state-
owned forestry plantations with a total planted area of about 80,000 hectares. At the time of appraisal
these plantations were not managed well. Under direct management by FBD, there was no mechanism to
retain income generated at the plantation level for management and investment operations. The
component has three intermediate outcome indicators:
· Plantation information base available. The plantation inventory of 80,000 ha was completed in 2009.
· Forest management guidelines revised and approved to reflect benefits and costs of multi-stakeholder
    arrangements in forest plantation management. This was achieved in 2006 with the publication of the
    Framework and Guidelines for Evaluating and Awarding Forest Concessions in Tanzania.
· Number of plantation management agreements in place. By the end 2009 three Memoranda of
    Understanding had been agreed upon, but no contracts in place for: (i) Community based
    management for Kiwira Plantation Forest; (ii) Co-management for Meru/Usa Plantation Forest; and
    (iii) Utilization Concessions with private companies and individuals in Sao Hill Plantation. According
    to the guidelines, a management agreement needs to be vetted by a Forest Advisory Committee,
    which had not been established by December 2009. In the absence of this committee no management
    agreement could be approved.
(c) Component Three: Eastern Arc Forest Conservation and Management.
9.      Sub-component 3.1: Sustainable financing mechanism for long-term biodiversity conservation in
place. The Eastern Arc Mountains Forest Endowment Fund (EAMCEF) was officially registered in
Tanzania in 2001. It was established as a mechanism to provide long-term reliable support for community
development and conservation Projects, as well as applied research activities, which promote the
biological diversity, ecological functions and sustainable use of natural resources. Governed by a Board
of Trustees, the EAMCEF operates as a not-for-profit NGO. It is operated by a Secretariat based in
Morogoro, headed by an Executive Director. Funding of field activities is done in three priority thematic
areas, 80 grants had been awarded by the end of the Project:
· Community based conservation and development activities for improvement of rural livelihoods of
    forest adjacent communities. Largest category of grants (about 50%), activities included training and
    awareness building for tree nursery establishment and planting, beekeeping, improved cooking stoves
    and brick making, fish ponds, dairy goats and supporting local saving and credit schemes.
· Applied biodiversity research relevant to the conservation of biodiversity in the priority Eastern Arc
    Mountain, including carbon sequestration and financing, distribution of different plants, mushrooms
    and animals, both of indigenous and invasive species, beekeeping, participatory forest management,
    impact of pesticides (about 15% of grants).
·   Improving the ecological functions of the ecosystem and strengthen the management capabilities of
    the responsible institutions. This category includes about one third of all grants, used for activities,
    such as improving boundary demarcation, removal of illegally planted crops within forest boundaries,
    training of villagers in forest use and management, awareness raising, improved surveillance.
10.      Until 2009 EAMCEF operated as a component of TFCMP, the operational costs were covered
from credit proceeds in order to allow the received endowment of US$7 million from GEF to grow. The
Endowment Fund is managed by an external fund manager. Due to the volatile global economic situation,
the income generated by the fund has been less than expected, and a more defensive investment strategy
than originally foreseen had to be adopted, which has had negative implications for the Projected income
and growth of the Fund. After a decline due to the financial crisis (to a low of US$5.8 million) the
invested capital increased in value again to US$ 7.2 million by the end of the Project. Though a
fundraising framework was prepared in 2008, the actual amount of additional funds raised has been
limited to a grant of US$370,000 from Unilever (a multi-national company). The Fund is expecting to
receive additional support to cover its operational cost from both GOT and the Royal Embassy of Norway
starting in June 2010. EAMCEF grant activities have been limited to a subset of five districts to ensure
that available resources achieve results on the ground. A gradual expansion to cover the total area under
its mandate is foreseen. However, this would necessitate a fourfold increase of its current capital
according to some calculations.
11.     Sub-component 3.2: Protection of selected forests in the Eastern Arc Mountains (added in 2007).
Three results indicators were defined: (i) bringing the whole forest area in the Eastern Arc Mountains of
Tanzania, or 5,350 km2, under protection status (consolidation of protected area forests and nature
reserves); this was achieved, though not all areas officially acquired IUCN status; (ii) preparation and
pilot implementation of management plans of selected critical watershed forests, which is very similar to
and overlaps with the activities reported under Sub -component 1.4 (iii); and (iii) implementation of the
Derema Corridor Resettlement Action Plan.
Annex 3. Estimated Benefits

1.      The Project Appraisal Document did not include calculations of the Net Present Value (NPV) or
of the Economic Rate of Return (ERR). The annex on economic and financial considerations did include
a review of: (a) poverty impacts, (b) environmental values and the national economy, (c) carbon
sequestration, (d) industrial plantation production, and (e) fiscal revenue collection in relation to FBD
expenditures and budget allocation.
2.       Community benefits. The PAD pointed out that Tanzania's woodland and forests are extremely
important for mitigating the impacts of rural poverty, stating that studies had shown that some 40 percent
of total household consumption in some rural areas was accounted for by forest and woodland products,
(such as honey production, firewood, construction material, and wild fruit), as well as an important source
of dry season grazing and reducing household exposure to environmental risks. In addition, it stated that
the poor were more dependent on woodland and forest resources than the rich.
3.       The Project contributed to participatory forest and woodland management in two main ways: (a)
by supporting the preparation of a series of relevant guidelines that are used nationally in the two
principle types of participatory forest management (Community Based Forest Management and Joint
Forest Management), with a total area of 4.1 million ha; and (b) by funding the establishment of
participatory forest management activities through TASAF. The latter included 273 sub-Projects in 25
districts with about of 520,000 beneficiaries.
4.      Benefits of about 520,000 TASAF forestry sub-Project beneficiaries are conservatively estimated
at an average of US$100 per person per year and a total of US$52 million per year in real terms. It should
be noted, however, that most of these benefits amount to ensuring sustainability (i.e. maintaining benefits
in perpetuity) as opposed to a gradual reduction that would result from uncontrolled resource use.
5.      Environmental benefits. Here the PAD focused on two main values, first and foremost water and
(hydroelectric) energy production, and secondly biodiversity, without attempting to calculate specific
values. A 2007 Tanzania Forest Account study on the willingness of water users to pay some amount as
contribution to watershed protection to ensure improved water services indicated the willingness to pay
was in the range of US$0.15-2.00 per household per year. Based on this finding, the value of watershed
services associated with the TFCMP, particularly the Eastern Arc mountain forests, has been estimated at
approximately US$1.1 million per year.
6.      The same study attempted to estimate the biodiversity value of Tanzanian forest resources, with
assumed values ranging from US$2.1- $811. per ha per year. In the case of TFCMP it would be prudent
to include the 5,350 km2 of protected Eastern Arc mountain forests in such estimates. With an assumed
biodiversity value of US$100 per ha per year, the total biodiversity value of these forests would amount to
US$53.5 million per year.
7.      Carbon sequestration benefits. The PAD includes a calculation of carbon sequestration in
Tanzania's miombo woodlands. It assumes 30 million ha of miombo with an average stocking of 150 tons
of carbon per ha and an average woody biomass increase of 3 percent per year, equivalent to 4.5 tons of
carbon sequestration per ha per year. It states that the reduction of fire frequency is the main technique for
increasing carbon uptake. It subsequently assumes that an increase of carbon sequestration in the miombo
area of a tenth of percent (or 0.15 tons per ha) over the life of the Project would yield 4.5 million tons of
carbon, which at a value of US$5 per ton would have a value of US$22.5 million.
8.     The actual impact of the Project is not on the total 30 million ha of miombo, but it is fair to
assume that the Project has had some impact on the 4.1 million ha of participatory managed forests
(CBFM plus JFM). It is also fair to assume that in the participatory managed forests the actual increase of
woody biomass per ha has been higher than 0.15 tons of carbon per ha (and not just due to reduced fire
frequency). If we assume this increase to be 0.5 tons of carbon per ha per year, the total amount of carbon
sequestered over 4.1 million ha of forest and woodland would amount to 2.0 million tons per year. With a
value of approximately US$10 per ton, this amounts to a total value of US$20 million per year.
9.      It should be noted, however, that the extra carbon sequestered on the 4.1 million ha of
participatory managed forest is at least partly offset by the likely increased harvesting from other forest
areas by those who were earlier harvesting in an unregulated way in the now managed forest areas. In
addition, TFCMP can only partially claim credit for this 4.1 million ha of participatory managed forests,
other stakeholders include for instance the DANIDA and MFA Finland supported forestry and natural
resource management Projects. Assuming that 50% of the additional carbon sequestered is offset by
increased harvesting elsewhere, and that no more than 25% of the remaining additional carbon
sequestered can somehow be attributed to TFCMP, the value of additional carbon sequestered thanks to
TFCMP would be 20*0.5*0.25= US$2.5 million per year.
10.     Assuming a current average stocking of 150 tons of carbon per ha and an average potential
stocking of 250 tons of carbon per ha, the 4.1 million ha of participatory managed forests include a
current total of 615 m tons of carbon with a value of approximately US$6 billion. The potential at full
stocking would amount to 1 billion tons of carbon with a value of US$10 billion.
11.     Benefits from industrial plantation production. The PAD includes six pages of economic
considerations in relation to industrial plantation production, elaborating on elements such as domestic
demand for sawn timber and pulpwood, international markets for softwoods and teak, the potential value
of the Sao Hill Plantations, financial benefits of private sector involvement and benefits from improved
management.
12.      It was noted that Southern Paper Mills in Mufindi had been closed since 1997, leaving the
considerable pulpwood resources of the nearby Sao Hill Plantations unutilized, thereby endangering its
viability. Scenarios were presented to value the Sao Hill Plantations depending on whether the mills
would be operational or not. In the best scenario, the maximum capacity of the mills is 315,000 m3 over
bark, the related pulpwood price was supposed to be US$14 per m3, and the value of Sao Hill Plantation
would then amount to US$12.5 million. In the second best scenario (no large paper mill) this value would
be only US$2.5 million. It was argued that it would be essential to transfer state plantations under private
sector management. The expected improved management, combined with improved pricing (marketing)
systems would then result in substantial benefits.
13.     During the Project, several factors played an important role in reviving the industrial forest
plantation sub-sector. First, the Ministry of Finance agreed that a major share of revenues generated from
government owned plantations could be retained for the management of these plantations. Second,
Government stopped exports of timber logs, now only sawn timber can be exported. Third, plantation
inventories (80,000 ha) under TFCMP provided plantation managers with the required information to
improve plantation management. These three factors combined helped revive and improve FBD
management of government owned plantations. Fourth, the Southern Paper Mills reopened, and are now
harvesting 200,000 m3 of pulpwood in the Sao Hill Plantations; while a series of small scale sawmills
have sprung up for instance around the Longuza Teak Plantations. Finally, private sector involvement in
plantation management (including communities) was accepted and some 16,563 ha of government forest
plantations are now under some form of private sector management regime.
14.     It still remains difficult to put figures to the value created as a result of TFCMP. It is for instance
questionable that the Southern Paper Mills would have been able to reopen and obtain harvesting
concessions in the absence of TFCMP. It is estimated that improved plantation management would
increase annual average annual harvest values by US$32 per ha. If we assume that a total of 80,000 ha of
industrial forest plantations is now better managed, the additional annual value created would be US$2.5
million, of which US$0.5 million would be generated in the area managed by the private sector and
US$2.0 million in the area managed by FBD.
15.     Fiscal revenue collection in relation to FBD expenditures and budget allocation. The PAD noted
that public funding for the forestry sector was generally inadequate, irregular, and supplemented by donor
funding. Improvements in the framework for royalty collection were expected to strengthen the overall
financial sustainability of the Tanzania Forest Service.
16.      The collection of forest revenues increased much during the Project and much of this increase is
due to the Project. The PAD mentions that in 1999/2000 revenues from Central Government Forest
Reserves (including plantations) totaled roughly TShs. 2 billion. In 2008/09 this had increased to TShs24
billion.
17.     The increase in forest revenues has been so significant that they now are of the same magnitude
as the FBD overall funding requirements. This means that if TFS had indeed been established earlier in
the Project and if it were fully operational with the TFCMP assistance on offer, chances are that it would
have been financially viable.
18.     Overall economic and financial benefits resulting from TFCMP. The above calculations are
indicative yet incomplete, they do not for instance include expected benefits from sub-component 1.5 on
sustainable wood fuel utilization. However, the calculated direct and indirect economic and financial
benefits amount to a total of US$13.7 million per year (see Table 1). This without counting the annual
US$52.2 million benefits of TASAF forestry sub-Projects and the US$53.5 million biodiversity value,
because it could be argued that these benefits largely existed already.
                    Table 1. Economic and financial benefits attributed to TFCMP
                 Description                         US$ million/yr
             Watershed services                       1.1
            Carbon sequestration                      2.5
       Industrial plantation production               2.5
              Forestry royalties                      7.6
                   TOTAL                             13.7

19.       TFCMP made a considerable difference in the forestry sector, though the institutional reform did
not in the end result in an established, operational, functioning and financially sustainable TFS, though all
necessary elements seem to have been put in place with some considerable results. However, the non-
establishment of TFS weighs heavy, and is an important factor in rating Borrower performance as
Moderately Unsatisfactory. Similarly, Bank supervision was insufficient during the early years of the
Project, and, in later years, could not catch up with these early omissions. Both Borrower and Bank
performance, therefore, had a negative impact on Project efficiency. Project efficiency could have been
much improved had Bank and Borrower been more consistent in the support provided to TFCMP from
start to finish.

Annex 5. Detailed Description of PDO, GEO and KPIs


                              A. Detailed Description of PDO and KPIs

Original PDO and KPIs
The original PDO in both TFCMP- and EAFCMP-PADs was "to assist Government in policy
implementation, in particular by developing a framework for the long-term sustainable management and
conservation of Tanzania's forest resources, strengthening the role of individuals, communities, villages,
and the private sector in management and conservation of forests, and implementing this framework on a
pilot scale." This PDO was never revised.
Both PADs each contain two different sets of KPIs. The first set is included in the PAD Main Text,
section A.2/3 "Key performance indicators"; the second set is included in PAD Annex 1 "Project Design
Summary". All different sets of KPIs as included in the TFCMP- and EAFMCP-PADs are included
below. The internal inconsistencies in the TFCMP-PAD have led to misinterpretation at later stages.
(i)     According to TFCMP-PAD Main Text section A.3 "Key performance indicators", the Project was
        to be considered successful if:
        (a)     A functioning TFS is established with clearly defined service delivery functions and
                responsibilities with regard to natural forests, woodlands, and industrial plantations.
        (b)     Significant areas of natural forests and woodlands are under effective management as an
                outcome of partnerships and initiatives with multiple partners (primarily communities
                and local governments).
        (c)     A range of mechanisms for improving revenue collection involving partners such as the
                Tanzania Revenue Authority and/or private sector are tested and implemented; time-
                bound forest revenue collection targets are established and achieved; and effective
                mechanisms for sharing revenues with villages are put in place.
        (d)     A framework for private sector participation in the management of industrial plantations
                is established, including guidelines, incentives, and regulatory, monitoring and control
                mechanisms; 3 pilot operations are in place and have been evaluated.
        (e)     An institutional framework consistent with overall civil service reforms is in place which
                enables Government to undertake forest biodiversity conservation initiatives, in particular
                in the Eastern Arc Mountains; institutional capacity to do so is strengthened.
        (f)     The modalities for the establishment of a sustainable financial mechanism for
                conservation of the Eastern Arc Mountain forests are developed and implemented.
(i)     The EAFCMP-PAD Main Text section A.2 "Key performance indicators" includes one additional
        KPI:
        (g)   The endowment has been capitalized and the Eastern Arc Mountains Conservation
              Endowment Fund is implementing the proposed conservation program.
(iii)   According to both TFCMP- and EAFMCP-PADs Annex 1 "Project Design Summary" the KPIs
        (or Outcome/Impact indicators) related to the PDO included:
        (a)     Forest and woodland cover is brought under effective management by communities and
                individuals in Project areas.
        (b)     Private sector is involved in plantation management.
        (c)     Mechanisms for forest biodiversity conservation are more fully established.
PDO and KPIs in the Development Credit Agreement (DCA). The IDA Development Credit
Agreement (DCA) dated March 13, 2002, retains the PDO and KPIs as included in the Main Text of the
TFCMP-PAD. Normally the CDA would have retained the KPIs as included in the "Project Design
Summary" (the equivalent of the "Results Framework") of PAD Annex 1.
Revised KPIs following the 2006 restructuring
The June 2006 restructuring proposal did not propose to change the KPIs, the TFCMP Task Team
assumed the KPIs to be those included in Annex 1 of the PAD. However, the July 2006 First Amendment
to the DCA did revise the KPIs:
(i)     According to the June 2006 TFCMP restructuring proposal the KPIs related to the PDO included:
        (a)    Forest and woodland cover is brought under effective management by communities and
               individuals in Project areas.
        (b)    Private sector is involved in plantation management.
        (c)    Mechanisms for forest biodiversity conservation are more fully established.
(ii)    According to the July 2006 First Amendment to the DCA the revised KPIs included:
        (a)    A functioning TFS is established with clearly defined service delivery functions and
               responsibilities with regard to natural forests, woodlands, and industrial plantations.
        (b)    Significant areas of natural forests and woodlands are under effective management as an
               outcome of partnerships and initiatives with multiple partners (primarily communities
               and local governments).
        (c)    A range of mechanisms for improving revenue collection involving partners such as the
               Tanzania Revenue Authority and/or private sector are tested and implemented; time-
               bound forest revenue collection targets are established and achieved; and effective
               mechanisms for sharing revenues with villages are put in place.
        (d)    A framework for private sector participation in the management of industrial plantations
               is established, including guidelines, incentives, and regulatory, monitoring and control
               mechanisms; 3 pilot operations are in place and have been evaluated.
        (e)    An institutional framework consistent with overall civil service reforms is in place that
               enables Government to undertake forest biodiversity conservation initiatives, in particular
               in the Eastern Arc Mountains; institutional capacity to do so is strengthened.
        (f)    The modalities for the establishment of a sustainable financial mechanism for
               conservation of the Eastern Arc Mountain forests are developed and implemented.
        (g)    Increased area under sustainable forest management, providing multiple benefits to
               forest adjacent communities in the long term.

Revised KPIs following the 2007 restructuring
The June 2007 restructuring Project Paper proposed relatively small changes (precisions) to the KPIs, the
TFCMP Task Team assumed the KPIs to be those included in Annex 1 of the PAD. However, the August
2007 Second Amendment to the DCA included different changes to the KPIs than proposed, and further
increased the divergence between the Results Framework and Results Monitoring Matrix as used by the
TFCMP Task team and the KPIs as included in the DCA:
(i)     According to the June 2007 TFCMP restructuring Project Paper the revised KPIs related to the
        PDO included:
        (a)    Area of forest on Tanzania Mainland managed according to approved forest management
               plans (including Community Based Forest Management (CBFM) and Joint Forest
               Management (JFM) Agreements).
        (b)    Areas of forest plantations under private management agreements (concessions, co-
               management, or communities designated).
        (c)    Mechanisms for forest biodiversity conservation are more fully established (Areas of
               Forest Reserves Mountains managed according to IUCN Codes).
(ii)      According to the August 2007 Second Amendment to the DCA the revised KPIs included an ever
          increasing list:
          (a)     A functioning TFS is established with clearly defined service delivery functions and
                  responsibilities with regard to natural forests, woodlands, and industrial plantations.
          (b)     Significant areas of natural forests and woodlands are under effective management as an
                  outcome of partnerships and initiatives with multiple partners (primarily communities
                  and local governments).
          (c)     A range of mechanisms for improving revenue collection involving partners such as the
                  Tanzania Revenue Authority and/or private sector are tested and implemented; time-
                  bound forest revenue collection targets are established and achieved; and effective
                  mechanisms for sharing revenues with villages are put in place.
          (d)     A framework for private sector participation in the management of industrial plantations
                  is established, including guidelines, incentives, and regulatory, monitoring and control
                  mechanisms; 3 pilot operations are in place and have been evaluated.
          (e)     An institutional framework consistent with overall civil service reforms is in place which
                  enables Government to undertake forest biodiversity conservation initiatives, in particular
                  in the Eastern Arc Mountains; institutional capacity to do so is strengthened.
          (f)     The modalities for the establishment of a sustainable financial mechanism for
                  conservation of the Eastern Arc Mountain forests are developed and implemented.
          (g)     Increased area under sustainable forest management, providing multiple benefits to forest
                  adjacent communities in the long term.
          (h)     A national forest assessment is carried out in at least 50% of the Borrower's mainland
                  territory (by December 31, 2009).
          (i)     About 4000 hectares of forest land is set aside and sustainably managed for charcoal
                  production (by June 30, 2009).
          (j)     About 5,350 square kilometers of forests is maintained under protection status and
                  management effectiveness is monitored regularly (by June 30, 2008).

                                 B. Detailed Description of GEO and KPIs
The GEOs in the PADs. The PADs contain three different versions of GEOs, the first version is included
TFCMP-PAD Main Text section A.2 "Global Objective", but it has been removed from the EFCMP-
PAD; the second version is included in both PADs under section C.1 "Project Components"; and the third
version is included in Annex 1 "Project Design Summary" of both PADs. For the sake of completeness
all three versions are included here:
(i)         According to TFCMP-PAD Main Text section A.1, the GEOs were to:
          i.       Develop and begin to implement an integrated biodiversity conservation strategy for the
                   Eastern Arc Mountains (which account for 40 percent of Tanzania's remaining tropical
                   high forest cover), which will, in turn, strengthen Tanzania's capacity to coordinate and
                   lead forest biodiversity conservation interventions.
         ii.       Support an integrated community-based pilot intervention in a priority conservation area
                   to achieve sustainable impact related to both biodiversity and human development.
        iii.       Improve the institutional mechanisms and capacity to undertake forest biodiversity
                   conservation;
        iv.        Develop, and implement on a pilot basis, a sustainable financing mechanism for
                   conservation activities in the Eastern Arc forests.
(ii)      According to both PADs Main Text section C.1 the GEO was to promote the sustainable
          conservation and management of the Eastern Arc forests.
(iii)     According to both PADs Annex 1 the GEOs were:
          (a)    Promoting in-situ use mechanisms for biodiversity conservation.

GEOs in the GEF Trust Fund Grant Agreement (TFGA). According to the GEF-TFGA, the objective
of the Project is to assist the Recipient within the Forest Conservation and Management Project, to
promote sustainable conservation and management of the biological biodiversity and ecosystems of the
Eastern Arc Mountains Forests through, inter alia, strengthened institutional capacity, pilot community-
based conservation and development and implementation of participatory forest conservation strategies.
KPIs for the GEOs: The PADs also contains different sets of KPIs for the GEOs. The first set is
included in the Main Text, section A.2/3 "Key performance indicators" (see paragraph above on KPIs in
the PAD); the second set is included in Annex 1 "Project Design Summary". However, the GEF-TFGA
includes only one KPI. For the sake of completeness, the three different sets of KPIs are included here:
(i)     The relevant KPIs included in the GEF-PAD Main Text section A.2 are:
        (a)     An institutional framework consistent with overall civil service reforms is in place that
                enables Government to undertake forest biodiversity conservation initiatives, in particular
                in the Eastern Arc Mountains; institutional capacity to do so is strengthened.
        (b)     The modalities for the establishment of a sustainable financial mechanism for
                conservation of the Eastern Arc Mountain forests are developed and implemented.
        (c)     The endowment has been capitalized and the Eastern Arc Mountains Conservation
                Endowment Fund (EACMEF) is implementing the proposed conservation program.
(ii)    According to both PADs Annex 1 the KPIs related to the GEO included:
        (a)    Extent of forests brought under community-based conservation.
        (b)    Forest cover loss is slowed.
        (c)    Conservation measures are financially sustainable.
(iii)   According to the TFGA there is only one KPI related to the GEO: The Endowment Fund has
        been capitalized and the EAMCEF is implementing the proposed conservation program by
        December 31, 2006.

                           Detailed Description of Project Components

           A. Original Project Components and Sub-Components according to the PAD
Component One: Supporting institutional change and improving delivery service, was to assist GOT
with the design and establishment of the Tanzania Forest Service (TFS), as a specialized 'executive
agency' as defined by the Executive Agencies Act (1997), and consistent with the wider and on-going
national program of civil service reform. It was envisaged that the TFS would, among other things, have
responsibility for bringing about improvements in the protection and management of natural forests and
the development and management of industrial plantations (including promoting private sector
involvement). The concept was that an agency with a national mandate would eventually be established.
Technical assistance would be provided to work with FBD and the Civil Service Department (CSD) and
other relevant government agencies to design the structure and functions of the agency and to draw up the
necessary implementation plans and guidelines for establishment of the agency, including the formulation
of business and staff recruitment plans. This component would also provide support to build on
experience from previous operations, and upon the opportunities posed by the new Forest Policy, and
planned legislation. The component would have three sub-components:
Sub-Component 1.1: Establishment of the TFS, focusing on the phased-in introduction of the new
      executive agency, with clearly defined roles, functions, performance standards, and monitoring.
      This sub-component would provide resources to manage the change process, to strengthen the
      capacity for administration and management, to rationalize and to strengthen the capacity for
      tasks related to policy, planning, and legislation (which would remain with the Ministry), and
      would support a badly-needed program of investments in infrastructure, including headquarter
      and field facilities for the TFS.
Sub-component 1.2: Improving service-delivery mechanisms for participatory forest and woodland
       management, in particular, support for the establishment of Village Forest Reserves, woodland
       management by individuals and communities and Joint Forest Management, building on
       experiences piloted in earlier operations. This sub-component, which would focus on facilitating
       the expansion of community based forest management activities, was envisaged to be supported
       by the Government of Denmark.
Sub-component 1.3: Improving revenue collection from forests and woodlands, to meet the dual
       objectives of improving the capacity of the TFS to become self-financing, and of ensuring that
       revenues are reinvested in forest protection and management at the local level. This component
       would develop alternative revenue collection mechanisms, and monitoring systems to improve
       rates of collection.
Component Two: Private sector involvement in the management of industrial plantations, would
provide resources to develop and implement a framework for the involvement of the private sector in the
management of existing industrial plantations as well as to strengthen the potential for the development
and management of new plantations. This would include an analysis of the technical and financial
feasibility of the industrial plantations with reference to existing and potential markets, as well as, the
formulation of steps and guidelines for the private sector's involvement. Multiple mechanisms for the
involvement of the private sector would be developed and implemented on a pilot basis, and were
expected to include leasing or concession arrangements, joint forest management, and co-management.
Consistent with policy, the objective was eventually to introduce fully commercial plantation
management, building on information and experience gained through Project activities. There were four
sub-components:
Sub-component 2.1: Improving the plantation resource information base and management planning
       capacity would provide resources to develop the information needed to allow for the
        identification and selection of priority sites and for designing pilot activities. It would finance
        aerial photography, interpretation, mapping, and indicative inventories of around 40,000 ha of
        state-owned plantations; a rapid socio-economic assessment which identifies key stakeholders,
        their concerns, and expectations and any mitigating steps which might be needed; the
        development of a plantation database for management purposes; preparation of basic guidelines
        to assist plantation management and to establish parameters for monitoring commercial plantation
        operations; preparation of basic growth and yield tables for key species relying on existing data;
        preliminary estimates of growing stock and allowable cut; and capacity building of staff in
        selected areas.
Sub-component 2.2: Strengthening institutional support services for private sector involvement would
       support the creation of an enabling institutional and market environment for private sector
       involvement in plantation development and management. It would provide resources for the
       design and implementation of a communication strategy; the development of an action plan with
       clear principles and objectives for private sector involvement; strengthening the capacity within
       MRNT or within the planned forest agency to handle PSI; the development of legal procedures
       and instruments for tendering to ensure transparency and consistency with GOT guidelines and
       with social and environmental safeguards; the preparation of model information memoranda,
       leases, model contracts, and transparent bidding assessment procedures, as well as community
       and environmental action plans where they are needed; prepare recommendations on an improved
       log sales system; an action plant for improving forestry taxation and the investment environment
       for plantation forestry; and study tours and staff training to increase an understanding of the
       principles surrounding private sector involvement.
Sub-component 2.3: Pilot alternative management of selected industrial plantations. Three pilot activities were
       envisaged: (a) the development of leasing or concession arrangements for involving the private
       sector in plantation management; (b) the development of co-management arrangements where
       responsibility for plantation management is shared between GOT and a partner (for example, a
       village or a company); and (c) designated community management for a plantation area where
       responsibilities and control are assumed by a village. The Project would provide resources to
       establish boundaries of each pilot area, to carry out rapid inventories or aerial surveys as needed,
       to prepare legal documentation as needed, and to carry out stakeholder surveys and assessments
       where communities would be involved or otherwise affected by the program.
Sub-component 2.4: Monitoring and evaluation. The Project would place a strong emphasis on the
monitoring and evaluation (M&E) of performance under the pilot operations. It would provide resources
to establish a mechanism for M&E; to determine performance indicators for the pilot operations; to
implement a regular monitoring process which reports against quantitative and qualitative performance
indicators; and to provide feedback to MNRT to modify mechanisms and procedures on the basis of
results from the pilot operations.
Component Three: Eastern Arc forests conservation and management, which was largely to be
financed by GEF. The GEF-financed elements of this component were separately appraised. The
component would support institutional reform, strategy development, pilot community-based
conservation, and the development of sustainable financing for tropical high forest conservation in
Tanzania. The component had four sub-components:
Subcomponent 3.1: Institutional reforms for forest biodiversity conservation, in particular of the Eastern
      Arc forests at central, district and local partnership levels to incorporate specific responsibilities
      for biodiversity conservation, oversight, monitoring and coordination. Such reforms would be
      linked with other reforms and institutional restructuring proposed for the forestry sector as a
      whole, which were to be financed by IDA. The GEF implementing agency for this sub-
      component would be the Bank;
Sub-component 3.2: Mechanisms for sustainable financing of biodiversity conservation, would be
       developed including the establishment of the Eastern Arc Mountains Conservation Endowment
       Fund (EAMCEF). It was envisaged that a pilot endowment trust fund would be established by the
       Project with GEF resources. The EAMCEF's initial operations and programs would be co-
       financed by IDA. The GEF implementing agency for this sub-component would be the Bank.
Two additional sub-components to be implemented by the UNDP were complementary to the Bank-
implemented activities, and are not formally reported upon in this report:
Subcomponent 3.3: Development and preparation of an integrated Conservation Strategy for the Eastern
      Arc Mountain Forests using a broad-based participatory process, with a focus on institutional
      capacity building, and which considers links to other sectoral activities, such as agriculture,
      water, land, and energy. A wider dialogue on the impacts of sectoral activities on forest
      biodiversity conservation in the Eastern Arc would be developed amongst the key institutions
      involved in sectoral activities. Mapping and baseline activities would be undertaken as part of the
      Strategy development, and would include an assessment of the multiple tenure regimes found in
      the forests of the Arc. The GEF implementing agency for this sub-component would be UNDP.
Sub-component 3.4: A forest conservation intervention through government and community partnership
       initiatives which would be undertaken at priority sites in the Uluguru Mountains ­ one of the
       most important mountain forest blocks in the Arc. Firm linkages would be established with
       partners (other donors, NGOs, Community-based organizations, government agencies, etc.) The
       GEF implementing agency for this sub-component would be UNDP.
Component Four: Project administration and management. The Project would finance the costs of
administration and management of the Project components, in a manner consistent with World Bank
guidance with respect to accounting, financial management, and procurement. This fourth component was
not included in the DCA.

           B. Original Project Components and Sub-Components according to the DCA
The DCA describes a Project with three instead of four components; it does not include a component four
Project Administration and Management. It also changed the sequence of sub-components under
component one (i.e. 1.2 became 1.3 and vise versa); and it excluded sub-components 3.3 and 3.4, since
these were to be implemented by the UNDP.

        C. Revised Project Components according to the June 2006 Restructuring Proposal
The June 2006 restructuring proposal did not include any changes to the structure of components and sub-
components. It proposed to open a window (through TASAF) for financing of community-based forest
management under the sub-component 1.2 improving service-delivery mechanisms for participatory
forest and woodland management.

       D. Revised Project Components according to July 2006 First Amendment to the DCA
The July 2006 First Amendment to the DCA altered and reduced the contents of sub-component 1.3
(equivalent to sub-component 1.2 in the PAD); and created a new fourth Project component:
Revised sub-component 1.3: Improving service-delivery mechanisms for participatory forest and
       woodland management, including facilitating networking and information sharing, and
       monitoring activities, through the provision of technical advisory services, training, goods,
       acquisition of goods and equipment.
New Component Four: Supporting community-based management of forests and woodland to
accommodate sub-Projects financed through TASAF.
     E. Revised Project Components according to the June 2007 Restructuring Project Paper
The 2007 Restructuring Paper introduced Intermediate Outcome Indicators (IOIs) at the sub-component
level. The differences with the original components as in the PAD are indicated in italics.

                                                Annex 7:
          Conclusions of the Verification of the Derema Corridor RAP (May 2009)
                                and subsequent GOT action

·   The RAP has been integrated into the Muheza District Development Plan and its delivery is,
    therefore, now part of the responsibility of the Local Administration beyond the project life.
·   The RAP document was translated into Swahili, intensively discussed by the Project Affected People
    (PAPs) before acceptance and the approval process documented.
·   The cash compensation to the PAPs has been duly paid out in compliance with the World Bank's
    safeguards policies.
·   The grievance settling mechanism was easily accessible. As a result of the thorough crop counting
    process, few complaints were received and they were settled amicably.
·   Delays in procuring important equipment (e.g. vehicle and motorcycles) led to higher operational cost
    in implementing the RAP.
·   The implementation of the RAP had been done in a piece-meal manner, focusing initially on cash
    compensation, while other important activities, such as income and livelihood restoration and M&E
    have been carried on afterwards.
·   Land compensation to the PAPs, which has been an integrated part of the RAP, had not been
    finalized, by the time of verification. Since May 2009, the following progress has been made:
    o About 921 hectares of farmland in the low lands (formerly owned by the defunct Tanzania Sisal
        Authority) have been surveyed and demarcated by the Ministry of Lands and Human Settlements
        Development (MoLHSD) facilitated by the RAP Coordinator, local authority and regional
        leadership.
    o The District Executive Director officially requested the Commissioner of Lands to revoke the
        Right of Occupancy of the land in question. This is a necessary step to allow the allocation of
        land to the affected farmers.
    o Until the land will be distributed to the affected farmers, the Forest and Beekeeping Division has
        assigned one senior staff at Muheza District to work with the affected farmers, district, provincial
        and national level institutions, including the local Member of Parliament, to finalize the land
        compensation. This has facilitated continuous follow up with the MoLHSD and the Ministry of
        Finance and Economic Affairs.
    o During a meeting with affected farmers in late March 2010 the Board of the Consolidated
        Holding Corporation (successor of the former Parastatal Sector Reform Commission - in charge
        of administering former state holdings), recommended that the ownership of the farm should be
        revoked by the President and distributed to the affected farmers as stipulated in the RAP. The
        necessary follow-up is currently undertaken by the local MP through the Commissioner for Land
        at the Ministry for Lands, Housing and Human Settlements.
    o Considering the fact that all relevant parties are now in agreement to allocate the land to the
        affected farmers, the final decision lies now with the President as the sole authority on land
        issues. While this process might be lengthy, there is an expectation that the issue can be solved in
        due time.
·   While the Monitoring and Evaluation component of RAP implementation had not yet been conducted
    by the time of RAP verification, this activity has been carried out subsequently through WWF, with a
    final report delivered by the time of project closure. The report confirms (i) the implementation of
    activities for restitution of income capacities and living standards; (ii) ongoing efforts to settle the
    land allocation as well as (iii) that neither OP 4.10 (Indigenous Peoples) and OP 4.11 (Physical
    Cultural Resources) were triggered.
·   The Derema corridor boundary demarcation has been effected and the gazettement of the Derema
    Corridor as a forest reserve is in its final stages.
·   The preparation of forest management plans has started involving PAPs to ensure the provision of
    access and benefit sharing mechanisms. This will take into consideration the demand of PAPs for the
    implementation of income generating activities, which has been wrongly considered part of the RAP.
·   While boundaries for the forest have been demarcated and the majority of people have abstained from
    returning to the former forest farms, the development and implementation of the management plan is
    critical to ensure that the forest area is conserved. Providing opportunities to benefit from and actively
    engage in the protection of the forest, will aid all parties in the long term.
              Annex 8. Summary of Borrower's ICR and Comments on Draft ICR
                                         A. Summary of Borrower's ICR
The Borrower has prepared a detailed ICR using the Bank's template, which is available in the project
files. The following summarizes the main findings and assessment of that ICR:


Assessment of the achievement of Project Development Objectives, Outputs and Outcomes

Rationale for Achievement Rating
The project was implemented since July 2002. It faced many implementation problems. The speed of
implementation was very slow initially (2002 ­ 2004)
Based on the achievements made the project, its Overall implementation performance was rated
"Satisfactory"
Factors that have positively contributed to project implementation included:
· The commitment of FBD-TFCMP team and the TFCMP-Task Team to see the success even in the
    face of constraints and challenges;
· Improved supervision and Task Team competence including the appointment of a forester as a TTL in
    2005;
·       The reviews which were carried out and use of the feedback to steer the Restructuring exercises
·       Joint Development Partner (Denmark, Finland, and Norway) approach to participatory forest
    management;
·       The decision to incrementally refocus the project, revise indicators and reorganize activities had a
    positive impact on project implementation although perceived limitations of the approval processes
    limited a more comprehensive and holistic restructuring of the project;
·       Improvements later on in terms Financial management and accounting systems in particular with
    respect to World Bank and National Audit Office reporting requirements.
The implementation the project was negatively affected by5:
· Some components like the establishment of the TFS and private sector involvement in industrial
    forest plantations did not achieve the desired outputs. The project was over-dependent on the
    establishment of the TFS at the expense of other project activities and without taking into
    consideration the risk factors involved. There was weak commitment in the involvement of the
    private sector in forest plantation management;
· Inadequate project supervision due to frequent changes in leadership in the MNRT which affected
    continuity of operations and institutional memory on the project. There were also changes on the
    Bank's side too- TFCMP Task Team leader (TTL);
· Delays caused by other parties including; delays in expected DANIDA support for local level
    implementation of CBFM and the FAO/NAFORMA project.




5
  Moderately Satisfactory: Project achieved some of its major relevant objectives, and has achieved (or is expected to achieve)
some satisfactory development results. There were moderate shortcomings in achievement of its objectives.
Achievements of project objectives envisaged at planning stage including developmental
(Institutional Reform, Forest Conservation and Management) and harmonized national
management programs
· Despite the constraints during implementation, the project has achieved (in some areas even over-
    achieved) many of the anticipated intermediary outcome targets. For example PFM supported by the
    Bank and other Development Partners, has reached a total coverage of almost 15 % of the total forest
    area of the country.
· Instruments and tools to improve the enabling environment for sustainable forest management have
    been introduced and/or developed, including the Log Tracking, forest control and surveillance as well
    as the set up of the NAFOBEDA.
· The implementation of the NAFORMA had been delayed and therefore no direct support to the actual
    field work was provided. However, critical logistical ground works, Institutional arrangements and
    procurements have been realized under TFCMP, which will ensure that the field work starts in early
    2010 and beyond.
· Coordination and monitoring of revenue collection has been made possible because of the system
    which involves registration for dealing with forest produce, licensing, FSUs, checkpoints and use of
    Transit Passes. Compliance with the Forest Law and regulations has increased significantly as a result
    of TFCMP interventions as more people now have licenses allowing them to engage in timber
    business. This notwithstanding, illegal harvesting of forest products is still persistent owing to
    inadequate funds to sustain FSUs activities and absence of harvesting plans. Discussion with FSUs
    staff indicated that while the objective of forming FSUs was to curb illegal harvesting, large amounts
    of timber and charcoal impounded were wrongly recorded as achievement.

Achievement of expected project outputs and outcomes of each component based on the
performance indicators data, lessons learnt and synthesis reports.
Supporting Institutional Change and Improving Service Delivery
(a) Activities accomplished under the TFS sub-component have provided the basis for establishing the
    new executive agency. The Acting Chief Executive was appointed in November 2009.The TFS
    Framework Document (FD) (2006) and the TFS Strategic Plan (SP) 2010/2013 are being revised on
    the basis of the Executive Agencies Act Cap. 245 (Revised edition 2009). The next stage is for the FD
    and SP documents to be sent for approval by the Chief Secretary (CS) who is the Head of Public
    Service. The approval by the CS will pave the way for the signing of the establishment order by the
    Minister for Natural Resources and Tourism after which TFS will be launched. The launching will be
    followed by the reviewing of the TFS Business Plan 2010/2011. At this stage a substantive TFS Chief
    Executive Officer (CEO) will be recruited. All this will be completed in time so that the Strategic
    Plan is operationalized in the July 20010/June 2011 financial year.
(b) The technical document for the planned Forest Resources and Ecosystem Assessment prepared by
    FBD has been approved by FAO.
(c) A wood fuel strategy had been prepared and action plan was being implemented. This is expected to
    help FBD in advancing the agenda to address the "charcoal/wood fuel challenge", an important cause
    of deforestation and land degradation. However, it should be realized that the strategy was a
    nationwide effort and involves the Ministry of Energy (MoE) as the key player and other
    stakeholders.
Participatory Forest Management
With the funding available for the ring-fenced forest window under TASAF, local service providers have
been hired to assist communities in the formulation of "fundable" sub-projects. The forest area under
Community Based Management and Joint Forest Management has increased to more than 4.1 million
hectares in 67 Districts. With the funding available for the ring-fenced forest window under TASAF, and
the technical assistance of local service providers, a total 166 sub-projects have been funded, while
another 62 have been technically approved and are awaiting financing. In addition, there are 59 sub-
projects which have been "deferred" (returned for improvement and re-submission to the project deferred.
This was a result of efforts made by both FBD and TASAF staff (agreed upon in November 2008) to
increase the number of acceptable sub-projects, as that the project development progress was slow. The
total coverage of the program is now about 15% of the total forest area of the country, a target which far
exceeds the end of project goal.
Progress of the PFM program
The change of forest management paradigm under new forest policy and legislation has enabled local
communities to have more responsibility in forest management under PFM. Based on PFM goals, its
progress can be assessed with regard to:
1.       Improved forest quality and condition;
2.       Enhanced livelihoods; and
3.       Improved forestry governance.
Improved forest quality and condition
· The progress for this goal can best be measured through research, either by use of permanent forest
    sample plots established in the forest with baseline established before PFM, or through the use of
    successive aerial photos or satellite images. Unfortunately very little had been done on this. However,
    the Tanzania Forestry Research Institute (TAFORI) was spearheading a research component on PFM,
    and has over the past three years provided quantifiable evidence of forest recovery under various
    PFM governance models.
· Other useful ecological studies have been done by other research/ training institutions but it seems
    there is not much horizontal link among forest research centers in the country. Improved networking,
    e.g. formalized through an annual research seminar, would facilitate the establishment of
    comprehensive collection of literature on PFM with regard to forest quality and condition.
Enhanced livelihood
· Local livelihood enhancement is increased through forest revenues and secured supply of subsistence
    forest products. It was anticipated that launching of the NAFOBEDA during FY 2006/07 would have
    acquired information to track progress of this indicator but by the end of TFCMP national-level data
    had not yet been processed.
· The proportion of household subsistence and cash based income derived from harvesting, processing,
    marketing and sale of forest products was another outcome indicator under this goal. The target was
    that by 2010 at least 15% of household subsistence and cash income should be derived from forest
    products. This indicator was monitored under the household Budget Survey of the National Bureau of
    Statistics (NBS). No up-to-date data was available which showed the extent to which this had been
    achieved.
· Tree planting, though not systematically dealt with in PFM, was an important means of supporting
    the villagers. The districts often provided seedlings and advice to the communities on how and where
    to establish woodlots on village land. Since tree planting provided opportunities for community
    benefits, and also added to improvement of the environment, there was scope for including tree
    planting in the PFM guidelines as one of the important means within PFM for both compensating and
    adding to the livelihoods of the villages in question. The District Forest Officer (DFO) should
    therefore include such training in the PFM training programs.
Improved forestry governance at village and district levels
·   The institutional setting at village level was well set to accommodate good governance in PFM. Each
    village had a Village Environmental Committee. When PFM was introduced this committee either
    became the Village Natural Resources Committee (VNRC) or a new VNRC was set up. VNRC was
    responsible to arrange for law enforcement (e.g. patrolling) and progress reporting on natural
    resources management issues. The VNRC was answerable to the village government, which is an
    autonomous organ at village level. For monitoring and evaluation (M&E) purposes, the VNRC was
    responsible for collecting and summarizing all data and information and for submitting to the DFO
    who was answerable to the District Land, Natural Resource and Environment Office under the
    District Executive Director. Monitoring information is submitted directly to the MNRT from DFO
    whereas progress reports are submitted to PMO-RALG with copy to the MNRT. It, however,
    appeared that the `copying' procedure was a too loose link between the Local Government (PMO-
    RALG) and the line Ministry (MNRT), and this adversely affected effective accountability in forest
    governance.
·   The PFM guidelines had been prepared. A proposal on benefit sharing with regard to Joint Forest
    Management (JFM) was sent to the Ministry of Finance and Economic Affairs for approval but until
    the closure of the project the approval was yet to be granted. The proposal suggests a 60% benefit to
    the government and 40% to the other partner Taking into account The continuous delays on an
    acceptable sharing mechanism jeopardizes the achievements made so far and planned The sharing
    formula needs to be seen as a priority issue.

Improved Revenue Collection (IRC)
A performance review in 2006 of the IRC system in 25 districts and Mwanza and Dar es Salaam regions
was undertaken by INDUFOR/Ernst & Young. Revenue collection continued to be a serious problem for
FBD. The main constraints to improved revenue collection include: (i) inadequate human capacity in
revenue collection and law enforcement; (ii) lack of appropriate incentive structures; (iii) lack of clear
mechanism for sharing accrued revenue to the District; (iv) retention of resources at FBD.
A proposal to introduce a transport fee based system for charcoal and firewood had been developed and
was awaiting formal approval for implementation.
A contract to develop a log sales and pricing system was awarded and expected to provide guidance of
revamping price and royalty setting, which in the past had been done centrally with little regard to market
supply and demand.
FBD HQ had played its role in coordinating collection of central government revenue from the districts.
Collection performance for 2004/05, 2006.07 and 2007/08 were above estimates by 64.5%, 27.3% and
40% respectively. In the 2005/06 and 2008/09 financial years, collections were below estimates by 16%
and 34.5% respectively. Collections in the year 2008/09 were significantly less (by 34.5%) than the target
because harvesting and operations of forest based industries were closed for almost half of the year.
Coordination and monitoring of revenue collection has been made possible because of the system which
involves registration for dealing with forest produce, licensing, Forest Surveillance Units (FSUs),
checkpoints and use of Transit Passes. Compliance with the Forest Law and regulations was said to have
increased significantly as a result of TFCMP interventions as more people now had licenses allowing
them to engage in timber business. This notwithstanding, illegal harvesting of forests product was still
persistent owing to inadequate funds to sustain FSUs activities and absence of harvesting plans. Area
covered by a unit was way too big and could not be effectively be patrolled owing to the inadequate
funding and transport.
Eastern Arc Forests Conservation and Management
The major element of the component was the formation of an Endowment Fund. Increasing the capital of
the Fund has been identified as a priority for EAMCEF. The Endowment has realized a decline from a
high of USD7.7 million in September 2007 to a low of USD5.8 million in December 2008 due the world
financial crisis. The Fund has started to recover and has recorded USD 7.2 million in September 2009.
Efforts at specific fund raising opportunities have been mixed. The Trust successfully negotiated a
corporate partnership with Unilever PLC who has committed to contribute â250,000 into the endowment
through a specific window to support projects in the Mufindi Forest area. The Trust has also received a
positive response to proposals to the Norwegian Embassy to provide budgetary support to cover its
operations and grant program starting January 2010. Additionally, EAMCEF has secured commitment
from the GOT to be included in the MNRT Ministerial budget for three years beginning July 2010.
The proposal to launch a joint fund raising program through the Critical Ecosystems Partnership Fund
(CEPF) has not been successful. EAMCEF is also seeking to engage a professional fund raiser on a
commission basis to help raise funds. The mission recommends that EAMCEF concentrates all its efforts
on this key priority with special attention to bi-lateral donors who in the current economic climate may be
the most promising partners for additional funding. )
The four Key Performance Indicators for this component were achieved as shown in the following table:

Table 1: Status of Achievement of performance indicators for EAMCEF

After the closure of TFCMP on 31st December 2009, EAMCEF has been operating using proceeds from
the invested Endowment Capital. Assets procured under TFCMP (transport, some furniture, office
machines and equipment) have been transferred to EAMCEF to enable it to continue carrying out its
planned activities.
Secondly like when it was under TFCMP, EAMCEF will continue to enjoy VAT exemptions since it is a
not-for ­profit organization. The component has been able to establish operational structures,
arrangements as well as strong stakeholder commitment for the achievement of the Global Environmental
Objectives which are Institution reform for forest biodiversity conservation and Mechanism for
sustainable financing of biodiversity conservation.
There is a need to change the strategy to fund raising. It has been recommended that EAMCEF should
concentrate all its efforts on fund raising with special attention to bi-lateral donors who in the current
economic climate may be the most promising partners for additional funding.
The Fund should also ensure there is a forum for the Funds stakeholders to meet and share experiences.
Further the Fund should train and encourage village based proposals. Projects based on such proposals
will not only be more efficient, effective and sustainable but also cheap as there will be savings on fuel
that could have been used by a proposal writer from outside the village
Derema Corridor Biodiversity Conservation
The Implementation of the Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) for the Derema Corridor is almost complete.
Most of key activities (Implemented through WWF such as RAP have been completed (the title of the
report provided in Reference list). The cash compensation part of the RAP has been successfully
completed, with 100% of the payments disbursed. WWF was contracted to undertake a Participatory
M&E for the RAP and have submitted a final report. Land compensation to Project Affected Persons
under RAP for the Derema Corridor is yet to be finalized although some significant progress on the issue
has been made. About 921 ha of farmland in the low lands have been surveyed and demarcated by the
Ministry of Lands and Human Settlements Development thanks to the efforts of the RAP Coordinator, the
local authorities and the regional leadership. This land (formerly owned by the defunct Tanzania Sisal
Authority) has not yet been allocated to the PAPs. The District Executive Director for Muheza has sent a
letter to the Commissioner of Lands in the Ministry of Lands, Housing and Human Settlements
Development proposing revocation of right of Occupancy of the land in question.
The MP for Muheza, WWF and MNRT's RAP coordinator joined forces to finalize the land
compensation issue. They took the issue with the Ministry of Lands, Housing and Human Settlements
Development and the Ministry of Finance and Economic Affairs so that the land compensation part of
RAP would be concluded by December 2009. However until the closure of the project (31st December
2009) the land allocation to the PAPs was not yet concluded.
Monitoring and Evaluation
A Results Framework (RF) with clear measurable indicators was developed much later during the project
implementation. It is also aligned with the approved National Forestry and Beekeeping Database
(NAFOBEDA).
Updating the RF has not been done routinely to ensure that the project has sufficient data as evidence for
the achievements of the project against its PDO.
NAFOBEDA is now in place, but not yet operational at all levels of FBD. This is supposed to work at
local government level also. A total of 300 employees from both central and 67 district councils and
plantations have been trained in the use of NAFOBEDA system. In addition the project has also trained a
number of NGOs and private sector. What needs to be done now is to update the system, retrain the users
and deal with the virus that had proved a serious problem With respect to the list of indicators, which can
be generated by NAFOBEDA, the majority of performance indicators (including those being tracked
under this project) are not yet entered into NAFOBEDA and therefore not available electronically.
Currently only data from PFM is being entered.
FBD needs to make NAFOBEDA functional at all levels by (i) improving capacity to maintain the
database, (ii) entering readily available data (with the help of an IT capable staff) and (iii) assign
additional staff to enter existing data and update the database at least twice a year (iv) monitoring and
evaluations This would ensure that all data collected by FBD is kept in a central location, is analyzed and
used for policy making decisions. Moreover, once updated and maintained NAFOBEDA should be linked
to the NBS thus making the database available and accessible to the general public.

Private Sector Involvement (PSI)
National Plantation Forest Reserves' inventory which covered 80,000 ha was completed in December
2008. This created a useful Plantation Information Resource base and an inventory system to save as a
baseline for future resources assessment under NAFORMA. Management Plans for all 15 government
plantation forest reserves have also been updated providing the critical basis for the involvement of the
private sector in the management of public forest plantations and a sound economic base to kick start the
TFS. The progress on this component with respect to Management Concessions and Public Private
Partnership had been stalled by the delay in putting in place a National Forestry Advisory Committee
(NaFAC) which is legally charged with the role of advising on the issuance of the concessions and Joint
Management Agreements. Members to the NaFAC have recently (November 2009) been appointed which
was a step towards instituting PSI in management of State owned Plantation Forests.
 There is high enthusiasm among local stakeholders and they seem to be possessive as they do not want
 the plantations they depended on to fall into hands that would jeopardize their livelihoods. In Sao Hill the
 small dealers feared that they might miss out in the privatization process in favor of the big dealers. In
 Kiwira plantation the local NGOs and dealers should be given priority in the joint management venture.
 There is good progress in planning and management with TFCMP support in the Sao Hill and Kiwira
Plantations, despite existing constraints, such as lack of market based pricing and marketing mechanisms
as well as access to quality seeds, to improve and diversify the current stock.
The project made some progress in involving the private sector, for example for the Kiwira plantation a
memorandum of understanding has been established to facilitated the participation of the surrounding
communities. These communities are quite enthusiastic and they already engage in the opportunities for
community plantation management (through tending operations, fire fighting, fire patrols, thinning etc.).
However there was a risk that the current achievements might not be sustainable if the management
contract agreements with the government which spells out the benefits accruing to the communities
continue to be delayed. The trust and enthusiasm among the private sector operators as waning and this
was detrimental to efforts to involve the Private sector in Management and development of public forest
plantations.

Assessment of impact of project intervention on the national and local institutional development
The project had institutional change as its major focus in the original project design. It should have started
with the establishment and strengthening of TFS. The realization of this became problematic and despite
promises official inauguration continued to be elusive time and again. The focus then shifted to actual
management and conservation of Tanzania's forests hence the 2007 restructuring Project Paper stipulates
that to deliver on improving enabling environment for sector Reform through strengthening existing and
promoting new tools for sustainable forest management.
    · The support to and formation of JFM and CBFM.
    · Involvement of the Private sector and the community in public plantation forest management.
    · Formation of village land forest Reserves through TASAF
    · Preparation of a series of manuals and guidelines (including management plans)
    · The establishment of the EAMCEF for the management and conservation of the Eastern Arc
         Mountains.
    · The project also leaves behind an important institutional landmark in the Mpingo house which
         was supposed to house TFS but is now occupied by MNRT with promises that it will be
         relinquished to the former upon its official inauguration. In addition there was the DEREMA
         corridor RAP which the project took over upon request by the government
    · In their review of the impacts of PFM in the Eastern Arc Mountains forests of eastern Tanzania,
         Vyamana et al., (2008) established that by laws established for JFM in Change village, Morogoro
         district appear to have been applied within the forest area under joint management but no similar
         management practices were introduced into other forests on village land. The net result of this is
         simply a displacement of harvesting from one area of forest to another.
The establishment of the TFS was a central element of the project design. Unfortunately the establishment
of TFS was much delayed and became increasingly uncertain. The delay and uncertainty prompted a
refocus in 2007 on "to deliver on improving enabling environment for sector reform through
strengthening existing and promoting new tools for sustainable forest management". The "new tools for
sustainable forest management" referred to CBFM and JFM of natural forests and woodlands; while in
relation to plantation forest management the original focus on private sector involvement widened to also
include community involvement. These are institutional changes at the field or forest level. Here TFCMP
had two types of distinct impacts: (i) direct, for instance through inventories of GOT owned forest
plantations, and the formation of village land forest reserves through TASAF; and (ii) indirect, for
instance through the preparation of a series of manuals and guidelines. Other institutional changes
included the instruments and tools to improve the enabling environment for sustainable forest
management that were in place by the closure of the project in December 2009. These include the Log
Tracking, forest control and surveillance as well as the setting up of NAFOBEDA and the National Forest
Resources Monitoring and Assessment (NAFORMA)
Towards the end of the project an Acting CEO for the TFS was appointed and she will preside over the
activities that will see to it that TFS is operational starting FY 2010/11. Among others the Acting CEO is
expected to undertake the following activities (i) updating all TFS establishment documents (ii) process
approval of the Framework Document and Strategic Plan documents (iii) Gazettement of TFS (iv)
Launching of TFS (v) Review TFS business Plan for Financial Year 2010/2011 and (vi) complete the
Assignment of Financial Management and Accounting Systems (FMAS) and training of Accounts Staff.
The recruitment of the substantive CEO will then follow. The substantive CEO will facilitate the
recruitment of directors and determine other staff levels. It was planned that the foregoing will be
achieved in time for the TFS to be operational in Financial Year 2010/2011. This shows that moderately
satisfactory achievements have been made in these respects. With regards to the Eastern Arc Mountains,
the project successfully established the Endowment Fund and hence enhanced the respective institutional
conservation and management mechanisms. The Progress is assessed as being satisfactory.
Other useful outcomes of the project included the following
· The Derema Corridor RAP was included in the project at the request of GOT to fulfill commitments
     made under a different non Bank operation.
· The office building constructed for the TFS (Mpingo House located in Ivory Room), which has in the
     absence of TFS been occupied by MNRT and its all departments. The building will be handed over to
     TFS upon its launching in the first half of 2010.
                           B. Borrower's Comments on draft ICR

This is to acknowledge the World Bank ICRR, and inform The World Bank that; the
Management Meeting of the Ministry of Natural Resources and Tourism(MNRT), on its extra
ordinary meeting held on the 14th June 2010, and based on both the Government ICRR and the
World Bank ICRR have principally agreed with the World Bank ratings and observations.
However, the Management of MNRT is of the opinion that:

1.     The overall rating for TFCMP Could be upgraded to Moderately Satisfactory from the
Current Moderately Unsatisfactory, this is due to the fact that the Tanzania Forest Service is
already established since April 2010, the acting Chief Executive Officer is in Place and the TFS
budget will be tabled as part of MNRT budget at the Parliament this month of June 2010, to be
followed by Launching.

2.     Implementing Agencies such, as TASAF and EAMCEF could be considered separately in
the process of rating and could be rated at a rate they deserve without the influence of overall
TFCMP rating, hence could get a higher rate than Moderately Unsatisfactory they are having
now under the Bank's ICRR.

The Ministry argues the World Bank to consider this together with other arguments contained in
the GOT-ICRR.
