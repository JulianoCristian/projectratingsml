mainland forest resources. The major changes include: (i)\n            revise the results framework; (ii) adjust existing\n            components; (iii) reallocate the credit proceeds; (iv) add a\n            new disbursement category; and (v) increase the disbursement\n            percentages. The restructuring will extend the original\n            closing date by two years, from December 31, 2007, to\n            December 31, 2009. The restructuring will also provide\n            support for the implementation of the resettlement action\n            plan, including retroactive payment of costs associated with\n            resettlement and compensation for expropriated land."}, "docdt": "2007-06-29T00:00:00Z"}
