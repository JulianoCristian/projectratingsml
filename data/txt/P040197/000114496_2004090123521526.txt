Re:
Nicaragua: Credit No. 3142-NI
(Third Social Investment Fund Project)
Excellency:
Please refer to the Amendment to the Development Credit Agreement (Third Social Investment 
Fund Project) dated July 21, 1999 between the Republic of Nicaragua (the Borrower) and the 
International Development Association (the Association).
Please note that a minor change in the order of the categories in Schedule 1 has been made in the 
above-mentioned Amendment. This is to correct a minor error in numbering when the Amendment was 
approved last year. It has no substantive impact, but does need to be corrected. Therefore, said table is 
hereby replaced by the one in the Attachment to this letter.
If you need further information, please do not hesitate to contact us.
Very truly yours,
INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
