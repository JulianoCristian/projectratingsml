for the project were as\n            follows: the outcome was satisfactory, the sustainability\n            was likely, the institutional development impact was\n            substantial, the Bank performance was highly satisfactory,\n            and the borrower performance was satisfactory. The lessons\n            learned indicate that the issue of subproject sustainability\n            is crucially important and complex, involving both the\n            central and local levels. New approaches need time to be\n            integrated, particularly in a conservative environment such\n            as Nicaragua, where there is also a lack of general\n            institutional capacity, both at the central and local\n            government levels. Decentralization of the subproject cycle\n            improved client responsiveness and municipal participation;\n            increased managerial capacity of local governments; and\n            reduced subproject costs. Social funds should continue to\n            promote the involvement of NGOs and other community-based\n            organizations, particularly in training activities related\n            to participatory planning and operations and maintenance.\n            The same Bank staff was available throughout project design\n            and implementation, which did contribute to institutional\n            memory, and helped consistency in the Bank response. As\n            evidenced in Social Investment Fund (FISE), the use of an\n            accurate and agreed poverty map for subproject resource\n            allocation can help a social investment fund withstand\n            political pressures to lend more to favored municipalities\n            and communities."}, "docdt": "2004-06-15T00:00:00Z"}
