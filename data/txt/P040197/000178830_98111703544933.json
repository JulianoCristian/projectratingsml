and\n            sanitation; b) focusing on the poorer communities; and c)\n            strengthening, on a pilot basis, municipal management which,\n            in turn, should lead to more sustainable subprojects at the\n            local level. The project consists of four components. First,\n            subproject financing represents the core of the project.\n            This component will include social and economic\n            infrastructure identified by communities, nongovernmental\n            organizations, and local government representatives. The\n            majority of the demand will be for education, health, water\n            supply and sewerage, and social projects. Second, capacity\n            building of municipalities/communities will support training\n            activities for local governments, special projects for\n            indigenous people, and programs specifically targeted at\n            women. The third component will support analysis of 1998 and\n            future Living Standards Measurement Surveys, updating of\n            Social Investment Fund's (FISE's) poverty maps;\n            and analysis of the 1998 and future FISE impact evaluations.\n            Fourth, project management will cover operating costs,\n            office expansion and rehabilitation, staff training, as well\n            as improvement of office technology equipment."}, "docdt": "1998-10-22T00:00:00Z"}
