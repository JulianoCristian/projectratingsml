are\n            to assist in: (i) developing indigenous renewable energy\n            resources, thus reducing dependence on imported oil; and\n            (ii) strengthening the Borrower's financial management\n            through the establishment of an improved accounting system\n            and a comprehensive training program. Towards these ends,\n            the project would include: (a) the construction of a\n            concrete gravity dam across the Drina river; (b) the\n            installation of three hydro turbine-generator units each of\n            105-MW, with inlet and outlet structures; (c) the\n            construction of a 400-kV step-up transformer bank and a\n            transmission line to connect the plant to the national power\n            grid; (d) technical assistance in construction supervision;\n            and (e) training in financial management."}, "docdt": "1985-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
