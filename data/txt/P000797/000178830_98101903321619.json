In addition the project\n            provides for the procurement of a small dredger and other\n            port equipment. On shore improvements will also be\n            introduced under the project, new handling equipment will be\n            procured, transit sheds constructed, and other facilities\n            provided for. A port operations adviser will be employed and\n            a personnel training program will be organized; as a result\n            working methods will improve leading towards increased\n            productivity of port labor."}, "docdt": "1970-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
