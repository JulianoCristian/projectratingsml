Whereas the loan is essentially focused\n            on financing physical investments in road maintenance and\n            rehabilitation, it will nevertheless also support to\n            improvements in institutional capacity, and support the\n            process of road safety improvement. The project components\n            will support the modernization action plan (MAP),\n            articulated around a diagnosis of the current situation of\n            GDDKiA, towards its modernization, and development of\n            procedures for implementation of roads projects.\n            Reorganization at regional levels will be undertaken,\n            supported by the establishment of a strategic planning\n            system that evaluates the efficiency of new procedures, to\n            ensure modernization, and, to review further potential\n            improvements. The road maintenance and rehabilitation\n            program will provide financial support, to maintain the\n            balance between maintenance and rehabilitation,\n            strengthening and reconstruction of existing roads, as well\n            as new construction of motorways, and expressways. The road\n            safety improvement program on the other hand, will\n            contribute to the reduction of road traffic accidents,\n            enhancing capacities in crash prevention and mitigation, by\n            financing partial support in local initiatives for spot\n            mitigation and traffic safety. Increased private sector\n            involvement in the financing and operating of road\n            infrastructure, and technical assistance will be provided,\n            to further define an adequate policy framework, through the\n            development of Public-Private Partnerships."}, "docdt": "2004-03-08T00:00:00Z"}
