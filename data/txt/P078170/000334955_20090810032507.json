PROJECT", "versiontyp": "Final", "loan_no": "7223", "abstracts": {"cdata!": "Ratings for the Road Maintenance and\n            Rehabilitation Project for Poland were as follows: outcomes\n            were moderately satisfactory, the risk to development\n            outcome was moderate, the Bank performance was moderately\n            satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was also\n            moderately satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: with\n            regard to the road components, the Government was successful\n            in utilizing the country's regional apparatus. The Bank\n            approved the medium-term investment plan of the implementing\n            agency (MoI/MoT) on the basis of its prior public\n            expenditure review and use of HDM-4 (HDM-4 is a software\n            tool for the analysis, planning, management and appraisal of\n            road maintenance, improvements and investment decisions), a\n            rigorous tool for ensuring that investment priorities will\n            be based on economic reasoning. The road components, the\n            great majority of the projects' funds were quick\n            disbursing, with more than $100 million having been\n            disbursed in about half a year in each case. Mixing\n            quick-disbursing operations with capacity building risks\n            disappointment. It was logical for the Bank to offer\n            relatively large, quick-disbursing support to a part of the\n            infrastructure that is perennially a poor cousin:\n            maintenance and rehabilitation, because the new economy of\n            the enlarged European Union (EU) is very much reliant on\n            intra-EU trade and much of that trade is road-based; and\n            because mobility is a fairly high priority among consumption\n            goals in new middle income countries. However, institutional\n            change is never rapid, even in a literate, educated country,\n            especially during a period of political instability. It may\n            be tempting to hope that the fast-disbursing elements of a\n            project will generate leverage to induce institutional\n            change, but success is far from assured. Since the first of\n            these loans, the Bank has rightly increased emphasis on\n            results as the central criterion for evaluating success and\n            hence for orienting management attention, 'what gets\n            measured gets managed' both in the Bank and in the\n            borrower's administration."}, "docdt": "2009-06-26T00:00:00Z"}
