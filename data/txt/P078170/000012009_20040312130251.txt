1. Country and Sector Issues

Country Assistance Strategy. The CAS for Poland (discus ed by the Board on December 10,
2002 and covering FY03-05) identified                                                                                                                                                                                              a number o f structural problems in the economy,
including a suboptimal tight monetary, loose fiscal policy mix, inefficient allocation o f public
resources, and a high fiscal deficit with unfavorable debt dynamics. The single lending scenario
inthe CAS hingedonone macroeconomic trigger, which was defined as follows: Publicfinances
will remain on trackfor an increase in central government savings of 1percent of GDP over the
period of the CAS, startingfrom the estimated level of -4.1 percent of GDPfor 2002. This would
in addition entail increases in central government savings each year of at least 0.25percent of
GDP, and no evidence of deteriorationin recurrent balances of the rest of general government.

The general government deficit for 2003 is estimated at 6.3 percent of GDP compared to 6.4
percent o f GDP in2002. The central government's saving balance improved from -4.1 percent of
GDP to -3.4 percent of GDP, thus meeting part of the macroeconomic trigger for 2003.'
However, there was deterioration in the recurrent balances of the rest o f general government.

' The main                                       focus o f the trigger was on central government savings because the fiscal deterioration o f 2001-02 took
place almost completely inthe central government's recurrent balance. Based on currently available data, the central
government exceeded the minimum annual improvement set by the CAS trigger o f 0.25 percent o f GDP, while
preliminary data indicates that the deterioration in the recurrent balances o f the rest o f the general government was
small. A more definitive assessment will only be available in May 2004 given the lags in availability o f relevant
data.


                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            1

  The 2004 budget envisagesfurther fiscal expansionlargely linkedto structural rigidities resulting
  from the delay inimplementing public finance reforms. The general government deficit for 2004
  i s projected at around 8 percent of GDP, and the central government's savings-investment
  balance is expected to deteriorate to -5.5                percent of GDP. Based on this budget, the
  macroeconomic trigger for 2004 will not be met.

  Inaddition to somewhat weaker anticipated growth in2004thanprojected inthe CAS, the fiscal
  deterioration impliedby the 2004 budget reflects a fiscal stimulus of around 1?4percent of GDP
  arising from roughly equal shares of higher outlays relating to EU accession, reducedcorporate
  tax rates, and higher current expenditures.The budget needs to be restructured to make room for
  significant copayments to utilize the EU's structural funds for developmental purposes while
  substituting some own-spending with EU grants. Moreover, inthe absence of policy initiatives,
  public debt will exceed the limits posed by the Public Finance Act as early as this year. In
  particular, debt i s likely to exceed the 55 percent GDP threshold in 2004 (reflecting in part the
  weakening o f the zloty), which--unless countered by significant additional adjustment or non-
  debt financing -- would trigger mandatory fiscal adjustmentinthe context ofthe 2006 budget.

  As public debt approaches legal thresholds, a sense of urgency has risen among policymakers.
  InJanuary 2004, the Government approvedaplanof administrative measuresand social reforms
  named after its author, MinisterofEconomy Hausner(the "Hausner" plan). Iffully implemented,
  the planwould be a decisive first step inreforminggovernment finances. Over the mediumterm,
  the plan could bring permanent improvements in the budget equivalent to about 2 percent of
  GDP (including some additional planned revenue measures), thus contributing importantly to a
  gradual reduction in the deficit from 2005 onwards and arresting the unsustainable debt
  dynamics.While the CAS targets are unlikelyto be met in2004 evenwith implementation ofthe
  Hausner plan, they could be met in 2005 if additional measures currently estimated at ?4 to 1
  percent of GDP are adopted.2

  Inthe interim, it is important to proceedwith the Roads operation despite the status of the CAS
  macroeconomic trigger. Despite downside risks, Poland's imminent EU membership offers a
  unique window of opportunity for the Bank to support the Polish Government, especially as it
  initiates an overdue fiscal adjustment. Further, World Bank support through this operation i s
  essential and urgent to begin to create the requiredinstitutional and financial capacity to prepare
  and support a greatly enhanced road improvement program as Poland is eligible to receive from
 January 1, 2004 EU structural and cohesion funds which, if not fully committed by the end of
 2006, would be lost. The lack of institutional capacity within the Polish national roads agency
 (GDDKiA) has already affected usage of ISPA funds in 2002 and 2003 and threatens to affect
 use of the larger Structural and Cohesion Funds in the absence of strong World Bank support.
 Although the CAS envisioned a single large road sector operation in FY03, followed by a coal
 sector operation and a social mitigation operation inFY04 (for total lendingo f $800 million over
the two years), it is now plannedto proceedwith a series of smaller operations, starting with this
one and the Hard Coal Social Mitigation Project, closely followed by a Coal Mine Closure
project (for total lending o f $425 million for FY03-04). Continued support to the roads sector
through Bank lending inFY05 andFY06 will be proposed as part of a CAS ProgressReport now
plannedfor FY05.

   The precise amount o f additional measures required will depend on the impact o fthe Hausner Plan as eventually
passedby Parliament and could be either less or more than this current estimate.

2. Rationale for Bank Involvement

As Poland will join the EuropeanUnion on May 1'` 2004, it is clear that the World Bank's role,
both interms of lending and advisory services, will have to evolve to adapt to a new situation. It
i s also clear that other institutions, notably the EU, EIB and EBRD -- are likely to be longer-term
partners for financing Poland's road network. However, their ability to help will be constrained
by Poland's still weak institutional capacity to develop and implement a large program of high
priority road investments. Therefore, World Bank support i s sought for its knowledge, expertise
and experience in the sector, in addition to its financing support. More specifically, the Bank is
expected to play a key role in providing support in the following: (i)       implementation of the
Modernization Action Plan for the road administration GDDKiA under a fast track approach,
i.e., less than one year of implementation period; (ii)   securing stable funding for national roads
through reactivated national roads fund; and (iii)    consolidation of the HDM-4 for setting future
roads spending priorities on the basis of rigorous economic criteria.

Request for World Bank Assistance. In July 2003, the Government formally requested the
World Bank to provide a multi-year -- US$400 million worth -- phased financial support for a
medium-termprogram of policy reforms and capacity/institutional building, aimed at increasing
the pace of road network modernization, strengtheningroadpublic expendituremanagementand
improving governance. The Bank plans to respond through two to three specific loans, in the
respective amounts of $lo0 or US$126.0 equivalent for the first one and US$275 million
equivalent for the follow-up loans, to be implementedover the next four years.

Borrower Ownership and Commitments. The Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) discussions
completed in November 2002 concluded that the improvement of the national roads network is
one of the highest priorities for the Government. The Government i s addressingthese issues and
has created the GDDKiA, the General Directorate ofNational Roads and Motorways, in2002 by
merging the previously separate roads and motorway directorates into a single entity. As already
mentioned, the Parliament has approved legislation to simplify land expropriation and to obtain
locations and construction permits more rapidly and introduced a new fuel tax to secure road
financing in the future. M o I is strongly committed to monitor closely the implementation of
GDDKiA's Modernization Action Planwiththejoint support ofthe World Bank andthe EIB.

The proposal is, therefore, that World Bank support be through a series of innovative operations
to support a Sector Wide Approach (SWAP), whose primary goals would be to: (i) the        support
development of institutional capacity in relevant sectors; (ii)help Poland address key sector
policy issues aimedat strengthening public expendituremanagement and improving governance;
(iii) provide funding for road maintenance and rehabilitation in a way that would allow for an
adequate balance between maintenance o f existing assets and new investment supported by the
EUandother longer-term financiers; and(iv) to improve road safety.


3. Higher LevelObjectives to which the Project Contributes

A major pillar of the CAS is to restore growth through increasing employment and public
investment. Within that pillar, further infrastructure development, including policies, institutions
and investments to support an appropriate modal mix, are bothurgent and essential for improved
competitiveness, economic growth and environmental sustainability. The poor quality ofthe road
network was identified in the CAS as a key factor that increases the cost of doing business in

reducedtransport costs, less pollution and fewer accidents. The rationale for providing financial
support in general and more specifically for the road sector operation are given in the CAS
(paragraph 74 and Box 3) as follows: ...Third Roads Project - Development and initiation of a
coherent roads expenditure and investment program to meet Poland's needs as it joins the EU,
including consolidating responsibility for management of road construction and maintenance
into one organization and ensuring sufJicient financing. This project would only proceed if
agreement is reached on measures aimed at improving institutional capacity regarding road
management and planning and financial constraints related to Poland's absorption of funds
from other, longer-term partners, particularly the EU and its current ISPA and soon Cohesion
Funds, This trigger has been met.

B. PROJECTDESCRIPTION

1. LendingInstrument

The proposed 100 million project will be financed under a Specific Investment Loan (SIL)
structured to support the rehabilitation, and maintenance of economic, social, and institutional
roads infrastructure, as well as to finance consultant services in management and training
programs. Although the loan is essentially devoted to finance physical investment related to
roads maintenance and rehabilitation, it also provides support to the neededimprovement of the
institutional capacity of the GDDKiA and support the process of road safety improvement.
Under the Road Maintenance and Rehabilitation component (component B) the World Bank
funds will be pooled with those from the national budget, while the three other components
(components A, Cy and D) will be implemented using World Bank standards fiduciary
arrangements.

The project funds would be disbursed through either the Central Bank or other commercial
bank's accounts and would support GDDKiA and National Roads Safety Council (NRSC)
financing needs for the period 2004-2005. In order to facilitate the use of the funds, it will
essentially rely on the Government's capacity and system -- strengthened as needed, -- on the
basis of the various findings of the project appraisal and built-in control mechanisms. However,
the move toward use of government systems/procedures, as well as the use of ex-post rather than
ex-ante based reviews, will neither compromise quality, efficiency, accountability, nor Bank's
fiduciary responsibilities.
Depending on the results of its implementation from both Government and World Bank point of
view, it will be possibly followed up by projects of similar nature and concept in the coming
years.

The table belowsummarizes the project content andtotal cost of about US$175 million, of which
the Bank would contribute up to US$126 million, Le., 72% of the project total costs estimate,
equivalent to 100 millionto be implementedwithin two years periodof time (2004/05).

 2. ProgramObjectiveand Phases

 The current program aims at implementing Government's 6 year development program o f the
 national road network, originally estimated to cost PLN36.8 billion (about US$9 billion). The
 necessity to accelerate the program results not only from its current poor conditions and
 respective expectations within the Polish society but also from the need to comply with the EU
 standards. The program will improve the effectiveness o f Poland's national road rehabilitation
 and maintenance systems, particularly dimensions o f quality, efficiency, road safety, financial
 viability, and road user satisfaction. In its Letter o f Sector Development Policy (advanced draft
 attached in Annex 1) the Government i s committed to allocate the necessary budget to the road
 sector intheir expenditure.

 This project is the first o f a series o f two to three loans aiming at assisting the Government inits
 effort to improve the overall quality o f its national roads network, including traffic safety, and
 strengthening the capacity o f the road administration. As indicated in the CAS, the program
 financed by the World Bank would amount to a maximum o f US$400 million.

 3. ProjectDevelopmentObjective and Key Indicators

 The objective of the Project is to improve the effectiveness of Poland's national road
rehabilitation and maintenance systems by: (i)         significantly increasing the percentage o f national
 roads in good conditions; (ii)establishing reliable and stable funding for the national road
maintenance and rehabilitation network and for road safety; and (iii)                     improving the capacity
within GDDKiA to operate efficiently and effectively and to reflect the views o f road users in
 developing its programs. Achievement of the Project Development Objective will be confirmed
usingthe following key indicators: (i)       adoption and continued use o f improved road maintenance
 and rehabilitation practices within GDDKiA; (ii)            evidence o f use o f a coherent 6-year rolling


  To be implementedthrough a pooling of funds (National budget and Loan proceeds)
   This amount corresponds to the national budget allocation 2004 for maintenance and reparation works for the
national road network (Detailed figures inannex 4).
   Identifiable taxes and duties are US$Om, and the total project cost, net o f taxes, is US$175.0 m. Therefore, the
share o fproject cost net oftaxes is 0%.

roads expenditure program together with an adequately balanced maintenancehnvestment
program; (iii) significant increase inthe percentage o f the road network in good condition when
compared with pre-project conditions; and (iv) evidence o f highroad user satisfaction following
rehabilitation or maintenance operations when users are polled, both about the quality o f the
completed sections and the inconveniences associated with the rehabilitation or maintenance
processes. The table below details the project monitoring indicators, including the results
expected at the endo f the project.

4. ProjectComponents

The project loan amounts to 100 million, equivalent to US$126.0 million and includes four
components: (i)GDDKiA modernization action plan [US$2.5 million]; (ii)national roads
maintenance and rehabilitation program [US$115.9 million]; (iii)road safety improvement
program [US$5.7 million]; and (iv) promotion o f public-private partnerships in the road sector
[US$0.6 million]. The complement to the total US$126.0 consists in Front-end Fee [US$1.3
million].

A  - The GDDKZA Modernization Action Plan (MAP) i s detailed in Annex 4. The plan is
articulated around four major topics to be implemented within one year: (i) carry out detailed
                                                                              to
diagnosis of current situation o f GDDKiA, implement modernization measures at headquarters
and launch works for development o f procedures for preparation and implementation o f roads
projects [Stage 11; (ii)to complete the process o f reorganization at central level, undertake
reorganization at regional level and finish works on procedures for preparation and
implementationof roads projects [Stage 21; (iii) to establish a proper system o f strategic planning
[Stage 31; and (iv) to evaluate efficiency o f implementedmeasures, pursue modernization o f the
gaps that will continue after stages 1to 3 and review potential for further improvements inorder
to further increase efficiency.

B The road maintenance and rehabilitation program has beenprepared by GDDKiA within
  -
the framework o f the budget 2004. Annex 4 provides details on the content o f the road
expenditure program that amounts to PLN5.4 billion (equivalent to US$1.4 billion) for the year


                                                 6

2004. The National budget funds allocated to road maintenance and rehabilitation, pooled with
the resource provided by the projects amounts to PLN0.634 billion equivalent to US$158.6
million, The proceeds of the loanwill provide additional resourceto essentially tackle the current
road maintenance backlog. The purpose of this financial support i s to maintain a right balance
betweenmaintenancehehabilitation, strengthening and reconstruction of existing roads together
withnewconstruction of motonvays andexpressways.

C The objective of the Road safetv improvement program is to significantly reduce current
   -
road accidents cost to society estimated at 2% of GDP. Actions will be focusing on further
contributing to the reduction of road traffic fatalities as part of the National Road Safety
Program. This will be realized by enhancingthe capacities of prevention and mitigation o f crash
consequences through the provision of financing to partially support local initiatives in the area
of black spot mitigation and traffic calming, additional equipment to the road traffic police, the
fire brigade, possibly also the ambulance service and the Road Transport Inspectorate. The
program will be coordinated by the Secretariat of National Road Safety Council inthe Ministry
of Infrastructure.

D In order to increase private sector involvement in the financing and operating of road
   -
infrastructure, technical assistance will be provided to GDDKiA and M o I to define an adequate
policy framework providing incentive for the development of Public-Private Partnership (PPP)
schemes in Poland. It i s expected that at the end of the project, at least one combined
routine/periodic maintenance concession would have been awarded through international
competitive biddingprocess.

5. Lessons Learned and Reflected in the Project Design

Since the beginning of ~O'S, the European Union has been very active in providing grant
assistance, mainly in the form of program PHARE and pre-accession instrument ISPA (510
million). During this period, the Polish road sector has been supported by three main
international financial institutions: European Investment Bank (EIB) - in the total amount of
1,7 billion, the EuropeanBank of ReconstructionandDevelopment (EBRD)- 45 million, and
the World Bank which made a transport loan with a road component and two road loans for a
total O ~ U S W million6.
                     ~ ~

Past projects financed by the World Bank, in addition to their focus on road rehabilitation-
modernization and maintenance, also included construction o f bypasses, road safety
improvement, andblack spots elimination. All physical investmentswere successfully completed
with works widely distributedthroughout the country, incompliance with World Bank fiduciary
and safeguards requirements. The civil works contracts enabled a recently commercialized
domestic construction industry to modernize its technology and to strengthen its managerial,
administrative and commercial practices. Through technical assistance, the modemization of the
national roads administration was initiated, and most of the new private consulting firms as well
as local construction sector professionals benefited from training courses on preparation of bids
and on the management and administration o f enterprises. A Road Data Bank was created to
supportmanagementof the national roads and facilitate training activities.



  The first road project was completed in 2000 and the ICR rated its outcome as highly satisfactory; the second
project of 1998 is proceedingsatisfactorily, and its completion is scheduledfor end-2004.

                                                          7

The experience from the past operations may be characterized as globally positive. While the
objectives o f the projects were achieved in full, despite the slow-down o f the Polish economy
and the integration process with the EU, there i s still ample scope for further improvement to
address some GDDKiA's internal specific issues recently reported in the Polish Supreme
Chamber o f Auditors (NIK) audit report o f 2003, especially with regardto the quality o f bidding
document, over estimation o f costs, and insufficient attention in the supervision o f works. All
these issues are being addressed inthe MAP.

Achievements in improvement of road safety have been also very positive. The National Road
Safety Council (chaired by the Deputy Prime Minister), with its executive secretariat at the M o I
has been established and national targets in fatalities reduction as been fulfilled. The secretariat
is responsible for formulation and initiation o f comprehensive, multi-sectoral national and
regional road safety programs, and i s supporting the enforcement o f laws by the police (e.g. by
providing regional statistics o f seat belt use, automatic equipment for over-speed infractions and
founding for breath analyzer ("alcotest")           equipment, together with new enforcement
methodologies to increase his efficiency). However, insufficient local funding and severe
understaffing have hampered further achievements. Compared to other countries in Western
Europe, Poland is still a place where the risk o f a traffic accident i s high and where the total
annual socio-economic losses due to traffic accidents are very high(about 2% o f GDP).

6. Alternatives Consideredand Reasonsfor Rejection

The proposed operation has beendesignedinclose coordination with the Polish Authorities with
a view to improve significantly both the fiduciary and safeguards processes. It i s obvious that in
the case o f well advanced middle income countries, such as Poland, the World Bank is moving
toward more reliance on country systems (fiduciary and safeguards), thus improving ownership
and effectiveness o f project and program.

A Sector Investment and Maintenance Loan (SIM) would have also been adapted to this project
as it involves agreement on the composition o f sector investment programs, and on sectoral
policy reforms necessary for the program's success, including the strengthening the institutions
that will carry out the program. However, the Government did not choose it, as this type of
lending instrument introduced in 1970/80s appears somewhat obsolete today, and its use is
steadily declining.

C. IMPLEMENTATION

1. PartnershipArrangements

The technical assistance provided by Bank staff and consultants, under the ongoing project in
helping to shape the Government program and institutional reforms has beenfully supported by
the EBRD, EIB and the EU. The Polish Government and the World Bank have maintained
regular contact with representatives o f these agencies, to keep them informed and to consult
them on program preparation. They all have expressed interest in extending further loans and
grants to the sector. As already mentioned, the project will facilitate their interventions by
increasing Poland's capacity to develop and implement a large program o f high priority road
investments and Poland's ability to contribute substantial counterpart funding. The Bank's role



                                                   8

therefore will be to coordinate and consolidate assistance o f other partners by supporting
appropriate policies and institutions.

2. InstitutionalandImplementationArrangements

Overall Project Management. The Ministry o f Infrastructure will act with responsibility for
overall project management and coordination in close cooperation with the Project Monitoring
Teams established within the GDDKiA and the MoI. Both implementing agencies have
developed significant capacity in preparation and management o f bidding documents, in cash
flow calculations and payments, and with the advice o f their respective experts they are found
capable o f successfully implementing the proposed project. M o I would be directly responsible
for all procurement required by the different agencies. The project will utilize existing
procedures for transferring o f budgetary funds and implementation of contracts. However, in

agreed that the project would also include -- as part of the MAP -- the design o f a new
order to modernize and strengthen the overall management capacity o f the GDDKiA it was

Management Information System (MIS) spinning financial-accounting information with the
contract data including planning and physicalmeasures.

Flow of Funds. There will be one Special Account for the project. The Special Account will be
opened by MoF inNational Bank o f Poland or other commercial bank as agreed with the World
Bank. Loan funds will flow from the World Bank to the Special Account and then converted into
PLN and and pooled with other government funds inthe central budget account. The funds will
then be made available to M o I and GDDKIA as budget transfers. The GDDKiA will report
monthly to MoI on its use o f the funds in accordance with normal budget reporting procedures.
On a quarterly basis, the M o I -- with concurrence o f the MoF       -- will send an application for
withdrawal of loan funds to the World Bank together with a reconciliation o f funds received and
used for project expenditures.The application will be supported by Financial Monitoring Reports
(FMRs) showing types o f expenditures with applied disbursement percentages, as well as a
request for further loan funds based on a forecast o f the next 6 months' expenditures. Full
documentation in respect o f project expenditures will be kept by GDDKiA, NRSC and verified
by auditors on an annual basis. For all the components -- as deemed necessary -- the loan funds
may also be disbursed using traditional disbursement procedures including Statement o f
Expenditures.Supporting documentationwill beretained by the GDDKIA andthe MoI.

The World Bank will devote about 30 staff weeks per year and a total o f about 50 staff weeks
through FY04 and FY05 to help the Government in implementing the project and supervise
progress. Implementation support, as well as direct involvement by the Warsaw Country Office
specialized staff, will in particular focus on performance o f the executing entities in managing
contracts, procurement and financial matters, as well as incompleting the agreed implementation
plans, especially the GDDKiA Modernization Action Plan.

3. MonitoringandEvaluationof Outcomes/Results

Project progress reports would be prepared by M o I on a quarterly basis and submitted to the
Bank's review. The progress reports will focus on results rather than providing process related
information. Therefore, the report will list all the relevant activities carried our under the project,
includingbut not limitedto: (i)  progress made inthe implementation o f the GDDKiA MAP; (ii)
roads maintenance an rehabilitation contracts executed during the period, (iii) taken to
                                                                                      action


                                                   9

improve road safety; and (iv) promotion of PPPs inthe road sector. To monitor the progress of
the project, a set of performance monitoring indicators has been defined (Annex 4) to be
followed and complied with and an annual meeting betweenthe Polish authorities and the Bank
prior to December 31 of each year, starting in 2004. Taking into consideration the innovative
approach o f the project -- the first of its kind inthe ECA region--possibly followed by similar
operations in Poland and other countries in the region, it is crucial to get confirmation of its
adequacy interms of fiduciary and safeguardarrangements as early as possible.

4. Sustainability

The project will seek sustainability through:
    e   Carrying out of the road maintenance and rehabilitation program as developed by
        GDDKiA with the assistance of the HDM-4 System, both at headquarters and regional
        offices;
    e   Increased capacity within GDDKiA for planning and managing national roads
        expenditure programs;
    e   Improvedefficiency inimplementing the overall national roads expenditure program; and
    e   Secured funding mechanismsfor road maintenance and safety.

5. CriticalRisks and Possible Controversial Aspects

Risks. The proposed project is considered as a moderate risk operation. The main risks relate to
GDDKiA's capacity to reform and the availability of adequate budgetary funds for road
maintenance and rehabilitation, as the fiscal pressures in Poland are likely to remain such that
careful evaluation of priorities and on-going discussions on inter- and intra-sectoral budgetary
tradeoffs will continue to be essential. A close monitoring of the progress made in the
implementation of the GDDKiA MAP, and annual review of budget allocations and spending
will be carried out to mitigate these two critical risks.

Another specific risk identified during the initial assessment relates to the lack of modern
Management Information System MIS that would integrate financial-accounting information
with the contract data including planning and physical measures. As a result the collection and
gathering of financial and managerial informationis cumbersome, time consuming, inefficient or
simply not possible. Therefore it was agreed during appraisal that the GDDKiA modernization
Action Plan would include the design of a modern Management Information System as part of
the technical assistance component.

Controversial Aspects. Taking into consideration the strong support from Polish citizens to
benefit from an improved and safer road network, and due to the fact that the proposed project is
essentially focusing on road maintenance and rehabilitation, thus limiting the potential
environmental and social negative impact, there are no controversial aspects foreseen during the
implementation of the project. As a result of a well attended public seminar held in Josefow in
January 2004, during which the Government strategy for national roads was presented and
debatedthoroughly with localNGOs, there i s no controversial aspect inthe proposed project.

         the NRSC andprocedures introducedto undertake roadsafety audits onall works; and

    0    The project operation manual has been prepared and found satisfactory to the Bank..

Conditions for Future Lending in the Road Sector: The Letter o f Sector Development Policy
attached to this project spells out the conditions for the continuation o f the World Bank's support
to the Government's national roads network improvement program (see Annex 1).

D. APPRAISAL SUMMARY

1. EconomicandFinancialAnalyses

None of the national road sections under consideration for the present project has less than 6,000
vehicles per day. Every road maintenance and/or rehabilitation contract would guarantee a
minimal economic rate o f return (ERR) averaging 25 percent, well above the economic cost of
capital in Poland, estimated at 12 percent. A summarized economic analysis o f some typical
maintenancehehabilitation works contracts recently carried out i s given inAnnex 9. The project
would also provide other benefits that are difficult to quantify, such as improving the
organization and funding mechanism o f road maintenance through the newNational Road Fund,
the improvement of road maintenance usingresult-based contractual schemes, and reduction o f
fatalities resulting from road accidents.




                                                 11

2. Technical

N o major technical issues are expected. GDDKiA has an excellent capacity in road engineering
and operations, and the designs of the various investments proposed under the project are fully
compliant with existing international standards. Both GDDKiA and the NRSC have long
experience with the Bank, as they have successfully implemented two IBRD financed projects
duringthe past decade. There should therefore be no major technical issues for this project other
than to ensure that quality control i s adequately administered both at the design and
implementation stages.

3. Fiduciary

Fiduciary Responsibility. Because the Bank will rely substantially on Borrower systems when
implementing the proposed operation, the project preparation included an independent review o f
the Public Procurement Law and its amendments with the aim o f identifying opportunities for
harmonizing EU directives and Bank policies to provide the Bank with the necessary fiduciary
assurance.

Procurement. In terms of public procurement, the Polish law has been amended in order to
satisfy its international obligations on accession to the EU. Whilst the EU directives have
borrowed many concepts from accepted international procurement practices, their overriding
objective o f market integration sometimes sits uncomfortably with these more general principles
andoften applies them for different purposes. These will needto be adapted underthis project in
the following four areas: (i) meritpoint basedevaluation will be carried out; (ii) domestic
                             no                                                       no
preference will apply under NCB; (iii)   selection of consultants will be carried out as per World
Bank's Guidelines; and (iv) "best offer" will be defined as "lowest evaluated bid. These four
exceptions to the PolishPublic procurement Law are reflected inthe loan agreement.

Financial Management Assessment. The financial management assessment o f GDDKiA and
NRSC was initiated in December 2003 and was finalized during the appraisal mission in
February 2004. The financial management arrangements o f the project were found acceptable to
the World Bank.

Disbursement. There will be one Special Account for the project. The Special Account will be
opened by the MoF inthe National Bank o f Poland. Loan funds will flow from the World Bank
to the Special Account and then converted into PLN and pooled with other government funds in
the central budget account. The funds will then be made available to the M o I and GDDKiA in
the form o fbudgettransfers. On a quarterly basis, the M o I -- withthe concurrence o fthe MoF --
will send an application for withdrawal o f loan funds to the World Bank together with a
reconciliation of funds received and used for project expenditures. An advance disbursement
amounting to 40% of the total loan will be made at effectiveness to cover both expenses eligible
to retroactive financing as well as those programmed by the GDDKiA for a 6-month time period.
Counterpart funds will not be calculated on a transaction-by-transaction basis, but will be
represented by the national budget funds allocated to GDDKiA for the national roads network
expenditureprogram financially supportedby the Bank/MoF loan.

Auditing Arrangements. The Audit o f the project financial statement will be performed by an
auditor and inaccordance with TOR acceptable to the World Bank. The audit shall be carried out
inaccordance with INTOSAIAuditing Standards or InternationalStandards onAuditingandthe

                                                12

TOR acceptable to the World Bank was attached to the negotiation minutes. During the
negotiations the World Bank informed the Polish Delegation that the Polish Supreme Audit
Institution, the Najwyzsza Izba Kontorli (NIK), would be an auditor acceptable to the World
Bank.

4. Social

Poverty Category. The specific focus o f this loan i s not on the poor and it does not meet the
criteria for being classified as a "poverty-focused operation". However, it supports Government
policy to improve the country's road network, make road transport more effective and safer.
Improved road transport networks and services are also expected to attract foreign and local
investors to do business across the country and not only around largest cities. This, in turn, i s
expected to contribute to more evenly distributed economic growth and reduce regional
disparities. Reliable transport services facilitate access to schools, health andjob markets. Road
works also generate substantial employment. It i s estimated that the first Bank financed road
project in Poland generated directly about 10,800 job-years and further employment in the
material and transport sector (estimated at 4,000 job-years). While this impact was temporary,
the proposed loan will support more stable and continuous funding for the sector, which should
provide longer employment opportunities.

Participatory Elements. Preparationo f the project took place during an intense public debate on
the current condition and the future o f the Polish road sector. Therefore, throughout the project
preparation process, the Government has been heavily involved in explaining the pros and cons
of various models proposed for road rehabilitation and investment to the public (particularly the
introduction o f vignettes vs. fuel price increases). These efforts, involving meetings and
consultations and bilateral contacts with the relevant parliamentary committees, NGOs, various
professional associations, media, resulted in high degree o f public awareness regarding the
Government's determination to focus on road transport sector and the need to mobilize resources
for this purpose. In this context, the Government also made intensive use o f the MoI's website
where the key documents were made public and interested parties could direct their queries and
concerns. In addition, in the winter 2003/2004, GoP launched a Social Assessment (SA) which
seeks feedback inter alia in regard to the impact o f the gasoline price increases on the poorest
sections o f the population, the willingness o f private and commercial road users to pay higher
fuel prices and their confidence that the additional funds mobilized that way will indeed result in
the improved network o f the country's roads. The SA involved a baseline survey as well as focus
groups and in-depth interviews conducted with various stakeholders across the country. The
Environmental and Social Assessment report was made public as well. InJanuary 2004, the GoP
convened a seminar with key Polish ecological NGOs to seek their feedback regardingthe report
and, more broadly, the Government's mid-term strategy inregard to the transport sector.

Public Information Campaign. A successful implementation o f the project andthe sector reform
more broadly will require the necessary degree of public and political support. To this end, inthe
course o f project preparation, the Government launched a Public Information Campaign,
obtained by surveys with a special focus on explaining the rationale and benefits o f the sector
reforms, publicizing the progress in the modification and construction o f roads, and building
public confidence in the key agencies involved. The Communications Unit o f the GDDKiA i s
coordinating the Campaign. The unit has recently been strengthened and is in the process of
designing a communication strategy in support of the reform. The campaign envisages a wide


                                                  13

range o f activities geared towards the national and regional media as well as other stakeholders
such as Parliamentarians, municipal authorities, transport operators, NGOs, etc. Inaddition, the
campaign strives to improve information flow and coordination across the key agencies involved
inthe roadsector reform.

5. Environment

The proposed loan will not directly finance any new investment, but rather support the
modernization o f the national roads agency and development o f other institutional capacity, and
help Poland address road financing and other key sector policy issues. As a Specific Investment
Loan targeting a subprogram within government road expenditure program, the project has been
rated as Financial Intermediary (FI) during the project safeguards consultation meeting.
Although there i s no sub-project intermediary (as for a social fund or a credit line), the rationale
for the FI rating for this project i s that the nature o f the operation has a lot o f similarities with
those financed under such projects, Le., many small investments which cannot be appraised on a
case by case basis. Inorder to ensure that the project will not negatively impact the environment
in any way, specific due diligence was carried out during the preparation o f the project: (i)an
updateddescription o f the proposed project has been prepared and made available to the public;
(ii)thematicseminartodiscusssustainabilityissuesrelatedtothedevelopmentofthehighway
     a
sector in Poland was held before appraisal; and (iii)a detailed description o f the current
environmental legislation, including resettlement policy, has been also prepared by the project
team and local consultant. The executive summary o f these preparatory works i s given inAnnex
10. Furthermore, the section o f the project Operational Manual dealing with environmental and
social aspects o f the project has beenpublishedbefore appraisal, so that an adequate framework
i s in place for ensuring environment due diligence by the implementing agency as these
investmentsare planned and undertaken.

6. Safeguard Policies

Giventhe nature o f the interventions supported by the project, the project does not trigger any
social safeguards. However, it is quite likely that the implementation o f the proposed sector
reform agenda will generate a number o f social issues that will require the Borrower's careful
attention throughout the project implementation period. In this context, it i s essential that the
Government builds the necessary capacity to monitor the impact o f fuel price increases on the
most vulnerable social groups and poor working population groups who rely on road transport,
access and mobility o f the poor. Inaddition, the Government will need to develop the capacity to
monitor the social impact o f the reform and deal with possible redundancies among transport
sector employees as well as in carrying out public consultations and briefings among the
concerned stakeholders.

Furthermore, while the project does not finance land acquisition, given the Government's resolve
to undertakesignificant sector investments funded inroad sector inthe future, the preparations o f
the project included an evaluation of the legal framework and its enforcement in regard to
involuntary resettlement and land acquisition. The evaluation was conducted on the request o f
the GoP in order to determine the degree of compliance o f the Polish law as compared to the
relevant standards pursuedby the Commission o f the European Unionand the World Bank.

CulturalProperh, and Chance Find Protection of cultural heritage is currently regulated by the
Act of 23 July 2003 on Protection of Monuments. This new law, which replaced the old Law of
1962 on Cultural Heritage Protection has reinforced the already quite strict rules concerning
protection of cultural heritage. In fact its requirements in this context, including far reaching
powers of cultural heritage authorities (`Conservators of Monuments") in relation to planning
and development control are often considered to be too rigid. Chance findings during works is
regulated by the Ministry of Culture and National Heritage which is empowered of giving and
recalling permits for carrying out conservational, archeological and excavatory works and on
terms of carrying out of these works and on qualifications of persons carrying out these works.

A. Road Sector Overview

The poor quality of the road network is a key factor that increases the cost of doing business in Poland.
Many Polish road structures date from the central planning era when traffic volume was lower and axle
loads were lighter (most long-distancetransport was by rail; and Polish roads were built for 6 to 10 ton
axle loads versus the current EUnorm of 11.5 ton). Over the past decade the demand for road transport
has grown radically but increases inthe supply have not kept pace. The road network has been the victim
of under-investmentinmaintenance. renewaland modernization.

With a recent modest increase in the road expenditure it is still less than 0.5 percent of GDP, which is
around one third of the needed bare minimum, compared with a minimum of about 1%just to stop the
quality deteriorating further. It is estimatedthat Polish consumers spend the equivalent of about 16% of
GDP on vehicle operatingcosts (vehicles, fuels. wages. etc.). on top of which road accidents cost society
about 2% of GDP in physical damage. medical costs and lost productivity. Overall quality and safety of
the roadnetwork falls far short of the standards expected of a country preparingto enter the EU.The total
length of the public road network in Polandis about 370,000 km., of which 67% are paved. Roads have
recently beenreclassifiedinto 4 categories:(i)     national; (ii)voivodsip; (iii)   powiat; and (iv) gmina.

estimated at the level of PLN7.8 billion; immediate surface treatment needs are at the level of PLN3.2
billion. In addition, Poland has one of the shortest motorway networks (394 km) and the lowest ratio of
roads in good condition among EU accession countries. Of these, 240 km were built before 1990. The

Motorization and Traffic Growth. As in the neighboring Central European countries, the demand for
road transport has grown radically over the past decade, owing to the unprecedentedgrowth of passenger
car ownership, and uncompetitiverailways. The number ofvehicles in Poland increased from 9 millionto
about 14 million since 1990. Annual average daily traffic on the main internationalcorridors has doubled
during last ten years. Average traffic level on national roads is 7,000 AADT and on international roads
11,450 AADT. Some sections however are heavily congested with a traffic level of more than 15,000
vehicles per day, where the constructionof motorwaysor expressways is highlyjustified.

Road Expenditures. The national roads budget, which had been very low in the first half of the past
decade, has risen recently to about 0.5 % of GDP (which is still low). Expenditures over the last three
years have averaged some 3.8 billion PLN p.a. (US$1.2 billion). While the amounts would be reasonable
ifthenetwork was inacceptable condition,the accumulatedbacklogofdeteriorationmakesthe need
much larger. In addition, the motorway and expressway program        -- which means new construction --
would require about US$1 billion p.a. at the start, possibly growing to US$3 billion p.a. after a few years.

billion a year to about US$3.0 billion a year within the next five years -- a total of US$lO.O billion. It is
Overall, public expenditure on the national road network needs to grow from its current level of US$1.2

clear that, provided they are well-chosen, investments to bring the roads up to EU standards will yield
high returns inreducedtransport costs, improved access, less pollution and fewer accidents.

Road Revenues. In year 2000, the total revenue relatedto road exceeded PLN13.5 billion (equivalent to
3.75 billion), with excise duty on fuels as the main contributor.The split is as follows: (i) excise duty on

for international transport -- PLN0.3 billion; and (iv) excise and customs duty on vehicles PLN0.25
fuels -- PLN12.6 billion; (ii)annual heavy goods vehicle tax -- PLN0.4 billion; (iii)licenses and permits

billion.

Only a relatively small portion of revenues from the road sector is allocated back to roads -- this mainly
concerns a share of the excise duty on fuels. In 1997, concernedabout the condition of the network, the
Parliament adoptedan act that would allocateno less than 30% of the fuel excisetax revenues to the road
sector (12% of this accrues to the national roads budget and 18% to the local governments for regional
and urban roads). The Parliament's idea was to gradually increase this percentage. In practice, this share
was higher than 30% only in 1999 and 2000 (31.5% and 30.6% respectively). Then, because of budgetary
problems, it was reducedback to 30%.

Past Reforms. The Motorway Development initiated in 1994 has not met its expected goals and its
results are very modest. The program, started as a pure BOT systemwhere all financing shouldhave been
provided by private investors, generated little interest. This probably due to the lack of sufficient levels of

large degree of state involvement. Despite this change, only 3 concessions have been awarded (one only
to operate an existing motorway) and no new section has been opened to traffic yet (map of existing
concessions i s attached below). Only a modest length(about 150 km) was built with traditional sovereign
loans from EIB and EBRD, as well as EU grants since 1990. Because o f its lack o f success mentioned
above, the Agency for Motorway Construction and Operation was in March 2000 merged with the
General Directorate of Public Roads. The new organization is now called General Directorate of Public
Roads and Motorways (GDDKiA).

In 1999,following the administrative reform ofthe country, the structure ofthe public road network was
adjusted to the new territorial structure. The length o f national roads was reduced from 46,000 km to
18,000 km, less than 5% o f the total network of 370,000 km. All other roads are under regional and local
governments. While the reclassification of the network clarified the management and the financial
responsibilities for various classes of roads, it also created problems for the efficient management o f the
system as a whole. Management and financing is particularly weak at the lower levels o f regional and
local governments.

The new system of road categorization and administration is a subject of discussion by professional
associations, at conferences and in professional magazines. The main merit of the system is the direct
responsibility of local governments for roads serving their area, which allows them to formulate
development plans and programs meetingthe local needs. One problem is that local road systems are very
fragmented and do not form easy to maintain networks. Road administration costs are increased by the
needto support a large number of small road management units. Some experts have suggested increasing
the national network to some 25,000 km, still a substantial reduction from the original 46,000 km and
regroupingroads among lower levels of government to increase efficiency.

B. Key PolicyIssuesand MainFeatures ofthe ReformProgram

The road sector in Poland is facing three major policy issues that are currently being addressed by the
Government; (i)weak capacity of the GDDKiA to implement an expended and ambitious road program
duringthe coming years; (ii)insufficient level of resourceto finance road maintenance, rehabilitation and
investment; and (iii)poor planning capacity for both maintaining and expending the national roads
network

 1. CapacityRestructuring

It is generally acceptedthat, although GDDKiA hasthe capacity to managethe roadnetwork on the basis
of a "business-as-usual" scenario, it does not have the capacity to implementthe Government's greatly
expanded and ambitious road program. The main constraints on capacity include lengthy compulsory land
acquisition procedures and staff constraints within GDDKiA to plan, prepare and manage the road
contracts. To address these weaknesses, the Government submitted two transport Bills to Parliament. One
focused on simplifying the procedures for land expropriation and for obtaining location and construction
permits, while still respecting the environment. The other focused on introduction o f an additional road
charge (vignette), and on creating a new road agency able to operate along commercial lines. The first
Billwas passedby Parliament and is now effective. The secondBill was not accepted by Parliament and
the problems of GDDKiA's staffing constraints remain. The lack of institutional capacity within
GDDKiA is already affecting usage of ISPA funds and, once Polandjoins the EU, it will affect use of
Structuraland Cohesion Funds.


                                 ISPA 2000       ISPA 2001              ISPA 2002          ISPA 2003

 Transferred (%)                   43.6              53.7                    0                 0

Furthermore, if such funds are not used in a timely fashion, they will be lost. The need to create the
required capacity to prepare and implement a greatly enhanced road improvement program is therefore
critical. To carry out this program the Government will strengthen the efficiency of the road
administration (GDDKiA).

2. Funding

The Billthat attempted to establish a new road agency which would operate along commercial lines, also
proposed to introduce a vignette system to generate additional revenues for the road sector. This proposal
was rejected by Parliament as part of their overall rejection o fthe Bill. The Government has now prepared
new legislation to enable it to re-activate a dormant road fund account held at the Bank o f the National
Economy (BGK). Briefly, the proposal is to: (i)re-name the account as the "National Road Fund"; (ii)
widen its objects to cover most national roads; (iii) the qualifying expenditures to include the costs
                                                     amend
of preparing and implementingroad investment schemes, loans granted to concessionaires, shadow tolls
paid to concessionaires, and the costs o f administering the Fund; (iv) generate revenues for the Fund
primarily through a fuel charge (a special, quasi-tax added to all pre-existing fuel excise taxes); and (v)
manage the Fund through BGK under the direction o f a First Deputy President under the overall
jurisdiction of BGK's Supervisory Board.

The above arrangement which has been approved by Parliament, and which will be effective on January
lst is expectedto generateabout250 millionperyear (i.e., itwouldraisethe funds channeledto
    2004,
national roads from about current 500 million to 750 million per year). In addition, although it
represents a form of earmarking, it differs from regular earmarking, since the arrangements are budget

                                                     20

neutral(i.e., the fuel charge is an additionaltax that does not abstract revenues away from other sectors)
and a considerationis beinggivento exemptingthe mainoff-roadusers of diesel. The fuel charge is thus
more like a road tariffthan a tax. Inthe longer term, it shouldtherefore be possible to pass legislationto
combine the fuel charge with the earmarked fuel excise taxes allocated for nationalroads (12% of the
overall fuel excise tax), to designate it as the "road tariff," to adjust it in future independently from the
fuel excise tax rate, and to manage the proceeds proactively to strengthen financial discipline. A
sustainable mechanism to finance the process of road safety improvement should be established by
allocating 1% of the road tariff revenues to the NationalRoad Safety Council to be invested in projects
with a highrateo freturninall sectors and administrative divisions ofthe country, accordingto an annual
investmentplanpreparedby NRSC within the framework ofthe National RoadSafety ProgramGAMBIT
2000.

3. Planning

Another important element underpinningthe Government's road improvement program is design and
implementationof a consistent system for setting spendingpriorities,basedon rigorouseconomic criteria.
The system would ensure that road spending produce value for money and it also needs to be able to
prepare a rolling 6-year investment program that donors and the EU can "adopt" for purposes of
supporting the road sector. The roads directorate (GDDKiA) has benefitedfrom technical assistance to
upgrade the current methods used for setting prioritiesto ensure that they are based on strict economic
criteria. Work is well advanced on efforts to develop and implement a consistent system for setting
spending priorities, based on rigorous economic criteria, and programmingthe subsequent road works.
Consultants were selected under the ongoingBank project. Based on the consultant's work program, a
first draft 6-year rolling expenditure program has been made available in February 2004. Usingrate of
returnandNPV criteria,the programshows:

     0   Which items in the Government's current 2002-2005 road improvement program meet the
         minimum rate o f return criterion and qualify for EU and donor funding (or, if they fail the full
         ERRcriterion,can be supportedby makinga specialcase basedontheir social, environmentalor
         strategic importance);
     0   Which items fail to meet the minimum threshold and will either have to be built to a lower
         standard, built instages (as shouldbe done with the A1 motorway),or postponed; and
     0   What needs to be done to ensure there is a proper balance between maintenance and new
         investment.

C. LETTER OF SECTOR DEVELOPMENTPOLICY

The following statement sets down the guiding principles which the Government intends to follow in
relation to its general responsibilities for the road sector and specific responsibilities for the General
Directoratefor National Roads and Motorways (GDDKiA).

Economic and Social Development Policies

The quality of transport infrastructure is one of the most important criteria of assessment of the country's
socio-economical development level and a very important factor stimulating the economic development.
Poor quality o f the transport infrastructure, resulting from the investments backlog in this sector, is a
burden for the national economy, limiting its competitiveness and economic development possibilities.
All transport modes are facing serious infrastructure investment needs.

The lack of road network of adequate standard, appears nowadays as the critical barrier to the country
development, limiting the potential of Polish economy competitive advantages such as geographical
position and market size. The condition of Poland's roads hampersthe internationaltrade with EUand the
other neighboringcountries, and has a negative impact on foreign direct investments and mobility of labor
force. Those negative factors result in decreasing Polish economy competitiveness and create a barrier to
the development and innovative processesinPoland.

Ensuring of effective connections of Polandwith EUand new member countries through TEN is of great
importance to take advantage o f the enlargement o fthe Common Market

Background to the Road Sector

The existing system of 18036kmnational road network, even ifconsidered as proper from a spatial point
of view, due to the lack of the complex system of motorways (total lengthof motorways inPoland is 483
km), expressways, it doesn't provide for an effective allocation of industries and services, and doesn't
ensure a proper quality of passengerand cargo traffic services.

Due to the poor condition of road network, improvement of it's standard is one of the Poland's
development priorities. The total lengthof roads accepting the load of 11,5t/axle, beinga basic European
standard, is estimated at 928 km (only 5,1% of the total national roads network). As many as 30% o f the
national roads require an immediate rehabilitation and additional 30% should be rehabilitated in the
nearest future. The main reason o f the poor technical quality o f roads is the increase of traffic movements
(doubled in the last ten years) combined with pavements standard not adjusted for the heavy trucks
movements.

Road Sector Development Policy

The Government intends to encourage provision o f an efficient and sustainable road network capable of
supportingthe Government's national socio-economic goals. These include:

    0   Providing an adequate and affordable level of access to all major centers of social and economic
        importance;
    0   Providing acceptable transit routes to adjoining countries, particularly those forming part of the
        European Union (EU);
    0   Providing road capacity and levels o f maintenance within the available resources which minimize
        overall transport costs;
    0   Undertakingdemand responsive maintenance to preserve key road assets;



                                                     24

    0   Promoting better road safety to ensure that, to the extent possible, road transport is both safe and
         efficient; and
    0    Minimizingthe adverse environmentaland social negativeimpacts of roadtransport.

The above goals will be promotedthrough the following guiding principles.

MAJOR GUIDING PRINCIPLES

RoadPlanningand Management

The Government is trying that road spending to produce maximum value for money, and that the
allocated funds usedefficiently. To address these issues, the Governmenthas therefore decidedto subject
the roadsector to some form ofmarketdiscipline.This will be promotedby:

    0   Ensuringthat the definition of its 6-year road improvementprogramfor 2004-2009 will be
        prioritized using economic criteria. The definition of the program will be defined using the
        moderncomputerizedroadmanagementsystem(HDM-4)currentlydevelopedwithin GDDKiA.
    0   Local authorities will also be encouraged to use more rigorous criteria for setting their priorities,
        althoughthese are expectedto be simpler than the methodsused for nationalroads.
    0   To helppromote market discipline, roadusers will be recognizedas customers who are paying for
        the road services provided by GDDKiA and the other local road authorities. To ensure they can
        be heard-- and are able to express what they want from the roadnetwork -- the Governmentwill
        explore ways of consultingthe roadusers.
    0    Sufficient financial resourcewill be allocatedto ensure a significant improvement of the quality
        of the national road network through new investment, rehabilitation, reinforcement and
        maintenance. A right balance will be sought between new investment and maintenance with a
        view of the economic benefit for boththe Polisheconomy andthe roads users.

ClarifyingResponsibility for Roads

The Ministry of Infrastructure is responsible for setting and overseeing implementation of all national
transport policies, including those that apply to the road sector. Responsibility for national roads has been
assigned to GDDKiA under the Ministry of Infrastructure,while that for local roads has been assigned to
the local authorities. Responsibility for national roads passing through urban areas are assigned to local
authorities and this often leads to varying standards and weak control of developmentswithin the right of
way. The Government is aware of this and would like to encourage local authorities to strengthentheir
capacity. Detailed actions currentlyunder considerationto addressthe above issues includethe following:


    0   Encouragingthe local authoritiesto undertakean audit of their technical capacity;
    0   Based on the above review, the local authorities would be looking for their better quality work;
        and
    0   In the case of national roads passing through urban areas it would be looking for better
        cooperationbetweennationaland local authorities.

Modernizationof GDDKiA

The Government accepts that the road network is one of the country's biggest assets. This makes the
national road network one of the country's biggest "businesses" and, since they are a big business, they
deserve to be managed like a business. The Government has therefore decided to modernize road
managementby taking the following steps:




                                                      25

    0   Endorsingthe operationof the "user pay" principle inrelationto the existingNational Road
        Fund.
    0   Taking steps to turn GDDKiA into a modernand efficient administrationresponsibleand
        accountablefor the successfulimplementationof the Government policyaiming at upgrading
        its road network with a view of a smoothintegrationwithin the EU.
    0   To deliver on its mission, the GDDKiA would adopt sound management structures and introduce
        appropriate management information systems. They would also prepare and periodically update a
        rolling6-year Business Plan, linked to their ModernizationAction Plan(MAP).
    0   Basedon the MAP, GDDKiA and the Ministry would agree on an annual "contract plan" spelling
        out the annualtargets, the performancemeasures to be appliedassociated with the Plan.

SecuringRoadFinancingand PromotingPublicPrivatePartnerships inthe Road Sector

A National Road Fund was established within Bank GospodarstwaKrajowego (BGK) in Warsaw. The
Government is also exploring ways of involving more private finance in the road sector and is actively
preparing its first PPP project. To further strengthen the financing of roads, the Government is
consideringseveral further initiatives as follows:


    0   Establishment of a Road Fund Consultative Council to advise the Minster on all matters
        pertaining to the financing of roads and also onthe managementof the National Roads Fund.
    0   The Council will undertake regular surveys of road users to establish their attitudes to the road
        program, its strengths and weaknesses, and ways it might be improved.
    0   The Council will also advise the Minster on any other matters that may be referred to it by the
        Minister.
    0   The Governmentalso reiterates its commitmentto supplementthe revenues of the National Road
        Fund by involving private sector finance, either though loans, public-private partnerships and
        other appropriate schemes.

ImprovingRoadSafety

Road safety continues to be a problemand the Government, throughthe National Road Safety Council, is
actively working to improve it. It will also develop its collaborating with the Global Road Safety
Partnership to build broad based support for an enhanced road safety program. In addition to these
ongoing initiatives, the Government now also intendsto:

    0   Undertake road safety audits on the designs prepared for all major road schemes. Since road
        safety audits is a new subject, selected staff from GDDKiA have been trained to undertake the
        audits.

Protectingand Enhancingthe Environment

The Government has already adopted Environmental Law April 27, 2001 (Dz.U.nr62 poz.622) to
mitigate further any negative environmental impact resulting from the implementation of it national road
program, the Government is committedto fully comply with the following:

    0   To systematicallyapply the environmentalLaw to all qualifying projects;
    0   To apply the Law at the feasibility stage and before, or during, the preliminary designstage;
    0   To systematicallyhold selectivepublic consultations on all qualifying schemes; and
    0   To supplement the general guidance on environmental analysis set down relating to the road
        sector.




                                                    26

Public InformationPolicy

A successful implementationof the projectand the sector reform more broadly will requirethe necessary
degree of public and political support. To this end, inthe course of project preparations, the Government
launcheda PublicInformationPolicy, obtained by surveyswith a specialfocus on explainingthe rationale
and benefits of the sector reforms, publicizingthe progress inthe modificationand constructionof roads,
and buildingpublic confidence in the key agencies involved. The Communications Unit of the GDDKiA
is coordinatingthe Policy. The unit has recently been strengthened and is in the process of designing a
communicationstrategy in support of the reform.A wide range of activities gearedtowards the national
andregionalmediaas well as other stakeholders suchas Parliamentarians, municipalauthorities, transport
operators, NGOs, etc. In addition, the Policy is trying to improve information flow and coordination
across the key agencies involvedinthe roadsector reform.

The above guidingprinciplesshouldgive confidencethat an effective andefficientroadnetworkis one of
the country's highest priorities and that the Government is willing to go to great lengths to ensure it the
roadsector meetsthose principles.

The project includes four components: (i)  GDDKiA modernizationaction plan; (ii) maintenanceand
                                                                                    road
rehabilitation program; (iii)road safety improvement program; and (iv) promotion of PPP in the road
sector. The total cost estimate of the project, including contingencies amounts to US$175.0 million, of
which the World Bank would contribute up to US$126.0 million, to be pooledwith the current equivalent
US$375 million funds of the nationalbudgetdevotedto the roadexpenditureprogram in2004.


1. GDDKIA MODERNIZATIONACTION PLAN [US$2.5 MILLION]

The GDDKiA Modernization Action Plan (MAP) was prepared and agreed upon on the structure of the
policy matrix used at an earlier stage of the project preparation. In addition to a reference made to the
road safety and the PPP promotion, the MAP is articulated around four major topics: (i) carry out
                                                                                             to
detailed diagnosis of current situation of GDDKiA, implement modernization measures at GDDKiA
headquarters and launch works for development of procedures for preparation and implementation of
roads projects [Stage 11; (ii)to complete the process of GDDKiA reorganization at central level,
undertake reorganization at regional level and finish works on procedures for preparation and
implementation of roads projects [Stage 21; (iii)to establish a proper system of strategic planning at
GDDKiA that reflects better roads' users needs [Stage 31; and (iv) to evaluate efficiency of implemented
measures, pursue modernizationof the gaps that will continue after stages 1to 3 and review potential for
further improvementsinorder to further increase efficiency ofGDDKiA. (The MAP is attachedbelow).


2. ROADMAINTENANCE AND REHABILITATIONPROGRAM[US$115.9MILLION]

The road maintenance and rehabilitation program has been preparedby GDDKiA within the framework
of the budget 2004. The table 1below details the content of the roadexpenditureprogramwhich amounts
to PLN5.5 billion (equivalent to US$1.4 billion). The contribution of the national budget amounts to
PLN1.5 billion (equivalent to US$375 million), Le., 27%. The other source of funds are provided by the
newly established National Roads Fund, and EU related financial supports. The reference made to the
World Bank corresponds to the remaining funds under the on going Roads I1project. The National budget
funds allocatedto roadmaintenanceand rehabilitation are highlighted inthe table and amountsto PLN0.6
billion equivalent to US$159 million. As showed inthe table, the proceeds of the loan will be pooledwith
the funds provided under the National State Budgetto tacklethe current roadmaintenancebacklog.

For the period beyond 2004, the proposed program is expected to be well balanced between
maintenancehehabilitation, strengthening and reconstruction o f existing roads together with new
construction of motorways and expressways. Its financing is contemplated from both domestic and
foreign sources as shown inthe table 2 below. The Government, as well as the transport and infrastructure
committee of the Sejm are determinedto move forward with the road program as soon as possible based
on the existing laws on public roads, financing of public roads andthe Toll Motorways Act.

3. ROAD SAFETY IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM [US$5.7 MILLION]


The objective o f the Road safety improvement program is to significantly reduce current road accidents
cost to society estimated at more than 2% of GDP. Road safety equipment has been already provided
under the previous Roads Projects mainly to the traffic Police to enhance its enforcement capacity. It was
a part o f GAMBIT 2000, a comprehensive Road Safety Program carried out in close collaboration inter
alia with the Ministryo fInterior and Administration, and the National Police. A set o fregional programs,
oriented to modify areas of accidents, as permittedto develop a close relationship with local authorities.
However, implementation o f the nationwide Road Safety Program requires further strict action on the
procurement o f road safety equipment, and to continue the implementation of exemplary projects at the
local level, on the educational aspects of pedestriansand drivers, onthe adequatepreventive signalization,
and on the elimination o f individual black spots.


4. PROMOTIONOF PPP INTHE ROAD SECTOR [US$0.6 MILLION]

In order to increase private sector involvement in the financing and operating of road infrastructure,
technical assistance will be provided to GDDKiA and M o I to define an adequate policy framework
providing incentive for the development of PPP schemes in Poland. It i s expected that at the end of the
project, at least one combined routine/periodic maintenance concession would have been awarded
through international competitive bidding process.

    9 analysis ofany deficiencies still inexistenceanddefinitionofthe alternatives for removingthese;
        and
    9 analysis of the possibility of dividing GDDKiA into two institutions engaged in investment
        projects and road maintenance respectively.

Time: December 2004


The reorganization of GDDKiA will not produce the anticipated results without the simultaneous
cooperation with the Ministry of Infrastructure. Of particular importance is cooperation with the
Department for Infrastructure Financing and European Funds as well as with the Department for
Programmingand Strategy.

It is important to prepare a professional database that allows monitoring of technical and financial
implementation of investment projects. The application for managing such a database must ensure




                                                    38

monitoring o f investment processes in a monthly cycle. Preparation of such an application and database
should become one of the most important priorities of the Ministry of Infrastructure inthe nearest future.

Another important element is the system of information flow in GDDKiA. It is necessary to introduce
new solutions to support management and to improve the speed of information flow and, as a
consequence, the speed of making decisions (independent WAN, electronic circulation of documents,
integrated system of managementof the firm).

                     POLAND:Road Maintenance and Rehabilitation Project


1. PartnershipArrangements

The technical assistance provided by Bank staff, consultants, and under the ongoing project inhelping to
shape the Government programand institutional reforms has been fully supportedby the EBRD, EIB and
the EU.The Polish Governmentandthe World Bank have maintainedregular contact with representatives
of these agencies, to keep them informed and to consult them on program preparation. They all have
expressed interest in extending further loans and grants to the sector. As already mentioned, the project
will facilitate their interventions by increasing Poland's capacity to develop and implement a large
program of high priority road investments and Poland's ability to contribute substantial counterpart
funding. The Bank's role therefore will be to coordinate and consolidate assistance of other partners by
supportingappropriatepolicies and institutions.

2. InstitutionalArrangements

Overall Project Management. The Ministry of Infrastructure shall be responsible for supervising the
entire Project implementation in accordance with the provisions of the Loan Agreement. It will act with
responsibility for overall project management and coordination in close cooperationwith the designated
project responsible within the GDDKiA and the NRSC. Both implementing agencies have developed
significant capacity in preparation and management of bidding documents, in cash flow calculations and
payments, and with the advice of their respective experts (engineer and financial analyst) they are found
capable of successfully implementing the proposed project. MoI would be directly responsible for all
procurement required by the different agencies. The Supreme Chamber of Commerce, though having
identified and reporteda number of reservationsin its Audit Report in2003, gave a positive opinion. This
opinion referred to activities of the controlled procuring entities in the entire road sector, including the
implementing entities for this Project.

3. ProjectCoordinationand ImplementationArrangements

Ministry of Finance. The Ministry of Finance is the signing authority of the loan agreement. Bank loan
funds will flow from the loan account, to a Special Account in the central bank managed by the Ministry
of Finance (MoF). MoF will transfer funds to the GDDKiA in accordance with the Program Operating
Regulations agreed betweenthe Bank and MoF. An advance disbursement amounting to 40% of the total
loan will be made at effectiveness. Once GDDKiA provides the required information for the use of these
funds, MoF will draw down the appropriate amount from the Special Account, and then submit a
replenishment application to the Bank. Counterpart funds will not be provided separately, but will be
representedby the nationalbudget funds allocatedto GDDKiA for the nationalroads network expenditure
programfinancially supported-by the Bank/MoF loan.

Ministry of Infrastructure. The Ministry of Infrastructure has the overall coordination and quality control
of the project which is carried out by two implementing agencies: the GDDKiA and the NRSC. The
existing ProjectMonitoring Unit (PMU) set up inMoI, and fully staff with competent and dedicatedcivil
servants, and presently successfully completing the implementation of the Roads I1Project, will act with
responsibility for overall project management and coordination in close cooperation with the
CoordinatingUnit establishedinGDDKiA and the NRSC.

GDDKzA:It is the central government agency responsible for national road management.It is supervised
by the Ministry o f Infrastructure. GDDKiA was created by Act of Parliament in March 2002 by the
merger o f the previous General Directorate of Public Roads and Agency for Construction and Operation
of Motorways. Of the16,600km o f national interurban roads managed by GDDKiA, about 200km are
expressways and 400km are motorways. There are 3517 bridges with a total length of 145km. GDDKiA
performs the following management functions on the interurban network: (i)construction of new
connections; (ii)modernization o f existing connections; (iii)maintenance of existing national road
network; and (iii)road protectionagainst inappropriate use.

GDDKiA is managed by a General Director, who has the rank of an Undersecretary of State in the
Ministryof Infrastructure. Its headquarters is organized vertically, managedby 4 deputies of the General
Director. There are 10 Departments, each headed by a Director. Departments consist of Divisions
managed by Heads o f Division, and of independent posts.

There are 16 Regional Offices, each with a similar organization structure to Headquarters but with
regional differences, e.g. not all the Regional Offices construct motorways. The Regional Offices
(Divisions) are not separate legal entities. They are part of GDDKiA, managed by Directors who have
personal authorization from the General Director. In each Regional Office there are 5 to 15 Regional
Maintenance Units (RMUs) -- 111 in total. Each RMU comes under a manager. The main task of the
RMUis maintenance ofthe roadnetwork.

GDDKiA shall be the Implementing Agency for the Road Maintenance and Rehabilitation Program,
Promotion o f PPP in the Road Sector as well as part o f TA Component dedicated to strengthen capacity
o f GDDKiA.

NRSC: In 1993 a World Bank report on road safety in Poland pointed to the need for coordination
betweenadministrative and social entities active in the field. This gave rise to the National Road Safety
Council (NRSC). The Council is a multidisciplinary body under the Ministry o f Infrastructure. It consists
of representatives o f ministries and other government institutions, social organizations and invited
experts. The chairman o f the NRSC is the ministerresponsible for transport. Day-to-day matters are inthe
hands of a Council secretariat.

The NRSC's mandate is to: (i)prepare a national policy for road safety; (ii)develop road safety
improvement programmes, taking into account ministerial proposals, and monitor their implementation;
(iii)promote scientific research; (iv) formulate and assess proposed draft legal and international
documents; (v) promote international cooperation; (vi) cooperate with civil and non-governmental
organizations; (vii) prepare a policy on education and publicity; and (viii) analyze and appraise
implemented tasks. At the regional level there are Regional Road Traffic Centers which mirror the
structure at national level and, in addition, have the participation of local municipalities, police and fire
brigades. One oftheir main functions is to increaseroad safety awareness in the regions.

The National Road Safety Council (NRSC) o fthe Ministry of Infrastructure, the Fire Brigade and Police
shall implement the Road Safety Improvement Component as well as TA Component dedicated to
strengthen capacity of NRSC. Part of the Road Safety Improvement Component shall be implemented in
a decentralized way, by self-governments, under supervision o f NRSC. The self-governments shall
conduct procurement for works under this Component.

               Annex 7: FinancialManagementand DisbursementArrangements


                     POLAND: Road Maintenanceand RehabilitationProject


FinancialManagementArrangements

Financial Management Assessment. The assessment was initiated in December 2003 and was finalized
during the appraisal mission in February 2004 by the Financial Management Specialist. The financial
management arrangements of the Project are found acceptableto the World Bank.

Country Issues. The latest Country Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA) for Poland issued by
the Bank in 1999 recommended inter alia: (i)assigning higher priority to reform of internal control and
internal audit functions; and (ii)modernizing public sector accounting and reporting functions. These
issues will be addressed as part of the Modernization Action Plan for the GDDKiA, particularly with
respect to the introduction of as new Management Information System (MIS) integrating financial
accounting information with contract data.

In September 2003 the Bank initiated a new CFAA for Polandto provide updated information on public
sector financial accountability arrangements and help to develop a program for reforms and capacity
buildingto improve transparency and accountability with respect to the use of public funds. The report is
expected to be issued inthe first halfof 2004.

Strengths. The strengths that provide a basis of reliance on the project financial management system
include the experience of MoI, NRSC and GDDKiA in implementingthe roads projects co-financed by
MDB includingthe WorldBank andEIB.

Funds Flow. There will be one Special Account for the project. The Special Account will be opened by
the MoF in the National Bank of Poland. Loan funds will flow from the World Bank to the Special
Account and then converted into PLN and pooled with other government funds in the central budget
account. The funds will then be made available to the M o I and GDDKiA inthe form of budgettransfers.
The GDDKiA will report monthly to the MoI on its use of the funds in accordance with normal budget
reporting procedures. On a quarterly basis, the M o I -- with the concurrence o f the MoF -- will send an
application for withdrawal of loan funds to the World Bank together with a reconciliation of funds
received and used for project expenditures. The application will be supported by Financial Monitoring
Reports (FMRs) showing types of expenditures with applied disbursement percentages as well as a
request for further loan funds basedon a forecast of the next 6 months' expenditures.

Staffing. The project will utilize the existing staff inMoI, GDDKiA, and NRSC. GDDKiA headquarters'
financial staff will be responsible for collection o f reports from regional branches and its consolidation.
The GDDKiA,M O IandNRSC staffhave proven experience inthe existingroads program.

Accounting Policies and Procedures. The GDDKiA, M o I and NRSC accounting books and records are
maintained on modified cash basis (i.e. liabilities are recorded at the date o f invoice acceptance). All
implementing entities will record transactions in their accounting books and records in accordance with
normal accounting procedures according to PolishAccounting Regulations applicable for budgetary units.

The M o I has documented the project's financial management arrangements in the project's Operational
Manual. These describe project-specific procedures, the roles and the responsibilities of the various
financial management staff, the coding structure in the various organizations' charts o f accounts to


                                                       43

identify project-specific transactions, the agreed formats of the project's FMRs with the deadline for their
preparation, andthe project's auditing arrangements.

Reportingand Monitoring. The GDDKiA will prepare standard budgetexecutionreports (so-calledRb28
reports) for the road maintenance andrehabilitation componenton amonthly basis and submit these to the
MoI and Bank within 30 days of the end of the month. The MoI will prepare Financial Monitoring
Reports (FMRs) for the entire project on quarterly basis within 45 days of the month-end incorporating
the information submitted by the GDDKiA as well as annual Project Financial Statements. The FMRs
will be usedfor project monitoring and supervisionand the formats were agreed prior to Board.

Internal Audit departments in the GDDKiA and MoI were created in 2002 as required by the Law on
Public Finance. The work of the internal auditors in 2002 and 2003 relatedmainly to training, preparation
oftheir organizationalstructures, formulation ofaudit procedures, and the preparationof audit plans.

External Audit. In its role as the Polish Supreme Audit Institution, the Najwyisza Izba Kontorli (NIK)
performs an annual audit of the state budget including the funds used by the MOI and GDDKIA.As the
project's funds will flow through the normal budgetary mechanisms, the project will effectively be
audited by NIK as part of its annual audit of the state budget. NIK recently issued three reports on road
construction, maintenance and management which included the activities of the GDDKiA. In these
reports NIK identified number of issues primarily relating to contract management. Accordingly, certain
procedures have already been agreed with GDDKiA immediately to strengthencontract management and
a further review of GDDKiA's contract management systems will be undertaken as part of the
Modernization Action Plan.

The Audit of the project financial statement will be performed annually both by an auditor and in
accordance with TOR acceptable to the World Bank. The audit shall be carried out in accordance with
INTOSAI Auditing Standards or International Standards on Auditing and the project financial statements
together with the auditor's report will be submitted to the Bank within six months of the end of the each
fiscal year. The TOR acceptable to the World Bank was attachedto the minutes of negotiation. The short
list of auditors should be submittedto the World Bank in October prior to the end o f each fiscal year and
only those accepted by the World Bank shall be included inthe short list. During negotiationsthe World
Bank informed the Polish Delegationthat NIK would be an auditor acceptable to the World Bank.

Information Systems. GDDKiA uses various decentralized (not integrated) computerized financial
accounting systems at each of its 16 branches. The branches send reports produced by these systems to
GDDKiA headquarters on a monthly basis in a format prescribed by budgetary regulations. GDDKiA
headquartersthen consolidatesthese reports ina spreadsheet.

Supervision Plan. During project implementation, the World Bank will review the project's financial
management arrangements in two main ways: (i)review the project's quarterly financial management
reports, monthly budget expenditures reports (RE3 28) and the annual audit report; (ii)implementation of
the modernizationplan ofthe GDDKiA; and (iii) the World Bank's missions, review the project's
                                                    during
financial management and disbursement arrangements to ensure compliance with the World Bank's
requirements. As required, a Bank-accredited Financial Management Specialist will assist in the
supervisionprocess.

DisbursementArrangements

There will be one SpecialAccount for the project. The SpecialAccount will be opened by the MoF inthe
National Bank of Poland. Loan funds will flow from the World Bank to the Special Account and then
convertedinto PLNand pooledwith other government funds inthe centralbudgetaccount. The funds will


                                                     44

then be made available to the MoI and GDDKiA in the form of budget transfers. The GDDKiA will
report monthly to the MoI on its use of the funds in accordance with normal budget reporting procedures.
On a quarterly basis, the MoI -- with the concurrence of the MoF -- will send an application for
withdrawal of loan funds to the World Bank together with a reconciliation of funds receivedand used for
project expenditures. The application will be supportedby Financial Monitoring Reports(FMRs) showing
types of expenditures with applied disbursement percentages as well as a request for further loan funds
based on a forecast of the next 6 months' expenditures. Full documentation in respect of project
expenditureswill be kept by GDDKiA and the MoIand will be auditedannually.

The first applications will be for: (i)payment to reimburse retroactive expenditures paid prior the loan
signing but not earlier than January 1, 2004; (ii)initial deposit/advance and will be determined on the
basis of reasonable plans of expenditures for the next 6 monthsas includedinFMRs.

World Bank Reimbursements. Requests for reimbursement are sent from the MoF/MoI to the World
Bank Loan Department only for reimbursement of expenditures financed previously by the Government
(including retroactiveexpenditures). The payment request is preparedon Form 1903 and authorizedas for
normal Withdrawal Applications.

Disbursement of funds from the WorldBank

The Special Account will be opened in National Bank of Poland or other commercial bank by MoF.
The loanfunds will be disbursed to SpecialAccount and then through budget account to MoE.

The first application will be in a form of payment to reimburse retroactive expenditures (see below for
details). The second application will be for initial deposit/advance which should be sufficient to cover
six months of planned expenditures estimated at EUR 25-30 million. Such high amount of advance is
justified by the demand driven character of the project and Bank approach to simplify the disbursement
proceduresandtransactioncosts.

On quarterly basis M O M O F sends the application for withdrawal to the World Bank together with
reconciliation of funds receivedfrom the World Bank and usedfor project expenditures.The application
should be supportedwith FMRs preparedin aggregate form showing types of expenditureswith applied
disbursementpercentages.

monthly basis to GDDKiA HQresponsible for consolidationof reports. The consolidatedreport on uses
of funds are sent to MOI on monthly basis. GDDKiA MOI prepares on quarterly basis the reports on
utilization of funds all components and after acceptance of MOF the reports are sent to the World Bank

                     POLAND:Road Maintenance and Rehabilitation Project


ProcurementArrangements: The Project comprises four components of which the Road Maintenance
& Rehabilitation (RM&R) Component, involvingmajority of loanfinancing, and is definedas aprogram
which shall be financed by pooling of the Bank and Government funds. It includes both pooled and non-
pooled contracting of works under contracts not exceeding equivalent 6 million. It may also include
procurement of goods and services related to maintenance and rehabilitation. The TA and Road Safety
Components shall be implemented in a traditional way, including contracts financed fiom outside the
pool. They will include consultants' contracts. They will also cover the cost of training, study tours and
hostingrepresentativesof the RoadAgencylies visiting the ImplementingAgency to within a program to
share knowledgeandexperience. The Road Safety Componentwill requireprocurementof goods.

Procurement of goods and works shall follow the Bank's published "Guidelines for Procurement under
IBRD Loans and IDA Credits" (January 1995, RevisedJanuary and August 1996, September 1997, and
January 1999). Selection of consultants shall follow the Bank's published"Guidelines for Selection and
Employment of Consultants by the Bank's Borrowers" (January 1997, RevisedSeptember 1997, January
1999, and May 2002).

Advertising: The first GeneralProcurementNotice shall be published in Development Business in 2004.
Requests for Expression of Interest for assignments exceeding the value of 200,000 shall be published
both in Development Business and a local nation-wide newspaper. Specific ProcurementNotices for ICB
procurementshall be publishedina local nation-widenewspaper and DevelopmentBusiness.

National Procurement Environment: During the 1990s Poland introduced a number of laws and
regulations to support the market economy system. Indeedpassage of a 1994 Act on Public Procurement
with later amendments made Polanda pioneer in central and eastern Europe in setting up a sound public
procurement system. While procurement is the responsibility of government agencies, an independent
Office of Public Procurement supports them in this function and provides oversight for effective
implementation of the Act on Public Procurement. The Law has been amended on several occasions
stipulating improvement of the public procurement system. Recently, to adjust to the requirements of the
Europeanlaw and the EUDirectives, the procurement law has been revisedand, by today, the new Public
Procurement Law has been voted by the Parliament and Senate. It is expected that by the time of
negotiations it will be signed by the President and published to allow its effectiveness from March 2,
2004. In order to institute single procurement, the Bank has analyzed the acceptability of the legal
framework and implementation in the context of the new law and with few exceptions, defined below,
foundthem acceptable for procurementunder the B.RM&Rcomponent.

ImplementingAgency: The Government of Poland (GOP) shall be the Borrower. GeneralnaDyrekcja

             Program, Promotionof PPP inthe Road Sector as well as part of TA Componentdedicatedto

             i s a budgetary unit. It has no legal status. It reports to the Ministry of Infrastructureand acts
             based on the Statute given by the Minister of Infrastructure. GDDKiA has the headquarters

            which it is located. There are also district offices subordinate to the branches. The
            procurement responsibility is split between the branches and district office in a way that
            procurement below 30,000 equivalent is responsibility of the district office while the
            remainingprocurementis conductedby the branches.

entities are well experienced in conducting procurement in accordance with the national Public
Procurement Law. The Supreme Chamber of Audit (NIK), though having identified and reported a
number of reservations in its Audit Report in 2003, gave a positive opinion. This opinion referredto
activitiesof the controlledprocuringentities inthe entire roadsector, includingthe implementingentities
for this Project. Recently, NIK publishedtwo new Reports indicating a number of irregularities, and

                     POLAND: RoadMaintenanceand RehabilitationProject


A. Framework

The project is consistent with the Bank's Country Assistance Strategy o fNovember 13,2002, (paragraphs
18, 20, 35, 40 and 43), which concentrates on the removal o f infrastructure bottlenecks, on creation o f the
better condition for private sector participation in infrastructure, and on infrastructure modernization, as a
core part o f the strategy for successful EU integration and on economic development and improved
quality o f life. Roads as well as motorway sector policy in Poland is set by Ministry o f Infrastructure
(MoI).

The project is based on Government's current 2002-2005 Road Expenditure Program. It would be
implemented during 2003-2006 through GDDKiA, except for the road safety program directly under the
responsibility o f M o I through the NRSC. The main lesson learned from the on-going projects is the
importance o f keeping the objectives and composition o f the project simple so as not to exceed the
absorptive capacity of GDDKiA and M o I staff; this has been taken into account in the proposed project
design which remains similar to the on going Roads I1project.

The Government has made substantial progress in adopting market-based transport policies since the start
of the economic transformation in 1990, and there are no major policy distortions that will affect project
implementation. The project will continue policy initiatives begun with technical assistance and studies
carried out under the on-going projects in the areas o f improving road maintenance, road safety, and the
system o f road user charges. The project is expected to have a further impact in each o f these areas. The
project is also expectedto encourage further privatizationo f road contracting, maintenance, and planning.

The project would facilitate the activities o f virtually every sector of the economy, so that benefits are
likely to be highly dispersed, as is the case with most transport projects. The environmental impact o f the
project would also be positive (reduction o f vehicle emissions, noise and reduction o f accidents through
improved national road network). GDDKiA will monitor the impact o f the project both, during
implementation with the assistance o f the PMU, and thereafter, through regular traffic counts on project
roads, GDDKiA reports on road maintenance activities, and the collection o f road accident statistics by
the Traffic Police.

B. Cost-Benefit Analysis

None o f the national road sections under consideration for the present project has less than 6,000 vehicle
per day. Every road maintenance and/or rehabilitationcontract would guarantee a minimal economic rate
o f return (ERR) averaging 25 percent, well above the economic cost o f capital inPoland, estimated at 12
percent. A summarized economic analysis o f one typical maintenancehehabilitation works contracts is
given below. The project would also provide other benefits which are difficult to quantify, such as
improving the organization and funding of road maintenance through the new National Road Fund,
promotion o f privatization through competitive procurement, and reduction inroad accidents through the
GAMBIT program.           Hence,     no   individual    ERRS have        been    calculated  for   the   road
maintenancehehabilitation activities (90 percent o f project cost), the road safety improvement program
(3.2 percent o f project cost), and TAhraining (2.8 percent o f project cost).




                                                      59

GDDKiA carried out the cost and benefit analyses and clearly has the capacity to do thejob satisfactorily.
Every (civil works contract) economic study reviewed and verified by the appraisal mission showed
significant precision and detail. Costs and benefits were measured net of taxes. Cost estimates included
physical (10 percent) and price (5 percent) contingencies. Current traffic levels were estimatedbased on
counts carried out by GDDKiA. Poland's increasingly high vehicle ownership rate, current high traffic
growth rate (about 5 percent per annum) and prospects for the future were provided by MoI. Traffic on
the project roads is expected to grow rapidly through 2006, when vehicle ownership would reach the
current level of EUcountries. Cost savings per km on road rehabilitatiodmodernization are estimatedto
US$0.05 per km (10 percentof present vehicle operatingcost) for the average light vehicle and US$0.20
per km (15 percent ofpresentvehicle operatingcost) for the average heavy vehicle.

                   ExecutiveSummary of the ComparativeStudy betweenPolishand
                         World BankGuidelineson EnvironmentalAssessment


The report provides detailed information about the Polish EA legal framework as well as insight into the
current practice which may be used as reference for further analysis taking into account the WB actual
experience and practice insupporting specific types o f projects in Poland.

The Polish EA legalframework comprises the Environmental Protection Law, the relevant Regulation
of the Councilof Ministers, and some otherparts of legislation

The Polish EA Legal Framework is provided for mainly by the Environmental Protection Law and the
relevant Regulation of the Council o f Ministers, however some aspects o f EA are regulated also in other
parts o f legislation. There are two different EA procedures: Strategic Environmental Assessment
applicable to plans, programs and policies both general and sectoral and Environmental Impact
Assessment applicable to specific development projects. The development projects subject to EIA fall in
either o f two categories: Group 1, which always require EL4 report or Group 2 which may require EIA
report.

All plans, programs, policies or projects which are subject to SEA or EIA are also subject to public
participation procedure. Draft documents including EA reports are made available to the public for
comments for the period o f 21 days. The submitted comments and recommendations have to be
considered by the relevant authority, who has to refer to them in the final documents, inform and justify
how they have been addressed.

The institutional set-up o f EA is built on two pillars: on o f them is the competent authority who is
responsible for the overall EA process from start to end and for taking the decision (Le. is the one who
would issue a development consent for a given type o f project, or adopt a given pladprogramme/policy),
and on the other one is the consulting authorities, who have to be consulted by the competent authority
duringthe EA process at screening and scoping stages and who should agree on conditions for issuinga
development consent at a decision making stage.

TheEA system is decentralized

Because     decision  making,   involving    authorization   o f  particular projects    or   adoption   o f
plans/programs/policies is decentralized, so is the EA system. Therefore, depending on a given project or
pladprogradpolicy and a type o f development consent being a subject to EA procedure, the competent
authority is usually on municipal or county level; while the consulting authority is on county, voivodship
or national level.

ThePolish EA legalframework and the WorldBank safeguards considerably overlap

The review carried out for the purpose o fthis report demonstrates a considerable overlap o f the Polish EA
legal framework on the one hand and the World Bank procedures and policies on the other hand,
revealingat the same time certain differences inapproach and measures taken.




                                                    61

        Both the Polish system and World Bank use different categories to qualify projects depending
        on the extent oftheir environmental impact.
        0   Polish system defines two categories: Group 1, always requiring EIA, including projects
            which may have significant impact on the environment because of being large scale or in
            spite of being small scale; and Group 2, which may require EIA, including projects of
            smaller scale and whose impact depends also on the local condition of the environment;
            Plans/programs/policies of nationalor regionallevelwhich are providedfor by law, always
            requiringSEA, unless screened negatively.
        0   World Bank Category A, requiringfull EA, including mainly large scale developments,
            Category B -- requiring EA, but with scope corresponding to the limited environmental
            impact of the project, includingmainly "small scale" developments, and Category C where
            no EA is required. There is no separatecategory for programs.

        Inthe WorldBank procedurethe scope and requirementsof EA dependonthe projectcategory.
        Inthe Polishsystemthe general scope and requirements of EIA are uniformfor all projects that
        are qualifiedas requiringEIA reports, Le., all projects of Group 1 and some projects of Group 2
        (in case of the latter the need of an EIA report is decided on case-by-case basis during the
        screeningphaseofEIA). WB program-typeof projectswould be subject to SEA, however, only if
        they were of regional or national level and provided by law. In any case, though their
        "subprojects", Le. specific investment projectswouldbe subjectto EIA procedure.

        The Polish requirements for the content of EA report are in all cases similar to those for the
        content for EA report of WB CategoryA projects. However there are some types of information
        requiredby WB which do not have equivalent provisions in the Polish system, though in some
        cases are partially covered: Capacity Development and Training, Implementation and Costs
        Estimates (related to Environmental Management Plan), specific requirements related to Pest
        Management Plan, description of policy, legal and administrative framework, social aspects,
        transboundaryandglobalaspects.

        Public participation is initiated at a later stage under the Polish procedure, as the initial
        consultationis not required.

        Quality control is provided for in the Polish system by obligatory involvement o f consulting
        authorities, public participationandEA Commissions.

        Post-projectmonitoringis not a mandatory requirement, however mightrelevant obligations may
        be includedinthe developmentconsent.

        The minorityrelatedcriteriado nothave an equivalent inthe Polishsystem.

        The WB policies related to natural habitats are sufficiently reflected in the Polish legal
        framework.

Insight into the current EApractice in Poland: there is both know-how and manpower on national and
regional level which allowsfor a thorough quality review while institutional capacity at municipal and
county level requiressome strengthening

Inorder to get an insightinto the quality of actual EA practiceinPolanda short investigationwas carried
out by means of a survey targetinga limitedgroup of relevant PAA representatives at all levels involved
in EA. The total of 19 interviews were heldwith 7 municipalities(out of2489), 5 counties (out of some
373), 5 regions (out of 16) and with 2 Ministry of Environment officials. They answered 8 questions


                                                    62

related to the number o f EA proceedings handled with regards to different categories o f projects and to
plans/policies/programs, duration o f the proceedings, number o f objections to EA reports, number o f
reports referred to EA Commissions, number o f proceedings which involved comments from the public,
any additional requirements (e.g. o f financing institutions) taken into account, major problems
encountered inthe daily practice.

The sample taken was too limitedto be considered as representative for county and municipal levels, yet
itprovidedan indicationo factualtrends.

The survey revealed that on national and regional level there is both know-how and manpower which
allows for a thorough quality review. In the case o f major developments requiring mandatory EIA where
opinion o f regional (voivodship) authorities has to be obtained it is possible to judge quality control as
adequate and reliable.

At the same time decentralization o f decision-making resulted in great shift o fpowers and responsibilities
to municipal (gmina) and county (poviat) levels. The bigger burden has not always been matched with
increased capacity, especially sufficiently qualified staff is often lacking. The gap is to some extent
matched by the involvement o f consulting authorities at the screening and scoping and EA report review
stages. Nonetheless it must be admitted that with regards to developments for which the need o f EIA
report is decided at the screening stage the practice is relatively weaker, as such developments are usually
handled by municipalities and counties.

Public participation practice has a lot o f potential for improvement and currently very few actors o f the
EA procedure appreciate fully the opportunities for quality control it may provide.

Poland has a special legalframework for siting and development of national roads and roads sited in
cities having county (poviat) status, which was introduced to simplifv project developmentprocess in
the roads sector. Although it provides lower level of environmental protection andpublic participation
compared to general procedure, it is generally compliant with the WB EA procedures and policies.
However, as it was adopted only in March 2003 it is too early make a judgment about its practical
impacts.

The report contains a Supplement focusing particularly on EA inthe roads sector. It explains the special
EA procedure as provided for by the Special Road Procedure Act adopted in March 2003 and gives a
short review o f current practice illustrated with a few recent cases. Although the special EA procedure
imposes certain limitations on public participationcompared to general regulations, yet it leaves room for
the public involvement in EA proceedings, especially at the stage o f land use plans and policies
development and retains the requirement to provide the public with access to information. The provisions
relatedto compulsory land acquisition secure the rights o f the owners to extent which remains well within
