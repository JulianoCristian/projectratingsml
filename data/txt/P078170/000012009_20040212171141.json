Therefore, even\n            those developments which are not covered by mandatory\n            environmental impact assessment, will not be exempt from\n            compliance with environmental regulations. Furthermore, the\n            Polish legislation is compliant with the requirements of the\n            European Union environmental legislation. Notwithstanding,\n            the review carried out for the purpose of this report\n            demonstrates a considerable overlap of two systems, despite\n            the following differences in the approaches, and measures:\n            1) both the Polish system and the Bank classify projects to\n            different categories, depending on the extent of their\n            environmental impact; 2) in the Bank procedure, the scope,\n            and requirements of environmental assessments (EA) depends\n            on the project category - full EA for Category A, and\n            limited for Category B projects; 3) public participation is\n            initiated at a later stage under the Polish procedure.\n            Despite improved EA practices in Poland, some problems\n            reveal insufficient expertise on lower administration\n            levels, insufficient quality, and often, changes in EA\n            regulations have caused problems at county, and municipal\n            levels, with little time to adapt to such changes. This EA\n            contains a comparison (Polish and Bank system) table of\n            project types, subject to an environmental assessment,\n            highlighting mitigation measures concerning aquaculture\n            aspects; dams and reservoirs; forestry projects, as well as\n            deforestation issues; hazardous waste management and\n            disposal; large scale industrial plants; irrigation,\n            drainage, and flood control issues; Land clearance and\n            leveling aspects; manufacture, transportation, and use of\n            pesticides, or other hazardous materials; mineral\n            development, including oil and gas; river basin development;\n            power and hydropower development or expansion; water supply\n            and wastewater collection, treatment, and disposal; and\n            finally, mitigation on construction of major highways of\n            rural roads. The Project Operational Manual (volume 2)\n            provides specific mitigation measures."}, "docdt": "2004-02-01T00:00:00Z"}
