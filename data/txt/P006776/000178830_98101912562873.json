{"cdata!": "The Eighth Highway Project is a highway\n            sector operation, supporting the Government's 1982-1986\n            Highway Development Program, which fosters economic growth\n            and regional decentralization of productive activity, the\n            adoption of minimum cost transport solutions over the\n            medium-term, complemented by a cohesive transport policy and\n            regulatory framework as well as adequate financing. The\n            project will also assist in strengthening the local\n            contracting industry, particularly in its efforts to recover\n            from the prolonged slump in construction activity during the\n            1970s. The Bank loan will finance about 7 percent of the\n            cost of the program, which in turn, will correspond to 15.6\n            percent of the estimated foreign exchange cost. The items\n            that will be financed include: (a) rehabilitation, paving\n            and new construction contracts; (b) maintenance equipment;\n            (c) studies; and (d) technical assistance."}, "docdt": "1982-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
