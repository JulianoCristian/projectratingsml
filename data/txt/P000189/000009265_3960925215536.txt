MEMORANDUM TO THE E ECUTIVE DIRECTORS ADD THE PRESIDENT
SUBJECTs    Project Completion Report on BuIundi
ourt.h Hishwav Project (Credit 1583-BU)
Attached is the "Project Completion Report on Burundi-- Fourth
Highway Project (Credit 1583-BU)". Part II contains the Borrower's observations.
They are cogent and reflect a clear and forthright assessment of Borrower and IDA
performance.
The Credit (SDR18.9 million of April 1985) was to assist
implementation of a three-year program to strengthen maintenance operations,
train staff, and provide consulting services to Burundi's road and transport
planning authorit2es.
Project completion was delayed until September 1991, three years
behind schedule. Results were good for physical works. On the other hand, the
project failed to enhance maintenance arrangements. These remain dependent on
external assistance and, at completion, still suffered from inadequate compliance
with agreed procedures.   Similarly, progress in transport planning proved
limited.
The Project is rated as satisfactory, wand its institutional impact
as negligible. Sustainability is rated as likely or.. 'e premise that the "follow
on" project will succeed where this and preceding p. sects did not.
The Project may be audited together with the Transport Sector
Project.

The project results were mixed. They wero fully satsfatory as far as the physical objectives
of road ma_tenac were concerned, as the physical output of the road componen was larger than
expected (pas. S.1 and 6.1 and Part m, Secton 6-A, Indicator 2).
The achievement in terms of insution  development wero far less satsfcty, however, as
both DOR and DGPI requred fruther  tchical    te  rA) to cary out thoir dudes under the
follew-up Transport Sector Project (paw. 6.3-4 and 9.5-12). The results would probably ave been
better if counepasa to expatri  TA had bee assigned symatially (pan 9.7).
The oveall project recalculated ERR wa 74%, compared with the appri  ERR of 51%,
which ind'cates an  w'lens economic justification (pan 6.5).

inrese by 100% compaed with a          esmates.

made necesary by  Ir a   ta were totally un        e: one of the piers of the
old bridge experienced a sudden major subsience, badly damaging the bridge structure
and maing the brdg unuble for trucks; the total number of bidges reconstructed
under the prject was increased from 2 to 5.
(c) A study of the erosion of the banks of the Rusizi River, upstram from the above-
menioned bridge; the rapidity of its     toward dt road prmpted an urgen
study so tat corecve work could be aeaed in time to void the ersion cutting off the
road-an important link with Zaire-in the fairly near ftwre.
(d) Ihe elimination of the contracted Impovvi  and rescing of 81 km of earth road GIM
1, Gltega-Ngozd, and the exesion of most of this work by force account instead; beause
additiona work was needed on the paved NR 5, DGR found prefable, in order to avoid
ct overn, to have GR 1 partly upgraded and resurfced by one of DORs mechnized
briga, at a lower cost and smewhat lower standards than the work originally
envsaged.

(f  The acvities of the tr g ca  for equipment oper s were dsconnu  at the end of
1989 (Le., after th ial poje  completion date) wras one would have  ced



these actiit  to contne on a pemaet basis; this dis         was a onsequence
of the decreasng need for trained equipment optrs and the excive cost of the
tainig   (bsically beas of high equipment cost); in antiiaon of ths discniuaon,
enollme   had stopped in 1988, and those enrolled in 1987 were given an accelerued
course so dtat the ist on could end In December 1989; taiing costs increased by
34%.
Changes (a) to (e) above were the subject of a Credit Amendme  nofied to the Borrowr on
Janlary 16, 1990; thq were fully co_se  with te Project's initidal objecties. The Project cost
increase was born by the Borrower, through three addiioual annuities of Project countepart funig.
(PM all Section 5).
5.2   Ihe works by for  account wero disupted by a shortage of locally purchased spare partu
duoing 1988 and the first half of 1989. This siuation was the result of the suspeson of the aumnatc
payment of FRN (Fodrs Rosuder Nadoa) revenues into a DGR bak acount and - much worse - the
withdrawi of the amounts alrdy pid Io that account 61; almost US$400,000 equtvlent, which had
already been cmmitd for paying local supplies, had been wihdrawn along with the anre balance in
ths accooL Theo           of bflls for one-nd-a-haf years resuIldng from this cash fRow problem
prompted local supplies to stop supplying DGR; this, in tu   caused numeu  instanc  of equme
being bwught to a smdstill for lack of bieensive replacemen part.
5.3    The project was schdled for completion in thr  years, i.e., by June 30, 1988, but because of
the delays referd to in paras. 4.2 and 5.2, ts Implm t  took almost six years. I wa eventuly
completed on December 31, 1990 for work under frce account and an Jume 30, 1991 for wor under

~of EroIWc Risk Assessmem aSsalE
5.4    A posble deine in avalability of local counterpart nds for the projet was the sole risk
envisaged at ar.  Tb  risk maeralized fbr a relativdy short perod of time and its overall
impact was lmited in tim  (pam 5.2).
5.5    Othr problems that occurred durig project impln   were th delay with procurem
proceing, and te lack of adequa  cuserpart staff in DOR (pras 9.4 and 9.7); these had not been
viaged at aprai.
6.         MIA R
6.1   The proJect acieved Its object  of epnding road          o operations to cover both eauh
and paved road nework, and consdated GOB's fiancing of road           which has bee
s     qbhctocy over the Lst few yea. In paicar, the project physical objec     of road mantance/
rebitaon we  acid  in a fuly satory mamer, in genera, as most of the Proecs
quantified targe w    met as shown in Prt I, Section 6-a.
A/ Ths move reslted frm  the Government overthrow of Septembe  1987. The now
IG tr                 uspended the ui  of the FM  account but late  on
restated it.

6.2   Tho contractor hired for the road works pfomed satisfactotily, despite a major delay in the
completion of the bridge over the Rusizi river, altough its ex8econ was ultim y techialy
satfatory. Tho periodic mantance work on NR 5 was especially good (para 6.7).
6.3   In terms of strenting MTDU's  acity as an insftuton to maintain its road network,
however, the projec results wee mixned. Wereas the taining target were met quanttatively, at
project completion DGR would not have been able to maintain its road network satsactory without
fther eerl TA. During the 18-mo   interim peiod between the begnning of the phasg out of
the Project's TA and the cmee   of the Tranport Sector Project, when DGR had less TA
available for oonal purposes, road mane_ ce capacites declined sharply in tem of plamg,
execution of wodc by force account and equipment  ilabt.  he reasns for this siution we: (O)
the lack of staff for cerain positions following the departure or reassignment of key high level staff of
DGR; (u) the lack of com        with opeal prcdr  whic had been ealished dudng the
Project; and (Ti a lack of motivation of DOR staff regarding force acco   opeaiom  pereived as
being outdated, whea the follow-on project would emuize excution of    _      by dte prvate
sector.
6.4   The objective of impving transport planning and coordinaton, was met to some extent, as a
transport plannig unit was set up wiin DGTPT and adequa planming tools were deloped by an
expatt expert wih close collaboratio from countepats whom he trained.7 Howev, dte
counteparts were not fuIy opeatnl by project completion, and furher TA is also being provided
with the same objective under the follow-on project.
EcnmiRate ou
6.5   ERRs on the two major project components have been recalculated on the basis of avable
project and traffic data (Part M, 6-B). For the paved road stet         component, the
appra    ERR was 19% whereas the recalculated ERR is 21%; for the road m   component,
the appraisa ERR was 71% whereas the realculated ERR is 79%. Ihe overall ERR for the two
componen  above which accuned for about 97% of the project cost was reeau     in the range of
74% versus 519% at appraisal (Part M1  Section 6B). The revised ERR idces that the project was
wel justified on economic ground.
6.6    Concning human reurc deveopment, about 735 DGR staff received in house taing
under the ptoject and 23 more hih level staff received overseas training (See Part l, Section 6-
A,Xndicator 3). ConSequently, a number of skilled staff are now available to DOR and the private
sector.
6.7    Conrdng the physical and tchogical enItoinmnt, th project provied an opportunity to
reinaroduce the sufac dresing techique for periodi    m    of paved roads in the country. Ie

8.         EEk Perfrm=
8.1   The Baks performce was good, both during the initial phases of the project and during
implementio. SevSent   supevision missions (mcluding two missions by a human resource and
tr g   specialist) ere spaced out between September 1985 and June 1991, i.e. almost three missions
per yea (Part 1  Section 8). This made It possbl for the Ban's and the Goverme's staff to keep
in close contact and thereby avoid  mis_  or the risk of deviatn   from the project.
9.         &mm Pman
9.1   Th Borwer's perfoiman  prior to effectvess was satsfctory. A PPF had been put in
plce which, inter alia, allowed the Borrwer to hire consultants to assist with project pration tasks.
9.2    During              the Borrower pefomance was mixed as explained in paras 9.3-12
hereater. The heads of DGR and DGIPT made commedable efforts to se that the project was
execued as well as possile, ensuring in pardeular tat appropriate follow-up be made to the Bank
supevision missions. In goneral, compliance with Cretit covenas was sats toy (Part M, Secton
7). Dudag Project Imple   on, GOA resources were filly dodiad t road maitenance; no
major nvesanent which was not economcally vible was initated in th  ansport sector; now
ivsmens begun eadier were conimed and completed. Cost recovery in the road sub-sectr has
been good I geneSa, as the sub-sector has been a not posive contributor to GOA's budget.
Problems Bevond the Control of th IMlememing Agnies
9.3   Two problems enountered by DOR and DGIPT wero-and stl remain-eyond their control,
but had a negative hmpact on the pwject impl         firs problem ws the direc consequence
of t  civil sevie status of DGR's and DGTPr's staft both Dirorats have difficultes attactig
and retanng qualfied staff because of the low wage level, well bdow those paid in the private sector,
mst quaified staff do not want to work for the Govenment, which means that the very few good
m.angers and line staff are surrounded by incompeten and unmotvated penonl. Due to iadequte
qualificand lack of modvaton of part of the staff, the few qualfied staff bear an excessive
workload and In tur cannot perfom fully asfactorily.
9.4     h second extenal problem, which has impacted seriously on the purcas of spare prs by
DGR, wa the result of cmewme Goveme  procmen and payment preadures, in spite of the
use by DOR of the Bank Sample Biding Doum    for the procuremen of goods and for wors.
Wite  oagme  ofth   Ministry of Finace and the Geal Diecto   of Public Procurment in
patdc , i was poblo gtadualy simpfy  d ceerate to some ele  procurement proceduso.
Towads the end of the project, the ceng on conac beyond whi  compedtiv biig is requted
was raised fom Fbu 250,000 to Fbu 2 million.  wevr, tere still rmns much to be done in fti
aras, as procrne ps are stil far too slow. Concering payments frm domesdc soures,
the project was temporaly disupted by the proviions adopted in 1988 ad 1989 agaist tbe Ue of
the FRN by DGR (para 5.2) which had disastrous tepercussions on the peform    of the bades
workIng on force accoun. Eventully, the FRN relar pcedur  were restored and, In addiion to
dds, DGR was authorid to hold an emegey fud to puo    spare parts available localy.

Problems Identified Within the  iementing Afencies
9.5   In addto t these problems resltiog from   tal constraints, DGR and to some exnt
DGTPT had to face the following shortcoming in their internal operations, most of which were lind
to the lack of staff motivation mentioned earlier. The shortcomon  have been most detimentl to
the efficinc of both Diecat concend. The main areas in which these opeatdon inadequacies
hae been apaent a  described hereafter.
9.6   Staff disciplin is extremely weak in gneral, and sanctions are too inrequen  ; which had the
following lmpac
(a) t  impleenttion of internal prcedures formerly developed by expatite experts has
often been incomplete and hence ineffida t; even the staff who are ied for their jobs and have the
necesy tools ad  faiit  often fail to abide by the appopriat working produr; this is a
persstetad seiou pblem, especy in the aconng, procurement and warhouse divion; and
(b) there is a high accidet r  among DGRs drivers, which impas negatively on the
avaiabkiy of equipment and vehicles, and the cost of wo; wheras this does not appear to be an
ise sp c to DGR, greater contmol over drivers by DGR and bettr taining of drivers in genal are
obviousy required.
9.7   There w  a persistent lack of adequate counepart stff working alongside certn expariate
exe. Th sotag of qulfied persnd is the 6mdamnu cas fo ths sition, which DOR,
especialy, has not been able to address effectdy, except for the cowmputer sat position for
which a local consultant has been conacted out. This unstis toy situation occured in DGR's
acntI  and procurement divisions, in part : audiors and Bank missions cused on the crial
siuaon of the accunting expert, who had no cou part and had to send almost his ntdre dme
motoing nd often even doing roune       u   s. The exat procmet expert was,
dung sevl months of 1990, not only witho  a  uctpart but also without a byr and se y.
s dstage of count  staff resultd in poor use of exper time, as the managers had to rely on
them for routine ts, which took them away from thrna mal     b     in plaing,
organization and taining.
9.8   The is an obvious ned for hImpovem  of    c      s, as wi as deleai   wiin
DGR, as this prblem is seiously udemiiDGDRs opeaions. Adequa procedur  for
-    _., }-9, I includig the use of  eo    should be enforced.
9.9   Seior magers In DGR too rately delega to their ine manag     rposbles th
beong to thei positos; their time is thdere connully beng spent deai  with   alnd
tadks which their uborat shoWld noralHy be hadlng. This mosty due to a lack of
and movation on the part of the s(paa 9.3); but whene   possible, the
senio ma sm must try to entru  as much work to the srinaes as they possiby cM, and make
hm accouta  for thi actons and duties.
A/ noweve, in 1989, large scale theft was discovered in the central waehouse
inventory and dscoipIlnary measures war taken.



-12-
9.10  Career plamnng has been dient within DR There must be close coordiion between
training (pardcularly when it Involves sending staff abroad, which is extremely costly) and career
planning. UDf_taey, certin tainig   courses abroad were followed by the reassignment of the
recipient, which significany reduced the impact of the training.
9.11   The utilization of DGR's constuction equipment has been pesintly too low; according to a
diagnosis carried out by a consultant in Febnay 1991, the utization rate could be doubled. This is
pmarily due to 0) the absence of equipment management, as th staff responsible for the equipmetm
pool do nOt have the taning, nor the motivation and capabiities that are needed; (11) the low
productivy of the cental workshop, which also suffers frm indequate mnLagmemn; and (ii) delays
In the supply of key spare parts.
9.12 Mainly because of problems mentioned above, DGR does not have a functioning cost
accountin system yet, despite atempt by the expatriate consultants to developed cost accounting
systems, which DGR staff faied to feed with the relevt data
LA=
9.13  TIe lessons leamed that are relevant to the imple of the follow-on Transport Sector
Project and to the preaation of other projects are summarized hereafter:
(a) the constraints of the cihil service status make effots spent in impwving perfmance
nostly inefficient, unless appropriate solutions are designed and implemented; civil service reform is
one of the most difficult under   in developing counties and does not provide an easily available
solution to these constaints; possible souiDons avaiable, which can be implemented simultaneusly,
a  as follows: i the strmlinn of goverment services to pmning and monitoring finctions, whie
produe  fuction are graduatly being transfred to the private sector'I for equiment _mten,
resorig to the priva  sector for complex repairs is a possble solution, now being used iasigly
by DGR; (u) the creation of incentives for staff in t  form of bonses linked to performance; IO/
Oii) whenr thee is too limited scope for hiing and/or retaing a staff withn the civil service for a
specfic positon, the hiring of local consultan under contact should be envisaged; such consutan
need not necessriy have a strong experience, but should have a good level of general education, and
be tsined on--ob by expi    eper; and Ov) when foreig e t are pwvided, DGR should
use them as effidcenty as possible wkhin its operatonal stuctu, and nOt leave them Ia isolation;
2/  The use of local  Ms to execute road           t    c  work is an objective of
the follow-on projeat. It has therefore bee decided to gradually turn over
road maintenanc  works to 835, whether labor-intensive or using machinry
that would intilly be leased to them by DOR. This practice will be
effectively introdued in 1992.
2./ DoR has put forward specific proposals to the Government authorities,
suggenting that               bonuses be authorized and that travel allowances
be given, with the idea of encouraging the staff to work harder and to retain
enough qualified staff within DCR. A Government decision is needed to
implement such an incentive schmes under this schem  the performae bonuses
for production units would be linked to measured monthly output, deducting the
cost of any excess fuel consumd and any other amunt for losses for which
working gngs would be made responsible.



* 13-
(b) adequa  career plannig and coordinated tiing is essential; training should be seen as a
mea to move on a specific career path, rather than a roward (in the case of traing abroad) unrelated
to  re assigmen; traing should include the organization of seminars aimed at senior manager to
tec them to organize their dim  and delegat asks; anohr  specific area where trainig is needed is in
road safey for drvers (worke3 and high level staff alike);
(c) speeding up procurement procedures should remain a priority on a cross secral basis;
(d) a refom of th equipme  pool to provide i ththe stu of an autoous public or
prvate enterpri shoul be envisaged in the medim term ate the results of the on-going effortu to
improve the manament of the equipment pool are assessed; and
(e) the collecdon of data and information needed to prepare progres and compledon reports,
and their fling by the Borrower should be improved; ul the quarterly progress repots should have a
suitable format to acilitate this documeadoti; adequate on-the-job training of secretral staff in the
area of filng should be provided hy a local specialist.

10.1 As mentioned in Chapter 8, contact between the Bank's and the Borrower's staff was close
trougho  the project, and cooperaton was excellent
10.2   Rations between the Bank/Borrower and other cofinacers of the Program developed in a
spir of dose collaboration, which esured efficiency. Coordinaton between the Bank and other donors
in the transport sector was facilitated by the frequet Bank superision misns (par 8.1).
