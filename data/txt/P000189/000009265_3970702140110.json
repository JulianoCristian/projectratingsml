The project would support the road maintenance\n            program to be implemented over a three-year period. The\n            project would include: (a) strengthening/resurfacing of 11\n            km of paved roads; (b) improvement/regravelling of 81 km of\n            country roads; (c) routine maintenance of the entire paved\n            road network (744 km); (d) maintenance of selected earth\n            roads (about 1,100 km); (e) improvement/maintenance of\n            bridges; (f) labor-intensive maintenance of the entire\n            classified road network (about 2,900 km); (g) training and\n            technical assistance; and (h) consultant services."}, "docdt": "1985-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
