BRAZILIAN STEEL EXPANSION PROGRAM
PART II
APPRAISAL OF THE USIMINAS EXPANSION PROJECT
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        This report appraises the proposed expansion of Usias Siderurgicas
de Minas Gerais, S.A. (USIMINAS), one of the three leading flat steel producers
in Brazil. The plant is situated in Ipatinga, about 210 km northeast of Belo
Horizonte, near its source of iron ore, but relatively distant from its prin-
cipal markets in the Sao Paulo/Rio de Janeiro areas. the expansion will in-
crease USIMINAS' raw steel capacity from 1.0 to 2.4 million tons per year by
1975 and add rolling and finishing capacity, particularly for wide plate and
cold rolled sheets. The project is being carried out in two partly overlap-
ping phases at a total estimated cost of US$572 million equivalent. Phase I,
for which financing had already been arranged, has an estimated cost of US$165
million. Phase II, vhich the Bank has been requested to help finance with a
loan of US$63 million, has a total cost of US$407 million, of which an esti-
mated US$156 million would be used for imported equipment and services. Pro-
curement action on the Bank assisted second phase has started and the project
is expected to be completed in 1975.
ii.       The project is part of an overall program to increase Brazil's raw
steel capacity from presently 6 to 20 million tons per year by about 1980.
This program was formulated by Conselho Nacional da Industria Siderurgica
(CONSIDER), the National Steel Council, and includes simultaneous expansions
of the other two Government-owned flat product mills, Companhia Siderurgica
Nacional (CSN) and Companhia Siderurgica Paulista (COSIPA). The Bank approved
a loan of US$64.5 million to CSN on February 1, 1972, and ha been requested
to assist in financing the expansion of COSIPA also.
iii.      The major objectives of the Phase II are the expansion of basic
iron and steelmaking capacity and increase in rolling and finishing facilities.
To this end, a third blast furnance will be installed which will provide -
together with the two existing ones - sufficient hot metal for both the project
and the next planned expansion (Stage III) to 3.5 million tons per year. In
addition, a basic osygen furnance (BOF) shop, continuous slabcasting, and a
160-inch wide plate mill will provide the Company vith the umet modern pro-
duction equipment. As a result, USIMINAS will produce high-quality steel at
lower costs and with less pollution. The other facilities included in the
project are auxiliary equipment for the rolling mills and for the power, water,
and transportation systems.



- ii -
iv.       Phase II will be financed by US$190 million in foreign exchange
loans; US$128 million equivalent in local currency to be provided by Banco
Nacional Desenvolvimento Economico (BNDE) about half in loans and half in
subscription to new share capital; and US$89 million equivalent fron BSININAS'
internal cash generation. The proposed Bank loan of US$63 million and an
Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) loan of US$42 million will be used
jointly in a 60/40 proportion for internationally bid equipment. An addi-
tional US$94 million worth of equipment is to be financed (901) by export
credit institutions in Austria, Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, Italy,
Japan, United Kingdom, and the United States 1/, after competitive bidding
among suppliers in these countries. The export credits will be extended
on average for 15 years and at 7.5Z interest, with any difference in terms
to be taken into account in bid evaluation. USIMINAS' contribution and
BNDE's financing will be used for downpayments, construction and erection,
working capital, and interest during construction. The Brazilian Covern-
ment has agreed to finance any overrun An project costs or shortfall in
financing.
v.        USIMINAS was formed in 1956 by the Government of Brazil and public
institutions of the State of Minas Gerais. Subsequent negotiations with
various foreign equipment suppliers led to the decision to accept a Japanese
offer for equity participation and technical cooperation in the construction
and initial operation of the new steel plant. The plant started producing
steel in late 1962 and integrated operation from iron and steel making to
the rolling of a wide variety of flat products began in 1966 with a capacity
of 570,000 tons per year of raw steel. Minor additional investments in plant
improvements gradually increased capacity to 1.0 million tons of raw steel in
1971. Primarily due to the economic recession in Brazil in the mid 1960's,
the Company had substantial losses in the early years of operation and was
unable to service its debt.  In 1967 therefore a financial reorganization
took place when BNDE and the National Treasury re-financed some of USIMINAS'
loans. In 1970 a modest profit was earned, followed in 1971 by substantially
increased earnings of US$19 million. During 1971, the Company received US$122
million through the sales of 6% preference shares enabling it to repay a large
part of its debt and place it in a sound financial position.
vi.       At the present time the Government of Brazil owns 791 of the share
capital of USIMINAS principally through BNDE, the National Treasury, and the
Companhia Vale do Rio Doce (CVRD). The remaining 21X are held by Nippon-
USIHINAS Kabushiki Kaisha of Japan, a company founded by the major iron and
steel companies of Japan and its Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund.
vii.      The basic plant and past minor additions as well as the ongoing
Phase I expanision have been executed in close cooperation with Nippon Steel,
the technical consultant of USIMINAS, which was largely responsible for
engineering, procurement, and construction. The Phase II project will be
the first to be carried out under USIMINAS' full responsibility. The Company
1/  Negotiations with Finland are ongoing.



- iii -
has signed a contract with Nippon Steel to assist it in this task and has also
obtained the services of Booz, Allen & Hamilton for advice on strengthening
project organization and administration. With this assistance the Company is
expected to carry out the project effectively.
viii.     Over the last two decades, consumption of steel in Brazil has on
average increased by about 9% per year. In future, flat steel demand is
expected to grow at an annual rate of 10%. Ship plate and autobody sheet,
the two USIMINAS' products which already command good markets in Brazil be-
cause of their high quality, are expected to contribute a higher portion of
the Company's increased sales. After completion of the project in 1975, the
Company would have available capacity to temporarily increase its exports;
but rising domestic demand should soon absorb such excess capacity and ex-
ports be reduced to the targets level of 10% of production, a level already
achieved in the past.
ix.       USIMINAS obtains its iron ore, primarily fines and pellet ore, from
nearby CVRD mines under a long-term contract at favorable prices. About two-
thirds of the other principal raw material coking coal, is imported, and the
rest is obtained domestically at relatively high cost and low quality. It is
expected that the share of domestic coal will be gradually reduced to 20% by
1975/1976. The combined cost to USIMINAS of iron ore and coal is comparable
to the lowest cost in Japanese and Western European steel mills. The other
raw materials are obtained locally. Labor productivity is higher than in
other plants in Brazil but slightly lower than in other major steel-producing
countries. USIMINAS expects to employ another 3,400 persons upon completion
of the project.
x.        The Company's selling prices, on which the financial projections
are based, are on the whole competitive with European domestic prices for
similar products with exception of cold rolled steel. Most domestic prices
(excluding excise and sales tax) in March 1971 were less than 10% above im-
port prices (excluding comparable European taxes and Brazilian import duties),
and in the meantime, import prices have firmed up, primarily as a consequence
of the recent currency adjustments. Upon completion of the project, it is
expected that the Company could meet import prices and still earn an accept-
able financial return. In view of the importance of steel prices (which are
controlled by the Brazilian Government) both to the steel industry and to the
economy as a whole, the Government has agreed to consult with the Bank on
steel pricing policy as circumstances warrant.
xi.       Considering the 1971 issuance of new preference stock and BNDE's
commitment to provide its funds on a basis to assure the Company a 50:50
long-term debt/equity ratio during project implementation, USIMINAS will
preserve a sound financial position. After completion of the project, the
Company will have a low profit break-even point of about 66% of capacity and
a satisfactory debt service coverage and liquidity.



- iv -
xii.      The expansion provides adequate financial and economic rates of
r turn of around 13Z and 12% respectively which vould be higher for this
expansion if it were not for some unavoidable imbalances on plant facilities,
particularly on a temporarily oversized blast furnance. However, such im-
balance is typical of steel plants owing to the large capacity of modern
production facilities and will be relieved and show the full benefit vhen
the envisaged Stage III expansion takes place in the latter 1970's.
xiii.     The principal risks of the project would be a delay of the scheduled
project completion, operational difficulties during the start-up of the con-
tinuous slab-casting and exports at prices below the projected levels. These
risks, however, have been analyzed and do not put in doubt the viability of
the project.
xiv.      Based on the assurances obtained during negotiations, the project
is suitable for a Bank loan of US$63 million equivalent for a term of 15-1/2
years including 4-1/2 years of grace. A guarantee fee of 1-3/4 per annum is
to be paid to the Government by the Company in addition to the Bank's normal
lending rate.



I. INTRODUJCTION
1.01      This report appraises the proposed capacity expansion from about
1.0 to 2.4 million metric tons of raw steel 1/ per year (TPY) of Usinas
Siderurgicas de Minas Gerais, S.A. (USIMINAS) at Ipatinga in the State of
Minas Gerais, Brazil. The expansion is divided into two partly overlapping
phases (I and II) which are estimated to cost about US$572.6 million (in-
cluding interest during construction and incremental working capital). Bank
financing of US$63 million equivalent is sought for Phase II which would
cost an estimated US$407 million, some 49% of which (US$198 million) would
be in foreign exchange. The Bank loan would be used for internationally bid
equipment; the project is expected to be completed in 1975.
1.02      USIMINAS, one of the three principal flat steel producers in Brazil,
began integrated operations in 1966. Like the two others, Companhia
Siderurgica Nacional (CSN) and Companhia Siderurgica Paulista (COSIPA),
USIMINAS' major shareholder is the Government of Brazil.  A minority of shares
is held by Nippon-LSIMINAS, a Japanese company formed by important Japanese
steel companies and equipment suppliers and the Overseas Economic Cooperation
Fund of Japan. As described in Part I - No. PI-16, dated January 10, 1972,
which discusses the present Brazilian Steel Expansion Program in general, the
Bank has also been asked to help finance part of the expansions of CSN and
COSIPA. The CSN project was approved by the Executive Directors on February 1,
1972 and it is expected that the COSIPA project will be presented for Board
consideration in May 1972.
1.03      USIMINAS, CSN and COSIPA account for approximately one-half of
Brazil's present raw steel capacity of 6.0 million TPY, to which USININAS
contributes about 17%. USIMINAS and COSIPA produce flat rolled products
exclusively, while CSN's output includes both flat and non-flat products.
1.04      USIMINAS' present capacity is 1.0 million TPY of raw steel equivalent
compared with 1.6 and 0.6 million respectively for CSN and COSIPA. In 1976,
when all three flat steel producers will have completed their expansion to the
projected total capacity of 7.2 million TPY of raw steel, USIMINAS will account
for one-third of the three plants' total capacity.
1.05      This report was prepared by Messrs. Jaffe, Paschke and Thadani of
the Industrial Projects Department, based on findings of a joint mission 2/ of
the Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB), which visited Brazil
in May/June 1971 and several subsequent discussions in Washington with repre-
sentatives of the Company and the Conselho Nacional da Industria Siderurgica
(CONSIDER), the Brazilian Government coordinating body for the steel industry.
The valuable constribution of IDB and, in particular, of Messrs. Prado, Pokorny
and Meyer in the appraisal of this project is acknowledged.

II. THE COMPANY
A.   Ownership
2.01      USIMINAS is majority-owned by the Brazilian Government. As of
December 31, 19t0, the Company's share capital was Cr$ 365 million. In
September 1971 USIMNAS increased the capital to consolidate its financial
position and facilitate its expansion program. In so doing, it capitalized
Cr$ 160.6 million of reserves and ended 1971 with Cr$ 525.6 million in com-
mon stock outstanding. In addition, the Company sold to its shareholders
in 1971 Cr$ 525.6 million of 6% preference shares at 130% of par resulting
in a Cr$ 157.7 million capital surplus which was capitalized in January 1972
by issuing additional coemon and preference shares in equal amounts.  The
sale of preference shares resulted in cash proceeds of Cr$ 683.3 million and
USIMINAS has now a sound financial position. Presently Government agencies
hold 79.1% of the Company's common stock and Nippon-USIMINAS Kabushiki Kaisha
of Japan 1/ the remaining 20.9%. The Brazilian owners of USIMINAS are Banco
Nacional do Desenvolvimento Economico (BNDE) with 63.3% of the share capital;
the National Treasury 12.7%; Companhia Vale do Rio Doce (CVRD) 2.8Z; and
others 0.3%.
B.   History
2.02      When founded in 1956, USIMINAS was entirely Brazilian-owned.  Sub-
sequent negotiations with several Japanese and European firsm led to the
acceptance of a Japanese offer for equity participation and technical coopera-
tion in the construction and initial operation of the new steel plant. It
also included the financing of Japanese equipment while German and French
manufacturers supplied and financed the remaining imported equipment.
USIMINAS' investment included not only the steel mill but also part of a new
township for 30,000 inhabitants nearby as well as handling and storage faci-
lities at the Port of Vitoria on the Atlantic coast.
2.03      The plant started producing steel-in late 1962.  During the follow-
ing three years, more production facilities were added in accordance with a
well-conceived master plan and by 1966 the plant was fully integrated from
iron and steel making to rolling of a wide variety of flat products and had
a capacity of 570,000 TPY of raw steel. USIMINAS' capacity was gradually
increased over the years through improvements of existing facilities to about
650,000 TPY in 1968, 850,000 TPY in 1970 and 1,000,000 TPY in 1971 without
additional major investments.
1/   Major shareholders of Nippon-USIMINAS Kabushiki Kaisha are the Overseas
Economic Cooperation Fund, Nippon Steel Corporation, Ishikavajima-
Harima Industries Co., Ltd., Nippon Kokan K.K., Kobe Steel Corporation,
Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, with together 78% of the shares and 11
other Japanese enterprises with together 22%.



-3-
2.04      The Japanese steel partners assisted in all phases of planning
and construction of the new mill as well as during subsequent operations.
This assistance contributed greatly to its success. While the Japanese
were responsible for the first three years of plant operations with about
100 of their specialists in key positions, training of Brazilian nationals
progressed, and over the years they have gradually taken over all major
operating functions. At present only about ten Japanese staff are assist-
ing Brazilian management.
2.05      On the whole, initial plant construction and subsequent expansion
proceeded smoothly and at relatively low investment costs and no major tech-
nical difficulties occurred. Today USIMINAS is a major producer of steel
and is recognized in Brazil for the high quality of its products.
C.   Location and Plant Facilities
2.06      The plant is located in Ipatinga (Map 1), a town of about 70,000
inhabitants some 210 km northeast of Belo Horizonte, the capital of the
State of Minas Gerais and the site of the Company's head office. From the
plant, road and railway connections exist to Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro
(Map 2) - the main domestic market centers for flat steel products - and
to the port of Vitoria, through which exports of finished products are shipped.
The plant is also connected by rail with the large Itabira iron ore mines of
CVRD, some 100 km distant, which supply mainly fines to USIMINAS. The steel
plant is therefore well located with regard to its source of iron ore, but
less so with regard to coking coal. With respect to the major sales markets
in the southeast of Brazil (Sao Paulo), USIMINAS is at a transport cost dis-
advantage compared with its two major competitors, CSN and COSIPA.
2.07      A full description of the existing facilities is contained in
Annex 1.  They include two coke oven batteries, one sintering plant, two
blast furnances, and one steel making shop with two 45-ton BOF converters.
Rolling facilities include a combination plate and hot strip mill and a
reversing cold mill.
2.08      The plant layout permits capacity expansion to about 5 million TPY
of raw steel (Annex 2). Further expansion is possible but would require
modification of the original layout concept.
D.  Subsidiaries
2.09      Usiminas Mecanica (USIMEC), the Company's only existing subsidiary,
was established in October 1970. It fabricates principally steel structures
and steel bridges and will soon also contain the Company's mechanical work
shop which provides maintenance and repair services to USIMINAS. While
receiving general guidance from USIMINAS, it has its own management and staff
consisting of about 500 of the Company's former employees. USIMEC from time to
time will need additional financing from USIHINAS to expand its operations.



- 4 -
It was agreed during negotiations that USIMEC, and other possible future sub-
sidiaries, would not spend or commit more than US$4 million annually for fixed
or capital assets and,during 1972-1980, not borrow, make advances or guarantee
debt of more than US$2.0 million in each year without prior consent of the Bank.
E.   Organization and Management
2.10      The organization of the Company is shown in Annexes 3 and 4.
USIMINAS' present six Board members are the President, the Secretary, who
acts as Deputy President and also presides over shareholders' meetings, and
four Directors responsible respectively for the functions of technical devel-
opment, finance, administration and operations. By contract, the Secretary
is nominated by the Japanese shareholders (Nippon-USININAS) and the Finance
Director by BNDE, as long as BNDE holds more than 20% of the Company's share
capital. The other Board members are elected by all shareholders.
2.11      The President of USIMINAS, Mr. Lanari, aged 58, has been with the
Company since 1958. A mining and metallurgical engineer by profession, he
has been USIMINAS'chief executive since joining the Company, and is con-
sidered a good manager. He is assisted by the present Secretary, Mr. Taka-
hashi, 61, a Japanese lawyer with wide experience in banking and finance.
He joined USIMINAS about six years ago and provides a sound back-up to
Mr. Lanari. The average age of USIMINAS' directors and senior executives is
below 40 years and the Company has proven itself to be well-managed with good
production and sales records.
2.12      All members of the Board are also full-time executives.  While such
internal directors are the norm in Brazil and this arrangement has also been
effective with USIMINAS, the Company is now considering two organizational
changes which are designed to meet more fully the increased demands on manage-
ment as a consequence of the expansion project. One is the possible enlarge-
ment of the Board to include one or two outside Board members and the other
is the possible separation of marketing and sales responsibilities from
operating responsibilities.
2 13      Apart from the Board of Directors, the Company maintains a Fiscal
Council which, in accordance with Brazilian law, reviews the annual financial
statements of the Company and recommends their approval to the shareholders.
The function of the other formal management body, the Consultative Council,
is to supervise and advise the Board of Directors. However, the Consultative
Council has not played an active role in recent years, especially after the
formation of ODNSIDER (Part I, paras. 2.16 and 2.17).
2.14      The Government of Brazil is considering the possibility of creating
a holding company for USIMINAS, CSN and COSIPA at a future date. Agreement
was reached during negotiation that USIMINAS' present independent corporate
form will not be changed and that it will not be merged or consolidated with
other companies without prior consultation with the Bank. A similar agree-
ment was obtained as regards CSN.

2.15      To supplement its own expertise, the Company has obtained outside
assistance both in technical and organizational matters. In 1966 it signed
a 10-year contract with a predecessor of Nippon Steel Corporation (NSC) for
technical assistance including training of Brazilians in Japan. Between 1965
and 1969, USIMINAS retained Booz, Allen & Hamilton International Inc. (BAHINT)
of New York to (a) improve its management organization, (b) improve cost con-
trol and maintenance, (c) introduce budget and incentive systems, and (d)
formalize procedures for better management reporting and quality control.
The results of NSC's and BAHINT's assistance have been very satisfactory.
In view of the requirements of the expansion, USININAS has signed additional
contracts with NSC for assistance in the execution of all phases of the
project and with BAHINT for advice on the organization of the department
within USIMINAS responsible for the execution of the project (para. 4.10).
These contracts are reasonable and are expected to improve the carrying out
the project.
F.   Past Growth and Present Financial Position
2.16      Historical income statements in both cruzeiros and US$ are given
in Annex 5 together with a more detatled explanation. While the official
cruzeiro statements show a profit from 1968 on, they understate depreciation
and financial charges, and the US$ statements give a truer picture of the
Companyis operations. Selected items from USININAS' US$ income statements
are given below:

-6-
2.17      Due to the recession in Brazil, USIMINAS' initial operations
through 1967 were characterized by below-capacity production and selling
prices lower than the Government imposed ceilings. Since then, the strong
recovery of the Brazilian economy has permitted near-capacity operations
and this, combined with price increases in real terms since 1968 and a
better product mix, have resulted in a steadily improving profit picture.
After the substantial loss of US$29 million in 1967, deficits were reduced
and the Company began showing a profit in 1970. This improvement continued
in 1971 and results for the year indicate earnings of around US$19 ilUion
after taxes.
2.18      The losses in US1MINAS' initial years created financial difficulties
in 1967, when the maturities due to Germany and France were rescheduled and
the National Treasury assumed settlement of the debt to Japan. As the poor
earnings continued in the 1968-70 period the Company borrowed additional funds
from BNDE and the National Treasury to meet its obligations in these years.
A summary sources and applications of funds statement for the years 1967-1970
is shown below:

2.19      With its greatly improved earnings and cash flow in 1971, supple-
mented by the funds from sale of preference shares of US$122 Million in the
last quarter of the year, USIEHNAS was able to service its 1971 debt maturi-
ties in full and repay some US$135 million in loans outstanding to RNEX and
the National Treasury, in part ahead of maturity.
2.20      The difference between historical cruzeiro and US dollar accounts
is explained in Part I, Annex 3. As can be seen in the historical balance
sheets (Annex 5), USIMINAS had net capital outstanding as of December 31,
1970 of US$71.8 million comprising capital stock of US$229.8 million less
accumulated losses of US$158 million. In the statements it was assumed that
the Company had US$71.8 million in capital shares outstanding on that date
and zero accumulated earnings. There was in addition US$27.8 million in



-7-
Government advances against future share capital increases. This was more
than offset by the Company's receipt in late 1971 of US$122 million in pay-
ment for preference shares. Including the effect of these changes and
operating results for the year, the capital position of USIMINAS at the end
of 1971 was, as follows:
Equity as at December 31, 1971
US$ Millions
Share Capital less Accumulated losses 12/31/70              71.8
Sale of Preferred Shares                                    93.8
Capital Surplus                                             28.2
Other Reserves                                               2.7
Net Profit for 1971 less Dividends /1                       15.0
Net Worth                                            211.5
Ll   Net profit after taxes of US$18.6 million less US$3.1 million
loss on currency conversion and US$0.5 million preferred divi-
dends accrued.
2.21      This gives the Company a healthy 31:69 debt/equity ratio and
provides a suitable base for the financing of its expansion program.
III. THE MARKET
A.   Recent Sales History and Sales Forecasts
3.01      The market and prices for flat steel products in Brazil are dis-
cussed in Part I of this report. This chapter treats the subject only to
the extent that it relates specifically to USIMINAS' operations. The fol-
lowing table summarizes the Company's recent sales history (1968-1971) and
forecasts through 1977, the year in which USIMINAS expects to achieve ca-
pacity sales under the Phase II expansion program to 2.4 million TPY. More
detailed information is contained in Annex 6.

3.02      The Company's total flat steel sales increased from about 427,000
tons in 1968 to 788,000 tons in 1971, a compound annual rate of about 23%.
During the same period, domestic sales of flat products rose from 341,000 tons
to 743,000 tons, or by about 30Z annually, with plate showing the strongest
growth at about 34Z per year. Exports of flat products remained stable at
about 85,000 tons during 1968-1970 and dropped by about 50% in 1971 which re-
flects the high demand for flat steel in the Brazilian market. Semi-finished
products (blooms and slabs) decreased sharply in absolute terms during 1968-
1970 and even more so relative to the overall sales growth. In 1971, no semi-
finished products were sold.  This trend indicates the increasingly full
utilization of finishing capacity for more remunerative products.

3.03      Because of its reputation in Brazil for quality products, USIMINAS
is now the preferred source for ship plate and autobody sheet. As a result,
USIMINAS has been able to supply mainly customers buying large quantities on
terms favorable to the Company. This position is expected to change to some
extent after 1976, when COSIPA should also be able to offer ship plate of a
quality comparable to USIMINAS. The projections assume USIMINAS' accounts
receivable to increase from 20% of domestic sales to 25% beginning in 1976.
3.04      USIMINAS' projected sales volume shows an annual growth rate of
about 12% between 1971 and 1977, while the Bank assumed that the demand for
flat steel products in Brazil will only increase by about 10% per year during
this period. The main reason for this apparant discrepancy is that the future
production and sales programs of the three main flat steel producers in Brazil
have been coordinated under the National Steel Plan and that therefore USIMINAS
and COSIPA will concentrate on the production of uncoated flat steel resulting
in higher sales growth rates for them in these products. CSN, on the other
hand, will primarely expand production capacity for coated flat steel (CSN
appraisal report PI-15a, January 7, 1972).
3.05      USIMINAS' share of total flat steel domestic sales and exports
projected for the three major Brazilian flat steel producers is shown in
the following table:

3.06      On the whole, USIMINAS' market share of uncoated flat products is
expected to increase from 40% to 48% between 1970 and 1977. In view of the
superior quality of USIMINAS' products, these forecasts are realistic.
Deviations in total Brazilian demand or competitive factors within the five
main product groups (plate, hot-and cold-rolled coil and sheet) may necessitat
minor changes in USIMIENAS' product mix from that projected and the Company's
production facilities will have the necessary flexibility to meet such
changes in demand.
B.   Geographic Distribution of Sales
3.07      The bulk of the Company's finished steel products goes to the in-
dustrialized southeast region of Brazil, where USIMINAS' sales have increased
from 80% of its domestic sales in 1967 to 85% in 1970. The Company has been
making successful marketing efforts in the region surrounding its plant, par-
ticularly in the states of Minas Gerais and Espirito Santo, and salf§ volume
in that region increased 40% during the period; nevertheless, the in6reased
volume still represented a smaller percentage of USItINAS' total sales (15%
vs 20% earlier) due to the very high growth of demand for flat steel in the
southeast region, where sales more than doubled during the 4-year pefiod.
USIMINAS' principal customers are the automotive companies in and ar'ound Sao
Paulo; the shipyards in Rio de Janeiro and Santos and Petrobras, the Govern-
ment-owned petroleum Company (Annex 6).
C.  Marketing Organization
3.08      The Marketing Department of USIMINAS enjoys the repufAfi6n of being
the most aggressive of the three major flat steel producers in Bfazii.  The
staff of about 55 persons is headed by Mr. Fernandes, who is in hi9 mid-30's.
The department is divided into four divisions (1) Sales; (2) Technical Assis-
tance and Product Development; (3) Advertisement and Sales Promofion; and (4)
Administration. Marketing costs have been kept low by developom6e af sales
to large consumers, who usually make payments promptly.  The shife of sales
through distributors has been deliberately reduced from 46% in 1967 i-6 26%
in 1970, and is expected to decline further in the future.  As has been
mentioned, the Bank discussed with the Borrower during negotiati6fi the pos-
sibility of strengthening representation of the sales function in the top
management by separating this function from production responsibilities.
Such a move would appear desirable especially for the period, Vhn in the
mid 1970's Brazilian flat steel production is expected to exceed temporarily
domestic demand and internal competition will increase.
IV. THE PROJECT
A.   Scope and Objectives
4.01      The project consists of the expansion of USIMINAS' bAdic iron and
steel making capacity from about 1.0 to 2.4 million TPY of raw 4t&el equiv-
alent and the addition of major facilities to increase rolling anid finishing



- 11 -
capacity for the production of plate and hot- and cold-rolled coil and sheet.
The project is well conceived technically and forms part of the Company's
long-term objective to raise the plant's capacity to 3.5 million TPY of raw
steel equivalent by about 1980.
4.02      In view of the plant's comparatively recent origin, none of the in-
stalled facilities needs replacement and the layout of the plant permits the
project to be executed with almost no interference with current operations.
The expansion will be carried out in two phases which are technically inte-
grated and which partly overlap -- Phase I being implemented during 1970-73
and Phase II during 1972-75. The proposed Bank loan would be used only for
the second phase. The place of this expansion in the overall program for ex-
panding flat products capacity in Brazil during the current decade is de-
scribed fully in Part I, primarily in paras. 3.09 to 3.11, and a detailed
account of the project's major facilities is given in Annex 7.
4.03      USIMINAS has been studying the expansion of its production capacity
to about 1.4 million TPY of raw steel since 1968. This scheme was later modi-
fied and integrated as Phase I into the 2.4 million ton project. Financing
for the first phase was arranged before the Bank was approached to participate
in Phase II but since both phases became closely interconnected the Bank also
reviewed Phase I and was satisfied about its technical concept, cost and the
mode and progress of its implementation.
4.04      The major facilities included in both phases of the expansion are a
new coke oven battery with 55 ovens and a new sinter plant with respective an-
nual capacities of 537,000 tons of coke and 2.6 million tons of raw sinter.
These are sufficient to meet the iron requirements of Stage II. A new blast
furnace will be installed with a rated capacity of 5,050 tons per day (appro-
ximately 1.8 million TPY) of hot metal and together with the two existing
furnaces, will be able to meet the hot metal requirements of the further ex-
pansion (Stage III) to 3.5 million TPY raw steel (para. 8.12). As discussed
in Part I (para. 6.09) this temporary oversize of blast furnace capacity is
common to all three expansion projects, and the Bank therefore received as-
surances during negotiations that the Government will consult with the Bank
prior to santioning any new flat steel plants that are primarily oriented to-
wards the domestic market before completion of Stage III expansions. USIMINAS'
steelmaking capacity will be increased by the installation of a third BOF ves-
sel of 70 tons capacity in the existing steel plant and of a second steel
plant comprising two BOF vessels of 160 tons capacity each as well as two con-
tinous casting machines capable of producing about 1.0 million tons of slabs
per year.
4.05      In the rolling mill a new 160" wide plate mill and a 5-stand cold
reduction mill, together with pickling and shear lines will be added, while
the existing reversing mill will be converted into a temper mill. Improve-
ments will also be made in the water and energy systems and in internal
transportation movement.



- 12 -
4.06      Major installations specifically included in Phase II are the blast
furnace, the new BOF steel plant, the two continuous casting machines and the
plate mill. Their design incorporates the latest technology for low cost,
high quality production of steel. The Company has been operating most of this
type of equipment, albeit of smaller size, for some years, except for the con-
tinuous slab-casting machines, which are a rather recent technical development.
Initial operating difficulties cannot therefore be altogether excluded despite
the assistance to be given by the Japanese technical partners. However, such
potential difficulties are not expected to take on serious proportions and any
foreseeable temporary shortfall of slabs could be largely made up by increased
slab production from conventional ingots. Therefore, considering the Com-
pany's experience in operating its existing equipment at a high level of per-
formance, no major difficulties are foreseen in handling the new equipment.
B.   Ecology
4.07      The project includes pollution control devices of an estimated
cost of US$11 million equivalent, which will effectively minimize the en-
vironmental impact of the expansion. In addition, they will help to reduce
pollution from existing installations to a satisfactory level. They include
equipment designed to upgrade the dust collection and gas purification sys-
tems at the existing BOF shop and a newer and more efficient gas collection
system for the second BOF shop, facilities to reduce smoke emissions in the
coke ovens, and biological treatment of the ammonia liquor from the existing
coke oven by-product plant. These installations will provide satisfactory
protection of the environment in the operation of the plant (Annex 8).
C.   Labor Force
4.08      In June 1971, USIMINAS had 6,721 employees, of whom 5,824 were
at the plant and 897 at the head and regional offices. At the end of 1971
about 500 persons were transferred to the Company's subsidiary USIMEC. Dur-
ing 1972, therefore, USIMINAS will produce about 1 million tons of raw steel
with around 5,400 plant employees. This is equivalent to about 15 man hours
per ton of finished product as compared to about 13 man hours for the U.S.
and Japan in 1970. During project execution employment will gradually in-
crease by about 3,400 persons to meet the manpower requirements of the ex-
pansion scheme. Satisfactory plans for recruiting, training and for addi-
tional housing in Ipatinga exist. At full production, the index of man
hours per ton of finished product is expected to fall to about 11. The new
employees are expected to come mainly from the State of Minas Gerais where
the plant is located.  Those without prior experience in large steel works
will receive intensive in-plant training of one or two years; present employees
selected for promotion to supervisory positions will be sent for training to
Japan.
D.   Project Execution and Supervision
4.09      As mentioned previously, while much of the planning for Phase I,
including detailed engineering and foreign procurement, was carried out by
Nippon-USIMINAS in Japan, and USIMINAS handled Brazilian procurement, the



- 13 -
Company's department of Technical Development (TD), will have much broader
responsibilities for Phase II. These broadened duties will include detailed
engineering, procurement and overall project supervision. Although USIMINAS
has staff experienced in project execution and construction supervision,
additional staff is required for the Company to cope effectively with the
enlarged responsibilities and work load arising from execution of the
project. Some senior technical staff will be seconded from NSC and the
Company will recruit other Brazilian and possibly expatriate personnel to
help carry out procurement and supervise execution.
4.10      The Company is aware of the need to build up its project implemen-
tation capabilities, and contracted BAHINT to assist it in determining the
organizational and staff requirements of the TD. This study is expected to
be completed by April 1972. During negotiations, the Bank received assurances
that the Company will give serious consideration to BAHINT's recommendations
and discuss their implementation with the Bank. In particular, the Bank feels
that the creation of the position of a deputy director and of a division for
legal and contractual matters should be included in TD's reorganization. As
indicated in Part I, para. 10.02, the Bank and IDB, in order to strengthen
their own supervision efforts, will engage an engineering consultant to
monitor closely the execution of the project.
E.   Construction Schedule
4.11      The time schedule for both phases of the project is shown in
Annex 9.  Phase I started in 1970 and is expected to be essentially com-
pleted by the end of 1973. About 70% of equipment orders have been placed
and construction is on schedule. With regard to Phase II, procurement action
has begun and the new blast furnace, a key item in the project execution
schedule, is expected to be awarded in April 1972. The majority of new
facilities are to go into operation during the second half of 1974 and the
continuous casting machines and plate mill in the first half of 1975. The
project implemention period planned for Phase II is short; however, the
present market situation for steel mill equipment favors reduced delivery
periods. Moreover, USIMINAS has divided its bids into larger packages than
CSN and COSIPA in the expectation that procurement and construction can thus
be accelerated. In addition, the past performance of the Company indicates
its ability to meet construction schedules successfully. Provided therefore
that USIMINAS strengthens its Department of Technical Development satis-
factorily (para. 4.10), the construction schedule appears achievable.

5.02      The capital cost estimates were originally prepared as of February
1971, based on stuidies of N'C and Nippon-USIMINAS and were expressed in
February 1971 US dollars. Cost estimates for equipment were based on inter-
national prices, and estimates for civil engineering and construction on
actual costs taken from the ongoir.g Fhase I, plus a 10% provision for physi-
cal contingencies.
5.03      To compensate for the currency changes in the second half of
1971, th?. cost estimates were adjusted upward by 8% except for certain
Japanese cquipment for Phase I where the sellers absorbed the first 5%
of adjustment and an additional 5% adjustment was considered adequate.
To allow for further e:pected price increases during project execution,
all yearly disbursement esti.mates were then escalated hy 5% per annum from
1972 r.. As a result, cast estimates contain a price escalation of about
10%. In view o'f the prescnt cnmpetitive market in steel mill equipment,
these adjustments apprar .-dequate and the capital cost estimates are con-
sidered realfiti..
5.0'      Brazil is cxpected to supply equipment for about US$87 million,
or about 29% of total estimated equipment costs of both phases. The foreign
currency cost of both vhlPses la estimated at US$299 million or 52% of total
projezt cont (AFinex 12;8.
B.  Working Capital
5.05      Incremental working capital for both phases is estimated at
US$76,.  mi.llion equivae,cn, primarily in local currency.  Of this amount,
acme USM$6.1 m4lllrn bwo;id be required by the end of 1973 (completion of
Phase I) and the remainder (U3$70.3 rillion) on completion of Phase II.
The assumptions on  hiich these estimates are based are given in Annex 13.
5.06      The small increase in working capital during 1971-1973 is
explained by t:he relatively -.Anor rise in production during that period and
by the CvT,pany's intcrpt ion tco. reduce its present stores and raw material
inventories.  While Zhe Tiank considers the decrease attainable, USIMINAS
is expected to be able t.o obtain additional short-term borrowings to finance
any foreseeable .vorking capital Deeds in excess of what is now expected.
C.   Financial Plan
5.07      Financing of Phase I had been arranged before the Bank was asked
to participate in Phase II and financing of each phase of the project is
therefore described separately. The Company will provide from internal
cash generation US$45.2 million for Phase I and US$89.4 million for Phase II
totalling US$134.6 million equivalent.  The financial plans are shown below:

5.08      At the end of 1971 USIMINAS had equity of US$211.5 million (para.
2.20).  BNDE has agreed to provide for both phases US$150 million in addition
to the US$31.4 loan already provided for Phase I. To maintain USIMINAS sound
financially, it was agreed that BNDE would purchase from the US$150 million
shares to the extent necessary to provide a 50:50 debt/equity capital struc-
ture with the balance as loan. On the basis of the Company's project earnings,
BNDE would provide about US$75 million in shares and US$75 million in loan
during 1972-75.
5.09      BNDE's loan portion will include US$9.4 million in foreign exchange
to cover the 10% downpayment necessary for bilaterally-financed eqipment.
Its loans will carry interest at 5% plus monetary correction and will be re-
paid over 16 years, including 4 years grace. Further details on commitment
fees, commissions and charges for supervision and inspection on all loans in
Phase I and II are shown in Annex 14. The share portion of BNDE's commitment
will be used half for common shares and half for 6% cumulative preference
shares having no voting rights. These shares will be offered to all existing
shareholders and BNDE will purchase any unsubscribed shares.
5.10      Phase I includes a Japanese credit of US$67 million equivalent
carrying interest of 6.2% and repayment over 15 years including three years'
grace. For Phase IT, a total of TS$105 million is being requested from the
Rlank and IDB in a-ratio of 60/40. These loans are assumed to be for 15-1/2



- 17 -
years including a grace period of 4-1/2 years with an interest of 7-1/4 on
the Bank loan plus a guarantee fee to the Government of 1-3/4X and 8. on the
IDB loan, identical to the Bank/IDB loans to CSN. The terms of all bilateral
credits 1/ (US$84.6 million) are expected to be for 15 years, including 3-1/2
years grace period with average interest of 7-1/2%. The Government will take
all reasonable measures for obtaining such bilateral financing.
5.11      The Company's projected cash generation is expected to be sufficient
to meet the needs of the financial plan including incremental working capital.
However, assurances were obtained during negotiations that the Government
provide funds needed to cover project cost overruns or a shortfall in financ-
ing during project implementation. These funds would be provided on terms
acceptable to the Bank, and cover requirements both in foreign and local
currencies.
D.   Summary of Sources and Application of Funds during 1971-75
5.12      The following table summarizes the estimated sources and application
of funds for both Phase I and II of the expansion during 1971-75, the main

VI. PROCUREMENT
A.  General Procurement
6.01      Equipment to be fihanded under the Bank and IDB loans (US$105 mil-
lion) will be procured by international competitive bidding, with Brazilian
manufacturers receiving a 15% preference, which is less than the prevailing
import tariff on steel mill equipment. This is independent of the fact that,
as mentioned previously, import duties have been waived for Phases I and II.
Financing will be shared between the Bank and IDB on a 60/40 ratio. The
baLa -ce of imported equipment, estimated at US$94 million, will be bid among
suppliers of the countries providing bilateral credits. NSC as engineering
and operating consultant of USIMINAS will not bid under Phase II. The other
shareholders of Nippon-USIMINAS, however, enjoy no advantage in respect of
technical or other information, are in no way involved in the management of
the plant, and would therefore be allowed to participate in the international
bidding process. The list of equipment to be financed by the Bank is shown
in Annex 16, and further details on procurement are found in Part I, para.
9.01-9.02.
6.02      Construction and installation work will be financed locally and
will be bid competitively in Brazil. During negotiations, however, the
Bank reached an understanding with the Government and the borrower, similar
to that obtained in the CSN project, that for those civil works and erection
contracts that are suitable for international competitive bidding, foreign
quotations would be solicited if it is apparent that the work load of Brazil-
ian construction firms is such that they could carry out the contracts only
with substantial increases in cost or unacceptable delays.
6.03      Confirmation was obtained from the Government during negotiations
that it will expedite registration of contracts and issuance of import
licenses.
B.   Allocation of Bank's Loan
6.04      Brazilian manufacturers are expected to win under conditions of
international competitive bidding up to 38% of the equipment financed by the
Bank and IDB loans. This estimate is based on the assumption that Brazilian
supplies of equipment to the project qualify for the same incentives as those
normally granted for exports. With these incentives, the allocation of the
Bank loan would be as follows:

/1   Including an estimated foreign exchange component of Brazilian
equipment of US$6 million equivalent.
6.05      The estimated disbursement schedule for the Bank's loan is shown
in Annex 16. It is based on detailed estimates of order placements and ex-
pected delivery times for equipment in line with the construction schedule.
VII. PRODUCTION COSTS AND SELLING PRICES-/
A.   Raw Materials
7.01      The availability of domestic iron ore of good quality has been an
important factor in the development of Brazil's integrated steel plants. As
the delivered cost of iron ore to industrialized countries may contain a
freight element as high as 60%, USIMINAS' costs of iron fines are very favor-
able. Based on delivered prices of US$3.2 per ton of iron ore fines and on
US$5.0 per ton of natural pellet ore, the ore cost per ton of finished steel
produced by USIMINAS is US$6.0. In contrast, plants in Japan and Western
Europe have a typical ore cost per ton of finished steel of US$17 to 24.
Offsetting this inherent advantage is Brazil's need to import large quanti-
ties of high grade coking coal over relatively long distances and the Govern-
ment's insistence that a certain quantity of the total coal requirements be
obtained domestically, the cost of which is above that of better grade im-
ported coal. As pointed out in Part I of the report the Government of Brazil
will not require USIMINAS to obtain more than 20% of its coal requirements
from domestic sources after 1976 as long as they remain of low quality.
7.02      USIMINAS7 coal cost per ton of finished steel now amounts to
about US$35 but is expected to drop to US$27 after 1976 due to a reduction
in coke rate resulting from the use of the large, ne-e blast furnace with
oil injection and due to the reduced share of local coal consumed. Both
figures are higher than indicated cost of around US$18 per ton in Japan
1/   All values are expressed in US$ of 1971.



- 20 -
and US$22 in Western Europe. Overall, USIMINAS's combined cost per ton
of finished steel for the principal raw materials, iron ore and coal, would
be reduced to about US$35 including US$2 fuel cost for oil injection. This
is about equal to the present lowest costs in Japan or Western Europe.
7.03      Brazil has virtually unlimited iron ore and hence an assured
supply. Moreover, USJMINAS hao a long-term supply contract with CVRD.
A full discussion of Brazil's i.-on ore resources is contained in the
appraisal of the Mineracoes Brazileiras Reunidas S.A. Iron Ore Project
(PI-10) dated June 16, 1971. The Bank has reviewed the outlook for coking
coal over the next decade and concluded that while short and medium-term
imbalances in the market cannot be ruled out, there are no serious long-
term problems in the availability of coking coal, particularly for the
Company which has long-term supply contracts for both domestic and imported
coal. The other principal raw materials are limestone and dolomite. These
are available from sources about 320 km and 220 km distance, respectively,
from the plant. No difficulties in their supply are foreseen. Further de-
tails regarding raw materials, including quality and sources, are given in
Annex 17 and Map 2. Transportation and shipping facilities used by the
Company are adequate and are being improved and extended. Water and elec-
tric power supply are sufficient, and together with some expansions, will
meet the increased requirements after completion of the Bank-financed
project.
B.   Production Costs
7.04      USIMINAS' production costs for representative products are shown
below for 1970 (1.0 million TPY) and for 1976 (2.4 million TPY) after com-
pletion of the expansion.

/1   Including raw materials, labor and supplies, but excluding general
overhead expenses, depreciation and ICM tax.
7.05      The economies of scale achieved by the expansion and the impact
of new technology are seen in all product stages, from pig iron to finished
steel. Variable costs per ton of finished steel, exclusive of excise and
sales taxes, will be about US$63 at full production after expansion. Fixed



- 21 -
costs are estimated to be about US$58 per ton on average, giving a total
average production cost of US$121 per ton of finished steel. The unit in-
puts and operating costs are considered realistic and are competitive with
those obtained in steelworks of similar size in industrialized countries.
Further details on the Company's production costs are given in Annex 18.
C.   Selling Prices
7.06      USIMINAS's selling price assumptions, shown in Annex 19 are
based on February 1971 prices. The average selling price ex-plant of
USIMINAS's flat steel products (excluding sales tax) is about US$147 per
ton and, on a product-by-product basis, is in line with Western European
prices. Minor price decreases for domestic sales have been assumed from
1976 on, when full production of 2.4 million TPY is reached. Maximum
prices are established periodically by the Interministerial Price Council
(CIP), based on cost increases beyond the Company's control, i.e. for raw
materials, labor, depreciation, etc.  The policy of CIP is discussed in
Part I, para. 2.19.
7.07      Also as discussed in Part I, paras. 5.10 and 5.11, the Government
agreed during negotiations on the loan to CSN that steel prices should re-
main at levels which would be reasonably competitive with imports and permit
the Company to (a) earn an adequate return on capital under efficient operat-
ing conditions, (b) meet their financial obligations, (c) contribute to the
financing of further expansion, and (d) be reasonably competitive. It was
also agreed that savings in production costs as a result of the steel expan-
sion program might be shared by Brazilian consumers by a reduction of in-
dividual steel prices in real terms. To this end the Government and the
Bank will consult as necessary to determine whether steel prices are appro-
priate.
7.08      Moreover, the Bank reached agreement with USIMINAS during nego-
tiations that the Company should take all reasonable steps to ensure that
its average February 1971 price for finished products sold on the domestic
market would not be reduced in real terms prior to 1976 without prior con-
sultation with the Bank.

3.02      After completion of Phase II, net sales will increase by about
US$162 million (or by 117%) between 1971 and 1976.  During this period,
profit before taxes is expected to increase (by 170%) and net profit after
taxes by about 163%. The Company's net profit after taxes in 1976 will
account for a satisfactory 17% of sales. Reflecting both the increase
in profit levels from the expansion as well as the higher depreciation
charges, internal cash generation will increase from US$40 million in 1972
to US$102 million in 1978, an increase of 155%. The technical and com-
mercial assumptions underlying the forecast are considered sound and the
projected profit levels realistic.
B.   Break-Even Point
8.03      After completion of the project, the Company's profit break-even
point is about at 66% of production capacity or 1.2 million tons of finished
steel per year. Alternatively, prices at full capacity could fall by 17%
before the Company would show a loss. During the subsequent year, assuming
full production, prices could fall about 21% before the Company's cash
generation would be zero. Durther details on the break-even levels are
found in Annex 20.
C.   Financial Rate of Return
8.04      The 2.4 million TPY expansion scheme (Phase I and II) provides a
satisfactory financial rate of return (after taxes) of 12.6%, despite the
fact that the blast furnace capacity installed in Phase II will not be fully
utilized until the further Stage III expansion takes place. Details on the
assumptions used and on the sensitivity tests are found in Annex 21.

8.06      The principal risks facing this project are a delay in project
completion due to the tight construction schedule, and the possibility tfhat7
due to the technical complexities of the equipment, the new continuous sLab
casting equipment will run at reduced capacity in the early years of opera-
tion. An overall delay of one year in project completion, together with a
15% project cost increase, would reduce the return to 8.5%. Considering
the timely completion of prior projects by the Company and the outside as-
sistance to be obtained, delays in project completion should be minimal.
While it is recognized that the new continuous slab casting equipment may
operate at below capacity for some time, such an event would not reduce
the return to an unacceptable level and, with the technical assistance to be
provided by NSC, it is felt that production difficulties can be overcome
reasonably quickly. Other than this, the project is most sensitive to a com-
bination of adverse circumstances such as an increase in project and oper-
ating costs of 10% each. Such an event will result in a yield slightly in
excess of 9% which, while marginal is acceptable. Thus, on an overall basis,
the project shows satisfactory financial returns under foreseen circumstances.
D.   Financial Position
8.07      Forecast balance sheets through 1986 are contained in Annex 15.
Significant data from these are shown below:

Long-Term Deb/Equity Ratio                   31:69  51:49  43:57  36:64  25:75
8.08      The above figures reflect the situation as projected before loan
negotiations assuming BNDE's part of the project financing at a fixed pro-
portion between loans and capital. Based on these assumptions, a slight
squeeze in available cash would have occurred in 1974 when Phase I is expected
to be completed. A short-term credit which would have become necessary in
1974 could have been repaid during 1975. Except for 1972 when projected
equity is still higher than long-term debt as a result of the 1971 financial
consolidation of USIMINAS during subsequent years of project implementation,
the long-term debt/equity ratio would have been close to 50:50.
8.09      Negotiations resulted in an agreement between USIMINAS, BNDE and
the Bank that (a) BNDE's total financial contribution to USIMINAS' expansion
project will be US$181 million of which US$31 million were already disbursed
before 1972 and US$150 million will be disbursed according to the Company's
requirements during 1972-75, and (b) during these years, a long-term debt/
equity ratio of not less than 50:50 will be maintained. It was also agreed
that the current ratio after preference dividends should not fall below
1.3:1 and that common dividends should only be declared if, after such divi-
dends and after preference dividends, the current ratio would not drop below
1.5:1. Finally, the Company agreed to invest in fixed assets - other than
the project - not more than US$8 million equivalent per year including not
more than US$4 million in USIMEC and other possible future subsidiaries. New
subsidiaries can only be created with the prior consent of the Bank. During
1972-1980, USIMINAS will also limit its lending, advancing money, guaranteeing
debt or investing to US$2.0 million equivalent per year. Accumulation of this
amount is possible up to US$6 million in any one year. Limitations on addi-
tional long-term borrowing by USIMINAS are described in para. 8.11.
E.   Debt Service Coverage
8.10      Based on the original financial plan for the expansion, USIMINAS
showed the following debt service coverage forecasts:



- 25 -
Long-Term Debt Service Coverage Forecasts
Year                       1972       19        176        1978       1980
Times Covered              1.4        1.4       2.3        2.0        2.6
Though the debt service coverage is low through Phase I, substantial
improvements are expected to take place during subsequent years.  Once
Phase II is completed, a satisfactory coverage of 2.0 and above is
reached and maintained. The debt service coverage that is expected to
result from the minor change in the Company's capital structure as
negotiated will only be slightly lower than shown above; however, that
is fully acceptable in the light of the assurance that at end of cons-
truction the Company's capitalization will contain at least 50% equity.
8.11      During negotiations agreement was reached that the Company
will not contract additional long-term debt if (consolidated with sub-
sidiaries) as a consequence total long-term debt exceeds equity and,
after project completion the debt service coverage (again consolidated
with subsidiaries) is less than two times.
F.   Further Expansion (Stage III)
8.12      USIMINAS plans a further expansion of its steelmaking and
rolling capacity to meet the expected increase of steel demand in Brazil.
Stage III would increase the production capacity from 2.4 million TPY
of raw steel to 3.5 million TPY. The timing of this stage depends on
the actual future demand for flat steel products in Brazil; however,
completion is tentatively scheduled for 1980. Total capital costs for
this stage, including additional working capital are estimated to be
about US$220 million including roughly US$50 million equivalent for
estimated price escalation until 1980. To meet these outlays USIMINAS
expects to borrow about US$76 million and to provide the balance from
internal cash generation. To assure that the financing of this expan-
sion will also be carried out on a sound basis, restrictions on long-
term borrowings as mentioned in para. 8.11 were agreed on. Annex 22
shows summarized financial statements superimposing costs of and bene-
fits from Stage III on the financial projections for the 2.4 million
TPY expansion scheme.

IX. ECONOMIC JUSTIFICATION OF THE PROJECT
A.  Economic Rate of Return
9.01      Based on estimated import prices of steel for domestic sales and
export prices (excluding taxes) for export sales, over an assumed 18-year
life of assets, the project yields an internal economic rate of return of
11.5%, despite the fact that the blast furnace capacity installed under
Phase II will not be fully utilized until further expansion takes place.
The underlying assumptions and details of the economic analysis (including
sensitivity tests) are given in Annex 21. The economic return is affected
greatly by changes in the sales price. A 10% decrease in sales price reduces
the return to 8.3%. The project is less sensitive to changes in project and
operating costs. A 10% increase in the former reduces the rate of return to
only 10.2%, while a similar increase in operating costs reduces the return to
9.6%. A combination of selling prices 5Z lower than assumed and operating
costs 5% higher will still produce an economic return of 9.0%. Thus, the
project provides a satisfactory return under foreseeable circumstances and a
marginally acceptable return under adverse circumstances.
B.   Competitiveness and Protection Required
9.02      As indicated in para. 7.06 and discussed in greater detail in
Part I of this report, selling prices for finished flat rolled steel
products in Brazil are in line with those prevailing in Western Europe.
A comparison has been made of the CIF import prices and the domestic prices
used in the financial analysis. It reveals that the domestic price of
plates and hot rolled products, the principal steel products to be produced
by USIMINAS, is lower than the equivalent import price, while that of cold
rolled products is somewhat higher. Since the import price for USININAS'
overall product mix is on average similar to domestic prices, the project
is economically viable even if the present tariff protection of about 20%
on the Company's product mix in Brazil were not given. Of late steel ex-
port prices in dollar terms have increased primarily as a consequence of
the recent currency realignements. These changes will be discussed in more
detail in the revised Part I report which will be issued at the time the
loan to COSIPA is presented to the Executive Directors.
C.   Estimated Foreign Exchange Savings
9.03      The present net foreign exchange savings in 1971 without expan-
sion are about US$74 million per year. At full production after completion
of the expansion scheme, annual net foreign savings will increase to about
US$153 million. Thus, the estimated foreign exchange cost of the project
of about US$300 million will be offset by the project's incremental net
foreign exchange savings of about US$80 million annually during less than
four years of full operation. The project, therefore, will have a bene-
ficial impact on Brazil also in terms of foreign exchange. Further details
are given in Annex 23.

ANNEX 1
DESCRIPTION OF PRESENT FACILITIES
Coke Oven Facilities
Coke-making equipment consists of 100 ovens, in two equally sized
batteries.  The dimensions of each oven are 400 mm x 4,000 mm x 13,200 mm,
and they have a dry charge capacity of 13.14 tons of coal. The coking time
is about 19 hours. Oven machinery includes two coal-charging cars, two coke-
pushers, two coke-guide cars, two quenching cars, two electric locomotives
and two sets of coke cutters.
Facilities are available for the recovery of coke-oven gas, tar
and tar-distillation products, ammonia liquor, as well as the lighter
aromatic hydrocarbons.
Two coal yards, one of 409000 tons and the other of 90,000 tons
capacity, are available, equipped with two sets of stackers and two aets
of jib loaders. Typically coal stocks are sufficient for about 60 days of
operations, with approximately another 25 days' coal supply available at
the port of Vitoria. about 10 railroad hours away from Ipatinga.,
Blast Furnaces and Sinter Plant
Facilities for the production of hot metal consist of two blast
fuzrnaces and associated equipment which includes a sintering plant and three
ore yards of 200 x 20 m each, one being for lump ore going directly into the
blast furnace and two for ore fines for sintering. All ore is received
dixectly from Companhia Vale do Rio Doce and discharged by a 1 car-dumper of
700 t/h capacity.
The sintering plant is a Dwight-Lloyd McKee type manufactured by
Mitsubishi. with 89.0 mW of grate area. During 1970, it produced an average
of 3,230 t/d of screened sinter, i.e.> almost 50% over its rated capacity.
Each of the two blast furnacees was originally designed with the
following characteristics:
Hearth diameter                     7,000 mm
Working volume                        891 m3
Tuyeres                                16
Iron notches                            1
Cinder notches                          2
Total heating surface             60,144 m2
Available blast temperature           960°C
Each blast furnace haa three hot blast stoves, and there is a total
of thtiree sets of electrostatic precipitators with a capacity of 60,000 Nm3/h each.
Under these conditions, the hot metal production per furnace was
limited to an average of 1,170 tons per day by the capacity of the three
existing blowers which have a maximum blast volume of 1,1400 Nm3/in. at a



ANNEX 1
Page 2
pressure of 1.2 kg/cm2 and .are driven by electric motors of 4,400 HP.  This
hot metal production correrponds to a raw steel production rate of 900,000 IPY.
However, as part of Phase I, the No. 1 furnace has been modified,
by increasing its hearth diameter from 7.0 to 7.3 meters, resulting in a
working volume of 957 m3. This is one of the contributory reasons for the
plant's reaching an output of one million TPY of raw steel in 1971.  The modifica-
tions to blast furnaces No. 1 and 2 are discussed further in Annex 7.
Steelmaking Facilities
These include wo'B0F converters of 45 tons nominal capacity now
producing at the rate of 68 tons per charge.
This larger erpacity was obtained through a small increase in the
hight of the converters -vd'thinging of the refractory lining, resulting in
a productivity of 1.5 tons per m.  The converters are supplied from two
800 tons mixers. Ingots-are teemed from any one of 8 teeming cars and strip-
ping is carried out in the'same building.
The calcining plant consists of a limestone-receiving station, a
stockyard with a capacity of 30,000 tons and three coke-fired shaft furnaces
of 50 t/d nominal capacity.  At present, because of good opexating practice.
these furnaces are productng an average of 70 t/d. The brick plant, has a
capacity to manufacture'MO0 t/month of tarred magnesite brick.
Some air pollution is at present caused at the steelmaking plant,
since the above-capacitymperation of the converters precludes effective use
of the original fume cluning equipment. This problem will be overcome wit s
the execution of the proJect (Annex 8).
Oxygen Plant
Two oxygen genemstofs of a capacity of 2,800 Nm3/h each are  resently
installed.  They deliver at 99;6% purity.  Two oxygen holders of LL0mJ each,
storing at a pressure of .22 atmospheres, are also part of this plant. The
oxygen supply system hs a  a:mum flow rate of 11,000 Nm3/h.
Slabbing Mill
Present installations consist of 3 batteries of soaking pits, one
2-high slabbing mill, one 4lab Rhear and two hot-bed units. The present
slabbing mill capacity is'mated at about 960,000 ingot TPY due to the limited
capacity of the soaking Fitis srnd hot beds.
Plate and Hot Strip Mill
A 2-high roughermeale breaker and a 4-high x 120 inch reversing
-roqghLng mill Are usod to-raduwe both 'heavy plate and strip breakdowns for
furtbker proeev*a.'ss1  to'hot r6led coil in the hot strip mill.  The six stand,
.4high tandem hot strip mill of 8&4 inch width has a yearly capacity of about
1.8 million tons of hot strip.  Downstream of this mill there are two dawn-



ANNEX 1
Page 3
coilers for coils up to 10 tons and 1.9 m diameter and a shearing line for
hot rolled sheet.
Cold Strip Mill
The existing equipment is capable of producing 150,000 t/year of
cold-rolled sheets, ranging from 0.4 to 2.3 am in thickness and 500 to 1,550
mm in width. It consists primarily of a 66" pickling line and a b-high x 66"
reversing mill capable of cold-rolling and skin-passing at a speed of 2,000 FPM.
Annealing furnace capacity of 180,000 t/year is available, with 10
furnaces of the radiant type and 3 furnaces of the direct-firing type. A DX
generator of 280 Nm3Oh and another HNX gas generator of 140 NW3/h provide the
required atmosphere.
The mill also has a 66" cold-shear line, with a capacity of 160,000
t/year and a speed of 300 FPM.
Rol        Mcka ehicles
At present the plant has 13 diesel locomotives with a tractive force
of between 25 and 35 tons and 200 railioad care moving over a rail system about
65 km  long.  This system, at the present production rate of one million raw
nteel TPY, transports about 530,000 t/month.
Heayy Oil-and Gas System
Blast furnace gas is stored in a 40,000 m3 gas holder, and used at
the hot blast stoves and mixed with coke-oven gas and heavy oi2 at the soak-
ing pits.
Coke-oven gas is stored in a 30,000 m3 gas holder and desulphurized.
It is used in the sintering and steelmaking plants, as well as in the anneal-
ing furnaces.
5team System
At present, two 35.6 t/h waste heat boilers are installed at the
steelmaking plant, producing at a pressure of 36 kg/cm2 and superheated to 2500C.
Tio small auxiliary boilers are also available.
Electrical System
The plant presently receives all its electric power from the CEMIG
system at 154 KV. This voltage is reduced to 69 KV, 11.5 KV and 3 KV, depending
on requirements.
The receiving substation has 3 primary transformers of 30 MVA each
that step down to 69 KV, with an additional transforming capacity of 6 MVA to
u.S5 KV.

Remarks on Historical Financial Statements
1.        Amex 3 of Part I gives details on the conversion of the historical
financial statements in cruzeiros into historical 13S$. Apart from the proper
conversion from cruzeiros into US$, the financial statements in US$ also in-
clude three major adjustments:
a)  The depreciation of fixed assets shown in the cruzeiro
statements is increased due to the higher actual purchase
value of equipment, since imported equipment was partly
paid in foreign currency at preferential exchange rates.
b)  The depreciation rates varying between 1% and 11% following
the Gauss-curve in the cruzeiro statements have been changed
in the IJS$ statements to straight 4% from the start of opera-
tion to 1970.
c)  The equivalent of about US$47 million of interest on loans
for equipment purchases after completion of the plant
erection were capitalized in the cruzeiro statements; the
corresponding US$ statements show these interest payments
of costs.
2.        These adjustments are the reasons for the differences in profit-
ability between the cruzeiro and the US$ income statements. The cruzeiro
income statements show profits since 1968, while the adjusted US$ income
statements show profits from 1970. The adjusted financial statements in
US$ of 1970 are the basis for the financial projections.
3.        The historical income statements on page 1 of this Annex indi-
cate annal net profits after taxes which need to be adjusted as follows:
a)  1967 cruzeiro statement
The shown loss of Cr$39.955 million has to be reduced by
Cr$13.897 million excess depreciation during previous
years resulting in a loss of Cr$26.058 million in 1967.
b)  Statementa in Historical US$ (1967-1970)
The necessary adjustments of the annual net profit after
taxes are (a) the accumulated financial cost, capitalized
during the years of operation prior to 1967 totalling US$
31.601 million equivalent was charged to the 1967 net profit,
and (b) imbalances resulting from the conversion into his-
torical dollars of assets and liabilities were balanced by
transferring a translation loss or profit for the respective
years to the income statements. The historical dollar income
statements for 1967-1971 have therefore to be adjusted as
follow:s

ANNEX 7
Description of the 2.4 Million TPY Expansion Scheme
Overall Concept
The description and comments that follow refer to both phases of
the expansion, of which phase II is the subject of the loan application.
Some reference is also made to the further expansion stage to 3.5 million
raw steel TPY (Stage III) expected to become operational at the beginning
of the next decade.
Annex 1 describes the principal existing production facilities
and their capacities.
The main factors that characterize tho overall expansion project of
lUSIMINAS are the following:
a) increased production of coke from a mixture of imported and
domestic coals, in which the latter component will be reduced
from the present 1/3 to about 1/5 by 1975;
b) expansion of sintering capacity to permit the use of a 100%
sinter burden in the blast furnace;
c) expansion of hot metal capacity by the addition of a large,
modern blast furnace with provision for high top pressure
operation and fuel injection;
d) expansion of the existing BOF steelaikdng plant and instal-
lation of a second larger BOF steelmaking plant;
e) slab production by continuous casting supplemented by ingot
casting and primary reduction in the existing slabbing mill;
f)  installation of a new single-stand, h-high 160# plate mill;
g) a substantial increase of cold-rolling capacity through the
installation of a new 5-stand tandem mill.
At the completion of the project there will be an excess of hot metal
capacity and No. 2 blast furnace will be blown out. Increases beyond the 2.4
million raw steel TPY capacity will require the relightinig of No. 2 blast furnace
and the installation of a third BOF converter in No. 2 shop, together with ad-
ditional oxygen generation capacity.
A flow sheet of the plant, as it will be after the completion of the
project is shown in Annex25. A long-term sales and production plan is provided
in Annex 14  which however  disregards the increased production planned under
the Stage IfI expansion wh?ch may-be implemented from 1977 onwards. Furthermore,
a general layout of the plant is shown in Annex 2, in which the existing facili-
ties are distinguished from those to be added under the project.

New Ins tallations
The new facilitite to be installed under the project are described
below with some reference to provisions made for Stage III.
Coke Oven Facilities
In Phase I a battsry of 55 six-meter-high ovens, 45 cm wide and 15.7
m long, with a dry charge cxpecity of 27.3 tons will be added.  The coal yard
will be increased by 15,000 m. , bringing its total area to 55,000 m2.
No additional coke ovens are requited for Phase II, but the coal yard
will be subject to a further incrrvase of 25,000 m2 aid one moft ttapker-wheel
loader will be required.  hk addition, some 700 m of belt convbyors wi]l be
installed.
For Stage III, a we* battery of 55 ovens, similar to the ones described
above is foreseen, togethwr with additional coal handling equipment and yard space.
Ore Yards and Sinter Plant
The existing thrus ore-yards will be enlarged and us4d fqr ore blending,
by the introductian of a new double-wheel reclaimer.  Furthermore, b twen the
car-dumper and the yards, a new ftin ore yard and blending bins wt31i be installed.
Phase I entails the MM9tlltaUM of a second sintetibg plant of 1T0 m 2
grate area. This will prst-d'e 00sugh sintering capacity to pWft*t the use of
lOQ% sinter in the blast fumnace charge.
Biast Furnace
The existing No.. 1 t*~*t has alrwady been enlarged, Oheae_s No. 2 blast
furnace will be blown out atter the start-up of the proposed No. 3 furnace and
rebuilt as part of the Stage rII expansion. The following sunmarizes the present.
and future characteristics of each of the two existing blast furnaces:

It can be seen that the rebuilding of the two furnaces includes the
addition of oil injection equipment for a rate of about 35 kg/t of hot metal,
with a peak capacity of 70 kg/t. This will bring about an appreciable reduction
in coke rate.
The hot metal requirements of the 2.4 million TPY phase necessitate
the building of No. 3 blast furnace. Its main characteristics will be:
Hot metal production, maximum per calendar day    5,500 t/d
Hot metal production, maximum per operating day   5,800 t/d

The furnace is designed to operate at a fuel rate of 520 kg. per ton
of hot metal. Of this total, 60 kg. (with a maximum of 90 kg.) will consist of
oil, resulting in a coke rate of about 460 kg.
As shown, the maximum output of iron from the No. 3 blast furnace is
expected to be 5,800 t/d, when operating under optimum conditions. Thus, there
is need for two sets of blowers of 29,000 KW each, driven by a steam turbine.



ANNEX 7
Page 4
At the compietion of the project, hot metal production has to attain
a.level of 2,167,4O0 t/year, equivalent to about 6,200 t/d. It will be seen
that., after completion of Na. 3 blast furnace, excess iron making capacity will
be available. Consequently, No. 2 furnace will be blown out and rebuilt in the
same manner as No. 1. It is planned to put No. 2 furnace back into production
at the start of     Stage III, for which no additional hot metal capacity will
have to be installed.
Steelmaking Facilities
As part of Phase I, an additional BOF converter with a nominal
capacity of 70 t/cbarge will be installed in the existing steeltaking plant.
This- will allow the-plant to ope.rate on a 3/2 pattern, i.e., two converters
operating at any one time with the third one down for relining. The capacity
of the overhead travelling cranes is to be increased and 13,000 PN3th of oxygen
generating capacity and a.200 t/d rotary kiln for lime production will also be
added. This will permit this steel plant to reach its ultimat* capacity of
about l. million raw st.eea
The new No. 2 BOF pleat will be designed for an annual capaci.ty of 1.75
million tons of raw steel. It will consist of two 160-ton converters, and an
oxygen system to supply 32,000 NmP/h.  Hot metal will be rece&ved in ten to.pedo
cars of 250 tons each.
The plant will b -prow,4ed with an OG system to recover the waste gas.
It will also have a bay for conv_wntional ingot casting, using, teeming wagons of
240 t capacity. A scrap baling pres with a capacity of 10,0W tV/o.nth will be
provided. There will be a 1^41 _and tundisb repair bay. Strip Jng will be
carried out in a separate buildi.g, between the No. 2 steel plant and the slabbinri,
Mill.
Two 2-strand continuoy slab casting machines are designed to operate
in the following production ranges:
THICKNESS:           In mm          160           250
WIDTH:               In mm           940        1,750
LENGTH:              In mm        h,000         7,500
A maximum preduction of 500,000 t/year per machine wiwd, be possible
based on the projected mix of 12 slab thicknesse, as long as the plant operates
with two converters.
A new brick plant for the large new converters will be required; its
capacity will be 700 tVwnth, with.1provision far future expansion. A new rotary
kiln of 300 t/day capacity will be added to the calcining plant.
Two fuarther genera1ori of(l'l ,000  AN3/h each will be added to the present
oxygen generating capacity of 49,400' Yb/h under each of the two staps.  This
cvygen will be used not only for steolmaking, but also for blast enrichment to No.
1 and No. 3 blast furnaces, and various miscellaneous applications.

'ilabbing Mill
U1nder Phase I, it is planned to install two more batteries of soaki1g
pits, one ingot weighing scale, one slab weighing sca_.e, and one slab cooling unit an'
conditioning unit. This will increase slabbing capacity and bring about an improve-
ment in yield and quality.
The above will be complemented in Phase II by a further battery of soak-
ing pits, an additional charging crane of 20/30 tons capacity for the soaking pits
and one hot scarfing machine for surface dressing. In this manner, the capacity
of the soaking pits, slabbing mill and cooling beds will be raised to a level of
1,800,000 t/year.
Plate and Hot Strip Mill
Under Phase I, a further slab-reheating furnace will be installed to
increase the hot-strip mill capacity. In addition, one hot-skin pass line will
be installed to improve the surface quality of the hot-rolled coil and sheet
which are sold as such. Both plate and hot-strip will continue to be produced
on the existing hot strip mill until the new plate mill included in Phase II
will start production in 1975. The addition of a third slab-reheating furnace,
under Phase II, will bring the capacity of the existing mill to 1,526,000 t/year
of hot strip only, since the production of plate mill will be transferred to the
new plate mill.
The new plate mill facilities will include one slab reheating furnace,
one hydraulic scale breaker, one 160" 4-high reversing mill, a 4-high leveller
and hot shear, a 160" shearing line, one (existing) 120" shearing line, and one
normalizing furnace. Its initial capacity will be 800,000 t/year of plates.
The single 4-high stand will be used for both roughing and finishing
operations. At the initial level of plate production the cheaper single-stand
installation is considered preferable to a two-stand arrangement, even though
the latter is said to provide yearly economies of US$200,000 in roll consumption,
and some reduction of crown on the plates. USIMINAS expects the quality of the
plate produced on the new mill to be at least as good as that presently manu-
factured. The second 4-high stand is projected for Stage III, together with a
fourth slab reheating furnace. In addition, slab and plate shipping yards will
be installed, as well as corresponding materials-handling equipment.
Cold Strip Mill
Under Phase I a 66" 5-stand, tandem cold-rolling mill with a runout
speed of 2,500 FPM will be installed, providing a rolling capacity of 540,000
t/year. This mill will be able to roll strip of thicknesses down to 0.4 mm.
In the layout, the future installation of an electrolytic cleaning line has also
been considered.
At the same time, a second, 56" pickling line with 300,000 t/year
capacity will be installed, together with an additional 10 annealing furnaces
with a capacity of 168,000 t/year. Another part of this Phase will be a 56"
shear line with a capacity of 138,000 t/year. Under these conditions, the
bottleneck would be annealing capacity which is in the order of 470,000 t/year.



ANNEX 7
Page 6
Thus, while Phase I will bring cold rolling capacity to the deL.ired
level, the cold mill facilities will only come into balance with the addition
in Phase II of 3 more annealing furnaces, together with an HN gas generator
with a capacity of 1,090 Nm3/h, and a 56" recoiling line, with a capacity of
10,000 t/month.
At the completion of Phase II the present reversing cold mill. will
be modified in order to function strictly as a skin-pass mill with the i-apabilitiy
of processing coils of up to 30 tons. A production of 540,000 t/year of cold-
rolled coil and sheet is envisaged.  Thicknesses would be in the rarge of' 0.
mm to 2.3 mm, and widths from 500 mm to 1,550 mm.
Rolling Stock and Vehicles
As the output of the plant increases, corresponding additions will
have to be made to the rolling stock.  Thus, four diesel locomotives of 70 t.onz
tractive force, plus another 41 railroad cars and about 5 moree kilometers ot
rail will be added under Phase I.
Phase II includes the addition of 10 torpedo cars for the transport.s--
tion of hot metal, 12 teeming cars, 7 diesel locomotives with a tractive forc.
between 40 and 70 tons, 180 railroad cars, and about 20 km of track to the rail-
road network.
Heavy Oil System
As already mentioned, heavy oil and oxygen injection facilities are
foreseen as part of the rebuild of the existing blast furnaces ana as origina.l
equipment for the new blast furnace.
No additional gas holder and compressor capacity will be required for
Phase II. However, two sets of pumps for oil injection in the No. 3 blast furnace
will be provided, each delivering 30 t/h, at 10 atm discharge pressure. Pue to
the use of HN gas instead of -NX, there will be no need for a further desulphluri-
zation unit.
Steam System
A third waste heat boiler of similar charact.eristics to the ones already
installed will be added to produce steam from the third ROF converter as part of
Phase I.
Some additional steam will also be required for the rolling mills and
pickling line as well as for the heavy oil firing of the top zone of the con-
tinuous slab reheating furnaces. A significant proportion of the steam will
come from the B30  wa.ste heat boilers.  Thus, in order to avoid a steam or coke-
oven gas deficit, the periodic repairs of the slabbing mill will have to coincide
with a shut-down of No. 1 steel plant.
The blowers of No. 3 blast furnace will be driven by a steam turbine,
which will use high pressure steam from two boilers at the rate of 120 t/h, at a
pressure of 65 kg/cm-, and a temperature of h85°C.  These boilers will be fired
by heavy oil and blast furnace gas.  They will have spare capacity of 30 t/h, to
be used to make up any deficit in the steam system when No. 1 steel plant iF down.



ANNEX 7
Page 7
Electrical System
As part of Phase I, one of the primary 30 MVA transformers of the
receiving substation will be replaced by one of 50 MVA. A transformer station
of 3 MVA will be installed at the sintering plant and the transforming capacity
at the oxygen plant will be increased to 24.5 MWA and that at the cold mill to
34.5 MVA.
Under Phase II an additional 9 MVA of transforming capacity will have
to be added for blast furnace No. 3, with a similar installation to be provided
at the No. 2 steel plant. Furthermore, 2h.5 MVA of transforming capacity will
have to be added to the oxygen plant and another 4.5 MVA to the hot strip mill.

ANNEX 8
ECOLOGY
New facilities for pollution control, including additional devices
for the existing plant, will be installed under the 2.4 million expansion scheme
at an estimated cost of US$11 million equivalent.
Water Management
USININAS' steel work sewer goes into the river "Rio Doce". The exist-
ing facilities for re-using water will be extended under the expansion scheme.
The sewer contains sulphuric acid, ammonia, phenol and cyanogenliquor. Sulfuric acid,
mainly originating from the pickle line, is neutralized.  Ammonia liquor from
the final gas coolers has a concentration of about 0.15% and does not create any
pollution problem. However, ammonia liquor from the tar tanks, containing phenol
(about 2,000 ppm)ad cyarrgen (100 ppm) at present, pollutes the river water.  To
avoid further damage, biological treatment of about 300m3 per day of ammonia
liquor will be installed.
Air Manarement
At present, a severe air pollution problem exists in the steel plant
No, 1.  This plant was originally equipped with a combined dust collection/steam
generating   system.   As it is working at 142% of its nominial capacity, the
plant is facing the problem of inadequate capacity of the water feeding system to
the boiler, of the boiler safety system a" ofthe boiler discharge.  Therefore, the
gas-cleaning system is presently by-passed. But by 1972, the bottlenecks in the
steam generating system will be eliminated and the existing gas purifying and
filtering systems will operate normally.
The new steel plant will be equipped with a gas recovery system to cool,
filter and recover the converter gases without combustion of CO to CO. The waste
gas wili be filared off at the top of a 75 in high stack in Phase II, but will be
stored in gasholders for use as fuel in Stage III.
The new coke oven battery will use smodeless charging by injection of
h-igh pressure ammonia liquor into the ascension pipe. This will help reduce
smoke emissions to about %20.

ANNEX 15

NOTE ON THE PROJECTED FINANC IAL STATEMENTS OF THE PROJECT
The financial projections are based on the assumption that
BNDE's future contribution to the financing of the project totals
US$lb5.5 million equivalent of which 4h4  are to be in the form of
equity and 56% in loans, including deferred financial charges during
construction which will be added to the principal.
During negotiations, however, agreement was re.ched between
the Bank, BNDE and USTMTIAS that BNDE should mpke available funds to
USIMTNAS of not less than US'150 million equivelent during project
implementetion. To give more flexibility to the Company it was also
agreed that:
1.  The Company will be free to determine the amounts
to be disbursed annually accordirg to its latest
forecast of financial requirements. These require-
ments can be estimated with greater precision at
the end of the fiscal year preceeding the year
during which disbursements will take place.
2.  The annual disbursements will be devided into
capital subscription and loans in such proportions
as to achieve and maintain a long-term debt/equit-y
ratio of not more than qO:<O at the en(d of eacih
fiscal year during implementation of i.l,e project..
These agreements imply minor changes in the financial
projections which were prepared before the start of negotiations.
However, since the actuaal results of operation and the project cost. cam
in any event be expected to vary in same measure from the projectionE,
a complete revision of the projections to take account of these
relatively minor changes was not undertaken.

The coal and ore volumes coincide with those given in the "Raw Mate-
rials and Products Flow Diagram - 1976" presented as Annex 25. _       ap 2 shows
the locations.
Coal Sources and Supply
USlINNAS expectsto reduce the proportion of its domestic coal con-
sumn-tion from its 1970 level of about 34% to just under 20% from 1976 omnard.
The rest will be inported and will conisist of about 52% of high-volatile and 28%
of low-volatile coal.
The Brazilian coals of Santa Catarina are generally of poor quality
and - as shown above - expensive due to the washing they require at the mine,
combined with high handling and transport costs.
Br mid-1971 USIMINAS had signed contracts for the supply of low ash
(below 6.h%) and low sulphur (0.79 to 0.88') American coal through 1982, with
Consoli.dation Coal Compaly, of Pittsburgh (high and low volatile) and Mitsu-
bishi International Corporation, of New York (high volatile). The volumes
agreed on will amount to about 720,000 tons in 1976, i.e. slightly over half



ANNEX 17
Page 2
of the   estimated foreign coal requirements in 1976.  Further negotiations
were in progress at the writing of this report.
Iron Ore Sources and Supply
The plant's relative closeness (107 km by railroad) to the Itabira
mine of Companhia Vale do Rio Doce (CVRD) results in a low ore cost to USIMINAS.
A long-term supply contract with the mining company has been signed, extending
to 1988.  By this agreement, USIMINAS' ore price equals 60% of the equivalent
lowest FOB Vitoria export quotation. Quarterly delivery programs are agreed
between USIMINAS and the mining corTpany every July 1, with maximum acceptable
departures of plus or minus 10%.
The ore purchased averages about 64% iron and less than 10% of finer-
than-150-mesh material.
USIMINAS' iron practice is based on high-sinter burdens. Given
adequate supplies of fines from CVRD, and adequate sintering capacity at
Ipatinga, the company can take advantage of the lower fines prices. Pellets
have been offered by CVRD at about US$17 per ton, as contrasted against a
sinter cost of US$6.64 per ton (excluding depreciation) during 1970.
Limestone
USIMINAS secures its limestone from its  own quarry in Matosinhos,
located about 10 km from Bela Horizonte. The exploitation of the quarry is in
charge of a contractor. Limestone reserves are estimated to be in the order of'
90 million tons, enough for some 40 years.
Transport
The rail system serving Ipatinga is generally adequate. The transport
of finished products from the plant to the southeast of Brazil is interrupted
by the change from narrow gauge between Ipatinga and Capitao Ednardo, south of
Belo Horizonte, to broad gauge for further conveyance. The Ministry of Trans-
portation duly considered in their railroad development plan the transport of
increased tonnages of raw materials and finished products after completion of
the expansion phases of UJSIMINAS. Additional rolling stock will be made avail-
able in time.
Power
Presently the plant's average monthly consumption is around 29 million
kw-hr/month. High-voltage power is purchased from Centrais Electricas de Minas
Gerais (CEMIG). USIMINAS has discussed its future power requirements and received
assurances that no supply- problem will arise. This is possible because of sig-
nificant pre- cted increases in generating capacity in the region.  Between the
present and mid-1972 it is projected to add about 1.1 million Kw to the Jaguara
power station. Furthermore, 200,000 additional Kw will be installed at the
Volta Grande station by 1973, and about 1.5 million Kw are planned for the Sao
Simao station for 1977.

Refractories
At present, USIMINASAs using Brazilian-made refractories almost excl-
sively. Most of this is magnesite, which is purchased from .'Magnesita'! in Belo
Horizonte.  The  bDmpany shapcs its own converter refractories, using piLrchased
raw material.   It also acquire dolomite, refractory mortar, graphite, etc.
from two Sao Pulo firms.

The operational break-even point (considering also interest, paymernt_i)
projected for the 2.4 million ingot ton per year operation, in 1976 is 7'% of
the plant's effective capacity.  Revenues in that year are expecteid to reach t.he
equivalent of US$314.4 million, in constant 1971 terms.

Cash Break-even Point
The cash break-even point projected for 1976 is 54% of the olat n-s
effective capacity. Like the operational break-even point, it has beer
calculated on the basis ofthe constant 1971 currency projections.
No graph was prepared for this break-even. The calculation shown
below is based on the followii4g assumptions:
(a) Operating as the break-even level, no working capt tal
increase would be required. Nor was any cash income
assumed as deriving from a decrease.
(b) Based on previous experience, the reserve for bad
debts was assumed as not being utilized.
(c) No dividends

Notes:
Prices used for economic return calculations are based on European
export prices that prevailed in February-August 1971 for the various products.
These prices have been analyzed in the context of historical trends, and on
average are expected to reflect representative prices over the long term period
relevant for evaluation of this project. In fact, if Brazil had to import 3.i
million TPY of steel products in the context of the existing volume of world
trade (under 50 million TPY) there would probably be some upward pressure on
prices of several products.
The cost of transport from the main European ports to Sao Paulo, the
principal market for steel, has been calculated on the basis of actual costsi
incurred in recent years on imports of up to 300,000 TPY, with benefit of special
contract rates for bulk shipments. While it is possible that much  larger 3hip-
ments could be moved at somewhat less cost, there is also the likelihood of higher
costs on account of port congestion and the need for additional handling facilities,
etc.
Altogether, import prices (CIF) assumed for the calculations appear tn
be a fair average of costs that would have to be incurred for imports dilrinr g
period of time under consideration.
For exports, the economic return calculation assumes February 1971
Brazilian prices (FOB Brazilian Ports). These are generally lower than the prices
actually obtained for Brazilian steel exports in the recent past. Price calcula-
tionki iinclude adjustment for freight from the steel mills at Ipatinga to Sao Paulo
in each case.
