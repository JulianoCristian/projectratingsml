INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION
OF THE

TO THE
EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A
PROPOSED LOAN
TO
USINAS SIDERURGICAS DE MINAS GERAIS, S.A.
WITH THE GUARANTEE

INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO
USINAS SIDERURGICAS DE MINAS GERAIS, S.A.
FOR A STEEL EXPANSION PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan to Usinas Siderurgicas de Minas Gerais, S.A. (USIMINAS) with the
guarantee of the Federative Republic of Brazil for the equivalent of $63
million to help finance the expansion of USIMINAS' steel mill from a
capacity of 1.0 million to 2.4 million tons of raw steel per year. The
loan would have a final maturity of 151 years, including a h½ year grace
period; interest thereon would be charged at the rate of 71 percent per annum.
The USIMINAS project together with the Companhia Siderurgica Nacional (CSN)
and Companhia Siderurgica Paulista (COSIPA) projects comprise Brazil's
current program for the expansion of its flat steel products capacity.
Total World Bank and Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) financing of
about $320 million is being sought by the Government of Brazil which has
also negotiated bilateral credit lines from nine major steel-equipment
producing countries. A $6h.5 million loan to Companhia Siderurgica
Nacional (CSN) was approved by the Executive Directors on February 1 and
signed on February 8, and a loan of approximately $64.5 million for COSIPA
is expected to be presented to the Executive Directors within the next
three months. The IDB has already made a $43 million loan to CSN and is
considering loans aggregating $85 million for USIMINAS and COSIPA.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        An economic report entitled "Current Economic Position and
Prospects of Brazil" (WH-210a), dated November 30, 1971, was distributed
to the Executive Directors on December 2, 1971. Its main conclusions
were summarized in my Report and Recommendation to the Executive
Directors on the CSN loan, dated January 17, 1972. I then noted that
in order to be effective external assistance could not be tied entirely
to the foreign exchange component of project costs since the Brazilian
capital goods industry has a proven ability to compete successfully
under international competitive bidding. I also stressed that the
balance of payments is likely to be the most critical constraint to
continued high economic growth rates and that there would be a
continuous need for an inflow of capital from abroad. A country data
sheet is attached as Annex II.

PART II - THE BANKIS ROLE IN BRA2IL
3.        Since 1949, Brazil has received 39 loans from the Bank
amounting to $1,245.1 million (net of cancellations).  A summary state-
ment of loans and credits, as of February 29, 1972 is attached as Annex
I. The status of these loans including the reasons for certain delays
in disbursement and in project implementation were analyzed in my
Report and Recommendation to the Executive Directors on the CSN loan.
4.        The Report and Recommendation to the Executive Directors on
the Third Highway Construction Project, dated February 25, 1972, described
the Bank's current lending program in Brazil. We are actively processing
four loans for projects in the power, agriculture and steel sectors. In
this fiscal year, four loans totalling $249.5 mlllion have been approved
for the MBR and related railway, CSN and Third Highways projects.
5.        Since 1957, IFC has made 13 commitments in Brazil totalling
$61.8 million. A summary of IFC investments is given in Annex I.
6.        The USIMINAS project was appraised by a joint mission of the
Bank and the IDB in May - June 1971. Negotiations took place from
March 1 to March 10, 1972. USIMINAS was represented by a delegation
headed by Mr. Luis Verano, Director-Superintendent. The Government of
Brazil was represented by Mr. Jayme Alipio de Barros, Attorney-General
for Finance, Mr. Antonio Miranda, Assistant to the Executive Secretary
of the Conselho Nacional da Industria Siderurgica (CONSIDER), Mr. Gabriel
Costa Carvalho, Legal Adviser and Mr. Sebastiao Martins Soares, Manager of
the Department of Equity Investments of Banco Nacional do Desenvolvimento
Economico (ENDE).
PART III - THE STEEL INDUSTRY
7.        A report "Brazilian Steel Expansion Program - Part I" (PI-16),
dated January 10, 1972 was distributed to the Executive Directors on
January 20, 1972, together with the Appraisal Report of the CSN Expansion
Project. A description and evaluation of Brazil's current expansion
program for flat steel products, including related market and competitive
aspects as well as an analysis of the rationale for the Bankts support for
the program, were contained in my Report and Recommendation on the CSN loan.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
8.        A report "Appraisal of the USIMINAS Expansion Project" (PI-17),
dated March 17, 1972, is being distributed separately. A summary of it
is in Annex III.



-3-
The Compan 
9.        USIMINAS is a Brazilian corporation, whose two major shareholders
are the Government Development Bank (BNDE) with 63 percent of the shares
and a Japanese corporation, Nippon-USIMINAS Kabushiki Kaisha with 21 percent
of the shares. The remaining shareholders are under the control of the
Brazilian Government. USIMINAS' plant is located at Ipatinga, a town about
210 km northeast of Belo Horizonte, the capital of the State of Minas Gerais.
The plant is at a short distance from the mines that supply its iron ore
requirements and is connected by road and railway to its major markets, in
the States of Guanabara and Sao Paulo. The site permits expansion to about
5 million annual tons of raw steel without modification of the original
layout concept. Production includes hot and cold rolled coil,sheet and plate.
Description of Project
10.       The Project consists of the expansion of the plant's basic iron
and steel making capacity from 1.0 to 2.4 million annual tons of raw steel
and of related increases in rolling and finishing capacity. IMajor facili-
ties comprise a blast furnace which together with the two already existing
ones will be sufficient to provide the hot metal requirements of future
expansion to 3.5 million annual tons of raw steel, a coke oven battery, a
sinter plant, a BOF shop, two continuous casting machines, a wide plate
mill and a cold reduction mill.
II.       Some of these facilities comprised a previously planned minor
expansion which was subsequently modified and integrated into the Project.
ENDE and Japanese credits were arranged by USIMINAS for the financing of
those facilities (Phase I of the Project) prior to the final foc.-mulation
of the Project and to the Government's request for Bank and IDB assistance
for Brazil's current steel expansion program.  Phase II constitut,*s the rest
of the Project and includes all the equipment to be financed by the Bank/IDB
and by the parallel bilateral credits referred to in paragraph 1, above.
The Bank has reviewed the specifications and financing terms related to the
procurement of all Project items and found them to be compatible with the
efficient carrying out of the Project on a sound financial basis.
12.       The cost of the Project is estimated at the equivalent of $573
million, including incremental working capital and interest during
construction. Although the original cost estimates were expressed in
February 1971 dollars, they have been readjusted to reflect the inter-
national currency realignments of the second half of 1971. Assuming
that about 29 percent of equipment orders will be won by Brazilian
suppliers, local currency costs would be $27L million and foreign
exchange costs would amount to $299 million.



-14.-
Financing Plan
13.       Financing for the Project will come from the following sources:
In $ Million
Cash generation                              134.6
Share capital increase                        75.0   209.6
long-term debt
IBRD                                        63.0
IDB                                         12.0
Bilateral credits (Phase II)                8h.6
Japanese credit (Phase I)                   67.0
ENDE                                       106.4   363.0
- 572.6
14.       The proposed Bank loan to USJnINAS of $63.0 million would be
on the same terms as the loan for CSN, namely, for 15½ years, including
a grace period of 414 years. The Government of Brazil would charge
USIMINAS a 1-3/4 percent per annum guarantee fee on the outstanding
amount of the Bank loan, thereby bringing the cost of the Bank loan to
USLMINAS to 9 percent. The amortization period of the IDB loan would
be identical to that of the Bank loan and the IDB's interest rate would
be 8 percent per annum.
15.       The Bank and IDB loans would be jointly disbursed in a 60:140
proportion for equipment items to be procured under full international
competitive bidding. Brazilian manufacturers would be given a 15 percent
margin of preference. Making certain assumptions on the extent to which
Brazilian bidders may win contract awards, and on the foreign exchange
costs of producing in Brazil the equipment in question, it is estimated
that up to 38 percent of Bank and IDB loan proceeds would be used for
local currency costs. The economic justification for external financing
of local expenditures on Brazilian development projects is mentioned in
paragraph 2, above.
16.       The bilateral credits will finance 90 percent of the value of
equipment items ordered from suppliers in the respective countries (other
than equipment for Phase I and equipment included in the Bank/IDB list)
after competitive bidding. Credit terms will be 15 years after signing
(12 years after commissioning of the equipment) with interest charged at
the most favorable rates provided by the bilateral credit agencies at
the time contracts are awarded. The Japanese credit for Phase I carries
interest at the rate of 6.2 percent per annum and will be repaid in 15
years including a three years grace period.



- 5 -
17.       ENDE has undertaken to provide USIMINAS sufficient funds, in the
form of loans and equity investments, to complete the Project.   It is
estimated that the total BNDE financing will amount to about $181 million
of which about $106 million would be loans. ENDE has agreed to purchase
additional shares of the Company during the construction of the Project
to the extent necessary to complete the financing of the Project and to
allow USIMINAS to maintain a debt to equity ratio of no more than 1:1.
USIMINAS expects to raise about $75 million in new share capital during
the 1972-75 period; BNDE would commit itself to take up all the issues
not subscribed by other shareholders. In addition to BNDEts commitment,
the Government would undertake to make available to USIMINAS whatever
funds are required to complete the Project.
Projected Results
18.       Projections of USIMINAS' financial statements after completion
of the Project, assuming full production and sales prices generally in
line with recent international prices, indicate an incremental financial
rate of return, after taxes, of about 13 percent. On the conservative
assumption that following completion of the Project in 1975, domestic
sales would correspond to only about 80 percent of capacity for three
years and, disregarding export sales, the return would still be
12 percent.
19.       The financial projections show long-term debt service
coverage ranging from 1.4 times in 1972 to 2.6 times by 1980. The
USIMINAS Loan Agreement contains provisions in respect of USIMINAS'
liquidity, namely, restrictions on common dividends, borrowings and non-
project investments. Futhermore, USIMINAS undertakes to maintain a
minimum current ratio of 1.3 times for the term of the Bankts loan.
20.       The Project will help avoid massive imports of flat rolled steel
products which Brazil can produce competitively. The domestic Brazilian
prices of plates and hot rolled products, which will constitute the main-
stay of USIMINAS' output after completion of the Project, are somewhat
lower than equivalent CIF import prices. Based on the estimated import
prices of steel over the assumed 18-year life of the assets, and current
exchange rates, the Project yields an incremental
internal economic rate of return of 12 percent. Net foreign exchange
savings resulting from the Project are estimated at about $80 million
per year, offsetting the estimated foreign exchange costs of the Project
in about 4 years of full operation.
General Aspects
21.       In connection with the CSN loan, the Bank negotiated the
following commitments of a general nature which would be extended to
the USIMINAS project.



-6-
Price Policy
22.      The Government of Brazil periodically establishes maximum
selling prices for steel products, which are at present at satisfactory
levels. The Government has given the Bank &ssurances
regarding the aims of its steel pricing policies and has agreed to
consult with the Bank if the financial return on the aggregate operat-
ing assets of CSN, USIMINAS and COSIPA should fall below 10 percent
or rise above 15 percent in any year. USIMINAS has undertaken not to
reduce the average price in real terms of its product mix before the
end of 1975 without exchanging views with the Bank.
Future Steel Expansion Projects
23.      The Government's Steel Expansion Program for the 1970's, upon
which our financing is based, entails building iron making facilities
which wrill be fully utilized only after the capacities of CSN, USIMINAS
and COSIPA have been raised to 4.0, 3.5 and 3.5 million annual tons of
raw steel. The Government has confirmed to the Bank its policy of
giving priority to the further expansion of the three companies and
will not, without first consulting with the Bank, establish or provide
incentives for the establishment of new integrated flat product plants
outside of those three companies.
Coal Policy
24.      The Government has followed a policy of requiring the steel
companies to procure domestically certain minimum percentages of their
total coking coal consumption. Since domestic coal is relatively
expensive and of poor quality, this policy tends to offset to some
extent the Brazilian steel industry's comparative cost advantage
stemming from relatively cheap iron ore and labor costs. The loan
documents provide that USIMINAS will not, after completion of the
Project, consume more than 20 percent of its coking coal in the form
of coal whose cost and technical characteristics do not meet specified
standards.
Civil TWlorks
25.      The proposed loan would not finance any part of the civil works
of USIMINAS.  The Company intends to use local resources for this
purpose and to engage the services of reputable Brazilian contractors,
including subsidiaries of foreign firms. However, if during the execution
of the Project contract prices and completion schedules are seen to be
rising significantly in relation to those currently prevailing, USIMINAS
will take corrective measures, including, if necessary, the employment
of foreign contractors. This procedure should ensure the efficient and
economic execution of the civil works.



- 7-
Coordination with the IDB
26.      As in the case of the CSN Project, a close relationship has
been maintained with the IDB. A joint mission appraised the three steel
projects. Both agencies have agreed on joint action with respect to
procurement, disbursement, supervision procedures and exchange of
information. The two Banks are presently reviewing the proposals
submitted by three firms of consulting engineers with a view to
selecting a coordinating consultant for the construction phase of the
CSN, USIIMNAS and COSIPA Projects.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
27.      The draft Loan Agreement between the Bank and Usinas
Siderurgicas de Iliinas Gerais, S.A.; the draft Guarantee Agreement
between the Federative Republic of Brazil and the Bank; the draft
BNDE Shareholder Agreement between the Bank and Banco Nacional do
Desenvolvimento Economico (BNDE); and the Report of the Committee
provided for in Article III, Section 4 (iii) of the Articles of
Agreement and draft Resolution approving the proposed loan, are
being distributed to the Executive Directors separately.   The
major features of these agreements have already been described in
this report.
28.      I am satisfied that the proposed loan will comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECONNENDATION
29.      I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
loan.

/  This definition of Brazil's net external reserves differs from that of
the IMF in excluding liabilities of the monetary authorities arising
from debt rescheduling and from the contracting of external financial
credits by the Bank of Brazil. The Bank's Economic Report classifies
these liabilities as part of Brazil's external debt.
