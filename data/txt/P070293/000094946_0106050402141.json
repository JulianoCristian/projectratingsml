privatization program; and 2) creates an\n            enabling environment for private sector participation and\n            competition in infrastructure services, notably in\n            telecommunications and electric power. There are six project\n            components. The first supports the government's program\n            for sector reform and privatization in telecommunications\n            and power infrastructure; finances preparation and execution\n            of public enteprise divestiture transactions in the other\n            sectors; finances competitively selected investment advisers\n            and legal and technical advisers; and finances consultant\n            studies. The second component finances and strengthens the\n            government institutions responsible for undertaking the\n            privatization program and sector reforms. The third\n            component helps mount a major communications and public\n            relations campaign at home and abroad to explain and\n            publicize the reforms. The fourth component develops a\n            national policy on telecommunications; reviews, develops,\n            and implements new and comprehensive telecommunications\n            legislation and regulations, among other telecommunications\n            reforms. The fifth component develops a national power\n            policy and a legal and regulatory framework, among other\n            power sector reforms. The sixth component restructures the\n            Lagos State Water Corporation (LWSC), and implements private\n            sector participation and an emergency action plan to support\n            LWSC during the transition."}, "docdt": "2001-05-21T00:00:00Z"}
