As part of the divestiture processes,\n            environmental issues are being addressed during project\n            preparation, by including audits to analyze existing\n            conditions at, and around specific sites, and facilities of\n            the enterprises. The EA presents the results of the\n            environmental pre-audits, ranking the enterprises with\n            respect to requirements either for comprehensive or full\n            audit, partial, or no audit. Environmental concerns include\n            soil degradation, rapid deforestation, desertification, and\n            droughts, in addition to constraints in generation,\n            transmission and distribution of electricity to the national\n            grid from hydropower dams, and gas fired thermal plants,\n            with some immediate concerns, such as water, air, and noise\n            pollution, poor sanitation, drainage, and solid waste\n            management. Comprehensive, and partial audits address: 1)\n            development of appropriate waste management practices\n            regarding solid wastes, including oil spill contingency\n            plans for the prevention, and control of spillage into\n            downstream waters; 2) training assessment on environmental\n            management plans, in accordance with the regulatory\n            framework, and in liaison with the Ministry of the\n            Environment; and, development of environmental mitigation,\n            performance indicators, and monitoring; and, 3)\n            identification of equipment decommissioning plans, in\n            compliance with World Bank guidelines."}, "docdt": "2001-01-31T00:00:00Z"}
