  moderately satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was\n            substantial, the Bank performance was moderately\n            satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was also\n            moderately satisfactory. Some lessons learned included:\n            effective inter-agency coordination and management of the\n            different institutional agendas and interests across the\n            infrastructure sectors are important for the smooth\n            implementation of a project. This was seen to be\n            particularly relevant for the successful realization of the\n            Power, Gas-to-Power and to a lesser extent transport sector\n            objectives. It is important to build institutional capacity\n            in project management, financial management, and procurement\n            at the beginning of the project. In particular, emphasis\n            should be placed on having adequate procurement capacity in\n            place before project effectiveness. Thus after conducting\n            procurement capacity assessment of the implementing\n            agencies, issues identified should be adequately addressed\n            before effectiveness. Such issue will usually include having\n            adequate procurement capacity, preparation of draft\n            documents. Communications Strategy: It is important to have\n            an active and effective communications strategy that is both\n            pro-active in reaching out to specific stakeholders (e.g.\n            Assembly members, labor, and unions) and the broader public\n            and provide specific products and services to deal\n            reactively with media commentary and other eventualities.\n            Privatization is a process which depends on market\n            conditions. More thorough upstream investment and risk\n            allocation assessment would have better assisted the\n            government in the preparation of transactions for market.\n            While Bureau of Public Enterprises (BPE) capacity to\n            undertake this due diligence augmented considerably over the\n            life of the project, given the complexity of many of the\n            sector issues this involved, even deeper institutional\n            capacity and expertise was required. This will have included\n            more robust IT systems to record and utilize the\n            considerable diagnostic and technical data that has been\n            accumulated on the different transactions across the sectors\n            targeted. These lessons learned have been important to the\n            design of the next generation Nigeria Electricity and Gas\n            Improvement Project (NEGIP) and Public Private Partnership\n            (PPP) projects."}, "docdt": "2011-02-28T00:00:00Z"}
