About this Report
     The Independent Evaluation Group assesses the programs and activities of the World Bank for two purposes: first, to
ensure the integrity of the Bank’s self-evaluation process and to verify that the Bank’s work is producing the expected
results, and second, to help develop improved directions, policies, and procedures through the dissemination of lessons
drawn from experience. As part of this work, IEG annually assesses 20-25 percent of the Bank’s lending operations
through field work. In selecting operations for assessment, preference is given to those that are innovative, large, or
complex; those that are relevant to upcoming studies or country evaluations; those for which Executive Directors or Bank
management have requested assessments; and those that are likely to generate important lessons.
     To prepare a Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR), IEG staff examine project files and other
documents, visit the borrowing country to discuss the operation with the government, and other in-country stakeholders,
and interview Bank staff and other donor agency staff both at headquarters and in local offices as appropriate.
     Each PPAR is subject to internal IEG peer review, Panel review, and management approval. Once cleared
internally, the PPAR is commented on by the responsible Bank department. The PPAR is also sent to the borrower for
review. IEG incorporates both Bank and borrower comments as appropriate, and the borrowers' comments are
attached to the document that is sent to the Bank's Board of Executive Directors. After an assessment report has been
sent to the Board, it is disclosed to the public.


About the IEG Rating System for Public Sector Evaluations
     IEG’s use of multiple evaluation methods offers both rigor and a necessary level of flexibility to adapt to lending
instrument, project design, or sectoral approach. IEG evaluators all apply the same basic method to arrive at their
project ratings. Following is the definition and rating scale used for each evaluation criterion (additional information is
available on the IEG website: http://ieg.worldbankgroup.org).
     Outcome: The extent to which the operation’s major relevant objectives were achieved, or are expected to be
achieved, efficiently. The rating has three dimensions: relevance, efficacy, and efficiency. Relevance includes relevance
of objectives and relevance of design. Relevance of objectives is the extent to which the project’s objectives are
consistent with the country’s current development priorities and with current Bank country and sectoral assistance
strategies and corporate goals (expressed in Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers, Country Assistance Strategies,
Sector Strategy Papers, Operational Policies). Relevance of design is the extent to which the project’s design is
consistent with the stated objectives. Efficacy is the extent to which the project’s objectives were achieved, or are
expected to be achieved, taking into account their relative importance. Efficiency is the extent to which the project
achieved, or is expected to achieve, a return higher than the opportunity cost of capital and benefits at least cost
compared to alternatives. The efficiency dimension generally is not applied to adjustment operations. Possible ratings
for Outcome: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory,
Highly Unsatisfactory.
     Risk to Development Outcome: The risk, at the time of evaluation, that development outcomes (or expected
outcomes) will not be maintained (or realized). Possible ratings for Risk to Development Outcome: High, Significant,
Moderate, Negligible to Low, Not Evaluable.
     Bank Performance: The extent to which services provided by the Bank ensured quality at entry of the operation
and supported effective implementation through appropriate supervision (including ensuring adequate transition
arrangements for regular operation of supported activities after loan/credit closing, toward the achievement of
development outcomes. The rating has two dimensions: quality at entry and quality of supervision. Possible ratings for
Bank Performance: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately Unsatisfactory,
Unsatisfactory, Highly Unsatisfactory.
     Borrower Performance: The extent to which the borrower (including the government and implementing agency
or agencies) ensured quality of preparation and implementation, and complied with covenants and agreements, toward
the achievement of development outcomes. The rating has two dimensions: government performance and
implementing agency(ies) performance. Possible ratings for Borrower Performance: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory,
Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly Unsatisfactory.

Preface
This is the Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR) for the Indonesia Land
Management and Policy Development Project (Loan Number 7754; Credit Number 3884;
P064728). The assessment aims, first, to serve an accountability purpose by verifying
whether the operation achieved its intended outcome. Second, the report draws lessons that
are intended to inform future operations of this nature.

Financing of US$65.6 million was approved by the Bank’s Board on April 29, 2004, and
became effective on August 31, 2004. The operation closed, as expected, on December 31,
2009. Actual project costs were US$51.6 million, compared to the appraisal estimate of
US$87.6 million. A total of US$24.5 million of Bank financing was canceled.

As part of the assessment, IEG visited Indonesia in December 2012. In addition to Jakarta,
the mission traveled to the provinces of Yogyakarta (Sleman), South Sulawesi (Maros) and
East Java (Blitar), conducting interviews in provincial capitals with officials and
beneficiaries.

The findings of the report are based on a review of project documents, Bank electronic files,
academic books and articles, and interviews with Bank staff, government officials,
representatives of donor agencies, and beneficiaries (listed in Annex C).

IEG much appreciates the assistance of all those who participated in the assessment,
including staff at the Bank’s office in Jakarta and the mission’s interpreter, Mr. Indra Sofyar.

Following standard IEG procedures, the Government of Indonesia was invited to comment
on the draft PPAR, but no comments were received.

Summary
In Indonesia, the laws and regulations bearing on land administration have multiplied by a
process of accretion since the period when the country was a Dutch colony. Compared to
other countries in the East Asia and Pacific Region, the legal framework in Indonesia is more
complex and internally contradictory, and the formalization of land tenure has made less
headway. The World Bank followed up its support for the FY1995-2001 Land Titling Project
with the FY2004-09 Land Management and Policy Development Project, which is the
subject of this assessment.

The objectives of the project were to “(i) improve land tenure security and enhance the
efficiency, transparency, and improve service delivery of land titling and registration; and (ii)
enhance local government capacity to undertake land management functions with great
efficiency and transparency.” IEG regards item (i) as having two separate objectives, and
therefore assesses the project against the following objectives: improve land tenure security;
enhance the efficiency and transparency of land titling and registration; and increase the
efficiency and transparency of local governments’ land management.

There were five project components:

   •   The Land Policy and Regulatory Framework component sought to introduce reforms
       that would increase tenure security.
   •   The Institutional Development, Capacity Building, and Training component funded
       development of a long-term strategic plan for the National Land Agency (BPN),
       which included provision for uniform service standards, training and data
       management.
   •   The Accelerated Land Titling component involved a campaign to increase community
       awareness of, and participation in systematic titling (which involves a one-time, area-
       wide sweep) and sporadic titling (which addresses, one-by-one, individual requests
       for title as they arise).
   •   The Land Information System component supported the development of a national
       strategy on data sharing and data standards.
   •   The Local Government component attempted to advance the decentralization of a
       menu of land administration functions, building the capacity of sub-provincial
       administrations.

The project covered eleven provinces: all five provinces in the island of Java (the most
institutionally-developed part of Indonesia) and selected urban centers in six provinces
outside Java. The titling initiative excluded forests and protected areas, as well as land
subject to customary tenure.

The main achievement of the project was to hand out 1.7 million titles to landowners, 71
percent of the appraisal target. The achievement of this target varied from 40 percent in West
Kalimantan to 100 percent in Yogyakarta. In other respects, the project fell short of
expectations. Several studies were conducted on land policy, but their recommendations were
not adopted and no progress was made with legal reform. There was no reduction in the cost
of land titling which, at 10 percent of land value, is more than double the regional average.
                                               x


The Land Information System was not implemented. While there was a substantial training
effort for local government staff, and five pilots were fully implemented in different parts of
Indonesia, the decentralization of land administration was hamstrung by the lack of budget
and the limited steps taken by the various government agencies to share land management
information.

The outcome of the project is rated unsatisfactory. The academic literature leaves little
doubt that the objectives of the project—particularly the objective of increasing tenure
security—were substantially relevant, although the Bank’s country strategy had by project
closing pulled back from its earlier commitment to strengthen land administration. But
design relevance was modest: the components and activities sponsored by the project largely
neglected the geographic and thematic areas where tenure security was most pronounced.
Actual achievement of the three objectives of the project was limited. Progress toward the
objective of increasing land tenure security was hindered by the absence of legal reforms and
the patchiness of systematic titling. The lack of improvement in the time taken to register
land and the uncertainty about the costs of registration (including the persistence of irregular
side payments to officials) suggest that the objective of increasing the efficiency and
transparency of land registration was not achieved. Finally, despite the project’s financing of
capacity building, progress toward the objective of making local government land
management functions more efficient and transparent was hampered by weak inter-agency
coordination, both within provinces, and between the provinces and the central government.
Efficiency was modest given the high and divergent costs of land titling, which accounted for
83 percent of actual project costs.

Risk to development outcome is rated significant because the main result of the project—the
distribution of land titles—may be compromised if subsequent transactions are not registered
owing to the high costs of doing so; and because Bank and Borrower commitment to
reforming land administration appears to have waned. Bank performance is rated moderately
unsatisfactory, partly because the project design underestimated the difficulty of
coordinating the three implementing agencies and, throughout preparation and
implementation, not enough attention was paid to how greater tenure security would be
achieved. Borrower performance is rated unsatisfactory, mainly because of the limited high-
level commitment to institutional reform and the absence of a sustained push by the National
Land Agency to increase the transparency and efficiency of land administration services.

Three lessons may be drawn from this assessment:

   •   In a country like Indonesia where the institutions bearing on land rights are poorly
       defined and not transparently administered, the priority is to champion legal and
       policy reform; in these circumstances, a project that pays less attention to reform than
       to land titling is unlikely to lead to a sustained increase in tenure security;

   •   The gains from a program of systematic land titling may not be sustained if the cost
       of registering subsequent land transactions is high (partly because there is a culture of
       making side payments to officials); and if the state often does not respect the private
       interest in land that has been formally registered; and
                                          xi


•   The decentralization of land management presupposes that there is adequate
    coordination between the sub-provincial agencies responsible for surveying, mapping
    and zoning; and it may also entail that central government transfers funds to cover the
    cost of those aspects of land management that are not self-financing.

1. Background
1.1    The 190 million ha that comprise the Indonesian archipelago are legally divided into
two zones: 70 percent of all land is classified as forest estate (as defined by the 1967 Basic
Forestry Law), and is administered by the Ministry of Forestry; and the remaining 30 percent
corresponds to the residual category of non-forest land, which is, in principle, subject to the
1960 Basic Agrarian Law, and is administered by the National Land Agency (BPN).

1.2     But the framework of land management in Indonesia is more complex than the dual
structure posited by these laws. First, the 133 million ha in the forest estate contain about
41 million ha with few or no trees. Second, only 14 percent of the forest estate has been
legally defined (gazetted). Third, within the forest estate there are about 33,000 villages that
claim ancestral rights to land — an uncodified customary jurisdiction (adat) that overlaps
and conflicts with claims made by the state. State claims to the forest estate in the many
islands of Indonesia are also contested by migrants who have left the densely-populated
island of Java in search of land. Fourth, about one-quarter of land classified as “non-forest” is
forested; these forests, which occupy roughly 15 million ha, are subject to unregulated felling
and conversion to farming, either under the auspices of private landlords, or at the behest of
provincial and district governments wishing to promote growth through such expedients as
pulpwood and palm oil plantations (Bell, Srinivas and Martinez 2013).

1.3      In practice, the state controls almost all the land in the nation. This is the cumulative
result of legislation dating back to the colonial period. In 1870, the Dutch Crown issued the
Royal Agrarian Decree declaring that all undocumented land belonged to the state. None of
the adat land was registered in the colonial period, thereby giving the state a formal claim to
all the land on which indigenous peoples had lived for generations. Article 33 of the 1945
Constitution of Indonesia states that: “...land, water, space and the natural resources
contained within are controlled by the State for the maximum benefits of the people..." The
1960 Basic Agrarian Law built on this principle of state control. In Article 5, it also
recognized adat rights, but only so long as these rights did not conflict with the claims of the
state (Bappenas 2009; Mutaqin 2012).

1.4    Summing up, since independence in 1945, Indonesia has not systematically repealed
previous land laws or established a hierarchy whereby higher laws take precedence over
lower ones. “The result is an unworkable fabric of thousands of laws that might relate to land
and administration, some surviving from the colonial period, and many more the result of
decisions made at all levels of government” (Bell, Srinivas and Martinez 2013: 4).

1.5      Only land outside the forest estate and not subject to adat has been covered by the
land titling initiatives of the past two decades and coverage remains patchy despite two
Bank-sponsored titling projects (including the one assessed in this report). “According to
BPN, non-forest land is divided into about 89 million parcels, and only 30 percent of this
area is formally titled” (Bell, Srinivas and Martinez 2013: 7). About 1 million non-forest land
parcels are added each year, mainly as a result of the informal partition of family holdings
between heirs. This annual increase in the number of parcels exceeds BPN’s capacity to title
them. Also, the process of titling farmland in response to individual demand (sporadic titling)
is unnecessarily cumbersome, requiring sign-off by the Ministry of Agriculture as well as
                                             2


BPN, together with irregular side payments to village officials (who are responsible for
certifying that the claimants are the actual owners of the land) and to BPN officials. Land
registration confers only qualified tenure security in Indonesia because a registered record
can be challenged by a third party without time limit: “Anecdotal evidence suggests that even
people in possession of a land title for more than 10 years could still lose their land because a
third party successfully proved before a court its claim based on an informal transaction”
(Deininger, Selod and Burns 2012: 116).

1.6    The Bank has been the main donor for land administration in Indonesia, financing
both the FY1995-2001 Land Titling Project (P003984) and the FY2004-09 Land
Management and Policy Development Project that is the subject of this report. The AidData
base shows the only other contributor as the Asian Development Bank which, in 2007,
committed US$511,431 for a technical assistance exercise (“Enhancing the Legal and
Administrative Framework for Land”) that was broadly complementary to the policy reform
supported by the Bank.

1.7     The project that is assessed in this report was one of an East Asia and Pacific Region
series supported by the Bank, a series that has also included land titling operations in
Thailand, Lao and Cambodia. When the Indonesia Land Titling Project was prepared in the
early 1990s, it was assumed that Thailand—the pioneer in the series—could be used as a
blueprint for the other countries. This assumption led to a focus on increasing the efficiency
of the land titling process and achieving complete coverage of the cadastral survey while
broader issues of reforming the regime of land rights— tackling the marginalization of
indigenous peoples and communities operating with customary (sometimes non-individual)
forms of tenure, the state’s claims to land, and the boundaries and conservation status of
forests and protected areas— were either left to studies, or simply left out.

1.8     When the Indonesia Land Titling Project closed in December 2001, the completion
report concluded that “it had become clear that the reform issues were paramount and that the
anticipated further Bank assistance would have to focus on that above all else. The social
circumstances in Indonesia proved to be very different from those in Thailand with a more
complicated mix of land tenure traditions. Land legislation is much less developed in
Indonesia and the rights being registered are not clearly defined and understood nor are
protected by the land administration agencies or the judiciary. The registration process itself
does not guarantee ownership” (World Bank 2002: 12). However, the follow-on project, like
its predecessor, focused on what was perceived to be easiest to do (titling). Once more, the
thorny problems of institutional reform were relegated to a set of policy studies that were not
well integrated with the rest of the project.

2. Objectives, Design, and their Relevance
Statement of Objectives
2.1     According to the Project Appraisal Document, “The proposed objectives of the
project are: (i) improve land tenure security and enhance the efficiency, transparency, and
improve service delivery of land titling and registration; and (ii) enhance local government
capacity to undertake land management functions with great efficiency and transparency”
(World Bank 2004a: 3).

2.2     The Credit Agreement contains essentially the same formulation but combines the
specific objectives of the project with the overarching goals of economic growth and poverty
reduction: “The objective of the Project is to assist the Borrower in reducing poverty and
stimulating economic growth through: (i) improving land tenure security, and enhancing the
efficiency and transparency of delivery of land titling and registration services; and (ii)
strengthening local government capacity to undertake land management functions efficiently
and transparently” (World Bank 2004b: 20).

2.3     These two statements are compatible but IEG makes two observations: objective (i)
contains two objectives; and objective (iii) is not outcome-focused—enhancing local
government capacity is an output, not an outcome. Therefore, IEG assesses the project
against the following objectives:
       (1) Improve land tenure security;
       (2) Enhance the efficiency, transparency and service delivery of land titling and
       registration;
       (3) Increase the efficiency and transparency of local governments’ land management
       functions.

Relevance of the Objectives
2.4      The objective of increasing land tenure security was relevant because it responded to
fundamental contradictions in the laws and regulations of Indonesia. To this day, the legal
and regulatory framework for land administration remains fragmented and allows for a
variety of interpretations. The Basic Agrarian Law of 1960, the Basic Forestry Law of 1967,
unwritten customary (adat) law, and the laws, regulations, and policies passed after 1967—
all of these are mutually inconsistent. Also, even land that is formally registered and titled to
private individuals is not guaranteed protection by the state and may be claimed back,
severely reducing tenure security. Thus, a titling initiative by itself, without supporting legal
reform, would have been of limited relevance. The tenure insecurity resulting from this
uncertainty had hindered the development of land markets and investment. In many parts of
Indonesia land could not be used as collateral to secure loans. The FY2009-12 Country
Partnership Strategy (CPS) that was current when the project closed noted the lack of
“transparent and efficient linkages among smallholders, small and medium enterprises and
rural businesses and commercial markets” (World Bank 2008: 59). The weakness of these
linkages may be attributed in part to poorly defined property rights, although this connection
is not made by the CPS.
                                             4


2.5      The objective of enhancing the efficiency, transparency and service delivery of land
titling and registration was relevant because National Land Agency (BPN) offices did not
provide an acceptable standard of service and land titling was not keeping pace with the creation
of new land parcels. Titling covered only 30 percent of parcels. New parcels were continually
being created through the subdivision of existing plots, increasing the strain on land
administration services. Also, the social analysis in the appraisal document suggests that,
based on the 2002 impact evaluation of the Bank-supported FY1995-2001 Land Titling
Project (P003984) titling had contributed to the government’s overarching goal of poverty
reduction, as framed in the Credit Agreement. “The [land titling] program did not
discriminate on the basis of income or social status, providing title to all in the program area
who were able to prove their claims. However, the poor benefit most by being able to obtain
security of tenure inexpensively and quickly, because they cannot afford the costs and time
of obtaining title through the sporadic titling program” (World Bank 2004: 79). But none of
this is reflected in recent Bank strategy: the FY2009-12 CPS was silent about land titling and
land administration in general, and it makes no mention of BPN.

2.6     The objective of increasing the efficiency and transparency of local governments’
land management functions was relevant because local governments lacked the trained staff,
the infrastructure and the budgets to discharge the new responsibilities given to them under
the 2003 presidential decree decentralizing many aspects of land management. The FY2009-
12 CPS identified as one of Indonesia’s longer-term objectives: “Strengthen decentralized
local governments and institutions to increase the impact of public spending.” The relevant
constraint was the “weak capacity of local governments to manage assets and improve
service delivery” (World Bank 2008: 57).

2.7     The project’s relevance to the Bank’s country strategy was greater at project inception
than at closing. The FY2003-07 Country Assistance Strategy gave a prominent place to land
administration, identifying “uncertain property rights and corrupt land management” as an
obstacle and pledging that the Bank’s program would reform and implement “land rights
policies and legislation with emphasis on traditional tenure systems.” This initiative was
grouped with others whose outcome was “sustainable income-creating opportunities for
poorer households” (World Bank 2003: Annex B9), a linkage to poverty reduction and
economic growth that is also made in the Credit Agreement’s statement of the project
development objective (World Bank 2004b: 20). However, this linkage is not made in the
FY2009-12 CPS: in this report the review of evidence from recent poverty assessments
(Appendix 4) makes no reference to land rights or land administration.

2.8    The National Medium-Term Development Plan 2010-2014 lists 11 national priorities
and provides a detailed discussion of each but there is no reference to the need to strengthen
land administration (Presidency of Indonesia 2010).

2.9     On the other hand, the academic literature and the recent Bank analytic work are quite
explicit about the need to improve tenure security and the land administration apparatus in
Indonesia (Bell, Srinivas and Martinez 2013, Deininger 2012; Novri 2013; Obidzinski and
others 2013).

2.10   The relevance of the project’s objectives is rated substantial.
                                             5


Components
2.11 The project consisted of five components (World Bank 2004a:9, 2004b:20-24).
Component 1 (Development of Land Policy and Regulatory Framework) strengthened
government’s capacity to formulate land policy, specifically supporting the development of a
National Land Policy Framework and related regulations. This entailed setting up a land
policy secretariat within the national planning agency (Bappenas) to undertake policy
analysis and studies, coordinate public consultations, and propose policy recommendations to
the Project Coordinating Committee.

2.12 Component 2 (Institutional Development, Capacity Building, and Training) funded
development and implementation of a long-term strategic plan for the National Land Agency
(BPN). This included implementing uniform service standards, formulating a human
resources management strategy, introducing a training program, and developing procedures
for better record management, with increased computerization. The component also funded
the redesign of Land Offices. It provided support to BPN’s Legal Department. The
component provided the means for formal courses of study and short courses to be offered by
local academic institutions. Finally, it included funding of a project management unit,
responsible for implementing Components 2 to 4.

2.13 Component 3 (Implementation of an Accelerated Land Titling Program) supported
increased community awareness of, and participation in, both systematic and sporadic titling
programs. This involved workshops and media spots, and collecting community land profiles
in order to identify the extent of customary land tenure and the level of land-related disputes.
The component financed a campaign of systematic land titling that aimed to issue about 2.5
million certificates. It also funded the streamlining of Land Office registration processes for
sporadic land registration (titling on demand), entailing studies on fee structures and the role
of private surveyors, a review of service standards, and an attempt to identify factors that
might deter title holders from registering subsequent transactions. The component also
supported an assessment of the training and licensing procedures for private surveyors.

2.14 Component 4 (Development of a Land Information System) supported the
development of a national strategy on data sharing and data standards. It funded
establishment of a Land Information System (LIS), thereby increasing access to land
information, promoting transparency and public participation in land management, and
improved land administration services. This entailed developing technical standards and
formulating policies on data sharing and data maintenance, fees, public access and data
privacy. The intention was to pilot LIS with selected local governments, to develop land asset
inventories, and to assess the capacity for storing, maintaining and sharing data.

2.15 Component 5 (Capacity Building Support for Local Government), which was
implemented by the Ministry of Home Affairs (MOHA), supported the development of a
strategic plan for strengthening the ability of local governments to manage land
administration functions efficiently and transparently. It funded an assessment of local
government capacity for land administration. Pilots would be conducted with about five local
governments, involving participatory land-use planning, review of procedures for granting
location permits, community mapping and dispute resolution. The component also funded
training, and efforts to strengthen the support to local governments provided by the MOHA.
                                                     6


Finally, financing covered the operation of a unit in MOHA set up to manage this
component.

Geographic Scope
2.16 The project covered all provinces on the island of Java as well as selected urban
centers outside Java. Java was given priority because of its accessibility, the large size of its
population and its considerable number of parcels — factors deemed likely to enhance the
project’s impact. Another consideration was the lower incidence of customary tenure on
Java, which supposedly reduced the likelihood that issuing individual titles would stir up
conflict. The plan was to develop a model of intervention that worked for Java and then
selectively replicate it elsewhere. By project closing, eleven provinces had been included: the
five provinces of Java, plus two provinces on the islands of Kalimantan and Sumatera, and
one each on the islands of Nusa Tenggara and Sulawesi (see Annex B).

2.17 The geographic scope of the project was also defined by types of land excluded from
titling, as explained in the appraisal document. The project’s environmental guidelines
specified that “the project will not provide titles in areas designated as forest areas, protected
areas, the coastal zone, riverbanks, areas of cultural and religious significance, or areas for
public purposes or public facilities” (World Bank 2004: 74). The project’s social guidelines
made the following commitment: “The project will not title land in areas with adat land
[areas where land rights are subject to uncodified customary rules and sanctions] until a
policy has been adopted and supporting legislation passed that makes clear the procedures
that will be followed to define the boundaries of adat land and to register the land in the
national cadastre” (World Bank 2004: 82).

Relevance of Design
2.18 The objective of increasing tenure security was underpinned by policy and regulatory
reform (Component 1), improved Land Office services (Component 2), accelerated land
titling (Component 3) and improved data sharing (Component 4). The National Land Policy
Framework scheduled for development under Component 1 was intended to spearhead
reform. Issues that would be addressed included the lack of clarity about the rights of land
users operating under customary norms (adat) or participating in forms of communal land
tenure (hak ulayat). 1

2.19 In principle, land titling—sporadic or systematic—could increase tenure security.
However, this presupposed that people were adequately informed about the options for
increasing security through titling, and that the project gave priority to areas where tenure
was least secure. Also, sporadic titling could only increase security to the extent that
individuals came forward to request a title, and moreover had the means to pay for it. The fee
charged for sporadic titling would influence demand and the socioeconomic profile of the

1
 “The project through Component 1 will support the development of national policy on the recognition and
distribution of adat and ulayat land. Support may also be given to define the boundaries of adat and ulayat land
and to register the land rights through such activities as community profiling and the convening of stakeholder
forums. The project will not title land in areas with adat and ulayat land claims until consensus on the
boundaries has been reached among the stakeholders” (World Bank 2003: 8).
                                                      7


users who participated. Component 3 made provision for a campaign to raise awareness of
the program and to set priorities for the phasing of systematic titling—defining the order in
which different zones would be covered. A critical consideration was the encouragement
given to registration of subsequent transactions through a communications and outreach
campaign financed by the project. Whether or not subsequent transactions were indeed
registered was likely to depend on the cost of the process, including the time needed to travel
to the Land Office. Because this project’s titling efforts—like those of other Bank-supported
projects in the East Asia Region—deliberately steered clear of areas where land rights were
most contested (areas subject to customary and communal tenure, and forests), its
contribution to increasing tenure security was necessarily constrained.

2.20 The objective of enhancing the efficiency, transparency and service delivery of land
titling and registration hinged on Components 2, 3 and 4. There was a difference between
service delivery associated with systematic titling (a service provided at limited cost to the
persons issued titles) and delivery of titles under sporadic titling (more expensive). The
efficiency of systematic titling depended on how well trained and how well funded were the
survey and adjudication teams that were hired for the project on short-term contracts, the
percentage of the eligible area they managed to cover, and whether or not they were slowed
down by poor roads and bad weather. The efficiency of sporadic titling hinged more on
extra-project considerations—the recurrent budget government provided for staffing and
equipping land offices and the extent and quality of outreach to communities. Achieving
greater transparency in recording registered interests in land was likely to be realized through
Component 4, which funded set up of a Land Information System.

2.21 The objective of increasing the efficiency and transparency of local governments’
management of land was underpinned by Component 5 and was in line with Presidential
Decree No. 34 of 2003, which transferred nine land management functions from the National
Land Agency (BPN) to the local authorities (under the Ministry of Home Affairs). 2 The
provincial, district and local land offices of BPN retained responsibility for various residual
functions, including land registration, titling, surveying and mapping. Piloting of the Land
Information System (Component 4) would also strengthen the capacity of the district
governments involved in this exercise, potentially enabling them to be more transparent in
their adjudication of land claims.

2.22 While a plausible case can be made that each of these project components was
appropriate for achieving the project objectives, revisiting the completion report of the
preceding land titling project gives pause for thought: many of the lessons drawn from that
operation were not incorporated in the design of the project that followed it. The completion
report for the Land Titling Project noted that institutional reform was treated as ancillary to
land titling, relegated to a series of policy studies that were not linked to reform champions.
The title of the follow-on project—the Land Management and Policy Development Project—

2
  “These nine functions are (1) issuance of location permits, (2) provision of land for the public interest, (3)
settlement of disputes regarding cultivated land, (4) resolution of compensation for land allocated for
development, (5) determination of subject and object of land redistribution and compensation for excess land,
(6) determination and resolution of conflicts regarding ulayat (communal) land, (7) resolution of problems
regarding neglected land, (8) provision of permits to open new land, and (9) land use planning within the
jurisdiction of the local government” (World Bank 2003: 8).
                                             8


suggested that policy reform would be given more prominence. But, the appraisal document
showed that, once again, the policy work was treated as an add-on, with three-quarters of the
project cost devoted to land titling.

2.23 When the project was appraised, the institutions of land management in Indonesia
were broken. From the Bank’s standpoint, it was operationally expedient to focus on what
was easiest to do (titling of land where land rights were least problematic). But this approach
largely neglected both the geographic and the thematic areas where tenure insecurity was
most pronounced: the areas subject to customary tenure, the areas where the state was riding
roughshod over community interests in the name of development, and the areas bordering
intact forest and reserve land that needed protecting (Novri 2013; Obidzinski and others
2013). The completion report of the previous project took the full measure of the problem.
“In the case of Indonesia, land legislation has been left incomplete for four decades since
promulgation of the Basic Agrarian Law in 1961. This has led to a general decline in
confidence in the agencies involved in land and is a positive disincentive to registering
dealings in land” (World Bank 2002: 12). In this environment, titles could be issued but it
was unlikely that land rights would be genuinely strengthened over the long term.

2.24 The following observation from the completion report of the Land Titling Project was
equally applicable to the design of the follow-on operation: “The Staff Appraisal Report does
not define any process for reaching a broad consensus on issues in land. The reform process
is defined as one of studying a problem, presenting the results to government, and waiting for
the changes in due course. Project preparation should have identified constituencies for
reform and designed an appropriate forum for involving them” (World Bank 2002:12).

2.25   The relevance of design is rated modest.

Safeguards Category
2.26 This was classified as a Category B project, calling for a partial environmental
assessment. The project was designed to promote sound environmental management and to
mitigate potentially negative effects arising directly from project activities. To promote
sound environmental management, the project included support for land policies that defined
the rules for delimiting boundaries between the public and private domains, and for creating
capacity for land management. It was agreed at appraisal that titles would not be issued in
areas designated as forest areas, protected areas, the coastal zone, and riverbanks (World
Bank 2004a: 20). The relevant safeguard policies were: Environmental Assessment (OP
4.01) and Indigenous Peoples (OD 4.20).

Design of Monitoring and Evaluation
2.27 Project design included plans for monitoring by external agencies (NGOs and
universities) as well as monitoring by project implementing agencies. The aim was to
measure the socioeconomic impact of the project, by conducting a baseline survey in the first
year of implementation and a follow-up survey in the final year. The performance indicators
chosen were output-oriented. There was little provision for monitoring outcomes, such as
tenure security and service quality. This omission is hard to explain given the Bank’s long
                                             9


engagement in the sector and the time it took to prepare the project—three years elapsed
between the initial concept review meeting and appraisal.

Implementation Arrangements
2.28 The project was implemented by three agencies—the National Planning Agency
(Bappenas), the Ministry of Home Affairs (MOHA) and the National Land Agency (BPN).
BPN was the executive agency, responsible for maintaining project accounts and preparing
progress reports. BPN led on Components 2, 3 and 4, while Bappenas led on Component 1,
and MOHA led on Component 5. Provision was made for a Project Coordinating Committee
to help keep the three agencies in step with each other. Bappenas and BPN were expected to
work closely together on land policy formulation and legal drafting. Each of the three
agencies had its own Project Management Unit, with BPN taking the overall lead. Given
MOHA’s relative lack of experience with Bank procedures, it was expected that BPN would
provide the necessary support in the early phase of implementation (World Bank 2004a:17).



3. Implementation
Dates
3.1     The project concept review meeting was held in April 2000. Appraisal took place
over three years later in November 2003. The project was approved in April 2004 and the
loan was made effective in August of the same year. The mid-term review occurred in May
2007. As forecast when the project was approved, closing took place on the last day of
December 2009.

Expected vs. Actual Costs
3.2     At appraisal, the estimated cost of the components totaled US$85.4 million; total
project costs were estimated at US$87.6 million, which included price contingencies of
US$2.2 million (Table 1). At closing, the sum of the actual component costs equaled the
actual total cost of the project (US$51.6 million). The project was not restructured, and there
was no reallocation of spending between components.

3.3     This was a blended operation, comprising financing from an IDA credit (equivalent to
US$32.8 million) and an IBRD loan of US$32.8 million. (This was one of many Indonesia
variable spread IBRD loans that were converted to fixed spread loans; conversion took place
in July 2009, the loan amount remained the same, and the loan was renumbered from 4731 to
7754.) At completion, US$24.5 million of the combined financing was canceled, with 96
percent of the canceled amount corresponding to loan number 7754.

Factors Affecting Implementation
3.4    National elections were held in summer 2004, leading to disruptions, particularly at
Bappenas and the National Land Agency, where there were changes in the senior staff after
the new administration assumed power in October of that year.

3.5    Further disruption resulted from the tsunami that struck Aceh in December 2004
followed by an earthquake off North Sumatra in March 2005. Damage to Aceh caused by the
tsunami stretched the capacity of the National Land Agency which was required to work on
an emergency land administration project for Aceh in addition to managing this project.

3.6     There was a significant shortfall in counterpart funding that hampered
implementation. At appraisal, the Borrower was expected to cover US$22.0 million of the
project cost; the actual contribution was US$9.7 million. There was a separate source of
budgetary constraint common to all externally-funded operations: national laws require that
donor lending be approved by Parliament, delaying the annual release of funds for projects.

3.7   The project design included an atypically large number of dated covenants, none of
which were met on time, leading to implementation delays.

3.8    In the last two years of project implementation, the Asian Development Bank
provided technical assistance on revising land laws; this was a parallel initiative but it
complemented analytical work conducted under the project and helped harmonize the policy
pursued by the National Land Agency's land acquisition committee.

Implementation of Monitoring and Evaluation
3.9     The baseline survey was not completed until May 2007, around the time of the mid-
term review. It did not establish pre-project values for the performance indicators. The
follow-up survey was poorly managed, failing to collect data on most of the indicators, and
not allowing for a full assessment of project impact. Beneficiaries were presented with an
                                           11


opinion poll about the project’s effects with no attempt made to measure material change
over time, and without reference to a control or comparison group of non-beneficiaries. Input
and output monitoring was also skimped: for example, there was no regular, reliable
reporting on disbursements. Little information was collected about beneficiaries. Bank
supervision missions were not provided with adequate information before each mission.

Safeguards Compliance and Financial Management
3.10 The Bank’s Operations Portal says that all relevant safeguards were complied with.
During the mission IEG found no evidence of safeguard violations. The partial
environmental assessment was conducted as required and different observers concur that the
environmental safeguards were complied with. The adjudication teams involved in
systematic titling were trained under the project to recognize problems bearing on social
safeguards (particularly the OP 4.10 safeguard on Indigenous Peoples). However, during
implementation there was no systematic reporting on compliance with social safeguards.
There is no evidence that the studies on customary land rights influenced implementation
procedures for land titling (or led to policy changes).

3.11 Financial management was flagged as a substantial risk at appraisal, given the
country’s fiduciary environment, and it was proposed that the status be reviewed annually.
These reviews did not take place and the completion report stated that financial management
remained weak throughout implementation, with reports often delivered late (World Bank
2011: 12). (The Bank’s Operations Portal shows that all audit reports were delivered on time
and deemed acceptable.) Contracts and accounts were kept in separate files and there was no
attempt to integrate this information. The broad geographic scope of the project—eleven
provinces, within each of which there are several districts—contributed to the difficulty of
accurate accounting because this activity was dispersed over 91 locations. There were also
shortfalls in procurement performance: bidding documents were not properly prepared, and
procedures were not complied with.



4. Achievement of the Objectives
Improve land tenure security
4.1     Progress toward greater land tenure security can be assessed by considering seven
factors that were taken account of in the project design:
    • Legal and regulatory reform intended to remove policy inconsistencies and increase
        protection of the vulnerable;
    • Achievement of targets for systematic titling (titles issued);
    • The frequency with which those whose parcels were surveyed under systematic titling
        actually ended up with title in hand (titles distributed);
    • The extent to which systematic titling registered women as sole or joint title holders;
    • The affordability of titling—the amount that landowners had to pay for the service
        relative to their means;
                                             12


   •   The frequency with which transactions subsequent to systematic titling were
       registered—a measure of sustainability; and
   •   The extent to which land titles were used to secure loans.

4.2     Legal and regulatory reform made little headway. A final draft of the National Land
Policy Framework was submitted to the Bank in January 2009 but this has not subsequently
been adopted by government and none of the relevant regulations have been prepared.
Contradictions between the Basic Agrarian Law of 1960 and the legislation bearing on
forestland have not been addressed. The scheduled consultations on the revision of the Basic
Agrarian Law have not been conducted. Policy studies were independently sponsored by the
National Development Planning Agency (Bappenas) and the National Land Agency but there
was apparently little coordination between them; and they were not used as a platform for
public consultation. However, Bappenas said that the studies had some “indirect” influence
on the framing of the 2012 Land Acquisition Act.

4.3      Bank and Borrower have different estimates of progress in issuing and distributing
titles and the gender balance. At project closing, the Bank verified that 2.0 million titles had
been issued (registered) and 1.7 million had been distributed to landowners (respectively, 80
percent and 71 percent of the appraisal target). The Borrower reported a higher level of
achievement but, because some of these data came in late in the project cycle, the Bank was
not able to verify all that was claimed—2.4 million titles issued and 2.2 million distributed
(see Annex B, Table B1 of this report). The Bank reported that 23 percent of the titles were
registered solely in the name of a woman; the Borrower claimed that the figure was
32 percent. (No gender target was set at appraisal). Both sources agree that 4 percent of titles
were issued jointly in the name of male and female partners (World Bank 2011; Annex B,
Table B2 of this report).

4.4     There was substantial variation between provinces in the achievement of titling
targets. Although institutional capacity is generally higher in Java than in the outer islands,
the provinces in Java did not outperform the others in meeting the appraisal target; but one
province in Java—Yogyakarta—met 100 percent of the target (Figure 1). There is a
distinction to be made between the number of parcels surveyed, the number of titles issued,
and the number of titles distributed. The distributed number is what counts most because that
indicates how many of those titled actually received the certificate. Titles distributed as a
proportion of parcels surveyed is a crude measure of the efficiency of the titling program.
Titling efficiency was generally low. In only three of the eleven provinces did titles
distributed as a proportion of parcels surveyed exceed 80 percent; in one province (South
Kalimantan) the proportion was under 60 percent (Figure 2).

4.5     Titling efficiency shows some inverse association with the relative poverty of the
province (based on the proportion of the province population in the lowest wealth quintile):
the sign on the correlation coefficient makes intuitive sense (r= -0.23) but the relationship is
weak (Annex B, Table B3).

Source: Annex B, Table B1.


4.6     The gender balance of titling was also variable. The propensity for a woman to
become sole or joint title holder varied from 18 percent in South Kalimantan to 45 percent in
East Java (Figure 3). There was no evident connection between gender balance and whether
or not the province was located in (institutionally more developed) Java. There was a positive
but weak association (r= 0.27) between titling gender balance and a province-wide measure
of female autonomy (Annex B, Table B4). The same sources demonstrated the intuitively
                                                      14


plausible finding that the female propensity to be named on the titling certificate was
negatively associated with the relative poverty of the province but, once again, the
relationship is not strong (r= -0.57).

4.7     Although the design and implementation of the project involved measures to
maximize the effectiveness of systematic titling, there was some shortfall in delivery. IEG
confirmed that steps were taken to engage communities before systematic titling was
conducted. First, community land profiles were drawn up to define village boundaries,
describe land distribution and identify any pre-existing land disputes. This information was
used to plan the titling program and as a baseline for measuring project impact. Villagers
were recruited to join the systematic adjudication teams and given the training they needed to
disseminate information and raise public awareness about the titling initiative. The 2009 mid-
term assessment reported that on various dimensions of customer satisfaction with the
adjudication process 80-90 percent of respondents said they were satisfied. 3 Ninety-nine
percent of respondents indicated that titling led to improved tenure security. 4 However, the
Bank’s mid-term review mission reported that titling was not as systematic as expected; and
IEG’s interviews in the field bear this out. The initial estimates for the number of parcels to
adjudicate—produced by the district land offices—were not very accurate. IEG was unable
to verify the size of the shortfall, but heard reports that a significant number of villages or
parts of villages in the work plan for a given year were not surveyed and adjudicated.


3
  Customer satisfaction surveys are generally riddled with biases (response bias, non-response bias, researcher
bias, question bias) and may hence give inaccurate estimates of satisfaction, let alone of actual improvements –
in this case of tenure security.
4
  An impact assessment conducted for the previous FY95-01 Land Titling Project found that 70 percent of
respondents considered their tenure security to have increased as a result of titling (World Bank 2004a: 42).
                                            15


4.8     Owing to the frequency of unauthorized side payments, landowners had to pay more
than legally stipulated for titles generated through systematic adjudication; this reduced the
scope for titling to increase tenure security by depressing the demand for titles, particularly
by those with limited means. In principle, adjudication was provided free under the project’s
systematic titling initiative. However, before adjudication could proceed, landowners were
obliged to pay for boundary markers, as well as stamp duty, and the Fee for Acquisition of
Rights to Land and Buildings. More importantly, village heads would demand a substantial
gratuity in order to provide the boundary markers and handle the necessary pre-adjudication
paperwork and processing. The socioeconomic impact study conducted near project closing
said that 69 percent of respondents indicated that the adjudication cost could be “precisely
calculated” (meaning presumably that interested parties knew in advance what exactly they
would have to pay) (INACON 2009: Table 4.1). But the report—which was essentially an
opinion poll—contained no information about actual costs, or how these varied between the
six localities surveyed. An impact study for the earlier Land Administration Project (SMERU
2002) was more systematic and quantified the considerable variation in what landowners
paid for adjudication, with charges set at the whim of village headmen. The Bank raised the
matter of irregular side payments on several occasions with the implementing agency but to
no avail; the National Land Agency had no leverage with village heads.

4.9    There is no indication in the impact study—or in any other source to which IEG had
access—what proportion of those who had received a title registered subsequent land
transactions. The 2009 study asked respondents if they had used their title to obtain credit
and whether titling had prompted increased investment in farm inputs: 45 percent said that
they had used the title to secure loans; and focus group discussions revealed that titles were
mainly obtained for housing plots, not for farmland.

4.10 Taken together, the 2007 “baseline” survey (which was conducted around mid-term)
and the 2009 “impact” study failed to provide rigorous, quantitative evidence of the
contribution that titling made to increasing tenure security. Evidently a significant amount of
titling took place but there is no indication how titling effects varied by location (province,
urban, periurban, or rural), or by social group. There was no attempt to compare those who
received title under the project with a matched group outside the project. Added to the lack of
progress with legal and regulatory reform, this leads IEG to rate achievement of the project’s
tenure security objective as modest.

Enhance the efficiency and transparency of land titling and registration
services
4.11 Service standards were introduced by the National Land Agency but there was no
independent monitoring to verify that these were complied with. There is no evidence to
suggest that services improved. Technology improvements paid for with project funds—
global positioning and electronic “total stations” that increased survey accuracy, and
geographic information systems—did not raise efficiency because budget constraints
prevented full use of the equipment that had been installed, and payment of staff allowances
was based on protocols that were designed for the previous level of technology, preventing
the realization of productivity gains. This lack of progress applied as much to the sporadic as
to the systematic titling process. The redesign of five model BPN offices was dropped. The
Land Information System was not implemented. No progress was made in computerizing
                                             16


land records. The project also did not contribute to building private sector capacity. No
systematic review of legislation for licensing of surveyors and assistance was undertaken,
and no regulations governing industry practice were developed. Contrary to expectations, the
project did not finance technical assistance and training to private sector surveyors, nor did it
establish an industry association that would be responsible for representing surveyors.
Coverage in the areas scheduled for systematic titling was patchy. The mid-term review
mission reported that many villages or parts of villages in the work plan for a given year had
not been surveyed and adjudicated, undermining BPN’s credibility as a service provider.

4.12 Trends in property registration indicators from 2005 to 2013 do not suggest that the
project (implemented from August 2004 to December 2009) led to a significant change in
efficiency: the fall in the time taken to register property occurred the year after the project
closed. Compared to the averages for the East Asia and Pacific Region (EAP) and for rich
(OECD) countries, Indonesia’s performance on property registration is not significantly
different with respect to the number of procedures, and it is comparable to the OECD and
much better than EAP on the time taken to complete the procedures. But the cost of
registration (as a proportion of the property price) is more than double that of both EAP and
OECD averages (Annex B, Table B6). It is striking that, despite the sharp drop in the number
of days required to register property from 2010, the cost of registration continued the 2005-
2013 trend of a slight increase each year (Figure 4). For one year (2012), the Doing Business
data were broken down by selected provinces. With respect to provinces covered by the
project, the number of procedures and cost was essentially the same; but the time taken to
complete the registration process varied from 19 to 43 days (Annex B, Table B6). This
suggests that the Land Office service standards promoted under the project did not lead to
harmonization from one region to the next.

4.13 The transparency part of this objective would be served by the Land Information
System (LIS) that the project was intended to set up. An outline for the LIS was included in
the 2007-09 Strategic Plan developed by the National Land Agency (BPN). However, neither
the LIS Steering Committee nor the technical support group was instituted. None of the
                                                  17


necessary technical standards and policies was developed during project implementation (or
subsequently), even though in 2009 an international LIS expert reviewed BPN’s
requirements. Also, the planned pilot study, which aimed to collect land management
information from a variety of agencies in a single district, was never launched. Thus, owing
to lukewarm support from BPN, the project did not enable BPN to implement the LIS that is
required under the 2003 Presidential Decree (34/2004, Article 1).

4.14    Achievement of this objective is rated negligible.

Increase the efficiency and transparency of local governments’ land
management functions
4.15 Several outputs were delivered in support of this objective but the outcomes appeared
to IEG and to an independent consultant to be less significant and sustainable than expected.
A Strategic Plan on Local Government Land Management was delivered under the project,
helping to provide the Ministry of Home Affairs with the guidance that it had previously
lacked. As anticipated at appraisal, five local governments participated in pilots, each
addressing a different aspect of land management. 5 Several case studies were conducted to
assess local government capacity. These studies evaluated operating procedures, human
resources, and the incidence of corruption — enabling preparation of a diagnostic instrument
that local governments throughout the nation could use to monitor their performance. The
final report set out the priorities for staff training and capacity building. The analysis was
enriched by experience gleaned from study tours to China, Germany, South Korea and
Australia that reviewed local government land management. The project supported the
training of local government staff in participatory approaches to land use planning,
community mapping, granting of location permits, resolution of land disputes, and
identification of land to be acquired for public purposes. In all, 1,125 local government
officials from 400 districts received training under the project (no target was set for training
at appraisal or later).

4.16 A consultant hired to assess the five pilots found that although they had generated
useful findings that were being used by staff in the local governments directly involved, the
experience had not been replicated and the learning had not been assimilated at the national
level, either by the Ministry of Home Affairs or by the National Land Agency (De Wandeler
2009). This report expresses some doubt that the findings from the pilots would lead to
lasting improvements in the performance of the local governments involved. It also noted
that there was some disagreement (and resulting turf battles) between the National Land
Agency and the Ministry of Home Affairs concerning the presidentially-mandated devolution
of land management responsibilities to local governments.

4.17 IEG visited two of the pilot sites (Sleman and Maros) finding in both cases that land
management was hampered by weak coordination between the local government, the
Regional Development Planning Board, the local office of the National Land Agency, and

5
 The pilots were on: land consolidation in Kota Denpasar (Bali); web-based management of land information in
Kabupaten Sleman (Yogyakarta); management of customary land rights in Kabupaten Tanah Datar (West
Sumatera); land acquisition for development of public infrastructure in Kabupaten Maros (South Sulawesi); and
procedures for issuing location permits in Banjar (South Kalimantan).
                                              18


local representatives of the line ministries. Despite the avowed aim of these pilots to increase
the knowledge needed for land management, local government officials interviewed by IEG
had only a sketchy understanding of the extent of the forest and non-forest domain in their
jurisdictions, or the area titled relative to the area eligible for titling. In Sleman, local
government officials noted that they were overstretched and that the budget they received
from their parent ministry (Home Affairs) had fallen from 2.9 billion Rupiah in 2009 to 2.5
billion Rupiah in 2012. As a consequence, since the project ended, aerial photography and
mapping has languished and land information is out of date. The local offices of the National
Land Agency and the local planning authority (Bappeda) are both involved in land use
zoning decisions and yet they do not share data—each wants to have their own source of land
use information.

4.18 De Wandeler’s assessment of the pilot experience in Maros and Sleman was mixed.
In Maros, the experiment with setting up a “one-stop shop” for land administration services
had helped develop a sound model for transparent and efficient delivery of services—a
verdict that was shared by the officials from various agencies that IEG interviewed. On the
other hand, De Wandeler found that the development of standard operating procedures for
issuing location permits and acquiring land for public purposes had not yet resulted in
improved service delivery and lessons learned had not been widely shared. In the Sleman
pilot, De Wandeler found that the land management information system that was developed
remained incomplete, pending the receipt of data sets from other agencies, including the
National Land Agency. This bears out IEG’s impression about the limited coordination
between agencies in these localities. Recent informal analytic work by the Bank confirms
that BPN is not sufficiently decentralized to facilitate collaboration with local institutions,
such that information from BPN’s cadastral maps is not readily pooled with the information
from land use maps and spatial planning initiatives that are controlled by district and
municipal authorities. The same source notes that decentralization has been limited by the
underfunding of provincial and local levels of government.

4.19   Achievement of this objective is rated modest.



5. Efficiency
5.1      At both appraisal and closing, the Bank based its analysis of efficiency on the titling
activities alone (Component 3 in Table 1 above), which accounted for 76 percent of the
expected total project cost (and 83 percent of the actual cost). It is a simple matter to estimate
the cost per title, dividing the aggregate data on actual project costs by 1.7 million, the
number of titles that the Bank was able to verify had been distributed under the project. (The
Borrower claimed that 2.1 million titles were distributed). By the Bank’s reckoning, the cost
per title was US$25 if the numerator is limited to the component for accelerated land titling
(Component 3), or US$30 if the numerator includes the total cost of the project. In terms of
this naïve estimate, efficiency at project end was higher than estimated at appraisal (when
cost per title was US$26-$35, depending on the numerator). Thus, unit costs by project end
were significantly lower than the full cost of delivering a land title in Thailand—estimated at
US$36 (World Bank 2004a: 44).
                                                              19


5.2     However, this unit cost analysis gives a very partial reading of the project’s efficiency
because it is unclear if all the costs associated with land registration were taken into account.
The complexity of the latter calculus is evident from work done on the previous operation
(the FY1995-2001 Land Titling Project) — work that fed into the economic analysis of the
project under review here. The work in question involved a survey of 1,600 households,
randomly selected from areas covered by the Land Titling Project and areas not covered by
this operation (SMERU 2002). In 2002, when the SMERU survey was conducted, the official
charge for a registering a parcel was Rp. 11,500 in urban and periurban areas and Rp. 2,500
in rural areas. However, based on a survey of 512 parcels, the study found that the actual cost
of obtaining the land title certificate was higher and, on top of that, there were a series of
separate charges which varied between urban, periurban and rural zones; these
supplementary charges made up the bulk of the full cost of land registration (Table 2). The
supplementary charges variously included stamp duties, costs for food and lodging of the
adjudication team, costs for certifying documents on which the land claim was based, and a
series of gratuities and irregular side payments to village headmen and BPN officials. More
important than the absolute values in Table 2 (which seem low when converted to US dollars
at the prevailing exchange rate) is the discrepancy between the official cost and the full cost,
and between zones.

5.3     The 2009 “impact” evaluation—prepared for the project assessed in this report—
contained no data on the cost of titling so it is impossible to update the SMERU analysis.
However, various sources, including Deininger, Selod and Burns (2012) and Bank
supervision reports, confirm the large degree of variation in the cost of titling, and the
magnitude of side payments. Moreover, the Doing Business survey data (Annex B, Table B6)
confirm that property registration in Indonesia costs more than double the average for the
East Asia and Pacific region: the sum of the formal charges (as set out in Annex B, Table 5)
has exceeded 10 percent of the property value since 2005 onwards (Figure 4 above)—and
this does not take into account informal payments. In other words, during the project’s span,
costs did not come down.

5.4     None of this evidence is definitive with respect to determining the economic rate of
return to land registration in the project under review; but it is the only evidence that IEG
was able to find. In short, the veracity of the economic rate of return estimated at appraisal
                                             20


(33 percent) is impossible to assess; in view of the data limitations, the completion report did
not attempt to re-estimate the economic rate of return.

5.5      Other data suggest efficiency limitations. First, around 20 percent of the titles
registered were not handed over to the landowners (see Figure 2 above). Second, coverage of
the areas eligible for titling appears to have been patchy (paragraph 4.7). Third, there are no
data to show how many subsequent transactions on the systematically titled parcels were
registered—no evidence, therefore, of whether the investment in titling had led to a long-
term formalization of transactions. Indeed, it has been suggested that the cost of sporadic
titling in Indonesia—which the completion report estimates at US$145 per parcel—drives a
large-number of efficiency-enhancing land transactions into informality, reducing benefits to
landowners, undermining the scope of financial deepening and squeezing fiscal revenues
(Deininger, Selod and Burns 2012: 120). IEG interviewed several landowners, confirming
the high cost of sporadic titling (Box 1).

5.6       Efficiency is rated modest.

To obtain a title for a rural parcel of 0.13 ha the landowner paid the following:

Measurement                 Rp. 360,000
Registration                Rp. 50,000

In Blitar, in 2012, the monthly minimum wage (urban and rural areas) was Rp. 900,000.

6. Ratings
Outcome
6.1      The outcome of the project is rated unsatisfactory. The academic literature leaves
little doubt that the objectives of the project—particularly the objective of increasing tenure
security—were substantially relevant, although the Bank’s country strategy had by project
closing pulled back from its earlier commitment to strengthen land administration. But
design relevance was modest: the components and activities sponsored by the project largely
neglected the geographic and thematic areas where tenure security was most pronounced.
Actual achievement of the three objectives that IEG imputes to the project was limited.
Progress toward the objective of increasing land tenure security was stymied by the absence
of legal reforms and the patchiness of systematic titling. The lack of improvement in the time
taken to register land and the uncertainty about the costs of registration (including the
persistence of irregular side payments to officials) suggest that the objective of increasing the
                                                   21


efficiency and transparency of land registration was not achieved. Finally, despite the
project’s financing of capacity building, progress toward the objective of making local
government land management more efficient and transparent was hampered by weak inter-
agency coordination, both within provinces, and between provinces and central government.
Efficiency was modest given the high and divergent costs of land titling, which accounted for
83 percent of actual project cost.

Risk to Development Outcome
6.2      The project’s main result was to deliver land titles to 1.7 million landowners under
the systematic titling campaign. Surveys sponsored by the project found that title
beneficiaries value their titles, perceiving that they increase their security of tenure (even if
they rarely use them to secure loans). Thus, in principle, the project could have helped
develop a culture of land registration, increasing the prospect that the results of systematic
titling will be sustained. On the other hand, while systematic titling was not free of charge to
the landowner, it was low-cost relative to the alternative option: on-demand (sporadic) titling.
The high cost of sporadic titling—which may equal or exceed the monthly minimum wage—
may deter landowners who received a title under the systematic titling drive from registering
subsequent land transactions, particularly if they do not know in advance the number and
level of side payments they will be expected to make. Moreover, owing to population
pressure, parcels are subdividing faster than the National Land Agency can (sporadically)
title them. The net result of both these trends is that the land registration database will
quickly cease to be up-to-date, reducing transparency about land rights and hampering
planning. Government commitment to systematic land titling appears to have waned.
Towards project closing, the National Land Agency advised the Bank that it was no longer
interested in pursuing further initiatives of this type, even though around 70 percent of
parcels in the country remain untitled.

6.3     The project’s contribution to increasing the efficiency and transparency of local
government’s land management functions was mixed. On the one hand, the staff that
received training under the project will still be able to deploy these well after closing.
However, the limited coordination between sub-provincial government agencies responsible
for land management, together with the insufficient budgetary transfers from central to local
government, increases the risk that the capacity built by the project will be not be fully
utilized.

6.4     In other respects, the project’s expected outcomes failed to materialize and therefore
the risk to sustaining these non-existent outcomes is moot. This is particularly the case for
legislative reform: there is no evidence that policy studies sponsored by the project led to
changes in laws and regulations consistent with improved tenure security—although some of
this work may have fed into preparation of the land acquisition act that was passed in 2012. 6
Also, the efficiency and transparency of land administration services did not improve. It is
unclear whether beneficiaries who received title under the project can truly be said to be
tenure secure as long as land markets, regulations, and services are not efficient, reliable, and

6
 Attribution to the project is uncertain: technical assistance from the Asian Development Bank (“Enhancing the
Legal and Administrative Framework for Land”)—which overlapped with the closing phase of the project—
also contributed to preparation of the land acquisition law.
                                             22


trustworthy. Today, both the institutional capacity and the political commitment to carry
forward needed reforms appear wanting. The government’s 2010-14 National Medium-Term
Development Plan did not give priority to land administration; nor did the Bank’s FY2010-
12 Country Partnership Strategy.

6.5    The risk to development outcome is rated significant.

Bank Performance
QUALITY AT ENTRY

6.6     The project concept addressed important weaknesses in the institutional framework of
land management in Indonesia. Documents in the project file at appraisal show there was an
ample body of analytic work (much of it generated by the previous Land Titling Project) on
which the operation could build (World Bank 2004a: 67). Studies included an impact
evaluation of systematic land titling (SMERU 2002). However, many of the implementation
shortfalls experienced under the earlier project manifested themselves again when this new
project was launched. This was partly because the particular limitations associated with the
three implementing agencies were not sufficiently taken into account in project design.

6.7      The designers of the project were too optimistic about the readiness of the National
Land Agency (BPN) to implement the project or the commitment of BPN’s top management
to promoting policy and institutional reform—neither of these matters was singled out as a
risk in the appraisal document. Also, the risk of weak inter-agency coordination was assessed
as modest when experience from the preceding Land Titling Project suggested that a rating of
substantial or high would have been more appropriate. However, the project design did
provide for the three implementing agencies to sign up to a corruption mitigation protocol, which
specified rules of disclosure, standardization of procedures and allowance for civil society
oversight. Despite this provision, the risk assessment acknowledged the possibility that BPN
would not enforce adherence to transparent processes of land administration—but no
suggestions were given about how this might be mitigated (other than by scaling back the
project).

6.8      The pledge to develop and establish a monitoring and evaluation system by June 2004
(two months after Board approval), and to start the baseline survey by March 2005, was not
fulfilled, even though three years were allowed for project preparation. When the project was
designed, it was not specified what indicators would be used to assess whether safeguards
were being complied with, and what level of reporting was needed.

6.9    Quality at entry is rated moderately unsatisfactory.

QUALITY OF SUPERVISION

6.10 An adequate skill mix was applied to supervision, there was continuity of staffing and
the supervision budget (slightly above the Region average) was appropriate, given the
implementation difficulties. Supervision reporting was candid. For part of the
implementation period, the task team leader moved to the country office, where he was
supported by an experienced in-country team. Supervision of this project needed to be
juggled with attention to a post-tsunami emergency operation on Aceh, a challenge that the
                                             23


supervision team met effectively. There were regular visits to project sites and the delivery of
outputs was closely monitored. Safeguards were satisfactorily complied with. The project
supervision team arguably did the best that it could to encourage BPN to take a firmer line
against the widespread culture of side payments for land administration services; it was not
responsible for BPN’s lack of responsiveness to this matter. The Bank also kept close track
of financial management procedures, procurement and compliance with the anti-corruption
framework that was set up during the design phase. However, less attention was given to
assessing progress toward the project’s intended outcomes—particularly tenure security; the
mid-term review was silent on this matter. The design of the impact evaluation was not
quantitatively rigorous, with no robust attempt to measure material change over time (the
approach was limited to an opinion poll of beneficiaries), and with no use of a control or
comparison group of non-beneficiaries.

6.11   Quality of supervision is rated moderately satisfactory.

6.12 Overall, Bank performance is rated moderately unsatisfactory for the following
reason: according to the harmonized OPCS/IEG guidelines, when one sub-rating is in the
satisfactory range and the other is in the unsatisfactory range, the overall rating is determined
by whether the rating of project outcome is in the satisfactory or unsatisfactory range.

Borrower Performance
GOVERNMENT PERFORMANCE

6.13 There is some indication that, from the outset, there was a lack of commitment to the
project from the highest levels of government. When the project became effective, few prior
actions had been carried out by government; instead the Bank hoped that a long list of dated
covenants attached to the legal agreement would ensure that the government would take the
necessary steps to facilitate implementation. This legal expedient proved to be ineffective;
there was no substitute for a strong political will to reform land management institutions.

6.14 The project got off to a slow start. By the third year of implementation (FY2006),
cumulative actual disbursements were only 38 percent of the expected level (Annex A).
Implementation was hampered by counterpart funding delays. Delays were exacerbated by
the complicated nature of the budget release process (which entails parliamentary approval)
and the difficulty of transferring unspent funds from one year to the next. The change of
government in October 2004 involved some loss of impetus for the project, partly because it
brought in a new head of the National Land Agency, the lead implementing agency. Also, the
natural disasters that struck Indonesia in 2004-05 diverted attention and resources from the
project. The government did not set up the Project Steering Committee that was mandated by
the legal agreement, suggesting that there was little support at the highest levels of the
government for achieving project objectives, particularly policy reform. The lack of a high-
level committee to guide policy change removed a possible avenue of recourse for addressing
the inertia shown by the National Land Agency, which had primary responsibility for project
implementation.

6.15 After the project was prepared, the government gave lower priority to land
management problems. The National Medium-Term Development Plan 2010-2014 lists
                                             24


11 national priorities and provides a detailed discussion of each but there is no reference to
the need to strengthen land administration (Presidency of Indonesia 2010).

6.16   Government performance is rated unsatisfactory.

IMPLEMENTING AGENCY PERFORMANCE

6.17 The project had an overall Central Project Management Unit established within the
National Land Agency (BPN), as well as separate project implementation units in each of the
three implementing agencies—BPN, Ministry of Home Affairs (MoHA) and the National
Development Planning Agency (Bappenas).

6.18 BPN, which had overall responsibility for project implementation, successfully
developed and disseminated a set of service standards but no provision was made to
independently monitor compliance with these standards—meaning that there was no way to
ensure that efficiency and transparency increased in line with the project’s objective.
Bappenas supervised the preparation of several studies on land policy; but for the most part
these did not make precise, closely-argued recommendations and there was little follow up.
MoHA backed the part of the project devoted to shoring up local government but did not
provide detailed supervision. In the course of implementation, there was little consultation
between the three agencies, partly because the Project Steering Committee was never set up.

6.19 BPN—the agency that accounted for 90 percent of project costs—did not assign
dedicated staff to the project, expecting the workforce to add project implementation to their
regular workload (a source of discontent). Also, despite encouragement from the Bank
(backed by legal covenants), BPN chose not to use independent consultants to strengthen its
operating capacity, or to monitor its performance. BPN devoted its efforts to systematic land
titling but neglected other areas of the project. Even with respect to land titling there were
delays and weak coordination between BPN headquarters and its offices in the provinces.
Monitoring and evaluation were neglected. The other two implementing agencies—MoHA
and Bappenas—performed better, partly because they were willing to make appropriate use
of technical assistance and to allocate an adequate budget to the project. None of the three
agencies were strongly committed to monitoring and evaluation.

6.20 Land Offices have continued to ask for supplementary, unauthorized “thank you”
payments as a condition for issuing titles; this has deterred some landowners from collecting
their titles from the Land Office once registered (although this problem arose more for
sporadic than for systematic titling). Procurement was not closely managed. Clients received
only limited information about the land registration process.

6.21 Of the 12 Implementation Supervision Reports that the Bank filed, the last four rated
implementation progress no higher than moderately unsatisfactory. Audit reports were
delivered on time and all were deemed acceptable. Compliance with the project’s legal
provisions was mixed. There were 24 legal covenants attached to the project; 12 were
complied with on time, 7 were complied with late, 2 were partially complied with and 2 were
not complied with. BPN did not hire an independent monitor to assess observance of service
standards at Land Offices. Also, although it submitted a land information strategy to the
Bank for review, BPN did not follow up by implementing the strategy.
                                              25


6.22    Implementing agency performance is rated unsatisfactory.

6.23    Overall, Borrower performance is rated unsatisfactory.


Monitoring and Evaluation
6.24 Design provided for a baseline survey to be conducted in the first year of
implementation and a follow-up survey in the final year. Performance indicators were mainly
output-oriented, with little attention to measuring outcomes. Implementation lagged. The
baseline survey was not completed until May 2007, around the time of the mid-term review.
It did not establish pre-project values for the performance indicators. The follow-up survey
was poorly managed, failing to collect data on most of the indicators, and not allowing for a
full assessment of project impact. Input and output monitoring was also skimped. With
respect to utilization, the thinness of the M&E results gave little scope for using data to fine-
tune the management decisions made by the three implementing agencies; and M&E left no
legacy that subsequent programs could build on.

6.25    Monitoring and evaluation is rated negligible.



7. Lessons
In a country like Indonesia where the institutions bearing on land rights are poorly defined
and not transparently administered, the priority needs to be championing legal and policy
reform; in these circumstances, a project that pays less attention to reform than to land
titling is unlikely to lead to a sustained increase in tenure security. This project approached
institutional reform incidentally and made no headway because there was little support for it:
there was little or no high-level commitment by government and the three implementing
agencies showed little or no inclination to work together on policy reform.

7.1     The gains from a program of systematic land titling may not be sustained if the cost of
registering subsequent land transactions is high (partly because there is a culture of making
side payments to officials); and if the state often does not respect the private interest in land
that has been formally registered. Worldwide experience shows that the (sporadic)
registration of subsequent land transactions—for which there is an urgent need as parcels are
divided among heirs, or as they change owners—will always be more expensive for the
landowner compared to the cost of receiving title under a systematic program (partly as a
result of economies of scale). The cost gap is particularly high in Indonesia and the project
did not reduce it. At around 10 percent of the property value, the cost of sporadic registration
is more than double the regional average, making it likely that subsequent transactions will
not be registered. Registered land rights are not strongly guaranteed: even people in
possession of a land title for many years can still lose their land if the court rules in favor of a
third party that successfully challenges the original claim to the land.

7.2    The decentralization of land management presupposes that there is adequate
coordination between the sub-provincial agencies responsible for surveying, mapping and
                                            26


zoning; because not all aspects of land management can be self-financing, land management
may be compromised if transfers from central government are erratic and insufficient.
Despite the project’s investment in local government capacity building, the National Land
Agency was not sufficiently decentralized to facilitate collaboration with local institutions,
and survey and mapping initiatives by these agencies were not harmonized, reducing the
efficiency of spatial planning. This problem is aggravated by the underfunding of provincial
and local levels of government.
