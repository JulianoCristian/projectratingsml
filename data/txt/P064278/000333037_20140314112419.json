Some lessons learned included: in a country\n            like Indonesia where the institutions bearing on land rights\n            are poorly defined and not transparently administered, the\n            priority needs to be championing legal and policy reform; in\n            these circumstances, a project that pays less attention to\n            reform than to land titling is unlikely to lead to a\n            sustained increase in tenure security. This project\n            approached institutional reform incidentally and made no\n            headway because there was little support for it: there was\n            little or no high-level commitment by government and the\n            three implementing agencies showed little or no inclination\n            to work together on policy reform. The decentralization of\n            land management presupposes that there is adequate\n            coordination between the sub-provincial agencies responsible\n            for surveying, mapping and zoning; because not all aspects\n            of land management can be self-financing, land management\n            may be compromised if transfers from central government are\n            erratic and insufficient. Despite the project's\n            investment in local government capacity building, the\n            National Land Agency was not sufficiently decentralized to\n            facilitate collaboration with local institutions, and survey\n            and mapping initiatives by these agencies were not\n            harmonized, reducing the efficiency of spatial planning.\n            This problem is aggravated by the underfunding of provincial\n            and local levels of government."}, "docdt": "2014-03-05T00:00:00Z"}
