of Rwanda's (GoR's) social protection\n            and health policy reforms designed to reduce extreme\n            poverty, initially in 30 pilot sectors, and to expand access\n            to high-impact health, nutrition and population\n            interventions at the community level. The program is the\n            third and final phase of a three-year community living\n            standards grant/credit development policy operation in\n            Rwanda that is consistent with the second Country Assistance\n            Strategy (CAS) theme. The operation supports GoR's\n            poverty reduction objectives, consistent with the\n            country's fiscal framework and the second strategic\n            theme of the CAS, which is to reduce social vulnerability\n            and - to ensure that the most vulnerable Rwandans also\n            benefit from growth and to help Rwanda make further progress\n            in building a more stable society. The operation supports\n            policy reforms in the public works and direct support\n            components of the Vision 2020 Umurenge Program (VUP) and\n            helps Rwanda get on track with child and maternal mortality\n            goals. It aims to achieve quick results in the areas of\n            poverty reduction and improved health outcomes, even in the\n            midst of the ongoing global economic and financial crisis."}, "docdt": "2011-02-22T00:00:00Z"}
