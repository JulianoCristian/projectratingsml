                       THE REPUBLIC OF RWANDA
        RWANDA THIRD COMMUNITY LIVING STANDARDS CREDIT (CLSC-3)


Borrower                      The Republic of Rwanda
Implementing Agency           Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning, Ministry of Local
                              Government, and Ministry of Health
Financing Data                Type: IDA credit. Terms: Single tranche to be released on
                              effectiveness of the operation. Amount: SDR 3.9 million
                              (US$6 million equivalent).
Operation Type                CLSC-3 is the third and final of three programmatic
                              development policy operations of similar size, approximately
                              one year apart.
Main Policy Areas             Social Protection and Community Health, Nutrition, and
                              Population.
Key Outcome                   Social Protection: After three years, the Vision 2020
Indicators                    Umurenge Program (VUP)1 supported by this credit will be
                              assessed with reference to (i) of those households eligible for
                              support, the percentage that are granted public works in VUP
                              pilot Sectors (2008: 35%; 2009: 35%; 2011: 35%); (ii) of
                              those households eligible for support, the percentage that are
                              granted direct support in VUP pilot Sectors (2008: 0%; 2009:
                              60%; 2011: 80%); and (iii) the proportion of households in the
                              bottom two categories of extreme poverty in a sample of VUP
                              pilot Sectors (2008: 28.7%; 2009:< 28.7%; 2011: < 28.7%).
                              Community Health, Nutrition, and Population (HNP): At the
                              end of three years, HNP policy reforms will be assessed with
                              reference to (i) increase in the proportion of married women
                              aged 15-49 years using modern contraceptives (2008: 27%;
                              2011: 38%); (ii) increase in the proportion of births that are
                              cared for in an accredited health facility (2008: 45%; 2011:
                              50%); and (iii) increase in the annual per capita allocation to
                              performance-based financing (PBF) for health facilities and
                              community health cooperatives (2008: US$1.45; 2011:
                              US$2.25).2
                              These indicators are part of the Common Performance
                              Assessment Framework (CPAF), which governs general
                              budget support for the Government of Rwanda (GoR). All
                              indicators are agreed between GoR and development partners.
Program Development           The Program Development Objective is to support the GoR`s

  A flagship program under the Government`s Economic Development and Poverty Reduction Strategy (EDPRS).

Objective(s) and              social protection and health policy reforms designed to reduce
Contribution to CAS           extreme poverty, initially in 30 pilot Sectors, and to expand
                              access to high-impact health, nutrition and population
                              interventions at the community level.3

                              The operation supports GoR`s poverty reduction objectives,
                              consistent with the country`s fiscal framework and the second
                              strategic theme of the CAS, which is to reduce social
                              vulnerability and to ensure that the most vulnerable
                              Rwandans also benefit from growth and to help Rwanda make
                              further progress in building a more stable society. A smaller
                              program will support the Flagship Vision 2020 Umurenge
                              initiative; help Rwanda get on track on child and mortality
                              goals...4
Risks and Risk                The key risks to the program are: (a) adverse impact on aid
Mitigation                    flows due to changes in the international perceptions about
                              political governance and human rights in Rwanda; (b) the
                              persistence of effects of the global economic slowdown; (c) the
                              low implementation capacity at the Sector level for the VUP
                              and for the community Performance-based Financing (PBF);
                              and (d) the strong reliance on the functioning of the
                              Community Health Workers (CHW) Cooperatives. The Bank`s
                              support for strengthened governance will continue within the
                              parameters laid out in the 2007 Governance and Anticorruption
                              Strategy, which include the support of the Joint Governance
                              Assessment (JGA) and strengthening the capacity of civil
                              society and private sector actors. For the VUP program, the
                              implementation capacity at the Sector level continues to be
                              strengthened through local technical assistance in VUP Sectors
                              using parallel financing. Over time, it is foreseen that this
                              technical assistance will be mainstreamed in the public system.
                              A mitigating factor for the reliance on Cooperatives is that
                              while the institutions are new, the CHW that make up these
                              Cooperatives have previous experience from Village Health
                              Worker Associations.

  High-impact interventions are those that have had high impact on reducing disease burden in developing
countries. Examples include: immunization, use of insecticide-treated bed-nets (ITN), integrated management of
childhood illnesses, pre- and postnatal care etc.

                 IDA PROGRAM DOCUMENT FOR A
    PROPOSED RWANDA THIRD COMMUNITY LIVING STANDARDS CREDIT
                  TO THE REPUBLIC OF RWANDA


                                         I.       INTRODUCTION

1. The proposed Third Community Living Standards Credit (CLSC-3) is the third
and final phase of a three-year Community Living Standards Grant/Credit development
policy operation in Rwanda that is consistent with the second Country Assistance
Strategy (CAS) theme. Each of the three phases amount to US$6 million of IDA Grant
/Credit5 totaling US$18 million and a parallel US$4 million, totaling US$12 million from the
Health Results Innovation Trust Fund that is disbursed separately. This operation was
developed in parallel to the PRSG/C given its focus on both Social Protection and Health
Sectors with a large number of policy reforms to support, and the fact that these same policy
reforms were also supported by the Health Results Innovation Trust Fund. The operation
supports policy reforms in the public works and direct support components of the Vision 2020
Umurenge Program (VUP)6 and helps Rwanda get on track with child and maternal mortality
goals. It aims to achieve quick results in the areas of poverty reduction and improved health
outcomes, even in the midst of the ongoing global economic and financial crisis. The
operation's Program Development Objective is to support Government of Rwanda's
(GoR's) social protection and health policy reforms designed to (i) reduce extreme
poverty, initially in 30 pilot Sectors7, and (ii) expand access to high-impact health,
nutrition and population interventions at the community level.

2. The First and Second Community Living Standards Grants (CLSG-1 and CLSG-
2), whose implementation coincided with the first and second year of the GoR's
Economic Development and Poverty Reduction Strategy (EDPRS)8, had policy actions
ensuring that:

    Social protection policy reforms followed international good practice, including (a) the
    adoption of a non-distortionary wage policy for public works; (b) direct payment of
    workers without intermediaries;9 (c) determination of direct support benefits to poor
    families with no adult labor based on the household as a unit; (d) voluntary savings; and
    (e) a process for determining eligibility that is clear and transparent to all potential
    recipients and non-recipients because it makes program policy and procedures widely
    known and selection outcomes publicly available.

  The first two phases were IDA grants and this third is IDA credit.

  Administrative Sectors are a subordinate tier of District governments. There are 30 Districts and 416 Sectors in
Rwanda.

  Since December 2008, Rwandan policy has required that all wage payments and other payments made by the
Government to individuals and other private entities be made by direct deposit into an account for the individual
or entity in a bank or financial institution. An individual entitled to receive such payments must have or create an
account in a bank or financial institution into which the payment can be made. In the context of this operation,
and within the Vision 2020 Umurenge Program (VUP), payments of wages under the public works program and
of household benefits under the direct support program are paid into such accounts.

                                                         5
     Health policies and strategies expanded poor households` access at the community level to
     selected reproductive, maternal and child health interventions. These included
     (a) financial reforms (e.g., tariff reforms to remove user fees for long-term family planning
     methods and increased budget spent on results-based financing principles);
     (b) improved planning and budgeting for community health (adoption of a Community
     Health Policy, approval of an annual implementation plan, and budgeting for community
     health as reflected in the annual Medium-term Expenditure Framework [MTEF]); (c) the
     design and adoption of the Community Performance-based Financing program
     (Community PBF)10 and development of related institutional mechanisms that provide
     demand-side incentives targeting women and complementary supply-side incentives
     targeting CHWs with the overall goal of stimulating demand for contraceptive use, pre-
     and postnatal care and institutional deliveries, and (d) a rigorous evaluation of the impact
     these reforms.

3.     The proposed CLSC-3 continues support in these areas over 2011.

     On the social protection (SP) side, policy actions focus on: (i) the piloting of an appeals
     and complaints mechanism in five VUP Sectors; (ii) the development and adoption of a
     VUP budget allocation policy for the reform of the distribution of VUP funding at national
     level that allows budgetary variations across Sectors depending on individual Sector
     needs; and (iii) the development and adoption of a policy to improve the current
     community-based targeting system (Ubudehe)11 within the VUP.

     On the health, nutrition and population (HNP) side, policy actions focus on:
     (i) adequate planning and budgeting for community health; (ii) the implementation of the
     demand-side incentive strategy and the community health worker (CHW) incentive
     strategy, respectively, in 100 Sectors; and (iii) strong monitoring and evaluation of the
     impacts.12 The demand-side strategy provides in-kind incentives for uptake of pre-
     determined services.13 Verification includes reconciling utilization data with distribution
     of in-kind incentives. Counter-verification includes periodic sample-based household

10
   The Facility PBF is a supply-side results-based financing program that provides financial incentives to staff at
health centers and district hospitals financed by Ministry of Health (MOH) and faith-based organizations to
deliver a higher quantity of priority maternal and child health services, conditional on the quality of these
services delivered. An impact evaluation showed important successes, but also the limitations of supply-side
incentives. Recognizing the importance of demand-side and community-level factors in determining demand for
key maternal and child health services and the need for innovation to ensure Rwanda`s next phase of
improvements in MDGs 4 and 5, the MOH embarked on the design of the Community Performance-based
Financing program.
11
   The Ubudehe-system of village-level community decision making has been institutionalized through the annual
series of processes to identify beneficiaries based on predetermined benefit criteria. For more information, see
section III.
12
    The plan is to expand implementation of the demand-side incentives to 100 Sectors, and the supply-side
(CHW) incentives to 100 Sectors. The experimental design of the impact evaluation has 50 Sectors with both the
demand and supply-side incentives. Consequently, expanded implementation of the Community PBF (demand-
side and/or supply-side incentives) is occurring in 150 Sectors.
13
   The indicators are: (i) to pregnant women to attend prenatal services within the first trimester; (ii) to deliver at
a health center; and (iii) to mothers who have recently given birth to attend postnatal services within 10 days of
delivery. The original proposal included incentives for women of reproductive age to take up reversible long-
term family planning methods. This indicator was subsequently dropped upon the recommendation of the Bank`s
and other agencies` reproductive health specialists.

     visits to verify that in-kind incentives have been received. Under the CHW incentive
     strategy CHWs are incentivized for reporting on the specific indicators.14 Verification
     includes reconciling reported CHW data with health center referral and utilization data.

4. Rwanda is one of Africa's most densely populated countries, with its modest
geographical size accommodating an estimated population of 10.1 million.16 It is also
among the poorest, despite having made significant progress in the past decade. The
proportion of the population that national household surveys identified as poor decreased
slightly from 60 percent in 2000-01 to 57 percent in 2005-06. However, because of relatively
rapid population growth estimated at 2.7 percent per year and an increase in income
inequality, the estimated total number of people living in poverty rose from 4.8 million in
2000-01 to 5.4 million in 2005-06. More than 90 percent of the poor live in rural areas, and
poverty remains deep and pervasive.

5. Despite strong economic growth, progress towards the Millennium Development
Goals (MDGs) is uneven. Rwanda is on track to achieve the MDGs related to access to
primary education, gender parity, malaria incidence, and HIV prevalence.17 The country has
made strong gains in the area of child health (MDG 4) and maternal mortality (MDG 5).18
However, with a poverty rate of 57 percent, considerable effort will be needed to meet the
MDGs to reduce poverty and hunger.

6. Rwanda's Economic Development and Poverty Reduction Strategy (EDPRS) for
2008-12 builds on strong achievements in human capital development and promotes
three flagship programs to accelerate growth and reduce poverty. These flagship
programs focus on: (a) encouraging a pattern of growth that creates jobs and increases
exports; (b) strengthening governance; and (c) accelerating poverty reduction by promoting
pro-poor components of the national growth agenda and releasing the productive capacity of
the poor in rural areas through a combination of public works, direct support and credit
packages.19 The Vision 2020 Umurenge20 Program (VUP), announced in March 2007 and

14
   The indicators are: (i) women referred to a health center for prenatal care in the first trimester; (ii) women
referred to deliver at a health facility; (iii) referral of children monitored for the nutrition status (conditioned on
correct referral of malnourished children to the treatment facilities); (iv) referral of new family planning users;
and (v) women referred to health center for sustained use of modern contraceptives.

   According to 2005 and 2008 Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) data, over this period under-5 mortality
decreased from 196 to 103 per 1,000 (47 percent decrease) and maternal mortality decreased from 750 to 383 per
100,000 (49 percent decrease). These improvements have also been evident among poor households.

   The Government has progressively devolved responsibilities and transferred resources to decentralized levels
of the administration--Province, District, Sector (Umurenge), Cell (Akagari), and Village (Umudugudu). Of
these, the last three are subordinate tiers of the District governments. The VUP and community health reforms
are being implemented through this newly restructured, decentralized local government system.

subsequently incorporated in EDPRS, constitutes the flagship poverty reduction program. A
pilot that served as a precursor to VUP was also included in the Bank`s Third Poverty
Reduction Support Grant operation in FY2007. Additional complementary interventions to
achieve EDPRS objectives include increasing access to basic health, nutrition and population
(HNP) services to improve health status and slowing down population growth. In support of
these objectives, the Government of Rwanda (GoR) has initiated a set of policy reforms to
expand access to basic health services at the community level.

7. The Bank's Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Rwanda has, as its second
strategic theme, a reduction in social vulnerability by ensuring that the most vulnerable
Rwandans also benefit from growth and by helping Rwanda make further progress in
building a more stable society.21

RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS
Growth Performance
8. The Rwandan economy showed signs of recovery in the first half of 2010. After real
Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth fell to 4.1 percent in 2009 from 11.2 percent in 2008,
it is expected to rebound to 6.5 percent in 2010.           Figure 1: GDP growth
This recovery is mainly driven by strong growth      and contribution by sector, percent
in      services,      particularly    in     the
telecommunications, and construction, even
though credit to the private sector has grown
less than expected. The agriculture sector
continues to be a key source for growth, with
production and prices for main agricultural
exports of coffee and tea having been stable or
increasing in the first half of 2010. The average
growth of 2006-10 is estimated at 7.3 percent
annually and remains slightly below the EDPRS
target of 8 percent.

9. The industry and services sectors were impacted indirectly by the global economic
and financial crisis, the effects of which were transmitted to Rwanda with a slight delay
during 2009. In 2009, agriculture became the main driver for growth, boosted by the ongoing
Crop Intensification Program and favorable weather conditions. Growth in the industry and
services sectors declined dramatically to 1.3 percent and 5.7 percent down from 15.1 percent
and 14.8 percent in 2008, respectively (Figure 1). The main reasons for this decline were the
tight credit conditions in the domestic banking sector, because Rwandan Authorities tried to
manage inflation and domestic demand. Real sector developments in the first half of 2010
outline a picture of ongoing recovery. In agriculture, intensification efforts and favorable
weather conditions led to the increased harvest, mainly in cereals and roots and tubers, which
are largely produced for domestic consumption and were not affected by the price drop for
export goods. Revival in construction activities, transport and storage, and banks and
insurance services contributed to the increasing growth trend for the industrial and services
sectors (estimated at 4.6 percent and 12.8 percent in the first half of 2010).

import prices and the good
performance in food production were Source: NISR
the major cause of this evolution.
Price pressures continued to decrease in 2010. Monetary policy aimed at 7 percent inflation by
end-2010, taking into account expected rises in oil prices, and stabilizing at 5 percent over the
medium term.

External Balance
11.     Trade data for the first nine months of 2010 showed slight improvements, mainly
due to a rebound in prices and strong volumes of Figure 3: Rwanda's external developments,
one of Rwanda's main export goods, tea. Export                      in percent of GDP
values increased by 30 percent compared to the first
half of 2009. Accounting for around 24 percent of
the exports value, tea exports rose by 20 percent.
Imports rose by 2.6 percent in value while the
volume rose by 18.3 percent mainly on account of
lower non-oil import prices and volumes of capital
goods. Remittances continued to increase in 2010
and are projected to reach a record high of US$98.8
million. Gross international reserves are projected
to remain at comfortable levels, but slightly lower Source: NBR & IMF
than end-2009 (Table 1).

12.     Recent global shocks adversely impacted Rwanda's external balances. The trade
deficit and current account deficit widened in 2009. The trade deficit reached 16 percent of
GDP in 2009, up from 13.1 percent in 2008. While imports continued to rise, external demand
for Rwanda`s main export products fell. Export values declined by 28 percent in 2009, also
reflecting lower export volumes. Import values grew by 16.3 percent in 2009, mainly driven
by an increase in imported consumer and energy goods.22 The current account deficit widened,
22
  Continued high levels of private remittances, and reduced barriers within the East African Community (EAC)
and Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA), contributed to the continuous increase in
consumer goods imports.

despite an increase in remittances and public transfers. It deteriorated to 8.5 percent of GDP in
2009, following a downward trend since 2007 (Figure 3). Remittances recorded an increase of
39.2 percent compared to 2008, while public transfers increased by 17.6 percent, reflecting an
increase of 22 percent in budgetary support transfers. In total, current transfers increased by
16.5 percent, but this increase was not enough to outbalance the trade deficit. Nevertheless,
strong foreign capital inflows led to a surplus of 2.8 percent of GDP in the overall balance of
payments in 2009.

Fiscal Performance
13.     In 2010-11, GoR started unwinding its fiscal stimulus. 2009-10 was characterized
by a fiscal stimulus of about 2 percent of GDP, leading to an overall deficit (excl. grants) of
13.2 percent of GDP. The overall deficit before grants is expected to increase to 13.8 percent
of GDP in 2010-11. The overall fiscal deficit including grants is expected to widen due to an
estimated marked decline in grants (2.9 percent of GDP) as grants revert to levels seen prior to
the onset of the financial crisis. Net domestic financing is expected to increase, as
Government spending remains at high levels in 2010-11.

14.     Fiscal year 2009-10 was characterized by an increase in the overall fiscal deficit
(excluding grants) to 13.2 percent of GDP, Figure 4: Fiscal Development (percentage of GDP)
from 11.5 percent in 2008-09 (Figure 4).
This reflected continued high levels of            30.0                                                                   0.0

investments. For the fiscal year 2010-11, net lending is expected to remain flat, with new net-

further KCC lending.

                                Box 1: Government Priority Areas of Spending
1.   The development of physical infrastructure: Priorities will be those investments that improve the
     business environment and reduce the cost of doing business in Rwanda, such as energy generation and
     distribution, road construction and rehabilitation, and ICT development.
2.   Productive sector: Spending will focus on agriculture supply, agri-business, land reform and promotion of
     value addition for exports. Special emphasis will be put on accelerated implementation of the pro-poor
     Vision 2020 Umurenge Program (VUP), introducing integrated development projects in all provinces and
     promoting non-traditional export crops.
3.   Human development and social protection: The focus is on interventions to improve the quality of life of
     the population with special emphasis on providing 9-year basic education, skills development through
     vocational training colleges and strategic support to higher education. Efforts will be also directed towards
     improving the health of the people by intensifying the fight against infectious diseases, preventing and
     treating non-communicable diseases, reducing maternal, infant and child mortality and provide family
     planning services. Social protection interventions will be mainly geared towards increasing the productive
     capacities of the vulnerable members of society by providing employment income generating projects, while
     giving direct support to the physically handicapped and aged people.
4. Good governance and protection of state sovereignty: The priority will be to strengthen community
     policing and to promote the community program of human rights and judiciary support, with particular
     attention to supporting institutions that promote integrity and the fight against corruption, especially the
     Ombudsman and the Office of the Auditor General. Fiscal decentralization will be enhanced through
     increased fiscal transfers to local government and fiscal reforms undertaken to mitigate any fiduciary risks in
     local governments` financial management. Support will also be given to Peace Keeping Forces (in Sudan
     and the East African Community standby force) to ensure security of the state.

15.      Rwanda scores lowest in revenue mobilization compared to its neighboring
countries in East Africa, reporting 12.5 percent of GDP in 2009-10. Preliminary data for
the first half of 2010 indicate that domestic revenue collection exceeded the GoR`s target.
However, shortfalls in trade taxes and losses in corporate taxes led to a revised revenue
projection of 0.2 percent of GDP lower than originally programmed for 2010-11. While the
base year revenue numbers (2009-10) were revised upwards, the projected growth until the
final target in 2012-13 was slightly lowered for each year. The GoR`s overall revenue target of
14.3 percent of GDP remains ambitious at a 2 percent of GDP increase between 2009-10 and
2012-13, despite good progress in tax administration reforms. Following the downward
revision of the revenue target, the GoR committed to submit a revised budget by the end of
2010, with expenditure cuts in the amount of 0.2 percent of GDP.

16.    Rwanda's budget is heavily reliant on grant financing and aid predictability
remains a challenge. In 2009-10, about 53 percent of the entire GoR budget was grant
financed. A large part of these grants is provided as budget support. Budgetary grants
increased in 2009-10 to 9.2 percent of GDP due to additional crisis support by donors, but are
expected to decrease to near pre-crisis levels, 6.9 percent, in 2013-14 (Table 2). The GoR is
working closely with budget support development partners to increase aid predictability. At
the bi-annual Development Partners Meeting in November 2010 it requested donors to
provide: (i) annual commitments in time for the national budget formulation process and (ii)
monthly disbursement plans. The GoR also appealed to donors to use country systems, given

                                                        11
the improvements in PFM, as reflected in the most recent 2010 Public Expenditure
Framework Assessment (PEFA). A considerable amount of bilateral aid is still delivered
outside of the GoR system, i.e. off-budget. In 2009-10, about 45 percent of aid delivered by
development partners was not going through the GoR`s budget.

fiscal consolidation is anchored on unwinding the higher spending levels of the fiscal stimulus
of recent years. Continued efforts to increase domestic revenue collection are crucial, given
the prospect of declining grants and limited scope for domestic financing. Overall, fiscal
policy still needs to be aligned with a sustainable Medium-Term Expenditure Framework
(MTEF) and grounded in a medium-term framework that gradually reduces the overall fiscal
deficit (including grants) to its long-term sustainable level. This medium-term framework
should contain a clear statement of fiscal policy objectives and a credible set of integrated
medium-term macroeconomic and fiscal targets and projection.

2009-10 budget process and included capacity
building for staff of all budget units. The GoR has
also embarked on the process to institutionalize Public Expenditure Reviews (PERs) with the
aim of strengthening public expenditure management and monitoring of spending. In 2010,
PERs were completed for the Water and Sanitation, Agriculture, and Education and Social
Protection sectors. Compared to the 2009 mini-budget execution rate of 92 percent, budget
execution performance has improved to 97 percent in 2009-10.24 A 2010 PEFA update was
completed and shows remarkable improvements compared to the 2007 PEFA (Box 2). The
strong commitment of the GoR to prudent financial management increased donor confidence,
reflected in the continued high share of budgetary grants.

Monetary Policies and Financial Sector Performance

19. Progress has been made by the National Bank of Rwanda (NBR) to enhance the
effectiveness of monetary policy, with reserve money being the anchor of monetary
policy. Liquidity management improved and NBR now targets average reserve money rather
than end-period reserve money as a way to smooth the path of the liquidity.25 Gross official
reserves (in months of imports) increased in 2009 to 5.1 from 4.8. They are expected to
stabilize in 2010 at around 4.8 months. An exchange rate corridor framework was introduced
as a transition measure toward greater exchange rate flexibility. However, NBR is still
challenged by capacity constraints, to implement and monitor the new exchange rate
framework, but also in carrying out its supervision responsibilities. In particular, high turnover
of trained bank examiners continues to weaken the supervisory capacity and remains a

23
   The strategy is based on the results of the 2007 PEFA and includes an operational manual for the MTEF, a
strategic plan for public procurement, internal audit manuals, a strategy for the implementation of the IFMIS and
improved reporting on transfers to districts.
24
   A major reason for this development is the longer execution period for the 2009-10 budget (double of the 2009
mini budget execution period). The overall execution rate hides significant differences in performance among
entities. The differences between budgeted and actual spend at the entity level are more pronounced when
looking at the development budget, whereas the recurrent budgets show smaller deviations.
25
   This is done through a mix of monetary policy instruments, including foreign exchange sales (subject to the
conditions of the foreign exchange market), and daily repos and reverse repos.

potential source of vulnerability in the financial sector. A joint IMF-World Bank Financial
Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) update, planned for February 2011, will review the
financial sector and lay out proposal for future policy reforms.

20. Credit to the private sector has picked up and financial sector soundness
indicators have been improving in 2010. In the first half of 2010, credit to the private sector
picked up slower than expected, reflecting in part pre-election uncertainties, but is expected to
rebound in the second half of the year. As of June 2010, all eight commercial banks were in
compliance with the minimum capital requirements of 5 billion RWF (approximately US$8.5
million). The capital adequacy ratio on a consolidated basis decreased to 17.6 percent in June
2010 against 19 percent in December 2009. The overall banking sector liquidity position has
also improved. Money supply increased by 5.6 percent between December 2009 and June
2010. The volume of newly authorized loans increased by 45.5 percent during the first half of
2010 compared to the same period in 2009. However, the outstanding credit to private sector
has shown only moderate growth compared to the increase in new loans. This reflects efforts
by banks to recover non-performing loans distributed before 2009.

MACROECONOMIC OUTLOOK AND DEBT SUSTAINABILITY
21. Growth will continue to benefit from an increase in agriculture productivity and
the recovery in services. Increased investment in fertilizers, improved seeds, extensions in
services and the dispatch of farm machinery to farmers will sustain the positive trend in the
agriculture sector while services will benefit from the recovery in lending activities recovery.
Growth will also be supported by the GoR`s investment strategy, which is expected to lead to
an increase in GoR capital spending. The Rwanda`s medium-term framework expects that the
country will sustain real growth of 6 to 7 percent per year for 2010-13. This real growth would
be needed to reach the envisioned increase in per capita income and to reduce poverty in line
with the targets of the Rwanda`s EDPRS.

22.     A gradual fiscal consolidation is expected. Fiscal policy will balance the objectives
to pursue growth and poverty reduction of the EDPRS, while preserving debt
sustainability. The fiscal deficit (including grants) is expected to decrease from 3.6 percent of
GDP in 2010-11 to less than 1 percent of GDP by 2012-13. For that to be realized, revenues
need to continue increasing at ambitious levels (consistent with the EDRSP) by two percent of
GDP between 2010-11 and 2012-13. This will be backed by significant reforms in revenue
administration. Simultaneously, dependence on donor aid is expected to decrease, with
official grants predicted to decline slightly from 12.5 percent of GDP in 2009-10 to 10.1
percent of GDP by 2012-13. Additional spending based on medium-term fiscal performance
will follow expenditure prioritization. The updated medium-term projections show a rapid
increase in borrowing from US$96.4 million in 2010 to US$259.0 million in 2011, connected
with a steep increase in the scheduled debt service ratio from 3.6 to 6.2 percent of export
goods and services. This is mainly related to borrowing for the KCC, which was supposed to
happen in 2010, but was pushed back to 2011, pending final agreement of GoR negotiations,
but also the remainder of the Boeing loan to RwandAir.

23.    Over the medium-term, budgetary grants will continue to be the main source of
financing for the GoR's implementation of the EDPRS. The projected increase in
investments will continue to rely on grant financing, which is reflected in the medium-term

based on the newly adopted fiscal year (July to June) as opposed to the previously used
calendar year. Although current commitment levels have not yet been affected by the global
slowdown, projections beyond 2010-11 are based on firm commitments and assume lower
levels of disbursements.

Strong import growth stemming from higher capital imports associated with the expanding
Public Investment Program is in the medium-term expected to outpace moderate expansion in
exports. Export volumes, led by receipts from traditional exports and tourism, and are
forecasted to increase at a slow rate. This is expected to widen the external current account
deficit considerably from about 5 percent of GDP (including grants) in 2008, to about 9
percent by 2011. Long-term improvements are expected, based on the implementation of the
GoR`s Export Promotion Strategy, which is expected to be finalized in 2011.

25.     The most recent Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA) of May 2010 confirmed that
Rwanda remains at moderate risk of debt distress (Box 3).26 Rwanda`s central GoR`s
external debt (including guaranteed) amounted to 14.4 percent of GDP (US$ 749.1 million) by
end 2009, with more than four-fifths owed to multilateral creditors. Debt indicators remain
most vulnerable to an export shock, underlining the need to expand and strengthen the export
base. By end 2009, the debt-service ratio was 1.8 percent of exports of goods and services and
it is expected to increase at 3 percent by        Box 3: Rwanda's Debt Sustainability Analysis

Adequacy of the Macro-Economic Policy Framework

26.     Overall, the medium term macro-economic framework is sound and adequate to
support the GoR's program. In June 2010, the IMF Executive Board approved a three-year
Policy Support Instrument (PSI) for Rwanda upon request by GoR. Rwanda`s track record of
prudent macroeconomic policies justified the transition to PSI-based IMF support. Rwanda
successfully completed the first review of the PSI in December 2010. The medium-term
outlook, including inflation, economic growth and financing remains favorable. The GoR is
continuing to pursue policies that support private sector-led growth. Public investments to
improve agriculture productivity and to reduce the dependence on thermal power as well as
the implementation of a strategic plan for capacity building should help establish the
foundation for long-term sustainable growth. However, fiscal risks remain due to the high
level of donor financing to the budget and the continued high level of public investments.
Revenue efforts need to be intensified. In order to keep external debt dynamics sustainable,
new non-concessional external borrowing for investments will need to be carefully assessed in
regard to economic viability and financing options that incorporate participation from the
private sector should be considered.

 Current analysis is based on the joint Low-Income Country Debt Sustainability Framework prepared by the IMF and
World Bank staff in consultation with the Government authorities.

     III.   THE GOVERNMENT'S PROGRAM AND PARTICIPATORY PROCESSES

ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND POVERTY REDUCTION STRATEGY (EDPRS)
27.    Rwanda's EDPRS (2008-12), its second generation Poverty Reduction Strategy
Paper (PRSP), builds on achievements and lessons from the implementation of the first
PRSP. The strategy emphasizes economic growth and faster poverty alleviation. It builds on
achievements in human development and basic social services, while deepening
decentralization reforms with greater community involvement and promotion of demand side
response, as well as a greater role for the private sector.

28.    The EDPRS is built around three main flagship programs: (a) sustainable growth
for jobs and exports; (b) governance, including deepening decentralization and enhanced
accountability; and (c) the Vision 2020 Umurenge Program (VUP) to accelerate poverty
reduction rates by targeting the most vulnerable segments of the population with a set of
interventions. These include labor-intensive public works, direct financial support to the most
needy and vulnerable households, and microcredit initiatives. In addition, there are also
interventions related to water, sanitation, health, nutrition and population services.

VISION 2020 UMURENGE PROGRAM (VUP)
29.    The VUP promotes economic growth that is increasingly pro-poor and all-
inclusive. The VUP is coordinated by the Ministry of Local Government (MINALOC) and is
implemented through decentralized structures that were introduced in 2000, and further
reformed in 2005-06. They have been imbued over time with specific capacity-enhancement
programs as well as increased responsibilities and resources. The VUP is composed of three
components: (i) labor-intensive public works, that provide support to extremely poor landless
families with under-employed adults through creation of employment opportunities,
encouraging saving and development of productive activities; (ii) direct support to the poorest
households unable to supply labor; and (iii) financial service initiatives intended to facilitate
investment in income-generation and entrepreneurial activities. Broadly, the VUP program
components are intended to raise sustainable living standards, encourage saving, and promote
movement from dependency to self-sufficiency.

30.     The VUP is currently in its third year of implementation and has gradually
scaled up from 30 to 90 Sectors,27 3 poorest Sectors in each of the 30 Districts since
200828. Consistent with the GoR`s decentralization policy, implementation of the VUP is
being planned and coordinated by the Sector administrations with strong community
participation at the local level while Districts provide oversight, technical support, and
supervision. Implementation of VUP has already generated positive results on social
protection policy reforms and their implementation which has translated into benefits to
targeted segments of the population on the ground. Key reform improvements and changes
are summarized below.


27
   The VUP scale-up strategy aims to extend program coverage within each local government District to at least
one additional Sector (Umurenge) annually, a target that has been strictly adhered to since 2008. As of July 2010,
VUP has been extended to a third Sector in each District, implying total coverage of 90 Sectors.
28
   Except for 10 second poorest which were control sectors in the 2008 baseline and thus excluded from
implementation until impact assessment is done.

                                                       17
31.      The Ubudehe system of village-level community decision-making has been
institutionalized through the annual series of processes to identify beneficiaries based on
predetermined benefit criteria. The Ubudehe process incorporates a poverty-mapping
component, which has a systematic methodology that allocates each household to one of six
ordinal income and poverty-related categories differentiated by well-defined qualitative
criteria. The maps have become the basis for community decision-making under the VUP
program about income support for ultra-poor households from local and donor sources, as
well as a guide to which indigent households receive subsidies for health insurance.

32.     International best practice in relation to wage setting and re-setting has been
introduced and adopted across all pilot Sectors under earlier phases of the program.
Under the VUP, wage levels for public works beneficiaries are based on data on wages paid
for similar unskilled works in the same localities. Wage levels are then set at or below wages
paid for similar activities. Wage-setting and resetting are reviewed every year. This approach
is also being adopted for other interventions involving labor-intensive public works outside of
VUP. This has minimized the potential for causing economic distortions as the program scales
up.

NATIONAL SOCIAL PROTECTION STRATEGY (NSPS)
33.    The Social Protection (SP) sector is currently supported by the GoR and
development partners' interventions, although in a less coordinated manner. One
implication has been that the existing social protection framework has inadequate focus on
measuring results and impact. The first SP sector Public Expenditure Review (PER) which
was done in 2006, estimated SP29 spending at 6 percent of GDP. A follow-up PER in 2009
estimated this had risen to 8 percent.30

34.     The GoR has recently finalized the development of a National Social Protection
Strategy (NSPS) to build coherence and complementarities among various programs
that contribute to social protection including the VUP. The strategy seeks, over the
medium-term, to consolidate the different elements of SP in Rwanda and to enhance
effectiveness of current programs. Within the strategy, the VUP continues to constitute the
main operational tool for support to the poor and vulnerable. The strategy was approved by
the cabinet on January 19, 2011.

HEALTH SECTOR REFORMS
35.     The EDPRS aims to maximize preventive health measures and build the capacity
for delivery of pro-poor and accessible HNP services. Since 2004, there has been
significant progress in implementing a variety of health sector reforms to improve equity and
effectiveness of health service delivery. These reforms have included, among others,
performance-based financing (PBF), decentralization and health financing reforms. Other
reforms aimed to focus attention on lagging areas of sectoral performance such as population
policy and nutrition.


29
   SP in this study was defined broadly to include all activities in MINALOC and other ministries perceived to be
contributing to SP objectives, for example, the micro health insurance scheme in the Ministry of Health, the
genocide survivors` program (FARG), as well as the VUP.

Policy were introduced to build more coherence and complementarity amongst various
financing mechanisms; to address the financial viability and sustainability of the phenomenal
expansion of the community-based health insurance, reaching 85 percent coverage in 2009; to
mitigate the regressive aspects affecting near-poor households; and formalize the system`s
regulatory and governance architecture.

37.     Performance-based financing initiatives. The Facility PBF provides financial
incentives to staff at health centers and District hospitals to deliver a higher quantity of
priority maternal and child health services, conditional on the quality of these services
delivered. The achievement under this program has led the way in the region for results-based
financing approaches.31 The Ministry of Health (MOH) expanded the PBF program to
incorporate community-based services by introducing a Community PBF program. This is a
demand- and supply-side incentives-based program targeting women and Community Health
Workers (CHW), respectively, for improved health behaviors and health service utilization,
respectively.

38.     Community Health initiatives. A Community Health Strategy was developed and
validated through a consultative process in 2010. Community health spans numerous technical
areas in health (reproductive, maternal and child health, nutrition, population, etc.) and the
strategy provides an important overarching framework that has been lacking to date. In
January 2011 the MOH hosted the International Conference on Community Health, in part
reflecting the prioritization of and advances in community health in Rwanda.

39.    Other key policy initiatives. In addition to the initiatives above, the GoR has recently
adopted reforms aimed at enhancing nutrition and population control. These are aimed at
further boosting efforts to implement community health policy and related benefits to
communities.

            IV.     BANK SUPPORT TO THE GOVERNMENT'S PROGRAM

LINK TO CAS
40.     Consistent with the VUP, the third flagship under the EDPRS, the second
strategic theme of the CAS seeks to decrease social vulnerability through mitigation of
significant health and social risks to vulnerable groups and social cohesion in Rwanda.32
This operation seeks to boost effectiveness of the second theme of the CAS. The series of
policy reforms under the VUP and community health program are expected to generate quick
impacts and provide alternative livelihoods to the vulnerable segments of Rwanda`s
population. This operation is thus fully aligned with both the EDPRS and the CAS.

COLLABORATION WITH THE IMF AND OTHER DONORS
41.    Rwanda has a high level of donor engagement and GoR attaches high priority to
aid coordination and effectiveness. There are currently 12 bilateral, three multilateral (the
African Development Bank, European Commission, and the World Bank) and about 16

United Nations (UN) organizations active in Rwanda. In addition, a vast number of Non-
Governmental Organizations (NGOs) and vertical funds (including the Global Fund) are
represented with major activities. A considerable amount of aid is still bypassing GoR budget.
The GoR is proactive in initiating better donor coordination, reflected in the Division of Labor
(DoL) exercise of July 2010, and is also supporting a number of donor coordination
initiatives. The GoR was a key driver behind the establishment of the Donor Performance
Assessment Framework (DPAF) and the CPAF for budget support donors.

42.     A DPAF reviews the performance of bilateral and multilateral donors against a
set of establish indicators on the quality and volume of development assistance to
Rwanda. Total Oversees Development Assistance (ODA) for the last DPAF review was
US$941 million from 15 donors in FY10 with 36 percent provided in budget support. The
DPAF exercise is based on donor reporting of aid data and self-reporting on DPAF indicators
at project/program level in a Development Assistance Database (DAD). Key DPAF findings
on an aggregate level include a continued increase in the volume of ODA on budget but a
decrease in the percentage of ODA recorded in the national budget. Other positive
developments include an increased percentage of ODA disbursed using GoR financial
reporting as well as procurement systems. Negative trends are, however, a still low percentage
of ODA disbursed using GoR budget execution as well as auditing procedures. The DPAF
also features budget support specific indicators, which record positively that donors keep GoR
fully informed about the anticipated volumes of budget support. However, progress is lacking
with respect to the predictability and timing of budget support. In an attempt to improve this
indicator GoR recently requested agencies to provide monthly disbursement schedules.

43.     The World Bank (the Bank) and the IMF continue to work closely together to
ensure coordination and consistency in macroeconomic and structural policy programs.
While the IMF advises on the size of the spending envelope on the occasion of budget
discussions, the Bank focuses on the composition of spending and its alignment with the
EDPRS. The IMF`s PSI, approved in June 2010, complements the PRSG/C`s focus on
structural and institutional reforms. The proposed CLSC-3 continues to align objectives,
resources and dialogue with the IMF through its close collaboration with the Bank`s PRSG/C-
7 operation.

44.    The proposed CLSC-3 operation supports a subset of the GoR reform program, which
is complementing the IMF`s Policy Support Instrument (PSI) and the budget support
operations provided by other donors.

45. The CLSG/C series' support for SP is being coordinated with other financial and
technical assistance to the GoR by other donors. Effective coordination has been assured
by the Bank`s regular participation in the periodic VUP and SP technical and policy dialogue
through the SP Sector Working Group (SP SWG) and the VUP Development Partners
Meeting (VUP DPM) and through consistent consultations with the donor community during
all Bank missions. The VUP is currently jointly financed and otherwise supported by donors
and GoR in an increasingly coordinated way. In addition to the budget support through this
operation, the Bank has been providing national technical assistance to program
implementation through an IDA operation (Decentralization and Community Development
Project) that closed in December 2010. The project team has sought options for sustaining the


                                              20
critically important technical assistance by securing Rapid Social Response Trust Fund
support for the next 2 years. Other donors are supporting the program as summarized below.

46.     Bilateral and multi-donor support has continued to grow since the beginning of
the VUP implementation. DFID continues to provide sector budget support to program
implementation, with annual disbursements of close to £5.0 million since 2009. DFID is
expected to sustain this support, together with top-up financing of selected international
technical assistance, until 2012. DFID`s ongoing commitment is approximately
$US31.8 million (£19.7 million) over four years (2009-12) and is aligned with the remaining
EDPRS period. SIDA has just started its support to the program which will amount to
equivalent to Swedish Krona (SEK) 95 million (roughly $US14.5 million) over a three year
period and will primarily focus on financial services and public works components of the
VUP. UNICEF continues to provide some gap-filling technical assistance support and just
finalized a rapid assessment of the VUP`s impact on women and children. The European
Commission (EC) has also committed budget support of approximately Euros 20 millions
over a 4-year period for social protection complementary services / Ubudehe. All of this
support and accompanying technical assistance are expected to sustain seamless
implementation of the VUP until the end of the EDPRS (2012), when it will be assessed
alongside other flagship programs to determine their impact and role in a renewed forward
looking strategy.

47.     The CLSG/C series' support to community health is closely coordinated with
partners providing budget support as well as with other development partners involved
in the sector. The health sector benefits significantly from development assistance, which
accounts for over half of the total health expenditure.33 The MOH has been proactive in
managing the risk of the donors skewing sectoral priorities. It has done so through the SWAp
processes, various technical working groups, and the annual joint GoR and donor process of
reviewing performance and deciding on spending priorities. Several other partners provide on-
and off-budget support to the implementation of the community health policies supported by
the CLSG/C. The prominent donors in this area are the Global Fund, UNICEF, and USAID. In
addition to the financial assistance, partners also provide much needed technical assistance.
The USAID-funded Management Sciences for Health is a key source of technical assistance
for the Community PBF Program.

RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER BANK OPERATIONS
48.     This operation is aligned with and complements the ongoing Poverty Reduction
Support Grant (PRSG/C) series. This operation was developed in parallel to the PRSG/C
given its focus on both Social Protection and Health Sectors with a large number of policy
reforms to support, and the fact that these same policy reforms were also supported by the
Health Results Innovation Trust Fund.

49.    The CLSG/C series continues to draw from other Bank operations that were
completed recently while complementing other ongoing operations. These operations
include the following: (i) Poverty Reduction Support Grant/Credit (PRSG/C) series;
(ii) Decentralization and Community Development Project (DCDP); and (iii) Land

33
  In 2008, development partners accounted for 53 percent of total health expenditure. HNP Country Status
Report, 2009.

                                                  21
Husbandry, Water Harvesting and Hillside Irrigation (LWH). The following paragraphs
briefly describe these relationships further.

50.     Based on achievements in human development, which were championed by the
First PRSG/C series that the Second PRSG/C series seeks to consolidate and
complement with growth policy interventions, the CLSC-3 sustains support to policies
and investments that have been supported by its predecessor in this series. The PRSG/C
1-3 supported health sector reforms that mainly included scaling up of community health
insurance, decentralization of health services management, and PBF. It also supported initial
efforts to implement social protection interventions before the VUP was introduced. The
PRSG/C 4-7 consolidates gains in human development and addresses the growth elements of
poverty reduction and economic development through further strengthening of investment in
human capital and skills, improving water supply and sanitation, and complementing
investments under ongoing operations in agriculture, rural development, energy and transport.

51.     The proposed CLSC-3 has complementary policy objectives to PRSG/C 4-7. The
PRSG/C 4-7 focuses on dealing with structural issues including enhancing the skills base of
the population, improving the economic infrastructure, and raising agriculture productivity.
This operations aims at enhancing the effectiveness of the social safety net to help reach the
neediest segments of the population and contribute to acceleration of poverty reduction rates.
It also aims at supporting the Community PBF Program in improving access to quality
services, particularly amongst the poor communities, most of which are based in rural areas.
These policies will complement the PRSG/C by boosting Rwanda`s potential for positive
progress toward achieving poverty reduction faster and more efficiently. At the same time,
policies that the CLSG/C supported will promote inclusive and pro-poor growth, a cause to
which the GoR, other development partners and the Bank are committed. The operation was
not included initially into the PRSG/C series because of the requirements of the health trust
fund, and the magnitude of SP and health reforms which triggered the GoR at the inception
stage to prefer to have it as a separate program.

52.      The IDA supported Decentralization and Community Development Project
(DCDP) built an important foundation for the VUP and the CLSG/C series. The DCDP
successfully expanded the notion of community-driven development initiatives. These were
initiated by its predecessor, the Community Reintegration and Development Project (CRDP)
which included strong community empowerment and participation elements as well as related
community capacity building and awareness. In addition, the project supported capacity-
building at the District level and orientation programs at the Sector levels. DCDP`s work
helped to create social infrastructure assets (mainly class-rooms and health facilities) in
remote areas, enhanced capacities at the District level and deepened understanding of
decentralization reforms amongst local leaders and the citizenry. For the last two years, the
VUP has benefited from the DCDP work through lessons on implementation, enhanced
District capacity, and technical assistance to the Sectors to manage and coordinate VUP
activities.

53.    The Land Husbandry, Water Harvesting and Hillside Irrigation (LWH)
operation managed by the Bank's Agriculture team has been complemented by the
interventions supported under the CLSG/C series and the reverse will hold as LWH
implementation takes off. The LWH includes a component on labor-intensive public works,

                                             22
which provides both employment and earning opportunities for the poor and contributes to
creation and maintenance of community assets. The earlier start of VUP implementation has
generated useful information for LWH during its implementation, particularly on setting and
re-setting of wage rates as well on eligibility criteria for selecting participants in the public
works program. Lessons from implementation of the VUP have therefore been useful in
informing design of other Bank operations like the LWH.

LESSONS LEARNED
54.    In addition to the lessons learned described in the Program Document for the
CLSG-2 (pages 13 and 14), the implementation of VUP has generated additional lessons
that are described below:

   Targeting is a key element of implementing successful social protection interventions.
   Targeting is a learning-by-doing process and can both draw from unique community-based
   systems, like the Ubudehe system in Rwanda, while complementing them with more
   scientific systems like the proxy-means testing for more efficiency in reaching intended
   beneficiaries which was shown in other countries. Assessments of the Ubudehe system
   indicate that it is successful in identifying poor households. Filtering the results of the
   Ubudehe system by the land possession criteria seemed at face value to be an effective
   way of yet enhancing the targeting. However, implementation revealed that this criterion is
   causing distortions since land productivity and value vary from one area to the other, and
   some of the poor population rent land. These findings emerged from the 2009 M&E
   surveys of the VUP.

   Harmonization and alignment of donor and GoR interventions reduce transaction
   costs for the GoR and translate into better programmatic interventions. As the VUP
   scale-up expands to a third Sector in each District, it is clear that results on the ground are
   strong. The programmatic approach to the VUP support by donors and GoR has facilitated
   this. While this approach presents significant donor coordination demands and challenges,
   results are better for the GoR and beneficiaries as observed under VUP implementation.

   The existence of decentralized governance and management structures highly
   facilitates successful implementation of community-targeted social protection
   reforms. This is particularly true when related targeting systems draw on community-
   driven development (CDD). Under the VUP, the lowest level of administration below
   Districts has played a significant role in the entire implementation process. While
   decentralized structures present capacity challenges, use of decentralized systems helps to
   identify those capacity challenges and to ensure proper follow-ups in addressing them.
   Generally, the case of VUP shows that systems and administrations that are closer to the
   people help facilitate easier provision of basic services.

   Parallel technical assistance support to a development policy lending (DPL)
   operation is key to successful outcomes. The DCDP`s support provided at the sector
   level played a key role in allowing the VUP to take off and capture lessons learnt. While
   agreeing on policy reforms is important, without this type of support it would have been
   difficult for the VUP to achieve results.



                                               23
      Continuous systems analysis and taking corrective action should be part and parcel
      of the implementation process. Initial implementation was significantly hampered by
      delays in processing sub-projects for public works through community and local
      government procurement systems, as well as by inefficiencies both in delivery of direct
      support to beneficiaries and in fiscal relations between the central and local governments.
      Preliminary but unsystematic systems analyses have helped to iron out some of the delays
      and inefficiencies in payments systems, fiscal transfers and the processing of public works
      sub-projects. Systematic assessment of administrative interactions between levels of
      government and development of action plans to address related challenges could further
      increase the efficiency of the program implementation.

55.      Specific lessons for health policy reforms include the following:

      Incentives matter. There is a growing body of empirical evidence of the use of incentives
      to reward health service providers for specific types of results and to motivate individuals
      for health-related behaviors. The experiences in the health sector have been led to a large
      extent by findings of the impact evaluation of the PBF in Rwanda. These findings follow
      the experiences with conditional cash transfers, and confirm that individuals (whether it is
      mothers, pregnant women or service providers) respond to incentives and that these
      incentive-effects can be used to yield sustainable health results.

      Valuable lessons can be learned from a process evaluation of pilot implementation.
      A process evaluation was conducted of the pilot of the incentive strategy in 30 VUP
      Sectors. The findings yielded important lessons in several areas, and were applied when
      planning the scaling up to 150 Sectors, including: (i) the process of implementing the
      demand-side incentives; (ii) the effectiveness of the training of Steering Committee staff
      in design of Community PBF; (iii) effectiveness of the publicizing the program to
      communities; (iv) the flow of funds to health centers and quantification of funds allocated
      to health centers; (v) the procurement system of in-kind incentives, and (vi) the experience
      with implementing the verification mechanisms.

      Even when an impact evaluation is conducted, monitoring is of critical importance.
      Not only does monitoring of administrative and service delivery data help increase the
      explanatory power of an impact evaluation. It also allows for the coordinating the timing
      and duration of the exposure period and the timing of the end-line survey for the impact
      evaluation.

      Investing in collaboration with a national research team not only strengthens in-
      country capacity in this technical area, but also contributes greatly to the successful
      implementation, management and ownership of an evaluation. A team from the
      National University of Rwanda School of Public Health was competitively selected in
      2009 to provide in-country technical support on the hands-onn participation in design and
      implementation of the evaluation (development of the impact evaluation concept note, the
      questionnaires, and training of enumerators with the survey firm to ensure quality). In
      addition, the national research team served as a key focal point between the Bank`s task
      team and the MoH counterparts in order to advise on mid-course corrections, troubleshoot
      during data collection, and ensure the evaluation responded to the key policy questions of
      the MoH. By establishing a key local research partner, the Bank task team was able to

                                                24
   develop and ensure local ownership of the study and commitment to the quality of data
   collection.

ANALYTICAL UNDERPINNINGS
56.    Preparation of the CLSC-3 is underpinned by a number of analytical pieces of
work conducted by the GoR, development partners, or independent consultants. These
include, but are not limited to, household survey analyses, public expenditure reviews, poverty
assessments, demographic and health surveys, MDG country-specific reports, and Poverty
Reduction Strategy Evaluations. The main analytical works are summarized in the table

OPERATION DESCRIPTION
57.     The Program Development Objective of the CLSG/C series is to support GoR's
social protection and health policy reforms designed to reduce extreme poverty, initially
in 30 pilot Sectors, and to expand access to high-impact health, nutrition and population
interventions at the community level. The series helps Rwanda to integrate international
good practice within its poverty-reducing policies under the EDPRS flagship Vision 2020
Umurenge Program (VUP). The series helps ensure the GoR`s policy reforms follow
international good practice in two areas: assisting extremely poor, landless households
through public works employment or, where such households are also labor-poor, through
cash transfers; and delivering high-impact health, nutrition and population (HNP)
interventions at the community level using PBF strategies. These policy actions are consistent
with the Bank`s CAS objectives and with the fiscal sustainability and effectiveness of public
resource allocation as reflected in the EDPRS. Since the inception of the first CLSG grant,
the VUP has been scaled up to 90 pilot Sectors and the health interventions to 150 Sectors.

58.      Overall expected benefits on the social protection policy side include a VUP
policy framework and MTEF that are closely aligned with the PRSG/C, EDPRS, and
CAS goals, while at the same time incorporating international good practice policies.
GoR`s social protection policies supported by this operation are expected to contribute to (a)
reduction in the poverty-income gaps in pilot Sectors over a three-year period and (b) greater
opportunities for beneficiaries to seek self-reliance and to graduate into income-generating
activities from public works and in some cases from direct supports programs. The operation
is thus closely linked with GoR`s program, but enhances its quality, transparency, and
outcomes.

59.     Analytical work is confirming the Ubudehe system is effectively targeting the
poor and impact on the population seems to be positive. A Household Poverty survey was
conducted during October-December 2009 in 90 Sectors (30 Sectors from each cohort of VUP
Sectors). Analysed together with the 2009 targeting survey, the VUP`s findings of the analysis
indicate that the Ubudehe system is identifying poor households well and is better than many
other countries` community-based systems. This finding is based on examining certain facets
of poverty and vulnerability with categories 1 and 2 of the Ubudehe system, such as female-
headedness, disability, illiteracy, etc. However, the system could be complemented and
strengthened in order to avoid potential exclusions, such as children in poor households.
Complementing the Ubudehe system, preferably including some other facets of vulnerability
in the categories, would further improve its targeting efficiency.

60.     VUP's analysis of the survey data indicates strong poverty reduction results.
Extreme income poverty34 is 35.1 percent across all VUP Sectors, a fall of 3.9 percent from 39
percent in 2006. The fall in extreme income poverty has been much stronger in more dynamic
1st cohort pilot Sectors, 35.7 percent to 25.6 percent. Such a reduction of 10.1 percent is twice
the reduction in the two other cohort Sectors. The reduction has been concentrated in male-

34
  Income poverty is calculated using a basic expenditure approach measuring the value of food consumption
and other basic expenditures.

                                                    26
headed households (from 37.9 percent to 33.1 percent, -4.8 percent). Female-headed
households report a fall of only 1.8 percent (from 42.6 percent to 40.8 percent). The VUP`s
analysis also shows that the numbers of households in the bottom two Ubudehe categories
have decreased globally by 6.4 percent between 2007 and 2009 (from 34.7 percent to
28.3 percent). The decrease has been highest in the 1st cohort Sectors (from 32.7 percent to
23.9 percent, a reduction of 8.8 percent). In the other Sectors the fall is 5.3 percent (from
35.7 percent to 30.4 percent). Net Ubudehe graduation (i.e. the percentage of households
moving to a higher category less households moving to a lower category) between 2007 and
July 2009 is 18.3 percent. Net Ubudehe graduation is 52 percent as strong for male headed
households (20.5 percent) compared to female headed households (13.5 percent).

61.    However, different analysis to the data indicates that that direct support (DS) is
having a significant and pronounced impact in increasing food consumption of poor
households, which may have positive outcomes on the nutritional status of beneficiary
households. However, public works (PW) is not producing the same significant impacts on
beneficiary households` food consumption. While it cannot be clearly explained why this is
happening, this outcome could be due the small number of days of work provided.

62.    A recent qualitative assessment conducted by the UNICEF indicates that overall
perception of the VUP program is consistently positive among beneficiaries. Overall,
beneficiaries report a positive impact by the VUP program. VUP was found to help
households become eligible for other GoR programs, such as SACCO (Savings and Credit
Cooperative) and the health scheme. Fifty-five percent of households reported saving a
portion of their VUP benefit. The average amount saved is 11,272.7 RWF. Fifty-four percent
of VUP beneficiaries report spending (or intend on spending) on food commodities. But
beneficiaries also report using funds to purchase productive assets such as livestock
(24.5 percent), health products (19.9 percent), farm inputs (18.3 percent), and education
(13.1 percent).

63.      However there seems to be variations in the PW wage rates. Sixty-one percent of
PW beneficiary households reported that the PW wage rate was higher than the market rate for
similar non-VUP supported job, while 26.1 percent reported that this wage was lower. The
average daily public works wage was 944.6 RWF. There was some indication of crowding
out` other gainful employment although it is unclear what this other work` involves. Top
three activities mentioned by VUP public works participants on work foregone in favor of
VUP were Labor on own farm (30.5 percent), childcare (9.2 percent) and other paid work
(5.7 percent). About 18 percent of household members report participating in the VUP public
works program of which 60 percent indicated working on a VUP project in the past month.
The average number of days worked is 11.2 days but with variations at provincial levels.
However during the focus group discussions there was "a consistent complaint that the wage
rate is not high enough.

64.     Similarly, overall expected benefits on the health policy side include policy
reforms to improve community HNP services, in support of the EDPRS objective to
improve health status and slow down population growth. EDPRS targets for Rwanda
include expanding access to basic health services to improve hard-to-reach MDGs for
reducing fertility, malnutrition, and maternal and child mortality, as well as combating
infectious diseases, particularly HIV/AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis. Building on substantial

                                             27
progress in improving facility-based services, this operation supports reforms in GoR`s
community HNP policies that complement the VUP, including a strategy to deliver high-
impact interventions to households by a network of CHW and stimulate demand among poor
women especially for key services, and thereby contribute to improved access to high impact
maternal and child health services by poor rural households.

65.     The complementary aspects noted under CLSG-1 and CLSG-2 continue under
CLSC-3. As poverty affects health and poor health contributes to poverty, the policy
reforms in social protection and health supported by this operation are strongly
complementary. Under the VUP, the social protection policies are aimed at providing income
support to the poorest households in the poorest areas of the country, while the community
health policies focus on improving access to services and health outcomes among poor
households in rural areas. The results-based financing innovations supported by the operation
were piloted first in the 30 VUP Sectors before their nationwide scale-up. It is anticipated that
support from the social protection and health interventions will provide multi-sectoral
synergies that enhance cumulative benefits to poor households. Achieving progress on MDG 1
(poverty and nutrition) in particular is dependent on improvements in a broad range of socio-
economic factors, while child and maternal mortality are similarly affected by numerous
determinants outside the health sector. This is most immediately evident with regard to child
nutrition, which is strongly influenced by both household poverty level and access to basic
health services.

66.     During CLSG-1 and CLSG-2, several key actions were completed by GoR. The
following policies were the focus of the earlier operations in the programmatic series.

   Social Protection Policy: CLSG-1 and CLSG-2 ensured that social protection policy
   reforms followed international good practice. Specifically, under CLSG-1, policy reforms
   included the adoption of a non-distortionary wage policy for public works, direct payment
   of workers without intermediaries, and determination of direct support benefits to poor
   families with no adult labor based on the household as a unit. All these features are still
   maintained to date. Under CLSG-2, policy reforms included shifting to voluntary savings,
   and a process for determining eligibility that is clear and transparent to all potential
   recipients and non-recipients because it makes program policy and procedures widely
   known and selection outcomes publicly available.

   Health, Nutrition, and Population Policy: Under CLSG-1 and CLSG-2, health policies and
   strategies were implemented to expand poor households` access at the community level to
   selected reproductive, maternal and child health interventions. There is clear evidence of
   evolution over the series, from policy approval of concept (CLSG-1) to detailed program
   design (CLSG-2) and piloting, refinement and implementation of Community PBF (under
   CLSG-2 and CLSC-3). The policy actions included: (i) financial reforms (e.g., tariff
   reforms to remove user fees for long-term family planning methods; increased budget
   spent on results-based financing principles); (ii) improved planning and budgeting for
   community health (adoption of a Community Health Policy; approval of an annual
   implementation plan and budgeting for community health as reflected in the annual
   MTEF); (iii) the design and adoption of the Community Performance-based Financing
   program (Community PBF) and development of related institutional mechanisms that
   provide demand-side incentives targeting women and complementary supply-side

                                               28
    incentives targeting Community Health Workers (CHWs) with the overall goal of
    stimulating demand for contraceptive use, pre- and postnatal care and institutional
    deliveries; and (iv) a rigorous evaluation of the impact these reforms. The policy actions
    have been sustained (e.g., removal of user fees for family planning under CLSG-1) and the
    design of Community PBF the Implementation Manual (under CLSG-2) is about
    95 percent retained.

    No audit report was requested for the CLSG-1 and CLSG-2 operations. The Bank retains
    the option of seeking an audit if necessary.

Policy Area: Social Protection

68.     The GoR's innovative VUP flagship program is aimed at addressing the
challenges of deep and pervasive poverty. The CLSG/C series supports and facilitates the
GoR`s efforts, incorporating global good practices. Building on the CLSG-1 and 2 reforms,
the following additional key policy challenges will be addressed in CLSC-3:

69.     Challenges: The need for a framework to handle appeals and complaints by
beneficiaries and non-beneficiaries. Maintaining public confidence in the Ubudehe
selection process requires that the public fully understands and accepts the system, and that
there is a process by which the public can appeal or complain. This challenge will be
addressed under CLSC-3. The feedback provided by such an appeals and complaints
mechanism would also provide important input for enhancing the performance of the VUP.



35
   Ministerial Instructions are official directives that summarize Community PBF implementation processes and are intended
to guide the health center staff and CHWs who are the direct implementers of the program.

                                                             30
70.     Actions to Date/Supported Measures: The GoR through MINALOC has drafted an
appeals and complaints mechanism with input from development partners. Following
revisions, the draft was shared with the five local governments representing the Sectors
chosen for the pilot implementation. Piloting started on September 24 in these five Sectors. A
media presentation was held on 26 September, 2010 to introduce the mechanism. In
December, 2010 MINALOC consolidated lessons learned from the piloting and drafted a note
that has been finalized. The appeals and complaints mechanism proved to be a valuable
addition to the program. The feedback from beneficiaries has been overwhelmingly positive,
and it is having a good impact on understanding of program policy and procedures, and why
and how decisions are made. The recommendation from the VUP team and the local
communities is that this mechanism should be continued. It is also seen as a good model for
other programs in terms of transparency, and Executive Secretaries in non-VUP sectors have
indicated they would like to introduce such systems in their Sectors.

71.     Challenges: The need to strengthen the design, planning and management of
VUP budgetary processes in an evolving decentralized budgetary framework. GoR uses
various channels to provide funds that support the budgets of Rwanda`s 30 sub-national
District governments for multiple purposes.36 One is to finance the VUP. The GoR`s policy
intention is that at a national level, DS typically absorbs 20 percent of the VUP budget; PW
receives at least 50 percent of VUP funding; and FS receives 30 percent. However, in this
context, the GoR also seeks more broadly to make budget allocations based on Sector-specific
needs, a core aspect of the new Fiscal Decentralization Strategy (FDS) as part of its
decentralization efforts. It is in these policy contexts the CLSC-3 is addressing the evolving
decentralized budgetary framework under the VUP. The approved policy action number two
seeks to balance the flexibility of funds allocations with the overall broad component
allocation.

72.     Actions to Date/Supported Measures: The GoR is undertaking a review of its budget
formula that allocates national Common Development Fund (CDF) funds among Districts and
of its budgeting processes for allocating Districts` funds among their constituent Sectors. It is
also delineating the relevant management and administrative responsibilities of District and
Sector levels of government. Furthermore, with support from the CLSC-3 operation, a new
VUP budget allocation policy and process was developed and approved by the CDF Board on
December 15, 2010. The new policy maintains the broad national level 50:20:30 allocation to
PW, DS and FS respectively, but with Sector and program component forecasts and
allocations based on needs. Under the new policy, Direct Support needs continue to be met in
full. A dedicated fund for beneficiary training will be established as well as a risk
management fund to respond to unanticipated changes in needs.


36
   Districts manage this in conjunction with their subordinate Sector (Umurenge) level of government, which the
2007 decentralization reform created. The VUP program is being phased in over a period of years by periodically
increasing the number of Sectors per District that VUP covers--from one Sector per District in 2008 to two in
FY2009-10 and three in FY2010-11. Concurrently, the Government is refining the mechanism for allocating
VUP funds among Sectors and among VUP`s three subprograms. The VUP subprograms have different
characters. DS entitles households deemed eligible to receive a cash payment. Where funded public works tasks
are available locally, PW offers the jobs to people in the pool of eligible households. FS provides evolving
financial services to a defined category of eligible people that includes members of households eligible for DS or
PW.

                                                       31
73.     Challenges: The need to improve targeting and reduce potential inclusion and
exclusion errors under the current system. The VUP uses the Ubudehe, the traditional
Rwandan process of village-level community decision-making, as the basis for the program`s
targeting mechanism (see Section III and Annex 5) together with additional criteria related to
land and labor availability. This was considered a solid targeting mechanism with strong
community-based ownership and, as such, highly desirable as VUP is scaled up. Household
baseline survey data from December 2008 suggest that vulnerable households are more likely
to be included in the VUP programs. However, the analysis also shows that there is room for
improving the targeting efficiency by complementing and strengthening the Ubudehe
system by including some indicators of poverty based on analysis of the 2006 household
survey data. The land criterion was also found to be misleading in many situations. The third
policy action comes to enhance this targeting system.

74.     Actions to Date/Supported Measures: Measures have already been taken during
CLSG-1 to improve targeting and minimize errors, including sensitization on the policy and
procedures, development of detailed targeting guidelines and formats, targeting training (for
Sector and village-level staff and facilitators), all of which underpinned the most recent
targeting exercise in May/June 2009. CLSG-2 supported the GoR to ensure that statistical and
administrative processes and tools for identifying, listing, validating and enrolling eligible
beneficiaries are reviewed, streamlined and made familiar to implementers, so that the VUP
scale-up meets its VUP objectives. The new policy approved under CLSC-3 is based on
lessons learned from the use of the existing Ubudehe process. The new policy continues to use
the existing Ubudehe-based targeting system. It eliminates the land criterion as it is not
relevant in urban areas, and is meaningless when taking into account the productivity of land,
which varies considerably across and within regions. The new policy also seeks to
(a) strengthen accurate reporting of household sizes, particularly for DS households, and
(b) strengthen accurate reporting of adults unable to work. The policy identifies the need to
clarify policy and implementation arrangements for PW pregnant and breastfeeding women;
review potential child-care options for mothers with young children working on PW sites, and
recommends the conduct of further research on the underrepresentation of households with
children amongst DS households.

75.    Important results have already been achieved under the VUP. Seventy-seven percent of
those households eligible benefitted from Public Works against a target of 35 percent. For
Direct Transfer, 100 percent of eligible households benefited against a target of 80 percent.

76.    Expected Results: Implementation of social protection good practice policies in
Rwanda should ensure that programs are better administered and that assistance is delivered
on time to intended beneficiaries, thus contributing to the overall policy goal of reducing the
poverty gap over a three-year horizon. Continuing to build on CLSG-1 and CLSG-2, the third
operation is expected to generate results in area of (a) strengthening public confidence in the
Ubudehe selection process by introducing the appeals and complaints mechanism; (b) reduce
potential inclusion and exclusion errors; and (c) ensure that VUP budgetary allocations
consider Sector needs.

77.    Community HNP policy reforms address key challenges to making progress on
the hard-to-reach MDGs. The operation supports a series of policy reforms that complement
the VUP, including strategies to stimulate demand for selected reproductive, maternal and
child health services through a set of incentives targeting women and CHW. There is
progression in the policy actions between the CLSG-1, CLSG-2 and CLSC-3. The CLSG-1
policy actions focused on the Community PBF policy development, the CLSG-2 policy
actions focused on development of the reproductive and maternal health strategy and the
community health worker training strategy; and the CLSC-3 policy actions focus on
consolidation and implementation of these policy reforms.

78.    Challenge: The need for improved coherence and articulation of the family
planning policy and to remove the financial barriers that prevent access to modern
family planning methods especially among especially rural poor women.

79.     Actions to Date/Supported Measures: The Population and Family Planning Policy
was developed in 2008 (including an information, education, and communication [IEC]
strategy) and it was formally adopted in 2009. Health policies and strategies expanded poor
households` access at the community level were implemented e.g., tariff reforms to remove
user fees for family planning methods. Finally, Community Health Workers (previously called
family planning promoters) received updated training in modern family planning methods.

80.      Expected Results: Improved utilization of family planning, contributing to reduced
fertility and population growth (indicator: percent of married women aged 15-49 using
modern contraceptives).

81.     Challenge: The need for community-based action to complement facility-based
efforts to achieve the hard-to-reach MDGs, and the need for coordinated planning and
budget allocation for Community Health. The impact evaluation also showed the limits of
supply-side incentives (provided to providers through the Facility PBF). The impact
evaluation showed that, for example, the uptake of prenatal care was very modest with only
supply-side efforts. There is the need for coherence and coordination in the community-based
efforts of the MOH, and to expand the skills of staff in the Community Health Desk.

82.     Actions to Date/Supported Measures: A Community Health Strategy had been
developed and related efforts aim to improve coordination of community health activities.
With Bank support, a draft Community Health Strategic Plan was developed. The process
culminated in a one-day validation workshop involving 22 institutions. The Community
Health Strategy is expected to be approved in January 2011. The work of the Community
Health Technical Working Group has also been of critical importance to coordinate all the
support of development partners in the area of community health. Community health spans
multiple technical areas (such as maternal health, child health and reproductive health) and the
MOH has also led a strong effort to improve budgeting for community health using a
budgeting tool that was jointly developed by the Bank and UNICEF. There is also now
explicit budgeting for Community Health in the MOH`s annual budgeting planning and
allocation process, together with increased funding for community health.


                                              33
83.     The capacity of the Community Health Desk has been expanded, although some
gaps remain. The MOH has created additional positions in the Community Health Desk, and
together with donor-funded technical assistance based in the unit, capacity has expanded. The
Community Health Desk has been much more proactive with engagement of Districts and
providing leadership to guide coordinated implementation of community health reforms. The
Minister has furthermore taken an active and visible leadership to community health efforts,
launching many of the community-based efforts personally, as well as communicating through
radio and television.

84.     Expected Results: Improved coordination of community health efforts and improved
financing of Community PBF program. (Indicator: annual per capita allocation to PBF for
health facilities and community health cooperatives).

85.      Challenge: The need to stimulate demand for reproductive, maternal and child
health services. The impact evaluation of the PBF program implemented at health centers
found that there are limits to the ability of supply-side efforts by providers to improve
utilization of high impact services. Demand for these services, especially among the poor, are
constrained by knowledge of the need and the availability of services. The Demographic and
Health Survey (DHS) data shows how knowledge of the value of prenatal care, postnatal care,
risks of home-based deliveries are lowest among the poor.

86.     Actions to Date/Supported Measures: The Health Center PBF model that was
introduced in 2006 was expanded to include a community-based dimension. Under this DPL
series the detailed design and adoption of the Community PBF was undertaken, as well as the
development of related institutional mechanisms that provide demand-side incentives
targeting women. Table 5 shows the in-kind demand-side incentives.

87.     The MOH undertook a pilot of the demand-side incentives in the 30 VUP Sectors
(in January­June 2010) and the experience yielded invaluable lessons to inform
expansion to the 150 Sectors. A review of the pilot was conducted using site visits, key
informant interviews and review of HMIS and other data. The main areas that were covered
in the pilot review are: (i) transfer of funds from the Treasury to health centers;
(ii) procurement of in-kind incentives; (iii) flow of information between Community Health
Desk and Health Centers; and (iv) data reporting and verification. The main lessons pertained

                                                         34
to practical aspects of community mobilization, how health center staff reorganizes their daily
functions to accommodate the increase workload generated by the program, the size of the
transfer of funds to health centers, amongst others. The flow of funds and procurement
benefitted from the relatively decentralized system of financial management and procurement.

88.     Following the issuance of a Ministerial Instruction (for the demand-side
incentives) in August 2010, implementation in 100 sectors started in October 2010. A
payment order from MINECOFIN confirms the transfer for funds for demand-side incentives
to the health center bank accounts. In-kind incentives have been procured by health centers
and these have been disseminated to eligible women.

89.     One of the key areas that require further attention is the implementation of
verification mechanisms--a fundamental issue in results-based financing. The early
results from the VUP pilot are promising. The preliminary data suggests a significant uptake
of the incentivized services. Using the example of prenatal services within the first 4 months
of pregnancy (one of the four demand-side incentives)37, the pilot review found a 48 percent
increase between over the period January-June for 2009 and 2010 for the VUP Sectors. While
not all of the increase is attributable to the introduction of demand-side incentives (as other
sectors have also seen an increase, but the increase was not of the magnitude in the VUP
Sectors).

90.    Expected Results: Increased utilization of child and maternal health services, reduced
risk of maternal mortality due to improved delivery and referral care, as well as and
reproductive health services. (Indicator: percent of births in an accredited facility; and percent
of married women aged 15-49 using modern contraceptives).

91.      Challenge: The need to support and motivate CHWs through performance-based
payments tied to improved service delivery indicators. All over the world are examples of
failed CHW programs because they were not able to be sustained. The model of CHW
Cooperatives provides great promise, although it is not without challenges. The success of the
CHW incentive strategy is strongly reliant on the functioning of the CHW Cooperatives. In
many instances these are newly formed organizational entities that are likely to have capacity
weaknesses especially early in the implementation phase. A mitigating factor is that while the
institutions are new, the CHWs that make up these Cooperatives are quite experienced (as
they functioned within Village Health Worker Associations that existed before the
Cooperatives were formed).

92.     Actions to Date/Supported Measures: CHW Cooperatives were established initially
in 30 Umurenge, and this was expanded nationally. Performance-based contracts have been
designed and signed with all targeted CHW Cooperatives. After the Ministerial Instruction
(for the supply-side incentives) was issued, implementation started in October 2010. All
CHW Cooperatives have contracts with PBF Steering Committee represented by the
Executive Secretary of the Sector. Performance reports from Cooperatives have been

37
  The rationale for the chosen indicators is provided elsewhere (MOH, Implementation Manual, July 2010). It is
worth noting that while 96 percent of women have at least one prenatal visit in Rwanda, only 24 percent of
pregnant women have 4 prenatal visits. A visit in the first trimester is highly correlated with the likelihood of
completing 4 visits, which in turn is strongly correlated with likelihood to give birth in a health facility (Source:
DHS 2005, 2008).

                                                        35
submitted and the Sector Steering Committees have met for 78 CHW Cooperatives (out of the
expected 100). A payment order from MINECIFIN shows that transfers have been made to
health center accounts from which it will be transferred to the Cooperative accounts.

93.     The success of the supply-side CHW incentives is critically linked to the
successful functioning of CHW Cooperatives.38 The Law governing cooperatives (Law
50/2007) specifies requirements for registration to function at the district and national level.
The overwhelming majority (92 percent) of the 100 CHW Cooperatives has obtained
authorization from District authorities, which allows them to function as Cooperatives in
specified sectors. Despite meeting the registration requirements many Cooperatives lack
capacity in operational and financial management, human resource development etc. as
identified in the National Cooperatives Promotion Policy. The Bank and other development
partners have funded technical assistance to coordinate and support capacity development
efforts. The MOH is working closely with the Rwanda Cooperative Agency (RCA) in
building the capacity of the Cooperatives (a primary function of the RCA). A Cooperatives
Sub-Working Group (of the Community Health Technical Working Group) has been
convened to coordinate the inputs of various development partners providing assistance to
CHW Cooperatives. The MOH is in the process of formally contracting NGOs to provide on-
going technical support to Cooperatives.

94.    The CHW Cooperatives have been trained in the design and implementation
arrangements for the Community PBF was a key step in the preparation for the
expansion to 150 Sectors. Over the period August 17-September 22, 2010 the MOH, in
partnership with Management Sciences for Health (MSH) and the Bank, organized training
workshops reaching 1,416 officials in 377 sectors.39

95.      Expected Results: Improved coverage of high-impact HNP interventions at the
community level is expected to respond to the health needs of poor households. The transfer
of knowledge and health services to communities will help households better manage their
own health care needs, which will indirectly contribute to improved productivity and higher
income-earning potential. The program is expected to contribute to: (a) improved maternal
health outcomes through expanded use of prenatal care and facility-based deliveries;
(b) improved outcomes such as use of modern contraceptives and ultimately reductions in
fertility and population growth; and (c) improved child health including neonatal health (from
expanded use of postnatal visits improved referral for malnourished children).

96.    The Community PBF program is fully integrated into the GoR's health sector.
The program has attracted a lot of positive interest by donors and sustainability many donors



38
   Cooperatives are a key vehicle for employment creation expansion of access to income-generating activities
and improve social well-being through gender equality, education, health care and community development. The
term CHW Cooperatives refers to Cooperatives whose membership comprise primarily but not exclusively of
CHWs. Many of these cooperatives have grown out the entities that existed previously, the Associations of
Village Health Workers. While engaging in income-generating activities other than community health work, the
CHWs spend roughly half of their time (2-3 out of 5 weekdays) doing community health work.
39
   The participants included: (i) from District level: the director of health and the supervisor of community health;
(ii) from Sector level: the president of CHW cooperatives, the president of the Sector steering committee, the
community health coordinator at the health center , as well as the person in-charge of the health centers.

stand ready to support the Community PBF. In fact, many donors want to add additional
incentives and indicators to the basic Community PBF model.

97.    To ensure that the operation is successful and that there is strong ownership of
supported policy actions, the operation is applying good practice principles, on
conditionality, as outlined in the box below.

Box 4: Good Practice Principles on Conditionality
Principle 1: Reinforce Ownership: The GoR has a strong track record in committing to and implementing
reforms. The third policy operation under the CLSG/C series continues support for the EDPRS, which was
developed in a participatory manner and continues to be Rwanda`s main tool for achieving economic and social
development. The process was led by a National Steering Committee, comprised of Ministers and Governors,
providing high level guidance. The Bank has actively supported the GoR in this process. The GoR has
completed a formal Aid Policy that articulates its vision for improved aid management and policies. In
September 2008, the GoR and all budget support donors signed a new Memorandum of Understanding (MoU)
governing the provision of direct budget support in the implementation of the EDPRS. These actions underscore
the strong commitment by GoR to implement prior policy actions and accomplish the triggers of this operation.
All of the prior policy actions have already been implemented.

Principle 2: Agree up front with the GoR and other financial partners on a coordinated accountability
framework: The GoR and budget support donors have agreed on a Common Assessment Framework for Public
Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA). The GoR and donors have also elaborated a Common
Performance Assessment Framework (CPAF) that is aligned with the EDPRS. The CPAF is also identified as
one of the three complementary monitoring and performance management frameworks under the Memorandum
of Understanding between budget support donors and the GoR. Sector-specific mechanisms, including a sector-
wide approach (SWAp), MoU and a sector strategy governing budget support have been agreed between the GoR
and partners in the health sector. The GoR also passed an Accountants Bill in December 2007 and adopted and
appointed the Rwanda Public Procurement Authority (RPPA) in March, 2008. Rwanda is widely recognized in
the region for its low levels of corruption.

Principle 3: Customize the accountability framework and modalities of Bank support to country
circumstances: The CLSG/C series is fully aligned with the EDPRS` overall objectives to accelerate progress
towards the MDGs, including poverty alleviation and improvements in basic social services. The CLSG/C is the
overall umbrella for Bank support and policy dialogue in the area of social protection and community HNP
policy areas, complemented by the second PRSG/C series and by specific investment projects.

Principle 4: Choose only actions critical for achieving results as conditions for disbursement: The CLSG/C
focuses on a few selected triggers and prior actions, which represent critical steps for implementing the GoR`s
program. These triggers and prior actions have evolved from extensive discussion with the GoR and other
relevant stakeholders and are aligned with EDPRS objectives, the CPAF, and sector-specific frameworks related
to social protection and community HNP.

Principle 5: Carry out transparent progress reviews conducive to predictable and performance-based
financial support: A full review of the program will take place in line with the review agreed in the MOU
governing the provision of budget support in the implementation of Rwanda`s EDPRS. Joint budget reviews and
joint sector reviews take place twice a year, aligned with the budget cycle.

the proposed operation, please refer to Section VI under implementation, monitoring and
evaluation.

POVERTY AND SOCIAL IMPACTS
99.    In line with GoR's overall objective under the EDPRS of alleviating poverty, the
VUP social protection program and the policy reforms supported under this operation
aim to reduce extreme poverty among Rwandan households and to expand access to
high-impact health, nutrition and population (HNP) interventions at the community
level.

100. The social protection policies supported are expected to contribute to: (a) a
reduction in the income-poverty gaps in pilot Sectors over a three-year period; and (b) greater
opportunities for beneficiaries to seek self-reliance and to graduate into income-generating
activities from public works and in some cases from direct support programs.

101. The Community PBF policies supported are intended to: (a) improve access to
selected reproductive, maternal and child health services especially among poor rural
households; and (ii) contribute to addressing persistent socio-economic disparities in
utilization of health services and in health outcomes. A criticism of some results-based
financing programs is that they have potential inegalitarian consequences.40 The operation
mitigates this risk because: (a) the magnitude of the demand-side incentives are of modest
value (US$3-US$6) and are likely to incentivize poorer women to change behavior; (b) the
initial implementation in the 30 VUP Sectors before expanding to the other sectors; (c) while
the CHW incentives is a form of supply-side incentives (thought to be of greatest risk for
inegalitarian effects), the CHWs target the poorest household in their outreach and they are
predominantly rural-based. Furthermore, the incidence of outcomes will be closely monitored
using disaggregated data, and the impact evaluation will further analyze effects among the
poorest households.

Results Achieved:

102. VUP's analysis of the survey data indicates strong poverty reduction results.
Extreme income poverty41 is 35.1 percent across all VUP Sectors, a fall of 3.9 percent from
39.0 percent in 2006. The fall in extreme income poverty has been much stronger in more
dynamic 1st cohort pilot Sectors, 35.7 percent to 25.6 percent. Such a reduction of 10.1 percent
is twice the reduction in the two other cohort Sectors. The reduction has been concentrated in
male-headed households (from 37.9 percent to 33.1 percent, -4.8 percent). Female-headed
households report a fall of only 1.8 percent (from 42.6 percent to 40.8 percent). The VUP`s
analysis also shows that the numbers of households in the bottom two Ubudehe categories
have decreased globally by 6.4 percent between 2007 and 2009 (from 34.7 percent to
28.3 percent). The decrease has been highest in the 1st cohort Sectors (from 32.7 percent to

    Gwatkin 2009. Ensuring that the Poor Share Fully in the Benefits of Results-Based Financing Programs in
Health Results-based Financing (RBF) for Health, Working Paper, http://www.rbfhealth.org/rbfhealth. The
criticism is centered on the notion that programs with strong incentives to serve large numbers of people with
little regard to the specific socio-economic characteristics of people who meet the eligibility requirements are
likely to benefit non-poor households. This criticism is particularly compelling in RBF programs that provide
incentives to providers, i.e., supply-side incentive programs.
41
   Income poverty is calculated using a basic expenditure approach measuring the value of food consumption and
other basic expenditures.

                                                      38
23.9 percent, a reduction of 8.8 percent). In the other Sectors the fall is 5.3 percent (from
35.7 percent to 30.4 percent). Net Ubudehe graduation (i.e. the percentage of households
moving to a higher category less households moving to a lower category) between 2007 and
July 2009 is 18.3 percent. Net Ubudehe graduation is 52 percent as strong for male headed
households (20.5 percent) compared to female headed households (13.5 percent).

103. However, different analysis to the data indicates that that direct support (DS) is
having a significant and pronounced impact in increasing food consumption of poor
households which may have positive outcomes on the nutritional status of beneficiary
households. However, public works (PW) is not producing the same significant impacts on
beneficiary households` food consumption. While it cannot be clearly explained why this is
happening, this outcome could be due the small number of days of work provided.

104. A recent qualitative assessment conducted by the UNICEF indicates that overall
perception of the VUP program is consistently positive among beneficiaries. Overall,
beneficiaries report a positive impact by the VUP program. VUP was found to help
households become eligible for other GoR programs, such as SACCO (Savings and Credit
Cooperative) and the health scheme. Fifty-five percent of households reported saving a
portion of their VUP benefit. The average level of savings at the point when the questionnaire
was applied was 11.272.7 RWF. Fifty-four percent of VUP beneficiaries report spending (or
intend on spending) on food commodities. But beneficiaries also report using funds to
purchase productive assets such as livestock (24.5 percent), health products (19.9 percent),
farm inputs (18.3 percent), and education (13.1 percent).

ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECTS
105. Under Operational Policy (OP) 8.60, on Development Policy Lending, the Bank is
required to determine whether specific country policies supported under the operation
are likely to cause significant effects on the country's environment, and, in the event of
such likely effects, to assess the country systems for reducing such adverse effects and
enhancing such positive effects. In the event of significant gaps in the analysis, or
shortcomings in the country systems, the Bank is required to identify how such gaps or
shortcomings would be addressed before or during program implementation, as appropriate.
Following these policy requirements, specific country policies supported by the CLSG/C in
the form of budget support are not likely to cause significant positive or negative effects on
Rwanda's environment, forests and other natural resources.

106. While GoR's social protection policies relating to the CLSC-3 operation are, in
themselves, not likely to cause significant effects on the country's environment, forests,
or natural resources, MINALOC has incorporated GoR's environmental and guidelines
in the operational manual for its public works program. In addition, Rwanda Environment
Management Authority (REMA) assigned an environmental expert to the MINALOC in 2010,
who works closely with the VUP team to ensure full compliance as the VUP evolves.
Environmental challenges are also being addressed through the environmental framework of
the GoR`s Strategic Plan for Agricultural Transformation for marshland development.

107. In the area of health policy, MOH adopted an Environmental Health Policy in
2008, which provides the overall context for a more specific "Policy on Injection Safety,
Prevention of Transmission of Nosocomial Infections and Healthcare Waste
                                             39
Management, approved in 2009. The policy aims to put in place mechanisms, systems, and
practices to prevent transmission of infection through injections and other medical procedures,
and ensure that medical waste is disposed in a safe manner that does not pose any risk to
health personnel, patients, or the community. The implementation details are spelled out in the
National Standards and Guidelines for Injection Safety, Prevention of Transmission of
Hospital Infections and Medical Waste Management, developed by MOH`s Epidemiology
and Public Hygiene Unit.42 Both policies are intended to address the risk of HIV transmission,
but also to comprehensively respond to other infectious blood-borne diseases such as hepatitis
and Ebola. Based on analysis of HIV transmission routes, there is no evidence in Rwanda that
infectious waste is a major source of HIV transmission.

108. In sum, the country systems have adequate capacity to mitigate the potentially
small negative effects, if any. The framework for environmental management has evolved in
the last decade, resulting in noticeable improvements in institutional capacity. Arrangements
have been made to ensure that appropriate safeguards are in place to address any minor effects
that might arise under the GoRs`s VUP and health sector programs. The operation therefore
complies fully with the requirements of OP 8.60.

IMPLEMENTATION, MONITORING AND EVALUATION
109. The Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) signed in September 2008 by GoR
and all budget support donors, which governs the provision of direct budget support for
implementation of the EDPRS, remains in effect. The MoU, which replaced the 2003
Partnership Framework, outlines monitoring and performance management responsibilities
and guidelines.

110. In line with the MoU, the CLSG/C series is aligned with the Common
Performance Assessment Framework (CPAF) in its three phases. This alignment was
achieved through close collaboration between the GoR and budget support donors. The
CLSC-3 operation continues following the updated CPAF43 and the Bank team is part of its
overall dialogue.

111. The Policy Matrix (Annex 2) for the proposed operation provides a results
framework that describes expected immediate and short-term outcomes as well as
indicators to measure progress during the annual operations, and identifies agencies
accountable for reporting. The matrix and indicators are consistent with the CPAF and
sector-specific frameworks.

Social Protection M&E framework

112. Monitoring of the VUP program and policy actions under CLSC-3 will continue
to draw on data and findings from a range of sources. The VUP monitoring system is now
well-developed. The VUP team recently developed a comprehensive set of monitoring

42
   In addition to specifying guidelines and standards, it also specifies the roles and responsibilities with regard to
medical waste management at the central and District levels (as well as for the private sector), and their
respective roles in waste management at the facility level and in waste production, storage, collection,
transportation, and disposal, with special emphasis on guidelines for infected waste.
43
   Following a multisectoral consultative process with development partners and led by the MINECOFIN, the
CPAF was updated in March, 2010.

                                                         40
templates to be used by Sector VUP staff. The templates are comprehensive, and provide
enough information on beneficiaries, funding, and public works projects. Training to sector
staff on these new templates took place and the templates are now in use.

113. The established baseline values and determined targets are presented in Table 6.
These indicators have been discussed with MINALOC and MINECOFIN and are consistent
with the CPAF.

 to be done in a sample of pilot

114.     The data for the third indicator was revised to reflect new and revised data:

     First, the VUP team has a revised the baseline value to 34 percent (for 2007 household
     Ubudehe category, collected during the 2009 targeting), which they are more confident in
     than the original 28.7 percent figure. The original figure was obtained from the Ubudehe
     database, which encountered many problems, which affected original calculation (there
     was a lot of missing data and anomalies etc.). Also, the revised 34 percent figure was
     collected for households still in the umudugudu47 in 2009, and thus for a 2007-09 change,
     it provides a panel of households, which is more accurate.

      Second, the VUP team has also revised the July 2009 Ubudehe figure to 23.8 percent
     (compared to the 22.7 percent figure we provided last year). Last year`s figure was
     calculated from manually completed cell summary sheets (using data extracted from the
     targeting files). The revised figure has been extracted from the cleaned excel Targeting
     2009 database.


44
   To ensure that the proportion of eligible households will not be reduced due to any intervening factor, such as
budget constraints, this key monitoring indicator has been fixed at a minimum of 35 percent throughout the
period of this operation.
45
   Baseline figure was calculated for 18 VUP pilot sectors for which Ubudehe data are well analyzed.

   Umudugudu (village) serves as the lowest level of decentralized administration under the local government
structure. See footnote 20 for further details.

                                                       41
     Third, the 2010 figure is 30 percent (for 17 of the 18 sectors), which is an increase from
     the 2009 figure of 23.8 percent. The VUP team is not sure why there has been an increase
     in Ubudehe 1&2 percentage in 2010 and is looking into it.

      Once the VUP team has the full 2010 targeting database and thus a larger sample and data
     from different cohorts of sectors, it will help to better understand if the 2010 Ubudehe 1
     and 2 percentage increase is general or whether there is any specific cohort relationship.
     Also, when the VUP team has the next round of household survey results it will look at
     the relationships between income, human and social poverty, and whether these have
     changed compared to the 2009 results. Such results will be included in the Implementation
     Completion Report of the PRSG/C series.

115. As mentioned in section V above, findings on impact of the VUP are positive but
data is not fully reliable. To provide more concrete evidence on the VUP`s impact, the GoR,
with support from the Bank, has incorporated relevant questions into the 2010-11 Household
Living Conditions Survey (EICV)48 questionnaire. Analysis of this data will provide more
solid evidence on: (a) how good Ubudehe system is in identifying the poor; (b) how
satisfied households are with the assessment made by the community in the village; (c) how
many households have graduated from programs or moved from one program to another or
removed from programs and why; and (d) how much households in the programs could save
and how much of their saving was used for acquiring small business/enterprise for future
earnings. This however will not be possible to do before the field work and data entry of the
2010-11 survey is finalized which will be in October, 2011.

Community Health, Nutrition and Population M&E framework

116. The main indicators and targets for the community HNP policy relate to
increased financing and coverage of high-impact interventions on maternal and child
health, and family planning. The indicators in the policy matrix are among those that have
been agreed between GoR and partners within the CPAF (see Table 7). The MOH annually
tracks the progress toward these (and other) CPAF and EDPRS indicators. The 2008
Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) provides baseline estimates and follow-up measures
are provided by routine reporting systems, including the reporting system being set up as part
of the performance-based payment mechanism. Another DHS was implemented in 2010 but
the data are not yet available. In the years between the two DHS surveys, the program tracks
intermediate outcome indicators, which will be used to ensure that MOH is on track to
achieve the outcome indicators that have been set for the operation. While not formally part of
the monitoring framework, these intermediate outcome indicators will assist with supervision
and mitigate the programmatic risk posed by the long interval (2-3 years) between formal
surveys (see Table 10, Annex 6).49 Because the implementation is to be scaled up in selected
Sectors, the indicators will be disaggregated by geographic area. The indicators from DHS
will also be disaggregated by income quintile to track progress among the poorest quintiles.



48
  Also known as Enquête Intégrale sur les Conditions de Vie des ménages (EICV).
49
  The choice of intermediate indicators was informed by the HNP Results Chain developed through an extensive
consultation process under the leadership of the Bank`s Africa Human Development (AFTHD) and Results
Learning (AFTRL) departments.

                                                    42
117. PBF has special data requirements, and an information system has been
developed in support of Community PBF that builds on the existing health information
system capacity in health center. The system has been reviewed to assess completeness and
quality of reporting, and the MOH is taking steps to address the barriers for reporting.
Verification is an important part of any PBF program. MOH has developed a 3-year plan for
supervision and verification, which includes a more formal role of the health center
community health focal point to conduct formal audits of CHW register/reports.

118. Key indicators for monitoring progress are shown in Table 7. The responsible
agency is MoH. The links between the indicators and the policy actions are quite direct.

    Institutional deliveries: Two sets of demand-side incentives are pertinent. The in-kind
    incentives for (i) uptake of early prenatal visit in the first trimester and for (ii) delivery at a
    health facility. A prenatal visit in the first trimester is highly correlated with the likelihood
    of completing 4 visits. The probability of delivering in a health facility is furthermore
    strongly correlated with the number of prenatal visits, reaching a peak among women
    attending at least 4 prenatal visits. On the CHW side, complementary incentives are
    provided to increase outreach by CHWs to pregnant women, to refer women to attend first
    prenatal visits in the first trimester, and to refer women to deliver at a health facility.

    Contraceptive prevalence: The CHWs are incentivized in two ways: to increase the
    number of women who take up contraception (new users) and to increase the number of
    regular users of modern contraceptives at the health centers.

    While there are no specific nutrition indicators, nutrition monitoring is being done through
    mid-upper arm circumference measurement. CHWs have been trained extensively though
    the IMCI training program that the MOH has implemented. Materials (tape measures) for
    the measurement are included in the kit that is provided to CHWs. While this is the
    indicator that was included in the incentive design (largely because it is easier to verify)
    the CHWs work program include community growth monitoring, breast-feeding and
    weaning IEC.

119. A rigorous impact evaluation is a key part of the evaluation framework to assess
the impact of the community HNP policy reforms. The randomized design entails data
collection through baseline and follow-up household surveys of target and control Sectors.
The follow-up surveys will collect data on service quality and utilization by socio-economic
status in order to assess the extent to which the community health reforms are helping the
poor. The factorial design of the impact evaluation is illustrated by Table 8. The baseline
survey and analysis has been completed and the end-line survey is expected to start 18 months
after the baseline.

FIDUCIARY ASPECTS
120. The public financial management system continues to improve in key areas and is
adequate to support the CLSC-3. The 2010 draft Public Expenditure and Financial
Accountability (PEFA) Assessment is currently being finalized. This assessment shows that
19 Public Financial Management (PFM) performance indicators have improved and achieved
an acceptable level of performance;50 5 PFM performance indicators are showing some
improvement;51 and 7 PFM performance indicators are not showing much improvement.52 A
PFM Basket Fund and a separate fund for the Office of the Auditor-general were created in
2010.


50
    These are: PI-1 Aggregate expenditure out-turn compared to original approved budget (A); PI-3Aggregate
revenue out-turn compared to original approved budget (A); PI-4 Stock and monitoring of expenditure payment
arrears (B); PI-5 Classification of the budget (A); PI-6 Comprehensiveness of information included in budget
documentation (A); PI-8 Transparency of inter-governmental fiscal relations (A); PI-10 Public access to key
fiscal information (A); PI-11 Orderliness and participation in the annual budget process (B+); PI-13
Transparency of taxpayer obligations and liabilities (A); PI-14 Effectiveness of measures for taxpayer
registration and tax assessment (A); PI-16 Predictability in the availability of funds for commitment of
expenditures (B+); PI-17 Recording and management of cash balances, debt and guarantees (B); PI-18
Effectiveness of payroll controls (B); PI-19 Competition, value for money and controls in procurement (A); PI-
20 Effectiveness of internal controls for non-salary expenditure (B+); PI-22 Timeliness and regularity of
accounts reconciliation (B+); PI-26 Scope, nature and follow-up of external audit (B); PI-28 Legislative scrutiny
of external audit reports (B); and, D-1 Predictability of Direct Budget Support (A).
51
   These are: PI-2 Composition of expenditure out-turn compared to original approved budget (D); PI-7 Extent
of unreported government operations (D+); PI-9 Oversight of aggregate fiscal risk from other public sector
entities (C+); PI-25 Quality and timeliness of annual financial statements (D+); and, D-2 Financial information
provided by donors for budgeting and reporting on project and program aid (D+).

    These are: PI-12 Multi-year perspective in fiscal planning, expenditure policy and budgeting (C+); PI-15
Effectiveness in collection of tax payments (D+); PI-21 Effectiveness of internal audit (C); PI-23 Availability of
information on resources received by service delivery units (D); PI-24 Quality and timeliness of in-year budget
reports (D+); PI-27 Legislative scrutiny of the annual budget law (C+); and, D-3 Proportion of aid that is

121. The Government is implementing a PFM Action Plan to ensure
comprehensiveness and consistency of reforms. This plan has been endorsed by key donors
engaged in supporting the Government`s reform agenda. Fiduciary assessments are also based
on results from recently completed PERs in the education, health, agriculture, and water
sectors, the 2004 HIPC Assessment and Country Procurement Assessment Report, as well as
the 2005 Country Financial Accountability Assessment. In addition, the most recent
safeguards assessment of the National Bank of Rwanda (NBR) was completed by the IMF in
the context of the PRGF arrangement approved on June 12, 2006. The updated assessment
was completed on January 26, 2007 and proposed recommendations to address continuing
vulnerabilities in the external audit and financial reporting areas. The implementation of these
measures is being monitored under the Fund program, but there was no separate follow-up
since 2007. Finally, the Bank is undertaking a policy driven technical assistance PER to
provide capacity building support to Government in expenditure analysis and monitoring.

122. In addition, a key focus of the complementary PRSG/C operation is providing
continuing support for implementation of the GoR's Public Financial Management
(PFM) Reform Strategy (2008-12), which was approved by Cabinet in December 2008.
The PFM system is adequate for the purposes of this operation. The PFM Reform Strategy has
a comprehensive government approach that deals with the overarching strategic issues in a
structured and sequenced manner. It is being implemented under four pillars and twelve
distinct complementary components. They include:

   Pillar 1: Economic Management and Budget: Economic management; budget formulation
   and preparation; domestic revenue generation; and intergovernmental fiscal relations;
   Pillar 2: Financial Management and reporting: Accounting and reporting; treasury and
   expenditure management; implementation of IFMIS/SmartGov; implementation of the
   integrated personnel and payroll information system;
   Pillar 3: Public Procurement: Public procurement under the Rwanda Public Procurement
   Authority;
   Pillar 4: Budget Execution Oversight: Internal Audit and External Audit.

123. Similar to the first two in the series, IDA reserves the right to request an audit of
the Deposit Account. If the proceeds of the credit are used for ineligible purposes as defined
in the Financing Agreement, the Recipient will be requested to refund to IDA an amount equal
to the amount of said payment, promptly upon notice from IDA. No audit was requested
during the first two phases and there was no deterioration of the Public Financial Management
System.

DISBURSEMENT AND AUDITING
124. The IDA credit will be disbursed as a single tranche of SDR 3.9 million (US$6
million equivalent) upon effectiveness. The proposed credit will follow the Bank`s
disbursement procedures for development policy operations. The credit will be disbursed
against satisfactory implementation of the development policy and not tied to any specific
purchases. Subsequent to Bank Board approval and credit effectiveness, the Bank will
disburse the proceeds of the credit into a foreign currency Deposit Account designated by
the Recipient at the central bank of Rwanda (National Bank of Rwanda) and forming part of
Rwanda`s foreign exchange reserves. The Recipient will ensure that upon deposit of the credit

                                              45
proceeds into said account, an equivalent amount is credited in the Recipient`s budget
management system, in a manner acceptable to IDA, with an indication of the exchange rate
applied, where applicable. IDA reserves the right to request an audit of such account. If the
proceeds of the credit are used for ineligible purposes as defined in the Financing Agreement,
the Recipient will be requested to refund to IDA an amount equal to the amount of said
payment, promptly upon notice from IDA. Amounts refunded to the Bank upon such request
shall be cancelled. The administration of this credit will be the responsibility of MINECOFIN
(Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning).

125. Within two business days, the National Bank of Rwanda (NBR) will credit the
Rwanda Franc equivalent of the credit proceeds to the consolidated account maintained
on behalf of GoR which finances budgeted expenditures. The Director of Treasury will be
notified accordingly. The NBR will not impose any charges or commissions on GoR for these
transactions. The conversion from US$ to RWF will be based on the prevailing exchange rate
on the date that the funds are credited to the consolidated account. GoR, through the
MINECOFIN, will: (i) provide written confirmation within 30 days to the Bank that an
amount equivalent to the credit proceeds from the Bank has been credited to the consolidated
account, with an indication of the exchange rate applied; (ii) provide evidence that the
Rwanda Franc equivalent of the credit proceeds was recorded as financing for GoR budget;
and (iii) ensure that the Rwanda Franc equivalent of the credit proceeds are subject to controls
to ensure its use for eligible budgeted public expenditures only.

RISKS AND RISK MITIGATION
126. There are four main potential risks associated with the program:
(a) macroeconomic and financial sector risk; (b) regional/country risk; (c) program risk; and
(d) fiduciary risk.

127. Macroeconomic and Financial Risk. This is rated moderate to low risk given the
GoR`s record in macroeconomic management. Overall, GoR`s record has been rated as
satisfactory as evidenced also through the satisfactory completion of the first reviews under
the IMF PSI in December 2010. Risks to the program could arise through repeating decrease
in world commodity prices for Rwanda`s key export goods, tea and coffee, compromising
export earnings, coupled with a reduction in grants as an effect of the on-going global
recession. The GoR responded with the development of an export strategy, which was
finalized in 2011, aiming at diversifying exports and better using its comparative advantage in
specific sectors. Rwanda was not directly affected by the toxic assets that led to the global
financial crisis, but the impact of the crisis is now being transmitted to the economy through
lower exports, foreign direct investment (FDI) and tourism receipts. However, in 2010 credit
to the private sector picked up and financial sector soundness indicators have been improving.

128. To mitigate the potential balance of payments risk, the GoR is reducing
expenditures and revising the current 2010-11 budget. The GoR will continue to protect
priority spending from any potential reductions in overall spending. It will also continue with
measures to expand the tax base and improve the efficiency of the tax system. Mitigation of
this risk is achievable as long as the GoR continues to implement reforms to increase
investment to support growth. The subsiding of the global recession will reduce the
macroeconomic risk to the program. However, the uncertain path of global recovery will

                                              46
continue to pose a risk to macroeconomic and financial stability. Also, there remains the need
for the GoR to take on some non-concessional loans, on a selective basis, to enable the
necessary investments to generate growth. The Bank and the IMF will continue to support the
GoR in managing macroeconomic reform and investing in infrastructure development to
ensure continued growth and productivity. In the context of the low income country debt
sustainability framework, the Bank and IMF will continue to monitor the evolution in
Rwanda`s debt indicators which are currently substantially below set thresholds.

129. Country and Regional Risk. Rwanda`s internal security and political situation has
stabilized. In August 2010 the country peacefully re-elected the incumbent President Paul
Kagame for his second and, by the Constitution, last seven-year term. Since then, the political
situation remains stable and the economy is slowly getting back on track after the impact of
the global economic slowdown, with considerable assistance from development partners. In
order to mitigate the risk of repeating internal ethnic unrest due in part to unequal access and
distribution of resource, the Authorities focus large parts of public expenditures on poverty
reduction priorities including this program. Additionally, the participatory planning and
poverty assessment in use ­ i.e. the Ubudehe program for the poor ­ assesses how the poor are
identified and offers recommendations for reducing poverty. However, Rwanda remains
vulnerable to a reduction in aid flows due to changes in international perceptions about
political governance and human rights. Commentaries in the international media around the
August elections alleged suppression of various political opposition groups and individuals.
For several bilateral donors, issues of democratic governance, political and media freedom
and equal access to justice are key determinants of the decision to continue provide funding,
in particular general budget support, which amounted to about 41 percent of total expenditures
in 2009-10.

130. While these issues continue to be raised by bilateral donors, there have so far
been no signs for reductions in donor assistance, which could potentially jeopardize
achievement of development outcomes including the ones supported by the CAS. A
dramatic drop of aid flows is not foreseen in the near future. The Bank`s support for
strengthened governance will continue within the parameters laid out in the 2007 Governance
and Anticorruption Strategy, which include the support of the Joint Government Assessment
(JGA) and strengthening the capacity of civil society and private sector actors. Capacity
remains one of the key country risks that affect all sectors, public and private. Beside the
GoR`s commitment to invest in skills development needed for economic modernization,
including stronger focus on PBF, it is currently developing a new National Human Capital and
Skills Development strategy to address major gaps.

131. The main SP program risk is the weak implementation capacity of the VUP at the
Sector level. Given the complexity of both the management of public works and direct
support programs and the fact that they need to be coordinated closely with the financial
services component, technical assistance is necessary to implement at the Sector level. This
technical assistance has been secured over the last two years in the form of two local
consultants for each VUP sector. This support was financed by the DCDP but is now coming
to an end. Through the Rapid Social Response (RSR) multi-donor Trust Fund, the Bank
secured a two years grant that will support this technical assistance till mid-2012. The GoR is
already exploring ways to mainstream these structures into the local governments at the Sector
level or support the creation of capacity at the District level that can support multiple sectors.

                                               47
132. As for the HNP, the two main risks are weak implementation capacity and
potential complexity of CHW incentive strategy. Regarding the implementation capacity,
the Community PBF is a new program that is being implemented by one of the least resourced
units in the Ministry of Health, the Community Health Desk. While the capacity has improved
since 2008 when the planning for the Community PBF started, gaps in the number of staff and
the skill mix still remain. During the design and development phases of Community PBF this
risk was mitigated through externally funded technical assistance from the Bank and other
donors. While this may have been acceptable during the development phase, specific technical
staff will be necessary over the next few years to ensure the institutionalization of the
Community PBF as implementation progresses. Another capacity-related risk is the fact that
the implementation of the CHW incentive strategy is strongly reliant on the functioning of the
CHW Cooperatives. In many instances these are newly formed organizational entities that are
likely to lack capacity especially early in implementation. A mitigating factor is that while the
institutions are new, the CHWs that make up these Cooperatives are quite experienced (as
they functioned within Village Health Worker Associations that existed before the
Cooperatives were formed).

133. As Figures in Annex 6 show, the design and implementation arrangements (such
as financial flows, information flows for verification and counter-verification etc.) are
potentially complex. An empirical question that will be addressed during the impact
evaluation is the impact of this particular incentive design. This will allow the MOH to
compare the institutional costs of implementation with the returns in terms of service delivery
gains.

134. Fiduciary Risks. The rapid decentralization undertaken by the GoR has heightened
potential procurement and public financial management risks (related to low capacity) since
only limited accompanying fiduciary measures were included in the reform. However, the
GoR has committed to accelerating its efforts to address these risks. The GoR is drafting an
easy-reference guide for procurement, along with a technical assistance hotline for
procurement officers. This is part of the e-procurement activity being sponsored by the series
of PRSG/Cs.

135. The GoR is also accelerating the implementation of the Rwanda Expertise
Scheme that is training accountants and internal auditors in the Rwanda public
accounting system, and sponsoring the best among them for professional accountancy
qualification. Following an unsuccessful attempt of training public accountants and internal
auditors in 2006, which resulted in extremely low pass rates, GoR scaled down the number of
trainees and retained only a pilot of 20 students who have now gone half-way through the
training program, with reasonable pass rates. More trainees were identified in 2010 with the
aim of ensuring a critical mass of qualified accountants in the public sector by 2012. In June
2010, more than ninety trainees were sponsored and the pass-rate was better than the global
average. Furthermore, the PRSG/C series is supporting the adoption and implementation of a
comprehensive 5-year capacity building strategy for local government, which includes
measures to strengthen public financial management at the local level. So while the fiduciary
risk maybe high originally, with the above mitigating measures, it is considered moderate.

ANNEX 5: OVERVIEW OF UBUDEHE

1. An important, relatively early aspect of SP development within Rwanda was the re-
establishment of Ubudehe, a traditional Rwandan process of village-level community
decision-making based on discussion, gathering of systematic information, and decision-
making through community meetings in which all villagers participate.

2. Ubudehe is a traditional practice and culture of collective action to solve community
problems. It has been adopted by the GoR as an approach to fight poverty. It is present at
9,000 cells all over the country. The 2006 Ubudehe survey results suggest it should be a core
method of GoR`s approach to fighting poverty because it is embedded in Rwandan mind sets,
is seen as an approach that benefits the poor, primarily through increasing access to livestock,
promotes social capital and unification, increases participation in planning and decision
making, and empowers the poor and women. 53

3. Under Ubudehe, two village committees are elected: one to oversee implementation of
communal decisions, and the other to function as a sentinel or oversight committee that
activates itself only if concerns arise about the functioning of the first committee. These
community-driven processes have been used in all villages for multiple purposes, including
identifying and overseeing projects to address community problems, identifying village
priorities as part of local government planning processes, and identifying the poorest
households in the village that would receive community-managed income support. The last of
these functions entails a systematic process through which each village has created its own
geographic and social map of the villages which shows physical features and structures, each
household`s home, and codes for relevant socioeconomic characteristics of each family. This
poverty-mapping process, which has a systematic methodology, allocates each household to
one of six ordinal income and poverty-related categories differentiated by well-defined
qualitative criteria. The maps have become the basis for community decision-making about
income support in cash or in kind to ultra-poor households from local and donor sources, and
about which households should receive subsidies for health insurance. More recently, similar
processes have been used to identify community priorities for consideration within District
government plans for public works programs. Similar approaches ware used in the VUP
program, to select households to receive assistance and, separately, to select community assets
to be created through the VUP public works component.

4. Development partners played a significant role in the redevelopment of Ubudehe by
providing technical support for development of related skills within local communities (e.g.,
DFID) and by offering operational funding (e.g., European Union) for each village community
to select, design, and oversee the contractual implementation of a substantial locally selected
investment project to address what each village perceived to be its most challenging solvable
problem. Resulting projects included modern market premises, road-building, new primary
health care or education facilities or their foundations, and even a small, hydroelectric system
powered by a local stream.

ANNEX 6: COMMUNITY PERFORMANCE-BASED FINANCING OF HEALTH

1.      The impetus for performance-based financing (PBF) in Rwanda came from the
experience of NGOs who paid health workers salary bonuses, yet the outputs of the health
services were stagnating and even deteriorating. The NGOs` efforts at improving service
delivery yielded various models, and from these the National PBF was developed.54 PBF
became a major pillar within the Ministry`s first Health Sector Strategic Plan and it was
implemented in order to provide incentives to health workers to improve efficiency and
outcomes, and provide additional income to health workers. Nationwide roll-out of the
National PBF took place in April 2008. The National PBF is divided into two main models:
(i) the PBF model for health centers and hospitals, called the Facility-based PBF (or the
Facility PBF), and (ii) the PBF model for community health, called the Community-based
PBF (or the Community PBF).

Facility PBF

2.      In the Facility PBF, payments for performance are based on the quantity of outputs
(through case-based remuneration) conditional on the quality of services delivered. The
quantity of outputs are measured monthly while the quality is measured quarterly through the
use of an elaborate supervisory checklist. Health facility staff can increase their performance,
and hence their earnings, by increasing the quantity of outputs, increasing the quality of
services delivered, or both. The health center PBF model is based on contracts between
different levels: (i) contract between the CAAC and the Steering Committee (Comité de
Pilotage); (ii) contract between the Steering Committee and health facilities; and (iii) contract
between health facilities and individual health workers. In-depth verification activities are
done by one focal point per administrative District for quantitative evaluation and by hospital
for qualitative evaluation.55

Community PBF

3.      The Community PBF was embedded in the National Community Health Policy, and
through this policy the Ministry of Health provides the policy direction, while implementation
is by the Ministry of Local Administration. Initial implementation was in January 2006 in 23
experimental Districts following a broad consultative process and based on 6 community-level
PBF indicators: (i) mutuelle enrollment; (ii) deliveries at health center; (iii) use of insecticide
treated nets; (iv) management of dehydration due to diarrhea among under-fives; (v) personal
hygiene; and (vi) reporting. The model was based on experience gained during the
implementation of the health center and hospital PBF models, and benefits from a close fit
with these models. However, although the Ministry of Local Administration transferred a
budget related to community PBF, there have been delays in implementation. This is due to
54
  Examples of the NGO models are: Ville de Kigali model; the Cyangugu model and the Butare model.
55
   The hospital PBF model for use in district hospitals consists of 52 indicators, 27 of which are singular output
measures or binary variables and 25 are composite indicators with 99 composite variables in all. Fifteen
indicators assess administration and represent 20 percent of the total performance score; 19 indicators assess
quality assurance and represent 30 percent of the total performance score, and 18 indicators assess clinical
activities and represent 50 percent of the total performance score.


                                                       66
the fact that, unlike the health center and hospital models, the community PBF model did not
succeed in linking payment to changes in outcomes (as opposed to submission of reports) and
suffered from a weak incentives to report reliable and timely data from the community-level.
Following these initial experiences the Community PBF has been redesigned to address the
design weaknesses while learning from the initial experiences.

Box 5: Development of the National PBF Model
 The national PBF model for health centers was designed during the first quarter of 2006 through an extensive consultative
 process involving various key stakeholders. The model is predominantly based on the Butare model--it has steering
 committees with representation of health authorities, health facilities, donors and civil society and contracts between each
 of these entities. It also has key quality elements of the Cyangugu model, such monthly control at the health center level
 and incorporation of the quality supervisory tool as a performance measure. A complicating factor during the introductory
 phase of the National PBF was the parallel implementation of the decentralization reforms at the time. These reforms
 included far-reaching administrative reforms, decentralized decision-making power and budgetary control, making the
 Mayor the decentralized authority on sector budgets. In the health sector there were also significant reforms--for example,
 the former District Health Teams (headed by the District Director of Health who was also the hospital Director) were
 disbanded, and merged with the hospital teams. A new district health department called Unité Santé et Famille et
 Protection des Droits de l'Enfant (USF) was created, with a new staffing, new District Director of Health and under direct
 authority of the Mayors office (Ministry of Local Administration). Figure presents the purchaser-provider split as
 defined in the national model between the quality controllers, the purchasers and the service providers.

 Figure 1. National PBF model




 During the second and third quarters of 2006, the national model was rolled-out through the 23 PBF districts. The
 implementation of the national model is guided through a rigorous intervention study, and a the roll-out plan. There were
 three phases of the PBF roll-out plan. Phase 0 districts corresponds to the three PBF pilot projects (2002-2005): (i)
 Nyamasheke and Rusizi, the Cyangugu Pilot; (ii) Huye and Gisagara, the Butare Pilot; and (iii) the BTC Ville de
 Kigali Pilot. Phase 1 districts are districts in which PBF was started since January 2006. Finally, Phase 2 districts are the
 seven control districts in which PBF was implemented in April 2008.



4.       Figure 5 presents the purchaser-provider split that is proposed for the Community
PBF: Purchasers: the Health Center Management on behalf of all Donors; Provider: the CHW
Cooperative; Controllers: the Sector PBF Steering Committee comprising the Sector
administrative officials responsible for health, the health center management, and other public
institutions or members like teachers, representatives of civil society organizations (local
NGOs, faith-based organizations, etc.).

5.     The Community Health Desk of the MoH provides overall policy guidance and support to
the national Community PBF. The implementation of the Community PBF reflects a
decentralized control and decision making model (see Figure 5 and 6).
    The Local Sector Administration signs a contract with the Community Health Worker
       Cooperative detailing the Community PBF performance indicators and the content of the
       reports that need to be submitted before a certain date.
    The Community Health Worker Cooperative reports to the Sector PBF Steering
       Committee as per the contract.
    The District health department and District hospital provide support to the PBF Sector
       Steering Committee: (i) general support and capacity building in the institutional
       mechanisms governing the Community PBF system; and (ii) support organizing data input
       using the Web application.
    The PBF Sector Steering Committee decides on the level of achievement: (i) discusses the
       quarterly sector community performance report and validates it; (ii) discusses any
       observations brought to the table by the Health Center; and (iii) approves the payment
       after determining successful performance based on the key performance indicators.
    CHW Cooperative receives payment from the health center after performance has been
       certified by the PBF Sector Steering Committee. The funds received by the CHW
       Cooperatives are pooled with other resources from income generating activities.

6.      The Community PBF is a central element of the 2008 Community Health Policy and
Strategy in which the MoH commits to addressing preventable health problems through
empowering communities to participate in activities aimed at improving their own health
status. CHW are elected by the community and have been trained in high impact, curative and
preventive care services at the community level. The Community-PBF is a dynamic program.
It is evolving from paying for the submission of the report, to also rewarding progress in
selected output indicators. The inclusion of demand-side incentives to promote maternal
health outcomes is a further step along the evolution of the model. Under this revision, the
PBF pays women for institutional deliveries.

   1. Pay for reporting: CHW cooperatives receive a quarterly payment based on the
      timely submission of quality data reports related to selected indicators.
   2. Pay for indicators: CHW cooperatives receive a quarterly payment based on changes
      in the 5 target indicators:
          a. Nutrition Monitoring: Increase the number of children (6-59 months)
              monitored and referred for the nutrition status,
          b. Antenatal care: Increase the number of women accompanied/referred to the
              health center for first trimester antenatal care visit,
          c. Deliveries: Increase number of women delivering at the facilities,
          d. Family Planning: Increase number of women new users of family planning
              methods (any method),
          e. Family Planning: Increase the number women (21-45 years) from regular to
              the long-term FP users (IUD, implants, injection, Norplant, Surgical/NSV
              contraception).

                                               70
The pay-for-reporting component will be implemented nationally. The pay-for-indicators
component will be implemented in all but 100 sectors.

Demand-side model
8.    The objectives of the demand-side incentive model include:
   1. Antenatal Care: Increase the number of pregnant women consulting the health center
      for prenatal care visit.
   2. Institutional Delivery: Increase number of women delivering in the health facilities.
   3. Postnatal Care: Increase the number of mother-child pairs receiving postnatal care at
      HC within 7 days of birth/discharge.
   4. Family Planning: Increase the number of women 21-49 years who initiate long-term
      modern contraceptives (IUD, Norplant, Surgical/NSV contraception)

9.      The demand-side model will be implemented in 130 sectors in 2010. First, the MOH
will target the 30 first phase VUP sectors to implement the first phase of the demand-side
model. These 30 sectors were identified by MINELOC as the poorest sector in each of the 30
Districts. Second, given budget and logistical constraints, the MOH cannot scale up
implementation of the demand-side model nationally immediately. In order to identify the
first phase for implementation, an additional 100 sectors were randomly selected. This is a
fair and transparent method for identifying the sectors that will receive the program first, and
allows for a rigorous, prospective impact evaluation.
