                         Program Development Objective (from Program Document)

                         The PDO is to support the government of Rwanda's (GoR's) social protection and health reforms designed to reduce extreme poverty, initially in 30 pilot sectors,
                         and to expand access to high-impact health, nutrition and population interventions at the community level.

                         The operation supports GoR's poverty reduction objectives, consistent with the country's fiscal framework and the second strategic theme of the Rwanda CAS
                         (2008-12), which is to reduce social vulnerability and ensure that the most vulnerable Rwandans also benefit from growth and to help Rwanda make further
                         progress in building a more stable society.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The operation supports the GoR poverty reduction agenda through the Vision 2020 Umurenge Program (VUP) and the Community Health programs which are managed under the
                         Ministries of Local Government and Health respectively. The VUP was launched in March 2007, its implementation started in January 2008 and government has successfully
                         implemented a gradual scale-up plan annually. Anecdotal evidence indicates that the program interventions have had positive impact on poverty reduction in the areas of intervention
                         as detailed in the PAD for the operation (Board version) and more evidence based data is expected from analysis of the third house hold and living conditions survey data (EICV-3)
                         expected in mid 2012.

                         The support program was delivered to the Bank Board on March 22, 2011 on schedule and signing was conducted on April 26, 2011. Delivery to the Board followed a successful
                         achievement of the policy reform agenda that had been agreed during negotiations. Since the signing, the government has progressed well on achieving ratification of the credit and
                         recent updates indicated that relevant legal documentation has been approved by the cabinet, the lower and upper chambers of parliament and awaits signing into law and a legal
                         opinion from the Government Attorney. Completion of this remaining step will lead to completion of evidential documentation package for effectiveness of the credit agreement (CA).

                         The revised effectiveness deadline is October 24, 2011 and evidential documentation is expected to be furnished earlier than the deadline based on progress to date.

                         Upon receipt of the effectiveness package and assessment of its adequacy, communication to the client of this satisfactory assessment will prompt a withdrawal application. The
                         credit proceeds will be disbursed in a single tranche.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The program was delivered to the Bank Board on March 22, 2011 on schedule. Signing was conducted on April 26, 2011. There has been delays in achievement of effectiveness by
                         original deadline. A request from the government for an extension of effectiveness deadline provided assurance of commitment to program implementation and the underlying reform
                         agenda. The government expects to achieve effectiveness not later than October 24, 2011.

                         Restructuring History
                         There has been no restructuring to date.
