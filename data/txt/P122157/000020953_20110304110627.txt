Country and Sector Background 
 
As a country of modest geographical size with an estimated population of 9.6 million, Rwanda is 
one of the Africa’s most densely populated countries.  It remains among the poorest, despite 
strong growth performance in the past decade.  The poverty rate decreased slightly from 60 to 57 
percent between 2000-01 and 2005-06.  However, because of relatively rapid population growth 
and an increase in income inequality, the number of people living in poverty increased from 4.8 
to 5.4 million over the same period.  Of those who were poor, over 90 percent lived in rural 
areas.  Despite strong economic growth, progress towards the Millennium Development Goals 
(MDGs) is uneven. Rwanda is on track to achieve the MDGs in several areas
1
but lags in 
maternal mortality and child mortality, as well as high fertility rates. 
 
1
MDG progress is on track in the following areas: access to primary education, gender parity, malaria incidence, 
HIV prevalence.

2. Operation 
Objectives 
 
Rwanda’s 
Economic Development and Poverty Reduction Strategy
 (EDPRS) for 2008-12 builds 
on strong achievements in human capital development and promotes three flagship programs”
2
:
(i) encouraging growth that creates jobs and increases exports; (ii) strengthening governance; and 
(iii) introducing the Vision 2020 
Umurenge
3
Program (VUP).  The VUP is expected to accelerate 
poverty reduction by promoting pro-poor components of the national growth agenda…by 
releasing the productive capacity of the poor in rural areas through a combination of public 
works, credit and direct support.
4
Furthermore, the EDPRS supports Rwanda’s commitment to achieving the health, nutrition and 
population-related MDGs.  To this end, the Ministry of Health has implemented the first and 
second Health Sector Strategic Plans
5
and has made substantial progress with policies aimed at 
improving facility-based services.  These include a strategy to deliver high-impact interventions 
to households by a network of community health workers.  This strategy is designed to promote 
access to services by the rural poor.     
Within this policy context, the program development objective for the Rwanda Community 
Living Standards Grant (CLSG) series is to support social protection and health policy reforms 
of the Government of Rwanda’s (GoR) that are designed to reduce extreme poverty, initially in 
30 pilot sectors, and to expand access to high-impact health, nutrition and population 
interventions at the community level. 
3. 
Rationale for Bank Involvement 
 
The CLSG grant aims to help Rwanda integrate international good practice within its poverty-
reducing policies under the EDPRS flagship VUP.  The operation’s focus is also consistent with 
the fiscal framework of the GoR and with the World Bank’s Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) 
for 2009–12.  Reducing social vulnerability is the CAS’s second strategic theme.  Its objective 
“is to ensure that the most vulnerable Rwandans also benefit from growth and to help Rwanda 
make further progress in building a more stable society.”  The operation therefore seeks to 
support the GoR’s objectives for poverty reduction and the hard-to-reach MDGs, as outlined in 
the EDPRS and the strategic objectives of the World Bank’s CAS.  The operation does so by 
supporting (i) the GoR’s VUP objectives and policies, within an improved policy framework 
consistent with international good practice, and (ii) GoR’s strategy to deliver high-impact 
preventive and community-based interventions through a program targeting women and 
community health workers via demand- and supply-side incentives.  Policy reforms in GoR’s

The Government of Rwanda has progressively devolved responsibilities and transferred resources to decentralized 
levels of the administration 
–
Province, District, Sector (
Umurenge
), Cell (
Akagari
)
and Village (
Umudugudu
).  Of 
these, the last three are subordinate tiers of the district governments.  The VUP is implemented through this newly 
restructured decentralized local government system.

The HSSP-II covers 7 strategic areas:  (i) institutional capacity; (ii) human resources; (iii) financial access to health 
services; (iv) geographical access to health services; (v) drugs, vaccines and consumables; (vi) quality assurance; 
(vii) specialized services, national referral hospitals and research centers.

community health, nutrition and population policies, which target health vulnerability, 
complement the VUP in addressing income vulnerability among poor households.

Institutional and Implementation Arrangements 
 
The CLSG operation is implemented by the Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning 
(MINECOFIN), the Ministry of Local Government (MINALOC), and the Ministry of Health 
(MINISANTE).  MINECOFIN has overall responsibility for coordinating the completion of 
policy actions and thus final responsibility for progress in implementing the proposed CLSG 
operation and coordinating the completion of actions.  MINECOFIN’s Development Planning 
Unit is responsible for overall monitoring and evaluation (M&E) of the Government’s poverty 
reduction programs.  Its Budget Monitoring and Reporting Team ensures that component sector 
spending plans developed with general budget support are incorporated into the national MTEF 
and subsequent budget.   
 
MINALOC is responsible for implementing the GoR’s flagship VUP, including its public works 
and direct support elements.  A VUP management team within MINALOC’s national ministry 
oversees activities and manages the program.  District governments are responsible for 
implementation at local government level and for important roles within program financial and 
informational flows. The Sector-tier (
Umurenge
)
of
local government has responsibility for the 
implementation and coordination of VUP as one of its major activities; and liaises and 
cooperates with the cell tier of local government in planning and implementing public works 
activities and in managing and oversight of direct support.  The village (
Umudugudu
)
tier of 
local government plays important roles in beneficiary selection and the formulation of 
preferences for public works projects to be undertaken through VUP.  Financial management and 
reporting responsibilities are distributed across these tiers or levels of government.   
 
MINISANTE oversees the implementation of the community health, nutrition and population 
initiatives.  The community health strategy will be implemented in conjunction with the VUP 
through the decentralized administration, notably the District and Sector administrations, as 
well as health centers at the Sector level.  MINISANTE will provide technical guidance and will 
oversee and lead coordination on community health programs with sector partners.  A program 
to provide demand and supply-side incentives to women and community health workers, 
respectively, will use the already-established capacity of information systems in health centers 
to meet the data requirements of the community-based PBF strategy.  A steering committee, 
including representation from the 
Umurenge
 administration, will authorize payments under the 
Community Performance-Based Financing (PBF) mechanism as well as being responsible for 
verification of reporting.

Benefits and Risks 
 
Benefits:
The principal benefits of the operation will include results that flow from improving the 
GoR’s poverty reduction strategy through a policy framework that ensures that international 
good practice policies are applied to the provision of public works employment, cash transfer, 
and health and nutritional support to the poorest households.  Setting public works wages no 
higher than the private wage for unskilled labor should promote a more efficient labor market 
with reduced disincentives to private employment.  Improved targeting of direct supports should 
make the social safety net more effective.  Public disclosure of VUP program rules and of 
information on direct support beneficiaries and, their benefit levels and processes for direct 
payment to all VUP beneficiaries should foster transparency under VUP.   
Community health, population and nutrition policy development and implementation are 
expected to contribute to addressing challenges relating to access to basic services by poor 
households, access to maternal health services, coverage of high-impact interventions, and health 
human-resource gaps in rural areas.  All of these are critical for making progress on the hard-to-
reach MDGs.  The operation will support reforms that complement the VUP through a strategy 
for delivering high-impact interventions to households by a network of Community Health 
Workers (CHWs).  A new
 
framework ensures that sector administrations will sign performance-
based contracts with CHW cooperatives providing for incentive payments made on the basis of 
reported health service indicators, with technical support and supervision provided by health 
centers.  The GoR is developing a training program to increase the skills of CHWs and others 
who are more likely to stay in rural areas, increasing the supply of health human resources there.  
To reduce maternal mortality, which reflects a broad range of factors, GoR is developing an 
innovative strategy incorporating key incentives for pregnant women, for CHWs, and for 
facilities.
 
Moreover, findings from a planned impact evaluation will provide important 
information for the community-based health and nutritional support strategy and its 
performance-based financing design.   
Risks
:
General international financial risks and specific regional risks for Rwanda as a whole 
could potentially affect this operation.  Predictability of donor financing in the longer term is 
uncertain, although donor attitudes are encouraging, reflecting GoR’s good performance to date 
in using aid effectively.  Risks specific to the operation include the challenges faced in seeking to 
embody and operationalize international good-practice policies in public works, social protection 
programs, and community health, population and nutrition.  The main challenge is the limited 
district and sector level capacity to manage the VUP components and the performance-based 
mechanisms that incentivize women and community health workers, respectively, on the 
demand- and supply-sides of health services delivery.  The proposed operation is also coupled 
with mechanism to support the capacity building for VUP sector level staff. Risks associated 
with weaknesses in the country’s fiduciary framework, particularly at decentralized levels, are a 
concern but are being addressed with support from development partners and the Bank. 
7. 
Poverty and Social Impacts and Environment Aspects 
 
The GoR’s social protection policies are intended to contribute to a number of policy objectives, 
including reducing the poverty-income gaps for extremely poor households.  The operation 
therefore seeks to help the government implement international good-practice reforms that 
Page  5
improve the effectiveness of its social protection programs.  These are intended to help reduce 
extreme poverty among Rwandan households by reducing the poverty-consumption gaps for 
extremely poor households receiving assistance (including those that would otherwise have been 
unable to help themselves), by promoting support systems that are more sensitive to gender, and 
by creating greater capabilities for beneficiaries to seek self-reliance and to graduate from the 
social protection programs and into income-generating activities.  In addition, community health 
and nutrition policies are intended to contribute to addressing persistent socio-economic 
disparities in access to health services and in health outcomes. 
The strong complementarity between social protection and health, nutrition, and population 
policy initiatives supported by this lending operation provides unique opportunities to help 
accelerate improved living standards and well-being amongst poor households at community 
level.   Direct Supports and Public Works under the social protection policy area are addressing 
income-related risks, thus enabling a reduction in the risks associated with the income 
vulnerability of poor households.  Any such reduction in income vulnerability among poor 
households is then further enhanced by the supplementary policy support in the domain of health 
to ensure a compounding effect in reducing households’ overall income and health vulnerability. 
Under Operational Policy 8.60, on Development Policy Lending, the Bank is required to 
determine whether specific country policies supported under the operation are likely to cause 
significant effects on the country’s environment and, in the event of such likely effects, to assess 
country systems for reducing any such adverse effects and enhancing such positive effects.  In 
the event of significant gaps in the analysis, or shortcomings in the country systems, the Bank is 
required to identify how such gaps or shortcomings would be addressed before or during 
program implementation, as appropriate.  Following these policy requirements, specific country 
policies supported by the CLSG in the form of budget support are not likely to cause significant 
positive or negative effects on Rwanda's environment, forests and other natural resources.   
 
The country systems have adequate capacity to mitigate potentially small negative effects if any.  
The framework for environmental management has evolved in the last decade, resulting in 
noticeable improvements in institutional capacity.  Arrangements have been made to ensure that 
appropriate safeguards are in place to address any minor effects that might arise under the 
GoRs’s VUP and health sector programs.  In 2008 the Ministry of Health adopted an 
Environmental Health Policy, which provides the overall context for the more specific Policy on 
Injection Safety, Prevention of Transmission of Nosocomial Infections, and Health Care Waste 
Management, approved in 2009.  Furthermore, with Bank support, the Ministry of Local 
Government has incorporated into its VUP Public Works program specific environmental 
guidelines to minimize the likelihood of adverse environmental impact through its Public Works 
program and to ensure that any such minor effects are addressed if they should arise. Rwanda’s 
Environmental Management Agency (REMA) has assigned an environmental expert to the VUP 
team in 2010, who will work closely with the VUP team to ensure full compliance as the VUP 
evolves.  Environmental challenges are also addressed through the environmental framework of 
the GoR’s Strategic Plan for Agricultural Transformation for marshland development.  In sum, 
the country systems have adequate capacity to mitigate the potentially small negative effects, if 
any. The operation therefore complies fully with the requirements of OP 8.60.
