1/ Ozone-Depleting-Potemial (ODP) is a concept which has been developed Lo aggregate the impacts of all ozone depleling substances (ODS) on the ozone layer. Since not all ODS are equally damaging to the
ozone layer, their effects on the ozone layer must be weighted by the appropriate damage factor. For example, CFCs are ten times as damaging as 1. 1 . I-Trchloroethane (TCE). so TCE only receives a weight
of 0. 10.
2/ Incrcmental costs are defmed as those costs of ODS phaseout which would not have been incurred in the absence of the Montreal Prorocol. Estimates of incremental capital and operating costs are based on
the methodology developed by the Montreal Protocol and Global Enviroecnent Faciliy.

TECHNICAL SUPPORT AND INVESTMENT PROJECT
FOR THE PHASEOUT OF OZONE DEPLETING SUBSTANCES
INTRODUCTION
1.    The Vienna Convention for the Protection of the Ozone Layer (1985) and the Montreal Protocol
on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer (1987) (MP) are international environmental agreements
which call for the phaseout of substances that deplete the stratospheric ozone layer. More than 100
countries representing over 95 percent of world consumption of these substances have ratified the
Montreal Protocol and Vienna Convention. The Montreal Protocol with its amendments and adjustments
now mandates the complete phaseout of production and consumption of a number of ozone depleting
substances (ODS) in developed and most developing countries by January 1, 1996.
3.    All industrialized countries in the world have undertaken comprehensive national programs to
develop cost-effective strategies to phase out the use of these substances in the various end-user sectors.
The largest family of ODS is chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) which are widely used in various industrial
applications including: domestic, commercial and industrial refrigeration and air conditioning, flexible
and rigid insulation foam, and in numerous applications such as aerosol propellants and solvents, among
others.
4.    Hungary is fully committed to the complete phaseout of the consumption of regulated substances
by 1996 as mandated by the Montreal Protocol and its amendments. Hungary acceded to the Vienna
Convention and the Montreal Protocol in 1989, and the London Amendments to the Montreal Protocol
in November, 1993. It formally ratified the Copenhagen Amendments in May 1994. However, Hungary
has not been designated as a developing country under the Montreal Protocol, and is therefore not eligible
for financial assistance from the Multilateral Fund for the Implementation of the Montreal Protocol
(MFMP). Global Environment Facility (GEF) resources will therefore be required to finance the Project
under the Reduction of the Ozone Layer Depletion component.
5.    Hungary has been actively planning its ODS phaseout strategy since 1992. A comprehensive
Country Program for the Phaseout of Ozone Depleting Substances in Hungary was undertaken, with Bank
support, and completed in October 1994. This study served as the basis for establishing the priorities
for the Hungarian Government, and for identifying key policy and regulatory measures which would be
required to support a cost effective phaseout, which would also minimize disruptions to the industrial
sectors which utilize ODS. The activities proposed for funding under this Project are among those
priorities identified in the Country Program.
ODS SECTOR BACKGROUND
6.    All ODS in Hungary are imported from the European Union, mainly the United Kingdom,
Germany, France, the Netherlands, and Italy. In addition, approximately 10 percent of ODS used in
Hungary were exported in final products in 1993. For a few enterprises, the export market has
effectively dictated the phaseout of ODS in advance of national legislation. Recovery and recycling of
ODS will be required as of July 1, 1995 in the refrigeration and fire fighting sectors which together
account for over 1/3 of ODS consumption. Thus far, the weakest area of phaseout has been in the
solvents sector due to its considerably more fragmented nature.



2
7.    In 1993, consumption of regulated ODS was approximately 2,224 metric tons. Compared to
1991, total annual ODS consumption fell by 43 percent, and was equivalent to 2,140 ozone-depleting-
potential (ODP) in weighted tons. In terms of annual ODS consumption and ODP equivalent,
Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) account for roughly three-quarters of the total. Consequently, the focus of
the project should be on phasing out the use of CFCs. Refrigerator and freezer production and servicing
account for approximately 43 percent of CFC use, and 33 percent of national ODS consumption. In
addition, approximately 55 percent of the ODS used in the foam sector are for insulation for refrigeration
devices. Consequently, refrigeration products and servicing account for roughly 49 percent of national
ODS consumption. The remaining ODS consumption is quite evenly distributed with aerosols, foams,
halons, and solvents each accounting for 11-15 percent.
RATIONALE FOR GEF INVOLVEMENT AND PROJECT ELIGIBILITY
8.    Most countries in Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) and the former Soviet Union (FSU) are not
eligible for assistance from the Multilateral Fund for the Implementation of the Montreal Protocol
(MFMP). Nevertheless, the total production and consumption of ODS in the CEE and FSU countries
is equal to that of all the developing countries (including China, India, Brazil, and Thailand) which are
eligible for MFMP assistance, and therefore ODS phaseout projects in Central and Eastern Europe
represent an opportunity to achieve significant global environment benefits through the adoption of cost-
effective technological interventions.
9.     This Project has been developed and structured based on specific ODS phaseout requirements
in Hungary (as outlined in the Country Program) and the general project eligibility criteria guidelines of
the Montreal Protocol and the GEF Scientific and Technical Advisory Panel (STAP). Funding for this
stratospheric ozone layer protection project is requested from the GEF on the basis that Hungary:
(a) is eligible for GEF assistance;
(b) is not classified as a developing country and is not eligible for funding from the Multilateral
Fund for the Implementation of the Montreal Protocol;
(c) has completed the preparation of a Country Program; and
(d) has ratified the Vienna Convention and Montreal Protocol.
10.    The Project consists of three components as follows: (i) an Institutional Strengthening
Component; (ii) a Recovery, Reclamation, and Recycling Component (3R Component) for ODS used as
refrigerants; and (iii) an Investment Component comprising thirteen Sub-Projects. It is consistent with
international efforts in the field of ODS phaseout. The Sub-Projects are deemed to be effective and are
essential interventions in order to quickly and successfully phase out the use of the controlled substances.
This project will be among the first comprehensive and planned ODS phaseout program to be
implemented in Central and Eastern Europe (the Czech Republic project is currently under
implementation, and the Slovenian one under preparation).
PROJECT OBJECTIVES
11.    The principal objective of the Project is to assist Hungary in the phaseout of ODS consumption
in a cost effective manner by the year 1996, as mandated by the Montreal Protocol and its amendments
and adjustments. Specifically this Project will assist Hungary to:



3
a. support the phaseout of the consumption of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) through adoption
of new cost-effective CFC-free technologies;
b. phase in the operation of a national network for recovery/reclamation/recycling (3R) of
refrigerants (CFC-12 and CFC-1 1); and
c. through institutional strengthening improve the capability of the Ministry for Environment
and Regional Policy (MERP) to manage and oversee the phaseout of ODS in Hungary.
GEF support will provide an incentive for the early adoption of ODS phaseout activities and capture
additional environmental and economic benefits which would otherwise either be lost or delayed. By
focussing on the key sectors and enterprises, the project will phase out 1158 tons of ODP per year or
roughly 54 percent of ODP weighted annual ODS consumption in Hungary.
PROJECT ELIGIBILITY AND DETERMINATION OF SUB-PROJECT INCREMENTAL COSTS
12.     For all GEF-funded ozone phaseout projects, the specific eligibility criteria developed for
projects to be funded by the Multilateral Fund for the Implementation of the Montreal Protocol (MFMP)
are used. The GEF Participants, which approved the funding of this Project, are also Parties to the
Montreal Protocol and most of the GEF contributors are contributors to the MFMP. The application of
the project eligibility criteria assured a fair and consistent assessment of the nature of activities which
could be funded and of the maximum level of funding which could be allocated (i.e., the incremental
costs of ODS phaseout). Incremental costs, as defined by the Parties to the Montreal Protocol, are the
capital and operating costs incurred by the Participating Enterprise which they would otherwise not have
incurred in the absence of the Montreal Protocol. The investment Sub-Projects proposed in this Project
meet the project eligibility criteria established by the Parties to the Montreal Protocol, and were subject
to the technical review and approval of the Ozone Operations Resource Group (OORG) which reviews
all Sub-Projects financed by the GEF and the Montreal Protocol.
13.     The level of funding for each Sub-Project was determined on the basis of the incremental costs
at the Sub-Project level. The grant amount requested for each Sub-Project may be less than the
incremental costs of the Sub-Project for several reasons: (i) operating savings are projected to accrue to
the Participating Enterprise during Sub-Project implementation; (ii) the Participating Enterprise may be
less than 100% Hungarian owned, so the grant amount must be pro-rated to the percentage of local
ownership; (iii) the grant amount for any Participating Enterprise which exports a portion of its
production to non-GEF eligible countries must be reduced based on the percentage of exports'. Other
factors which must be considered in determining the Sub-Project incremental cost include, but are not
limited to, the level of technology upgrade achieved by the Sub-Project, the impact on production
capacity, and the cost of substitute materials. For all the Sub-Projects proposed as part of this Project,
counterpart contributions have been made by the Participating Enterprises in terms of time for the
preparation of the project documents and, in most cases, in the implementation of the Sub-Project, either
through management time or through direct investment.
14.     The Sub-Projects were selected on the basis of eligibility criteria from the list of potential Sub-
Projects which had been identified during the preparation of the Country Program. The Sub-Projects
were selected on the basis of their impact on ODS consumption, their potential for minimizing the impact
I    The grant amount for Participating Enterprises which export to non-GEF eligible countries is calculated as follows: (i)
Participating Enterprises which export more than 70% of their production are ineligible for GEF support; (ii) companies which
export less than 10% of their production are eligible for 100% financing of incremental costs; and (iii) companies which export
between 10% and 70% of their production are eligible for financing of incremental costs based on the following formula -- Grant
Amount = Incremental Costs * (I.10 - Per"cntASe of Vroduction which is exported to non-GEF eligible countries).

of ODS phaseout on the economy. The Participating Enterprises were selected on the basis of their
capacity to undertake the Sub-Projects, their technological leadership positions, or their special situation
within the context of ODS consumption (e.g., the Hungarian Association of Refrigeration and Air-
Conditioning Enterprises). From a review of the financial situation of the participating enterprises and
discussions with the Hungarian authorities it is clear that some enterprises are experiencing what appears
to be short-term financial difficulty based on 1994 data, but the firms are about average by Hungarian
standards and appear to have acceptable medium-term prospects. On balance, the financial status of the
selected project enterprises is adequate to justify project participation.
15.    Additional counterpart contributions are expected during the implementation phase of the Project,
and these are estimated at $1.5 million for the Project -- $0.028 million for the Institutional Strengthening
Component, $0.628 million for the 3R Component, and $0.837 million for the thirteen investment Sub-
Projects of the Investment Component. The proposed level of funding represents a conservative but fair
estimate of the incremental costs which will be incurred by the Participating Enterprises. The assessment
of incremental cost for the national recycling scheme (the 3R Component) was determined on the basis
of the analysis of cash flows of all participants and GEF funding determined on the basis of ensuring an
adequate return on the investment for all those participating.
16.    It is therefore proposed that the Project cost of US$8.4 million be funded by the GEF in the
amount of $6.9 million under its Reduction of Ozone Layer Depletion component. Of this amount, about
US$1.1 million (17%) will be in the form of retroactive financing, beginning from August 1993 when
project preparation was initiated, since many of the Participating Enterprises already had to undertake
substantial investments in order to be able to comply with the terms of the Montreal Protocol by 1996
(see Schedule B and Summary Table of Technical Report). Funds would be provided as a grant from
the GEF to the Government of Hungary and channelled to the Participating Enterprises under the 3R and
Investment Components through the NBH and the Corvin Bank. The estimated costs are to be considered
incremental costs net of any potential savings. Proceeds of the grant will not be utilized for transfer
payments, such as taxes and duties.
PROJECT DESCRIPTION AND COSTS
17.    The project consists of (i) an Institutional Strengthening Component (Sub-Project 1); (ii) a
Recovery, Reclamation, and Recycling Component (3R Component) for ODS used as refrigerants (Sub-
Project 2); and (iii) an Investment Component comprising thirteen Sub-Projects (Sub-Projects 3-15).
Below is a description of each of these components. Comprehensive Sub-Project descriptions are
provided in the Technical Report.
I. Institutional Strenghtening Component
18.    Sub-Project 1 -- Project Implementation Unit. The MERP will set up an ODS Phaseout
Project Implementation unit (PIU) to be supported by a Technical Advisory Group (TAG) of specialists
who will be appointed by the PIU. The PIU will coordinate the implementation of the Project, oversee
procurement and disbursement for Sub-Projects 1-15 in compliance with World Bank guidelines, and in
close cooperation with the Corvin Bank (CB), supervise project activities according to the requirements
of the World Bank and the MERP. As necessary, the PIU will arrange for technical assistance and
consultants to assist in project implementation, and provide support to facilitate cooperation among
government institutions and the consumers of ODS. The PIU will be responsible for calling meetings
of the TAG, which will be responsible for assisting small users not covered under the Project, and
advising the PIU and Participating Enterprises concerning any changes in ODS Phaseout technologies and
their implications for Sub-Project implementation and training of staff at the Participating Enterprises.



5
The TAG will not, however, identify new investment Sub-Projects. Finally, the PIU will be responsible
for establishing the computerized monitoring system for monitoring ODS consumption together with the
Institute for Environmental Management (IEM). Funding for this Sub-Project amounts to US$244,500
to cover salaries (for additional staff who are not civil service employees), office equipment and the costs
of the monitoring during implementation of the Sub-Projects.
II. 3R Component
19.    Sub-Project 2 -- Reduction of the emission of ozone depleting freon gases through recovery,
reclamnation, and recycling of refrigerants. The objective of the Sub-Project is to decrease the amount
of CFC-l 1, CFC-12 and CFC-502 since consumption of these substances is expected to be 750 tons in
1993. These substances are used and discharged during the maintenance and repairs of domestic,
commercial, and industrial refrigerators, and air conditioners. Under the Sub-Project, the Hungarian
Association of Refrigeration and Air Conditioning Enterprises will establish a national network to remove
these ozone depleting substances from refrigerators and to collect and recycle them.  There are
approximately 2000 qualified refrigerator fitters in Hungary, and it is expected that the Association will
work with 75-80 percent of the qualified refrigerator fitters. Under this Sub-Project, the refrigerator
fitters will receive training for the new closed system repair and maintenance technology which will be
required to operate the recovery, reclamation, and recycling scheme for refrigerants which is expected
to recycle 450 tons of CFCs per year. The total cost of the Sub-Project is US$2,042,670. The
Association will cover US$627,175 of the total incremental cost of the Sub-Project, and the GEF Grant
will cover US$1,415,495.
III. Investment Component
20.    Sub-Project 3 -- Phaseout of ozone depleting substances in the manufacturing of
refrigerators and freezers at Frigolux Ltd. The objective of the project is to phase out the consumption
of various ODS by 90 percent per year. Present consumption includes 3.8 tons of CFC-12 and 0.85 tons
of CFC-502 refrigerant, as well as 11 tons of blowing agent CFC-11 which will be eliminated by
replacing the blowing agent (CFC-1 1) used for rigid polyurethane (PU) foam insulation with cyclopentane
(temporarily with HFC-134A), and replacing CFC-12 refrigerant with HFC-134A, and CFC-502 with
HFC 404A and/or HFC-507. For these changes new filling equipment, vacuum pumps, gas detectors,
and temperature control units are to be procured and put into service. The Sub-Project includes training,
which is necessary for the implementation of the new technologies, and some elements of servicing. The
first phase of the Sub-Project was carried out between June 1994 and December 1994. In the first phase,
the phaseout of the ODS was not complete, since the emission of ozone depleting substances equivalent
to about 1.8 tons of ODP continued. By the end of the second phase (through 1996), ozone depleting
substances will not be used. The total cost of the Sub-Project is estimated at $572,864. Frigolux Ltd.
will cover US$96,800 of the total incremental cost of the Sub-Project from its own sources, while the
remaining incremental costs of the Sub-Project (US$476,064) are to be financed by the GEF grant.
21.    Sub-Project 4 -- CFC-11 free polyurethane foam processing for the heat-insulation of hot
water storage tanks at the Hajdusagi Iparinuvek Company. The objective of the Sub-Project is to
phase out annual consumption of 63 tons of CFC-1 1 PU-blowing-agent propellant through construction
alterations, the establishment of a storing park, and the installation of a foaming machine which uses high
pressure water/CO2 as propellant. During the first ten months (January-October 1994), the high pressure
foaming machine using water/CO2 as propellant (which is necessary for the new process which will not
use foams with CFC-1 1) was put into operation. In the first phase, technological experiments and heat
loss tests were also carried out with the foams which do not contain CFC-11. In the second project phase
from November 1994 to December 1995, the foaming in form or pillory is to be worked out and
inaugurated, and the construction modifications are to be planned and carried out depending on the results



6
of heat loss tests. In the third phase between January and December 1996, the transportation and storage
system of the polyurethane base are to be rationalized. Construction modifications to maintain the quality
in CFC-free polyurethane (PU) foam manufacturing will also be carried out. The total cost of the Sub-
Project is estimated at $1,406.000. Hajdusagi Iparmuvek Company will cover US$407,560 of the total
incremental cost of the Sub-Project from its own sources, while the remaining incremental costs of the
Sub-Project (US$998,642) are to be financed by the GEF grant.
22.    Sub-Project 5 -- Phaseout of ozone depleting CFC-11 freon in sandwich panel production
at Metalucon Ltd. The objective of the Sub-Project is to phase out annual consumption of 45.6 tons of
CFC-1 1 freon blowing agent. In the first phase of the Sub-Project the CFC-1 1 freon will be substituted
with the much lower ozone depleting HCFC-141b blowing agent. To carry out this change, new foaming
equipment which uses the new blowing agent will be procured, and the temperature adjustment of the
electric heating of the foaming frames will be assessed. In the second phase of the Sub-Project,
cyclopentane will be substituted for HCFC-141b blowing agent. The first phase of the Sub-Project is
planned to be executed in 1995-1996, and the second phase in 1997. The most important parts of the
first phase are the procuring and putting into service of the foaming equipment, the stirrer, the tanks, and
the injection device, and the realization of the electric heating and temperature adjustment of the foaming
frames. In the second phase of the Sub-Project the implementation of the cyclopentane blowing agent
will be possible without any investment cost because the equipment installed under the first phase can be
converted to use cyclopentane. The Sub-Project will also include training for employees. The total cost
of the Sub-Project is estimated at $884,608 Metalucon Ltd. will cover US$160,289 of the total
incremental cost of the Sub-Project from its own sources, while the remaining incremental costs of the
Sub-Project (US$724,319) are to be financed by the GEF grant.
23.    Sub-Project 6 -- Phaseout of ozone depleting CFC-11 freon in sandwich panel production
at Metisol Ltd. The objective of the Sub-Project in the first phase is to substitute for annual use of 80
tons of CFC-11 blowing agent with HCFC-141b blowing agent. This will entail necessary technological
changes, reconditioning certain equipments, changing the temperature adjustment, and technical
assistance. This will entail necessary technological changes, procurement and installation of high pressure
blowing presses and heating containers, air control on the shop floor, reconditioning certain equipments,
technical assistance, and training for employees. During the second phase of the Sub-Project in 1997,
the phaseout of the consumption of ozone depleting substances will be complete. The execution of the
first phase of the Sub-Project took seven months from June-December 1994. The total cost of the Sub-
Project is estimated at $441,207. Metisol Ltd. will cover US$95,185 of the total incremental cost of the
Sub-Project from its own sources, while the remaining incremental costs of the Sub-Project (US$346,022)
are to be financed by the GEF grant.
24.    Sub-Project 7 -- Phaseout of CFC propellant in gas-sterilizer cartridge production using
ethylene oxide at Mediroll Ltd. The objective of the Sub-Project is to phase out annual consumption
of 107 tons of CFC 12 with HCFC-124 propellant and to carry out the development work, obligatory
sterilizing tests, chemical and microbiological testing, and determination of the most effective gas
mixture. The Sub-Project will be carried out in two phases. The first phase should take four months,
and the second twelve months. The total cost of the Sub-Project is estimated at $58,253. Mediroll Ltd.
will cover US$4,854 of the total incremental cost of the Sub-Project from its own sources, while the
remaining incremental costs of the Sub-Project (US$53,399) are to be financed by the GEF grant.
25.    Sub-Project 8 -- Phaseout of CFC-11, CFC-12, and 1,1,1-Trichloroethane solvents and
propellants at Auto-Mobil Ltd. The objective of the Sub-Project is to phase out annual consumption
of 28 tons of CFC-11, 64 tons of CFC-12, and 47.6 tons of 1,1,1-Trichloroethane ozone depleting
substances through the application of other propellants such as propane-butane gas and compressed air.
The project entails conversion of propellant containers and other equipment, and safety training for staff.



7
The planning phase of the project was between June 1, 1994 and September 31, 1994, and its investment
phase between October 1, 1994 and December 31, 1995. The total cost of the Sub-Project is estimated
at $83,512, of which the entire amount will be financed by the GEF Grant.
26.    Sub-Project 9 -- Modification of cleaning technology of automatic and electronic parts of
oil and gas pipelines, substituting for CFC and 1,1,1-Trichloroethane solvents with water based
solution at MMG-AM Ltd. The objective of the Sub-Project is to phase out annual consumption of 87
tons of 1,1, 1-Trichloroethane and 3.5 tons of CFC ozone depleting substances by conversion to a water-
based solution using washing technology. During the execution of the Sub-Project seven modern
ultrasonic washing appliances will be bought and installed. These new appliances use water based
solution, and will be substituted for eight degreasing washing appliances which employ 1,1,1-
Trichloroethane and CFCs. The investment Sub-Project also includes: (i) ventilation systems, which are
to be installed at the washing appliances, (ii) a recirculating water-using rinsing appliance, and (iii) a
solution desalting appliance, which is based on reverse osmosis. The realization of the Sub-Project should
take eight months. The Sub-Project is divided into three phases. In the first phase preparatory research
and development works (experimental degreasing with modern water based washing solution,
experimental soldering, etc.), planning tasks, and tasks related to ordering will be executed. The second
phase consists of the installation and of the new appliances. In the third phase of the Sub-Project the
operating parameters of the new appliances will be set. The total cost of the Sub-Project is estimated at
$1,233,179 of which $1,205,800 amount will be financed by the GEF Grant.
27.    Sub-Project 10 -- Phaseout of 1,1,1-Trichloroethane photoresistant developer with alkalic
solution in the manufacturing of printed circuit panels at Hitelap Ltd. The objective of the Sub-
Project is to phase out the annual consumption of 32 tons of 1,1,1-Trichloroethane through new
equipment to be used in alkaline soluble photoresistant development, stripping, and developing in water
based solution and washing with water. The Sub-Project will substitute for the old developer and washer
by procuring and putting into service modern equipment. New wastewater cleaning equipment is to be
installed to improve the treatment of sewage water. The execution of the Sub-Project will take eight
months. It will consist of planning, and putting into operation the alkalic developer, the washer, and the
coagulant filter -- including the introductory operation. The total cost of the Sub-Project is estimated at
$179,789 of which the entire amount will be financed by the GEF Grant.
28.    Sub-Project 11 -- Conversion from release agent solvent to solvent free release agent
substance, and from the consumption of 1,1,1-Trichloroethane to water based cleaning in
polyurethane sole producing at Tisza Shoe Company. The objective of the Sub-Project is to phase out
annual consumption of 3.7 tons of CFC-1 1 solvent, 16.78 tons of 1,1, 1-Trichloroethane washing liquid,
and 5.6 tons release agent which contains 1,1, 1-Trichloroethane through the application of a new release
agent, installation of a new sprinkler device, and use of a water-solution washer. The new release agent
is completely solvent free, and consists of a mixture of waxes and silicon oils. A wastewater treatment
facility must be installed and the ventilation system updated. The execution of the Sub-Project will take
ten months. In the first phase of the Sub-Project (April 1 to June 30, 1995) the alternative substances,
technologies, and equipments are to be chosen, tests are to be carried out, and permits are to be obtained.
In the second phase of the Sub-Project the old equipments are to be detached, the new strewing
equipment, water-using washer, and water treatment facility are to be installed, the ventilation is to be
up-dated, and the staff is to be trained (July 1 to October 31, 1995). In the final phase, the new
technologies are to be installed and checked November 1 to December 31, 1995). The total cost of the
Sub-Project is estimated at $176,000 of which $131,617 will be financed by the GEF Grant.
29.    Sub-Project 12 - Conversion from open system vapor phase washing with CFC-113 to
closed system washing with perchloroethylene at Fovarosi Finommechanikai Ltd. The objective of
the Sub-Project is to phase out annual consumption of 1.50 tons of CFC- 113 ozone depleting substances



8
by switching over from an open freon system using washing to a closed system based on
perchloroethylene washing. The Sub-Project will be realized in three phases. During the first phase, the
alternative cleaning technologies and cleaning substances will be evaluated, and experimental production
will be done with the selected substances. In the second phase of the Sub-Project, the freon-using washer
will be detached, the two renewed closed system perchloroethylene-using washers will be installed and
put into service, the staff will be trained in the new technology, and the operating parameters of the new
washing technology will be set. In the third phase a closed system of perchloroethylene-based washing
will be applied and the technology will be tested. The total cost of the Sub-Project is estimated at
$33,570, of which the entire amount will be financed by the GEF Grant.
30.    Sub-Project 13 -- Conversion to soldering with residue free fluxic soldering tin instead of
cleaning with freon after soldering at the BRG Radiotechnikai Company. The objective of the Sub-
Project is to phase out annual consumption of 1.5 tons of CFC- 113 ozone depleting substance through
the implementation of the modern MULTICORE soldering tin, which makes washing with freon
unnecessary. Although the composition of the flux of the modern MULTICORE-made soldering tin
makes the washing after soldering unnecessary, its application increases the soldering time, and therefore
the working time and the consumption of electric energy. For this reason BRG must employ 32 people
instead of 30 for soldering jobs, in order to avoid that the new technology decrease its output. The
duration of the Sub-Project is one month, and the Sub-Project is divided into three phases. During the
first phase, alternative soldering substances and cleaning technologies were evaluated and trial producing
was done with the chosen substances. In the second phase the staff was trained for the new soldering
technology, the materials and the soldering edges needed for the new technology were procured. In the
third phase the new soldering technology is to be tested in manufacturing. The total cost of the Sub-
Project is estimated at $22,845 of which $22,160 will be financed by the GEF grant.
31.    Sub-Project 14 -- Conversion from freon-using cloth cleaning machines to perchloroethylene-
using machines at the Rutitex Company. The objective of the Sub-Project is to phase out annual
consumption of 7.9 tons of CFC-11 and CFC-113 freon ozone depleting substances through the
substitution for freon-based cleaners with new perchloroethylene-based cleaners. During the Sub-Project
four closed system perchloroethylene-based cleaners will be bought. The execution of the Sub-Project
will take six months. The total cost of the Sub-Project is estimated at $340,400 of which the entire
amount will be financed by the GEF Grant.
32.    Sub-Project 15 -- Regenerating and closed system draining of extinguishing gases at the
member companies of the Fire-Protection Association. The Fire-Protection Association was established
in 1994 by the decision of the Elzett Safety Technology Company, Fajro Automatics and Fire-Protection
Equipment Producing Ltd., and the Fire-Protection Education and Research Institution. The objective
of the Sub-Project is to recycle 2,764 tons of halon 1211 and 159 tons of halon 1301 extinguishant. As
a benefit of the Sub-Project the emission of 85.13 tons of halon 1211 and 1.43 tons of halon 1301
extinguishant would discontinue by putting into service regenerating devices, closed system draining
devices, and other additional devices (evaluating and measuring instruments, etc.). The realization of the
Sub-Project will take four months. In the first phase the old equipment will be dismounted and the new
ones will be installed at Elzett and Fajro. The second phase will be carried out in two months and will
consist of the training of the controlling staff. The total cost of the Sub-Project is estimated at $321,000
and will be totally financed by the GEF Grant.
33.    The incremental cost of the Project has been determined to be US$8.4 million, which represents
about 29 percent of the national incremental costs which will be assumed by Hungary economy in phasing
out ODS. Of this total $7.6 million (91%) is incremental capital costs, and $0.8 million (9%) is
incremental operating costs. The national incremental costs were estimated in the Country Program for
the phaseout of ozone-depleting-substances.

PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION ARRANGEMENTS
34.    The Ministry for Environment and Regional Policy (MERP), through the Project Implementation
Unit (PIU), will act as general program coordinator for the Project. The MERP will liaise with other
ministries on policies and industrial strategy issues, and, through its PIU, be responsible for day-to-day
management of project implementation. The PIU was established by the MERP approximately twelve
months before Project Appraisal. Moreover, since the PIU has practically the status of a government
entity, the Corvin Bank will not be responsible for disbursement to the PIU under Sub-Project 1. Instead,
disbursement for this Sub-Project will be made directly to the Central Environmental Protection Fund of
the MERP.
35.    The Corvin Bank (CB) was selected by the MERP to manage, on behalf of the recipient as its
agent, the local funds administration for the 3R and Investment Components. The emphasis in selection
of the CB by the MERP was based on its ability to disburse and administrate project funds and its
familiarity with the World Bank procurement procedures. To ensure smooth disbursement, early
involvement of the CB in supervision will be required.  The CB will assume the day-to-day
responsibilities related to procurement, disbursement, and it will assist the PIU in the supervision of Sub-
Project implementation for Sub-Projects 2-15. The CB will provide at least one staff person with
experience in procurement in World Bank projects, and procurement advice will also be provided by the
World Bank Resident Mission in Budapest.
36.    A Project Administration Agreement (subject to Bank review), which clearly spells out the
responsibilities of each organization, will be established between the recipient represented by the Ministry
of Finance (MoF) and MERP on one part, and the CB on the other part. Agreement on the Project
Administration Agreement will be a condition for negotiations, and its signature a condition for
effectiveness. A fee of 2.50 percent will be paid on Sub-Projects 2-15. This fee will be split between the
CB and the National Bank of Hungary (NBH). For each Sub-Project a Sub-Grant Agreement between the
CB and each of the Participating Enterprises will be prepared. Each Participating Enterprise has prepared
a Sub-Project Document which will form the basis of a Sub-Grant Agreement between the CB and the
Participating Enterprise. The Sub-grant Agreements will include reporting provisions, annexes on
disbursement, and provisions related to environmental protection and worker safety. Signed Sub-Grant
Agreements will be a condition of disbursement for each investment Sub-Project, and preparation of a
pro-forma draft Sub-Grant Agreement will be a condition of negotiations.
37.    Standard Bank disbursement procedures will be followed, with established limits on initial deposit
and replenishment levels, statements of expenditures, and Bank procurement review levels. The CB will
review the progress of the Sub-Projects and make recommendations on disbursements to suppliers and
consultants. On the basis of an agreement between the recipient and NBH, the Special Account will be
held with the NBH. Though the Multilateral Fund procedures allow for complete retroactive financing
of ODS-phaseout expenditures incurred in a country after the Montreal Protocol comes into force, more
restrictive IBRD rules limiting retroactive financing have been applied to this project. Project expenditures
incurred after August 1993 are eligible for retroactive financing, provided the procurement procedures
outlined in Schedule B are followed. Retroactive financing shall be limited to no more than 40% of total
project expenditures financed by the GEF grant. It is expected that by October 1995 the enterprises will
have incurred expenses worth $ 1.1 million, or about 17% of the total GEF grant financing, which will
be financed retroactively. For expenditures to be retroactively financed, the procurement process should
be consistent with Bank procedures, and all records should be available to the Bank for review.
38.    Monitoring and evaluation of the Project will require that the PIU prepare quarterly reports to
be submitted to the World Bank for the duration of project supervision. A standard format for these



10
quarterly supervision reports is being developed by the GEF, and will be explained to and agreed upon
with the PIU. The quarterly reports will summarize issues related to procurement, disbursement, technical
aspects of project implementation, accounting and auditing information, environmental and safety issues,
and any changes in the legal and regulatory framework. Inputs for the quarterly report will be provided
by the CB and the Participating Enterprises. The quarterly reports will be reviewed by the World Bank
task manager, and discussed during supervision missions.2
39.      A Project Implementation Manual (PIM) has been provided, and includes the relevant Bank
guidelines on procurement, disbursements, use of consultants, financial reporting, auditing, sample
bidding documents, and other project-specific documents. In addition, detailed Project Implementation
Plans were prepared by each of the Participating Enterprises during Appraisal. Finally, a one week
training course on project implementation and management was held in Budapest in mid-January 1995,
and was attended by staff of the PIU, the CB, and the NBH.
PROJECT BENEFITS
40.    The project's major benefit will be to assist Hungary to achieve its objective of completely
phasing out the use of ODS as early as is technically feasible. The project will help the Governmnent
implement an accelerated ODS phaseout program by providing financing for priority Sub-Projects which
will result in the phaseout of 1158 tons of ODP annually (or about 54 percent of Hungary's total ODP-
weighted annual consumption of ODS).
41.    The project consists of Sub-Projects which will contribute to maximizing the useful life of
equipment which currently rely on the availability of CFC for their continued use. This will contribute
to reducing the country's economic cost of phasing out the use of the controlled substances, and
minimizing the economic dislocation associated with ODS phaseout. In addition, the project will enable
firms with exports to adjust in a timely manner to non-ODS products as requested by importers from
industrialized countries. These companies export around 10 percent of their annual ODS consumption.
Finally, implementing the 3R Sub-Project will reduce ODS emissions which originate during servicing
of refrigeration and air conditioning systems by as much as 450 tons per year, and will extend the useful
life of equipment utilizing ODS which otherwise would be discarded for lack of ODS for maintenance
purposes.
PROJECT RISKS AND MITIGATION MEASURES
42.    Management structure and ownership of most of the companies which would be assisted under
this project could change in the future. Nevertheless, the risks associated with any future financial
problems of some companies would be mitigated through a review of the financial status of each
Participating Enterprise during supervision. The Participating Enterprises have good prospects for
increased profitability based on their position within their respective industrial sectors, and the fact that
they will be undertaking these necessary new investments for the phaseout of ODS technologies.
Implementation of the new technologies will also make any state enterprises more attractive candidates
for privatization.
43.    The risk associated with insufficient institutional capacity should be adequately offset by the
2   The first supervision mission is scheduled for October 1995, and 12 staff weeks per year have been allocated for World
Bank Supervision of the Project.



11
establishment of the Project Implementation Unit (PIU) and Technical Advisory Group (TAG) to assist
in the implementation of the Sub-Projects and Country Program for ODS Phaseout. The work of the PIU
and TAG will be essential to help industry make the transition to ODS substitutes instead of continued
use of ODS. Monitoring of compliance with ODS regulations will also be of paramount importance for
project success. Under the Institutional Strengthening Component, the MERP will be responsible for
monitoring the compliance with ODS regulations. To address this problem, the Ministry of Environment
will develop an ODS monitoring system, ensure that a system of fines is in place to discourage continued
use of ODS, and ensure that regulations governing the use of ODS are strictly enforced.
44.    Finally, experience in national 3R programs is limited to only a few countries, although many
are now under development. The limited experience to date has indicated that, initially, the amounts of
CFC recovered will be small, and that the most important aspect of the program is to provide adequate
financial and economic incentives to the servicing sector.  A condition for disbursement for this
component will therefore be that the product fees and the methods for their collection are in place.3 The
financial sustainability of the 3R scheme will be monitored closely in order to react to market conditions
(price and availability of CFCs) which will influence the short and medium term profitability of the
operation. Project risk is being mitigated by placing the financial risk with the enterprises which are most
capable of assuming it, and by ensuring that the incentive to the servicing sector is sufficient to encourage
widespread recovery of CFC through maintenance activities. Presently, the incentives scheme consists
of product fees of 250 Hungarian Forints/kg of CFCs, and 100 Hungarian Forints/kg of HCFCs.
REGULATORY FRAMEWORK
45.    Stratospheric Ozone Layer protection has been accorded high priority by the Government of
Hungary as an important global environmental issue. The requirements of the Montreal Protocol were
incorporated into national law by issue of a Ministerial decree in 1992 and amended in 1993 and 1994.
The principal components of the decree were deadlines for ODS phaseout in each sector of consumption,
bans on new equipment which used controlled substances, requirements for authorization to import
controlled substances, obligatory reporting on the use of controlled substances, and penalties for violating
regulations. The decree adopts the ODS phaseout schedule of the Montreal Protocol and its amendments
and adjustments, and is fully consistent with the provisions of the Montreal Protocol on limitations on
trade in the controlled substances.
ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT
46.    Sub-Projects 2-15 were prepared on the basis of, and will be subject to, local environmental
regulations and the Bank's project environmental review procedures. The Sub-Projects consist of light
industrial projects which have been classified as category B on the basis of the Bank's project
environmental classification system (OD 4.01), and based on previous classification of similar projects.
47.    The MERP has provided its environmental clearance for all of the proposed activities to be
implemented under the Project. The Project provides for resources to retain the services of international
consultants for supervision of project implementation, including health and safety considerations, and
these will be addressed during the first supervision mission planned for September 1995. International
health and safety standards should be observed, with particular emphasis on the design and operation of
3    Collection of product fees (250 HF/kg for CFCs and 100 HF/kg for HCFCs) is expected to begin in September 1995.
The exact sharing of these product fees between the State EcoFund and the Refrigeration Enterprises will be determined at a later
date. See Table 3-1 of the Technical Report for a detailed breakdown of the incentives scheme.

cyclopentane tanks. Adequate safeguards for worker health and safety will be a condition of disbursement
for any Sub-Project, and project supervision will include guidance to ensure that safety and environmental
conditions in the Participating Enterprises are consistent with international practices for the new
technologies which will be employed to phase out ODS.
AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
48.    During negotiations the following assurances were obtained from Government:
(a) a part of the proceeds of the grant will be made available to CB, under terms acceptable to
the Bank, including a financial agency fee of 2.50 % of the amount disbursed to finance Sub-
project 2-15 (para. 36);
(b) all measures necessary to ensure that each Participating Enterprise complies with the relevant
requirements for ODS phaseout activity will be taken (para. 46);
(c) PIU and CB will maintain reporting and accounting practices acceptable to the Bank (para.
38 and 39).
49.    The execution of the Project Administration Agreement between CB, MoF and MERP would
be a condition of effectiveness (para. 36).
50.    Conditions of disbursement would be:
(a) signing of a Sub-Grant Agreement between the CB and the Participating Enterprise(s)
responsible for the corresponding Sub-Project (para. 36);
(b) Governmnent's certification to the Bank that adequate environmental and safety precautions
are in place for any Sub-Project (para. 47);
(c) establishment of CFCs product fees and collection system for the 3R Component (para. 44).

TECHNICAL SUPPORT AND INVESTMENT PROJECT
FOR THE PHASEOUT OF OZONE DEPLETING SUBSTANCES
PROCUREMENT AND DISBURSEMENT ARRANGEMENTS
A.      Procurement
1.     Procurement of goods, works, and services will be in accordance with relevant Bank Guidelines.
The Project Implementation Unit (PIU), which was established by the Ministry for Environment and
Regional Policy (MERP) in July 1994, will be responsible for the day-to-day management of project
implementation. The PIU will provide support to the enterprises participating in the project and, by
providing a link between them and the World Bank. will ensure that the project will be carried out in a
timely and efficient manner. The Corvin Bank (CB) was selected by MERP to manage the funds
administration, based on its ability to disburse and administrate project funds and its familiarity with the
World Bank procurement procedures. The CB will be responsible for ensuring that the procurement
methods proposed by the Participating Enterprises are in accordance with World Bank Guidelines
(January 1995).
(a) Works
(i)       Contracts for civil works up to US$200,000 equivalent would be awarded on the
basis of national shopping (NS) procedures, where quotations would be obtained
from at least three qualified suppliers4
(b) Goods
(i)       Contracts over US$500,000 equivalent would be awarded on the basis of
international competitive bidding (ICB) procedures; domestic preference will
apply;5
(ii)      Contracts between US$50,000 and US$500,000 equivalent would be awarded on
the basis of the Bank's international shopping (IS) procedures where price
quotations would be obtained from at least three qualified suppliers from at least
two countries
(iii)     Contracts below US$50,000 equivalent would be awarded on the basis of national
shopping (NS) procedures where quotations would be obtained from at least three
qualified suppliers
4   The use of National Shopping procedures for works is justified on the ground that: a) the project must be completed by
a certain date for the country to fulfill the Montreal Protocol mandate; and b) the country has a very strong construction industry
which can perform at very competitive prices.
5   However, no procurement package has a contract value higher than the threshold. No ICB procurement is expected in
the project.



SCHEDULE B                                             16
(iv)      Direct contracts (DC) would be awarded on the basis of negotiations with the
technology supplier. The Bank's prior approval for each case of direct
contracting would be necessary.
(c) Consultants
(i)       Consultant services for engineering studies, technical assistance, study tours and
training programs would be procured in accordance with the "Guidelines for the
Use of Consultants by World Bank" published by the World Bank in August
19816.
2.      The following contracts and bid packages will be subject to the Bank's prior review:
(i)       ICB packages'
(ii)      The first two NS contracts for works; the first two IS contracts for goods; and
all DC procurement
(iii)     Terms of References for all consulting services; short list, terms of reference,
letter of invitation and award decisions for consultant contract over US$100,000
equivalent for firms and US$50,000 equivalent for individuals.
3.      All other contracts for goods, works and consultant services which are financed through this
grant will be subject to ex-post review by the Bank in order to verify compliance with Bank procurement
guidelines. Information on procurement would be periodically provided to the World Bank task manager
by the PIU.
4.      Retroactive Financing. Project expenditures incurred after August 1993 are eligible for
retroactive financing, provided the above procurement was carried out in accordance with Bank
Guidelines (January 1995). Retroactive financing shall be limited to no more than 40% of total project
expenditures financed by the GEF grant. It is expected that by October 1995 the enterprises will have
incurred expenses worth $ 1.1 million, or about 17% of the total GEF grant financing, which will be
financed retroactively. For expenditures to be retroactively financed, the procurement process should be
consistent with Bank procedures and all records should be available to the Bank for review.
6   Short-term contracts for highly specialized assignments will be carried out by individual consultants, major assignments
will be contracted through short-listing of consulting firms.
7   See note 5.

Recovery, Reclamation, and Recycling of Refrigerants
REFRIGERATION
A. SUB-PROJECT DESCRIPTION
Background
2.1    The Association of the Refrigerating and Air Conditioning Enterprises was established in 1993,
currently the Association represents the interests of 182 companies - these companies include more than
900 refrigerator repair shops, which each have six refrigerator fitters, on average.
2.2    There are about 450-460 refrigerator services in the country, and about 2000 qualified fitters
work. It is expected, that the Association will work with 75-80 percent of the qualified fitters under this
Sub-Project.
Sub-Project Objective
2.3    The objective of the Sub-Project is to decrease the amount of CFC-11, CFC-12 and CFC-502
since consumption of these substances was 750 tons in 1993. These substances are used and discharged
during the maintenance and repairs of domestic, commercial, and industrial refrigerators, and air
conditioners.
2.4    The Sub-Project will be implemented by the Association with a view to provide each of its 182
member Service Centers with the skills and equipment required to establish a national network to remove
ozone depleting substances from refrigerators and to collect and recycle them.
2.5    During the Sub-Project the companies of the Association will first establish the material
conditions and requirements for closed system repairing. Meanwhile, on the national level, about 2000
qualified refrigerator fitters will be trained in the new closed system repair and maintenance technology.
The training will be both theoretical and practical.

SUB-PROJECT No. 3 - Phaseout of Ozone Depleting Substances in the Manufacturing of
Refrigerators and Freezers at Frigolux Ltd.
REFRGERATION AND FoAM SECTOR
A. SUB-PROJECT DESCRIPTION
Background
3.1   The Frigolux Ltd. used to belong to the MIRKOZ Diesel and Cooling Technology Cooperative
Society as a factory unit in Csongrad. In 1990, it became independent as a cooperative society, and in
1992 it became a limited liability company. The main products of Frigolux are: shop-type food freezers,
refrigerators and vitrines, ice-cream-machines for retail use, and domestic refrigerators. The company
produced nearly 8600 refrigerators in 1993. The revenue of the company was 390 million HF (3.9
million USD) in 1993.
Sub-Project Objectives
3.2   The objective of the Sub-Project is to phase out the consumption of various ODS by 90 percent
per year. Present consumption includes 3.8 tons of CFC-12 and 0.85 tons of CFC-502 refrigerant, as
well as 11 tons of blowing agent CFC-1 1 which will be eliminated by replacing the blowing agent (CFC-
11) used for rigid polyurethane (PU) foam insulation with cyclopentane (temporarily with HFC- 134A),
and replacing CFC-12 refrigerant with HFC-134A, and CFC-502 with HFC 404A and/or HFC-507. For
these changes new filling equipment, vacuum pumps, gas detectors, and temperature control units are to
be procured and put into service. The Sub-Project includes training, which is necessary for the
implementation of the new technologies, and some elements of servicing.
B. SUB-PROJECT EXECUTION
3.3   The first phase of the Sub-Project was carried out between June 1994 and December 1994. In
the first phase, the phaseout of the ODS was not completed, since the emission of ozone depleting
substances equivalent to about 1.8 tons of ODP will continue. The Sub-Project incudes the procurement
and installation of one high pressure PU-foaming mixer, heating and ventilation for the foaming
workshop, refrigerant charging equipment, vacuum pumps, electronic leak detectors, and refrigerating
system dew-point testers. At the end of the second phase (through 1996) ozone depleting substances will
not be used. Particular attention will be given to ensure that the design and operation of cyclopentane
storage tanks is up to international safety standards.
3.4   Frigolux Ltd. will carry out Sub-Project execution on its own site. The CB and the MERP will
supervise the use of the GEF grant.

3.6    Frigolux Ltd. will cover US$96,800 of the total incremental cost of the Sub-Project from its own
sources. The remaining incremental costs of the project are to be financed by the GEF grant.
Proposed GEF Grant                                                               US$476,064
Participating Enterprise Contribution                                            US$ 96,800
D. BENEFIT OF THE SUB-PROJECT
3.7    As a result of the implementation of the first phase of the Sub-Project, the reduction in
emission of ozone depleting substances will be equivalent to 15.60 tons of ODP per year.
9  The cost-effectiveness of this project is $30.7 1/kg-ODP, which is within the range of cost-effectiveness of similar projects
supported by the Multilateral Fund of the Montreal Protocol (with an average cost-effectiveness of $29.32/kg-ODP).

SUB-PROJECT No. 4 - CFC-11 Free Polyurethane Foam Processing for the Heat-Insulation of
Hot Water Storage Tanks at the Hajdusagi Iparmuvek Company
FOAM SECTOR
A. SUB-PROJECT DESCRiPTION
Background
4.1    The activity of the Hajdusagi Iparmuvek Company involves manufacturing and merchandising
of household appliances. Besides automatic washing machines and hot-water-tanks, the company
produces traditional washing machines, spin-dryers, open system water heaters and surface radiators.
4.2    The net income of the company in 1993 was 42.6 million USD, and 19 percent of this originated
from exports. The number of employees is 1,950. In the last few years the company has undertaken
many positive steps for environmental protection and quality assurance.
Sub-Project Objectives
4.3    The objective of the Sub-Project is to phase out annual consumption of 63 tons of CFC-1 1 PU-
blowing-agent propellant through construction alterations, new technologies, the establishment of a storing
park, and the installation of a foaming machine which uses high pressure water/CO2 as propellant.
4.4    The high pressure foaming machine which is to be installed will operate with a water/CO2
propellant foam system. This machine has to have 500 kg/hour polyalcohol + 700 kg/hour isocyanide
foaming capacity and the amount of foam to be propelled into the system is to be 1.5-8.5 kg/piece. Heat
loss inspections and technological examinations will be performed. Construction modifications to
maintain the quality in CFC-free polyurethane (PU) foam manufacturing will be carried out.
B. SUB-PROJECT ExEcuTIoN
4.5    The execution of the Sub-Project will take 36 months. During the first ten months (January-
October 1994), the high pressure foaming machine, which uses water/CO2 as propellant instead of foams
with CFC-1 1, will be put into operation. In the first phase, technological experiments and heat loss tests
are also going to be carried out with the foams which do not contain CFC-11. In the second project
phase from November 1994 to December 1995, the foaming in form or pillory is to be worked out and
inaugurated, and the construction modifications are to be planned and carried out depending on the results
of the heat loss tests. In the third phase between January and December 1996, the transportation and
storage system of the polyurethane base are to be rationalized.
4.6   The Hajdusagi Iparmuvek Company will control and conduct the Sub-Project execution, while
the CB and the MERP will supervise the use of the GEF grant.

SUB-PROJECT No. 5 - The Phaseout of Ozone Depleting CFC-11 Freon in
Sandwich Panel Production at Metalucon Ltd.
FOAM SECTOR
A. SUB-PROJECT DESCRIPTION
Background
5.1    Metalucon Ltd. is a property of the HUNGALU Hungarian Aluminum Industrial Company. Out
of the 550 million Hungarian Forints (HF) revenue of the company in 1993, 101 million Hungarian
Forints caine from the production of sandwich panels. The company has 160 employees, 30 of which
work in the sandwich panel manufacturing industrial unit that began operations in 1981. Currently they
produce 30 thousand m2 of sandwich panels, but a few years ago the production was over 100 thousand
m2. The company delivers most of its sandwich panel products to the building industry and to
refrigerating plants. In the future, the production of the company is expected to increase.
Sub-Project Objectives
5.2   The objective of the Sub-Project is to phase out annual consumption of 45.6 tons of CFC-1 1 freon
blowing agent. In the first phase of the project the CFC-1 1 freon will be substituted with the much less
ozone depleting HCFC-141b blowing agent. To carry out this change, new foaming equipment which
uses the new blowing agent will be procured, and the temperature adjustment of the electric heating of
the foaming frames will be assessed. In the second phase of the Sub-Project, cyclopentane will be
substituted for HCFC-141b blowing agent.
B. SUB-PROJECT ExEcuTIoN
5.3   The first phase of the Sub-Project is planned to be executed in 1995-1996, and the second phase
in 1997. Only the first phase contains investment cost. The most important parts of the first phase are
the procuring and putting into service of the foaming equipment, the stirrer, the tanks, and the injection
device, and the realization of the electric heating and temperature adjustment of the foaming frames. In
the second phase of the Sub-Project the implementation of the cyclopentane blowing agent will be possible
without any investment cost because the equipments installed under the first phase can be converted to
use cyclopentane. The Sub-Project also includes a training program for employees. Particular attention
will be given to ensure that the design and operation of cyclopentane storage tanks is up to international
safety standards.
5.4    Metalucon Ltd. will conduct the Sub-Project execution on its own site, while the CB and the
MERP will supervise the use of the GEF grant.

to Closed System Washing with Perchloroethylene at Fovarosi Finommechanikai Ltd.
SOLVENT SECTOR
A. SUB-PROJECT DESCRiPTION
Background
12.1  The main products of the company are razor blades, automatic electronic products (e.g., switches,
instruments), and household products. The most important products are the razor blades, since they
account for 40 percent of the production value. The company plans to produce 20 million razor blades
in the next year.
12.2  The production value of the Fovarosi Finommechanikai Ltd. was 1.25 million USD in 1993. The
company employs 120 people. A significant percentage of the production of the company is sold on the
national market.
Sub-Project Objectives
12.3  The objective of the Sub-Project is to phase out annual consumption of 1.45 tons of CFC-1 13
ozone depleting substances by switching over from an open freon system using washing to a closed
perchloroethylene system based on washing. The new perchloroethylene based washing technology will
be carried out by putting into service two renewed closed system, perchloroethylene using washers.
These washers will still have enough washing capacity to degrease the razor blades before coating and
to degrease the electric parts before installation. Before the implementation of the new cleaning
substances, proper checks will be done to decide whether the components treated by the new washing
technology meet the prescribed requirements.
B. SUB-PROJECT EXECUTION
12.4  The execution of the Sub-Project will take six months. The Sub-Project will be realized in three
phases. During the first phase, the alternative cleaning technologies and cleaning substances will be
evaluated, and experimental production will be done with the selected substances. In the second phase
of the Sub-Project, the freon-using washer will be detached, the two renewed closed system
perchloroethylene-using washers will be installed and put into service, the staff will be trained for the new
technology, and the operating parameters of the new washing technology will be set. In the third phase
the closed system perchloroethylene-based washing will be applied and the technology will be tested.
12.5  The Fovarosi Finommechanikai Ltd. will control and conduct the Sub-Project execution on its
own site, while the CB and the MERP will supervise the use of the GEF grant.

SUB-PROJECT No. 13 - Conversion to Soldering With Residue Free Fluxic Soldering Tin
to Avoid Cleaning With Freon After Soldering at the BRG Radiotechnikai Company
SOLVENT SECTOR
A. SUB-PROJECT DESCRIPTION
Background
13.1  The BRG Radiotechnikai Company produces electronic equipments for Hungarian state-owned
and private companies, and for foreign companies. Its production consists of portable electronic devices
for establishing radio connection. BRG produces 200-300 thousand parts per year, which are built into
the electronic devices. These parts have to be washed, using freon, before mounting.
13.2  The ownership of the company is 97 percent Hungarian, with the remaining 3 percent Austrian.
The company employs 400 people, and its revenue in 1993 reached 8 million USD, based on producing
about 6000 radio devices. About 70 percent of the revenue comes from export, and most of the foreign
costumers are from the former Soviet Union.
Sub-Project Objectives
13.3  The objective of the Sub-Project is to phase out annual consumption of 1.5 tons of CFC-113
ozone depleting substance through the implementation of the modem MULTICORE soldering tin, which
makes washing with freon unnecessary.
13.4   Although the composition of the flux of the modern MULTICORE-made soldering tin makes the
washing after soldering unnecessary, its application increases the soldering time, and therefore the
working time and the consumption of electric energy. For this reason BRG must employ 32 people
instead of 30 for soldering jobs, in order to avoid that the new technology decrease the output.
B. SUB-PROJECT EXECUTION
13.5  The duration of the Sub-Project is one month, and the Sub-Project is divided into three phases.
During the first phase alternative soldering substances and cleaning technologies were evaluated and trial
producing was done with the chosen substances. In the second phase the staff was trained for the new
soldering technology, the materials and the soldering iron edges needed for the new technology were
procured. The technology was modified on the basis of the quality check. In the third phase the new
soldering technology is tested in manufacturing.
13.6  The BRG Radiotechnikai Company will conduct the Sub-Project execution on its own site, while
the CB and the MERP will supervise the use of the GEF grant.
