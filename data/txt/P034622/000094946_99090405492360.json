The project is sustainable with both\n            World Bank and Borrower performances rated highly\n            satisfactory overall. The most important lessons are in the\n            areas of project design, the Public Awareness Raising\n            Campaign (PARC), and procurement. Some equipment was not\n            included in the original sub-projects and had to be procured\n            with remaining unallocated funds. Better planning could have\n            ensured these were included in their original funding\n            requests. The PARC management used a large multi-national\n            public relations (PR) company with little interest in the\n            environment. Instead the project implementation unit should\n            have involved environmental nongovernmental organizations.\n            Consultants not committed to true environmental improvements\n            are now considered an inappropriate choice for such a\n            campaign. In the future, PR firms well experienced in\n            environment together with nongovernmental organizations may\n            be used as the lead contractors. The Hungarian Refrigeration\n            and Air Conditioning Enterprises Association (HRACA)\n            complained that Bank procurement procedures did not allow\n            them to examine and test goods from different suppliers,\n            unaware that this could have been made a condition of prior\n            participation in the tender. This suggests that training of\n            sub-project enterprises themselves in procurement procedures\n            in the start-up phase is needed."}, "docdt": "1999-05-24T00:00:00Z"}
