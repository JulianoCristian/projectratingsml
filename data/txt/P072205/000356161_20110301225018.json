The team considers the\n            reallocation: 1) as a project change within the meaning of\n            OP/BP 13.05 (project supervision); 2) does not involve the\n            use of cost of project savings, specifically as per footnote\n            three to OP 13.25; and 3) does not involve any new change to\n            the original project description. Further, the team\n            considers the reallocation to be a minor one within the\n            meaning of OP/PB 13.05. Finally, the reallocation will not\n            result in significant changes to the project's\n            description, objectives, or associated outcome targets."}, "docdt": "2011-02-28T00:00:00Z"}
