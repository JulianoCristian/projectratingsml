With a reformulation of the\n            project development objectives (DO), the changes are meant\n            to: (a) clarify the DO and results that EMTA is supporting,\n            (b) modify the project performance indicators to ensure\n            alignment with results by dropping some and adding new\n            performance indicators, (c) adapt activities planned to the\n            current situation by dropping activities and adding a few\n            ones, (d) reallocate the Credit, and (e) provide an adequate\n            time frame for seeking clearly defined sustainable results\n            by extending the closing date by 24 months from December\n            31,2007 to December 31,2009. The main reasons for\n            restructuring are the following. a) Design. Project\n            preparation was accelerated after the April 2002 Peace\n            Accords to ensure Bank's support through this operation\n            would be swiftly available. At that time, the need to speed\n            up preparation led to some design issues, essentially an\n            over-ambitious project in scope with very optimistic\n            disbursements projections, a large number of activities and\n            low cost estimates; b) Implementation. The project suffered\n            from a lack of stable leadership on both the Bank's and\n            Government side. This situation led to a slowdown in the\n            first months and low initial disbursement. This initial\n            delay makes it necessary to adjust the timeline; c) Changing\n            environment. The various governmental programs meant to be\n            supported by EMTA were not implemented as scheduled; and d)\n            Demonstrated commitment and ownership."}, "docdt": "2007-05-08T00:00:00Z"}
