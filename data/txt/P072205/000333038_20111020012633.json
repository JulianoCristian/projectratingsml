 follows: outcomes were moderately unsatisfactory, risk to\n            development outcome was high, Bank performance was\n            moderately unsatisfactory, and borrower performance was also\n            modernly unsatisfactory. Some lessons learned included: EMTA\n            ownership waxed and waned over the course of the loan and\n            was especially weak at the end of the project when turnover\n            and inability to provide final output data were especially\n            problematic. The relatively slow start-up and lack of\n            disbursement might have been mitigated by preparing\n            procurement processes as part of credit preparation and\n            providing training to the project implementers. Additional\n            supervision resources are likely to be needed. There is no\n            indication this was done. The Bank and Government should\n            work to minimize team turnover. Client turnover at the\n            beginning and end of the project were problems otherwise the\n            situation was stable. Having long serving Task Managers\n            residing in country for such a difficult project/country\n            situation is highly desirable. Building relationships,\n            working through problems, maintaining close contact\n            -something that would not have been possible from outside\n            the country proved essential. Lessons Learned are important\n            and are ignored at the team's risk. A number of the\n            lessons above if taken more seriously would have benefited\n            EMTA. Operationally, investments in procurement capacity are\n            important. Preparing procurement processes prior to approval\n            can also help."}, "docdt": "2011-08-31T00:00:00Z"}
