RESTRUCTURING PAPER 
 
SUMMARY 
 
1. 
This Restructuring Paper (RP) seeks your approval for the following proposals 
under the Economic Management Technical Assistance Project (EMTA) (Credit No. 
37440-ANG): (a) reallocation of credit proceeds across the various expenditure 
categories; and (b) partial cancellation of undisbursed IDA resources under the project, 
which amounts to about XDR 1,707,826 million (US$2,650,000 million equivalent). 
These proposals are in response to the requests from the Government of Angola (GoA). 
 
2. 
The project implementing entities are i
n
full compliance with the Bank’s financial 
management requirements, and there are no overdue audit reports and interim financial 
report from these entities.  
 
PROJECT STATUS 
 
3. 
The original credit amount of XDR 12,300,000 million was approved by the 
Board on March 27, 2003, and it became effective on December 4, 2003. As of February 
14, 2011, the project has disbursed about XDR 9,671,219 million which represents about 
78 per cent of the original amount committed. The project has committed an additional 
amount of XDR 902,248 million (US$1,400,000 million equivalent), which will be 
disbursed before the project closes on February 28, 2011.  
 
4. 
The objective of the Project is to support the government effort to improve 
efficiency and transparency of public resources management, by improving the 
imitational framework and building capacity in relevant public institutions to articulate 
and implement public investment and financial policies and processes. The Project 
performance ratings in the last Implementation Status and Results (ISR) report was 
Moderately Satisfactory (MS), both in terms of probability of achieving Development 
Objectives and Implementation Progress (IP). There has been significant progress 
towards the achievement of targets set for the key performance indicators. At the 
moment, the project has achieved the targets set for 10 out of the 11 intermediate 
outcome indicators.  
 
PROPOSED CHANGES  
 
Reallocation of Credit Proceeds  
 
5. 
The GoA has requested the reallocation of the credit proceeds across the various 
expenditure categories of the project.  The letter presented to the Bank dated December 
21, 2010 asks for a reduction in the amount allocated to Category 2: Goods, Vehicles and 
Page  5
5
Equipment; Category 3: Consultant Services and Audits and Category 4: Training. The 
amount deducted from these expenditure categories, will be used to increase the 
allocation to Category 5: Operating Costs by about XDR 1,417,818 million (US$ 
2,200,000 million equivalent) 
–
see details in the table below.  The main reason for this 
final reallocation is to pay expenditures (operating cost) incurred by the National Statistic 
Institute in the preparation of the national Household Survey. 
 
6. 
The team considers the proposed reallocation: (i) as a project change within the 
meaning of OP/BP 13.05 (Project Supervision); (ii) does not involve the use of cost of 
project savings, specifically as per footnote 3 to OP 13.25; and (iii) does not involve any 
new change to the original project description. Further, the team considers the proposed 
reallocation to be a minor one within the meaning of OP/PB 13.05 (Para. 21 of the BP). 
Finally, the proposed reallocation will not result in significant changes to the Project's 
description, objectives, or associated outcome targets.
 
Cancellation of Undisbursed Balance of IDA Resources
 
7. 
In a separate letter dated February 14, 2011, the GoA also requested for the partial 
cancellation of the uncommitted balance of IDA resources allocated to the project, which 
amounts to about XDR 1,707,826 million (US$2,650,000 million equivalent). The 
borrower has requested that the cancelled funds be recommitted to a better performing 
project in the portfolio – Emergency Multi-Sector Recovery Project. However, the GoA 
has reaffirmed its commitment to improve the performance of public sector institutions 
and to continue the implementation of activities started under the project.
