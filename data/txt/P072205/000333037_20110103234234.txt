SUMMARY AND PROPOSED CHANGES
1.      The purpose of this Restructuring Paper (RP) is to seek from the Regional Vice
President's approval for a third extension of the closing date of the Angola: Economic
Management Technical Assistance (EMTA) project, Credit Number 37440- ANG, Project ID:
P072205, from December 31, 2010 to February 28, 2011. The Recipient had initially requested
an extension of another 12 months (see attached copy) but, upon consultation with the Country
Management Unit has agreed, in principle, to a shorter extension of two months so that the
project can be restructured. Under the restructuring the undisbursed funds will be canceled and
reallocated to another well performing project in the country portfolio. If this request for
extension is granted, the accumulative extensions will add up to a total of 38 months, which
includes a first extension of 24 months granted on May 28, 2007 and a second extension of 12
months granted on December 22, 2009. With this extension, the total life of the project will be 8
years.

2.     The Borrower has reaffirmed its commitment to the project activities and the willingness
to restructure the project and request the cancellation of undisbursed credit funds of
approximately US$ 4 million in order to allow the consolidation of the country portfolio, with
the understanding that cancelled undisbursed funds will be reallocated to another well
performing project in the country portfolio which will need additional financing as part of its
own restructuring. The implementing entities are in full compliance with the Bank's financial
management requirements, and there are no overdue audit reports and interim financial report
from these entities. The proposed extension is consistent with the Operation Policy (O.P) 13.30
and the Bank Procedures (B.P) 13.30 and complies with all the requirements



PROJECT STATUS
3.       The credit of SDR12.3 million (originally US$16.6 million) was approved by the Board
on March 27, 2003, and it became effective on December 4, 2003. The objective of the project is
to support the government effort to improve efficiency and transparency of public resources
management, by improving the institutional framework and building capacity in relevant public
institutions to articulate and implement public investment and financial policies and processes.
The project comprises four components, namely: (i) support the establishment of methodologies
for the preparation, execution and monitoring of sectoral and provincial plans and the public
investment program; (ii) support the implementation of the five-year plan for statistics; (iii)
support Ministry of Finance's public finance modernization program; and, (iv) support the
improvement of the Central Bank's operations and the full implementation of the country's new
payment system.

4.      The implementing entities are in full compliance with the Bank's financial management
requirements, and there are no overdue audit reports and interim financial report from these
entities. The project performance ratings in the last Implementation Status and Results report
                                               4
were Moderately Satisfactory, both in terms of probability of achieving Development Objectives
and Implementation Progress. There has been significant progress towards the achievement of
targets set for the key performance indicators. At the moment, the project has achieved the
targets set for 8 out of the 11 intermediate outcome indicators. But, implementation has suffered
some delays as a result of: (i) changes of authorities in the Angola administration; (ii) difficulties
in the selection process to appoint a new project manager; and, (iii) resignation of the project
procurement officer. All these issues have been resolved satisfactorily. Another cause of delay
was the high frequency of change of Task Team Leaders (TTLs) for the project, as three TTLs
were appointed for the project in the last 12 months.
