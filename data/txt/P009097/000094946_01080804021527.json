Among the lessons learned,\n            it is suggest that greater attention should have been paid\n            to organizational procedures, to support more efficient data\n            processing, and analysis. Given that in some instances,\n            internal barriers within the Treasury, and, between the\n            Treasury and other agencies, prevented the most efficient\n            use of the data management system (DMS), internal incentives\n            for example, might have mitigated data processing problems.\n            Similarly, although a major purpose of the project was\n            knowledge transfer, the selection of consultants for their\n            ability in this area was negligible, for regardless of\n            pre-eminent qualifications, consultants were not adequately\n            available to Treasury staff, nor effective in transferring\n            the desirable knowledge. Nevertheless, it is worth noting,\n            that the use of the best competitive software available in\n            the market, proved not only effective, but avoided delays,\n            and cost overruns; an improvement over the initial intention\n            to utilize proprietary products, tailored to the existing\n            IBM mainframe computer. Finally, the experience of the\n            project suggests that greater attention should have been\n            given to the internal promotion of the DMS, either through\n            seminars, or information dissemination."}, "docdt": "2001-06-28T00:00:00Z"}
