follows: outcomes were satisfactory, the risk to development\n            outcome was moderate, Bank performance was moderately\n            satisfactory, and Borrower performance was also moderately\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: a monitoring\n            and evaluation framework that includes outcome indicators is\n            necessary to measure results, as is an effective supervision\n            team. Ideas for possible outcome indicators could include\n            improvements in quality standards (for works), skills tests\n            (for training), drills and practical tests (for new\n            equipment and procedures). Disaster risk management is an\n            excellent basis for a national/municipal/territorial\n            development strategy. Including risk as a factor of\n            consideration in development encourages preventive and\n            mitigating action across sectors, allowing for more\n            sustainable achievements on the path to development. It also\n            allows for participatory processes developing consensus\n            toward a common future. Unlike emergency response,\n            prevention entails a change in behavior. Establishing a\n            culture of prevention therefore takes time, and requires\n            dedication and resources over multiple years and activities.\n            The project shows that a combination of analytical work\n            (risk mapping) followed by a concrete action (mitigation\n            works) is a good way to keep actors involved through a full\n            project cycle leading to tangible change in perception,\n            behavior and capacity to manage risks. Disaster risk\n            management institutions are frequently over stretched\n            between regular operations and emergencies. This means a\n            project implementation unit should have clear roles, so that\n            staff can continue to work on on-going projects independent\n            of staff tending to the emergency. This will ensure\n            continuity, and is especially important in countries with\n            highly recurrent events."}, "docdt": "2009-08-27T00:00:00Z"}
