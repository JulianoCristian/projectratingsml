There are six project components. The\n            first builds capacity within the Executive Secretariat to\n            coordinate the National System, including the overall\n            planning, coordination, and supervision of matters related\n            to disaster prevention, mitigation, preparedness, and\n            response as well as improvement of the physical plant and\n            equipment. It also aims at improving the National\n            System's operational capacity, especially its emergency\n            preparedness and response capacity. It finances consultants,\n            procedural guides and legal agreements, and emergency\n            response diagnostics. The second component develops a\n            national mitigation program and strategy that involves a\n            national policy for involuntary resettlement to reduce risk\n            from natural disasters and a revision of the national\n            building codes. The third component builds public awareness\n            of disaster prevention by updating the formal education\n            curricula, producing and disseminatng materials to the\n            public, and training journalists and communications\n            employees. The fourth component strengthens the local\n            capacity for disaster risk management. The fifth component\n            implements local vulnerability reduction measures including\n            implementing sub-projects. The sixth component finances\n            costs related to project administration."}, "docdt": "2001-03-08T00:00:00Z"}
