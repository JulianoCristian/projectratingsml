                         Implementation Status Overview
                         This is the final ISR before the project closes on 31 October 2011 and follows the recently completed final implementation support mission from 17 to 30 September, 2011. Most
                         activities under Phase 1 have been completed. The exceptions are the ongoing contract for the supply and installation of 150 orifice modules, preparation of the survey and design
                         consultancies for the first year irrigation investments and the social and environmental assessment and framework for the new proposed areas (e.g. Bundelkhand). These activities

                         will be completed during the preparation of the Phase 2 project (FY13 deliverable). A team was mobilized to start the preparation of the Implementation Completion and Results
                         Report (ICR) during the same mission to begin its data analysis and information collection efforts. This ICR is being started early to provide lessons learned to the preparation of
                         Phase 2. A project restructuring was archived on 14 October 2011, for the cancellation of a portion of the remaining credit for an amount of INR 250 million (SDR 3.2 million or US$
                         5.1 million equivalent). The cancellation was necessary to do before project closure to relinquish these funds to the India program.
