and b) initiate irrigation and\n            drainage sub-sector reforms in the state to increase and\n            stain water and agricultural productivity. The project\n            helped the state create one of the first state-level water\n            resources agencies in India, as well as a state water\n            resources regulator. Their mandate covers all water-using\n            sectors including the irrigation sub-sector. The project\n            helped provide technical assistance and support to provide a\n            legal basis for Water User Associations (WUA) and held WUA\n            elections. Recommendations of a detailed institutional study\n            on one of the oldest departments in India the Uttar Pradesh\n            Irrigation Department (UPID, with about 100,000 employees)\n            was conducted as part of the project and adopted by the\n            Government of UP. An integrated planning decision support\n            system and strategic basin environmental and social\n            assessment were conducted for the overall Ghagra-Gomti basin\n            in eastern UP to improve a more holistic consideration of\n            basin issues in planning. Computers and an enterprise\n            management system were introduced into the UPID. Irrigation\n            and drainage systems were rehabilitated in the pilot Jaunpur\n            Branch basin using modern surveys (one of the largest in the\n            country) and designs to provide a template for modernizing\n            the 12 million hectares of surface irrigated land served by UPID."}, "docdt": "2010-08-27T00:00:00Z"}
