                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Since the last formal mission in September 2010, the team has been working closely (through regular VCs and short informal visits - Nov 2010, Mar 2010) with the PACT team to

                         advance the preparation of the proposed UPWSRP Phase 2 operation. This ISR is based on the findings from the last short informal visit to Lucknow (May 16-18, 2011). During this
                         visit, the team met with the new Chairman PACT (Mr. Yadav), PS (Mr. Atoria) , the new Chief Secretary (Mr. Mishra) and PACT staff to discuss in detail the various proposed
                         components of the new operation. All agreed with the importance of reflecting the challenges (and successes) with implementation of UPWSRP in the design of the new operation.
                         In particular, the team had detailed discussions regarding the implementation arrangements for this likely multi-sector program. The status of several key preparation activities (part
                         of the Phase 1 work program), including the preparation of the survey and design consultancies for the first year irrigation investments and the social and environmental assessment
                         and framework for the new proposed areas (e.g. Bundelkhand), was also reviewed. Finally, a category-wise reallocation request was received from GoUP/DEA to increase the
                         remaining funds available for civil works and consultancies. This is to cover the remaining payments on several Phase 1 activities. The Bank is processing this request.
