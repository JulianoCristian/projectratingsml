                     RESTRUCTURING PAPER

A. SUMMARY

1. The proposed changes will support a requested cancellation of an amount of INR 250
million (SDR 3.2 million or US$ 5.1 million equivalent as of October 12, 2011) from the
Uttar Pradesh Water Sector Restructuring Project (Credit No. 3602-IN). The project will
close October 31, 2011.

B. PROJECT STATUS

2. The project is scheduled to close October 31, 2011. As of October 12, 2011, of the
IDA Credit of SDR 90.47 million, approximately SDR 76.5 million (85%) has been
disbursed (as of October 12, 2011). The key project data are:

3. The Project Development Objectives are to (i) to set up an enabling institutional and
policy framework for water sector reform in the State for integrated water resources
management; and (ii) to initiate irrigation and drainage sub-sector reforms in the State to
increase and sustain water and agricultural productivity.

4. Of the remaining project resources, several withdrawal applications are in the claims
pipeline (see table below). This includes claims that were i) earlier rejected due to
insufficient resources in the civil works category, ii) earlier deducted due to audit
disallowances, iii) rejected for other reasons and iv) claims to be submitted for the period
August 2011 to October 2011. After these claims are resolved, it is estimated that Rs.
30.96 crores will remain (about SDR 4 million). The proposed cancellation before the
project closure is necessary to relinquish these funds to the India program.
