     Sector Restructuring Project for India were as follows:\n            outcomes were moderately satisfactory; risk to development\n            outcome was moderate; Bank performance was moderately\n            satisfactory and borrower performance was also moderately\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned includes: due to the high\n            sedimentation it is not possible to operate the system at\n            full design flow, particularly during rainy weather when\n            silt loads are high, to minimize the deposition of silt in\n            the canals. Operation at full supply level will enable\n            canals and field channels with inlets at comparatively high\n            levels to receive their designed flow rate. This issue of\n            sedimentation begins at the head of the feeder canal and a\n            solution must be taken up, along with the other investments\n            if the problem is to be systemically fixed. Good linkages\n            between agriculture investments (often carried out by the\n            Department of Agriculture) and irrigation and drainage\n            investments (by UP Irrigation Department, or UPID) will\n            improve agricultural productivity. One way of improving this\n            will be to have at least one agricultural officer in each\n            Participatory irrigation management (PIM) cell in UPID\n            district offices. During the design stage it is critical to\n            get the input of farmers to understand the current system of\n            both formal and informal outlets within a minor. The\n            technical designs should be discussed by outlet committees\n            and the farmers should debate the trade-offs in order to\n            come to agreement for how the minor will be operated. This\n            will decrease the risk that illegal cuts will be made after\n            the designs are implemented, which in turn compromise the\n            ability of the system to deliver the proper allocation of\n            water to all the outlets."}, "docdt": "2012-04-23T00:00:00Z"}
