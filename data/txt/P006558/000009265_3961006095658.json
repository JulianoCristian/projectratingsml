In support for Parana's innovative efforts to\n            administer the first four years of primary school in\n            partnership with municipalities, project investments will be\n            directed to the state education system and to those\n            municipalities in partnership agreements with the state.\n            Thus, the project consists of the following five components:\n            (a) instructional materials; (b) teacher training; (c)\n            school upgrading and expansion of access; (d) institutional\n            development; and (e) project evaluation and impact studies."}, "docdt": "1994-06-08T00:00:00Z"}
