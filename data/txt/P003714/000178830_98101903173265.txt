INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RBCOI3f0EDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED DEVELOPlMENT CREDIT
TO THE REPUBLIC OF INDONESIA FOR A TELECOMMUNICATIONS EXPANSION PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
credit to the Republic of Indonesia in an amount in various currencies
equivalent to US$12.8 million for a telecommunications expansion project.
PART I - HISTORICAL
2.        In September, 1969, the Government of Indonesia asked the
Association to assist in the financing of a telecommunications develop-
ment program to improve and extend the existing telecommunications
facilities. In November/December 1969 an appraisal mission reviewed the
program in the field and identified a project suitable for Association
financing.
3.        Negotiations were held in Washington from May 5 through May 19,
1970. Representing the Government were: Brig. General Soehardjono,
Director General of Post and Telecommunications, Department of Communica-
tions; Mr. Atmono Surjo, Minister Counselor, Embassy of Indonesia; Mr.
Suhono Sumobaskoro, Head, Planning Division, Department of Communications/
National Planning Agency (BAPPENAS); Mr. Bahdar Djohan, Chief, Planning
Division, Directorate General of Posts and Telecommunications, Department
of Communications; and Mr. Rasjidi, Director of State Investment, Depart-
ment of Finance.
4.        If approved, this would be the Association's first credit to the
Telecommunications sector, and together with a proposed credit for a
Fisheries project to be considered today, would bring the number of IDA
credits to Indonesia to ten. The following is a summary of the status of
earlier credits. Disbursements are shown for credits effective as of
May 31, 1970:

5.       The status of disbursements of the various credits has been
described in my report and recommendation on the PUSRI Fertilizer Pro-
ject, dated April 30, 1970. Since that date, disbursements under Credit
No. 155 have begun, and Credit No. 165 has become effective on June 1;
the situation is othernwise the same.
PAR?T II - DESCRIPTION OF THE PROPOSED CREDIT
6.       Borrower:           Republic of Indonesia
Beneficiary:        Perusahaan Umum Telekomunikasi (PM-U-ITEL)
Purpose:            Improvement and expansion of telecommunica-
tions facilities and reorganization of
PEPLUPiTEL.
Amount:             Various currencies equivalent to USql2.8
million
Amortization:       In 50 years, including a 10-year period of
grace, through semi-annual installments of
1/2 of 1 from December 1, 1980 through
June 1, 1990 and 1-1/2O from Decermber 1, 1990
to June 1, 2020.
Service Charge:     3/1h of 1,J per annum
Relending Terms:    The Government will relend to PERUIWTEL the
proceeds of the credit at 12% interest per
annum for 20 years including a grace period
of 4 years. This relending vill be expressed
in U.S. dollars.
PER.T II - TINE PROJECT
7.        A detailed description of the project is given in the attached
appraisal report, entitled "Appraisal of the Telecommunications Expansion
Project of the Perusahaan Umum Telekomunikasi (PUTT4iTEL) - Indonesia"
(PU-39a) dated June 1, 1970.
8.        PERUI4EL, a state-tmed corporation, faces a number of problems.
The present long distance network is not reliable, is of poor transmission
quality, .nd falls far short of meeting the demand for telecommunications
services. Operating costs are high; over 50 percent of the exchanges are
manually operated and maintenance of equipment, whiclh due to a long period



of neglect in telecommunications development has become obsolete, is very
costly. Lacking an effective accounting system, little information is
available to management for informed decision making. Billings and collect-
ions are erratic and incomplete.
9.        With the help of a technical mission provided by the Australian
Government, PERIMTEL has drat'm up a five-year (1969-73) development program.
The main elements in the program are an increase of about 65,000 telephones
from 197,000 telephones now in use, extension of the long distance network
by installation of microwave links in Java and Sumatra, a troposcatter
link betwxeen Java and Kalimantan, subscriber trunk dialing (STD) switching
equipment, extension of the telex network and construction of operating,
administrative and training center buildings. Its estimated cost is
equivalent to $81.5 million, including foreign exchange expenditures of
$9 9.4 million. Financing is being sought from various sources.
10.       The project proposed for financing by the Association forms part
of the program, but does not depend on the implementation of the full pro-
gram to be viable. The project consists of (i) a trans-Sumatra microwave
system linked to that of Java. (ii) a tropospheric scatter system between
Surabaja in East Java and Bandjarmasin in Kalimantan; (iii) extensions to
the telex networks; (iv) cables to meet part of the immediate requirements
for extension oI the telephone distribution networks) (v) STD switching,
terminal and operator dialing equipment) and (vi) management consulting
services.
11.       The Island of Sumatra is rich in natural resoarces and con-
tributes 60 percent of Indonesia' total exports.    Kalimantan also con-
tributes to exports and has a vast potential for development. Reliable
long distance coimmunications through and within Sumatra and f:rom Nali-
rmiantan to DjakaIta in Java - the latter the administrative and business
center of Indonesia - are of vital im=ortance to the oconomy of the
country.
12.       The consultants (whose terms of reference are annexed to the-
a-ppraisal report) wiould examine PZlU1T2EL' s organization and operations,
and make recommendations in a number of areas, including 2IURTfl3Ts
financial position, tariff levels and structures and accdunting pro-
cecures.  In addition, three e-perts provided by the United 1aingdom under
the Colombo Plan would participate in the consultants' work and wJould help
in the implementation of their recmmendations for about two years after
the consultants' departure.
13.       The total cost of the project is estimated at US$22.6 million
equivalent, including foreign exchange expenditures of USMLh.l million of
which the Association credit-would provide US$12.8-million. Tile Govern-
ment of Australia has agreed to provide US1,.2 millionto finance the
Import of STD suitching and operator dialing equipment, and the balance
of U3'O.l iillion for survey and engineering w7ork is being provided oy
Japan.  3ridence that this supplementary finance will be made available
has been made a condition of effectiveness of the proposed credit.



14.       PER=lfTEL's financial viability is safeguarded by a rate covenant
and by a debt limitation covenant in the Development Credit Agreement.
Under the rate covenant PERUMTEL wJould undertake to charge tariffs calcula-
ted to cover operating expenses and debt service and a reasonable portion
of capital expenditure and, after 1972, to earn a minimum rate of return of
10 percent on its net fixed assets. PEREUVTEL would not incur any debt
other than tlhat incurred to finance the project unless total debt service
would be covered 1.3 times by net revenues earned.
15.       Although, as stated in paragraph 8 above, PERUNTI's service
faces a number of problems, some progress in the provision of better
facilities is being made and a microwave arterial system is being
installed, financed through bilateral aid, linking the principal cities
of Java ijith each other and wiith Den Pasar in Bali.  The microwiave and
troposcatter systems proposed under the project would extend the avail-
ability of good long distance communication to the principal cities and
towns of Sumatra and to Bandjarmasin in Kalimantan. The installation of
local distribution cables wiould remove local congestion and enable 5,000
new telephones to be connected in Djakarta. The installation of a 100
line telex exchange at IIedan and teleprinters would permit business and
market information to be speedily transmitted and exchanged in print.
The incremental rate of return on the investment in the project is
calculated to be 16.8 percent per annum.
PART IV - LEGAL 111STRUMIETS AND AUTHORITY
16.       The draft Development Credit Agreement between the Republic of
Indonesia and the Association, as wjell as the recommendation of the
Conmittee provided for in Article V, Section l(d) or the Articles of
Agreement of the Association and the text of a Resolution approving the
proposed Credit, are being distributed to the Executive Directors
separately.
17.       In addition to the standard requirements of the General Conditions,
the following conditions precedent to the effectiveness of the Development
Credit Agreement have been agreed upon: (i) the execution of the Subsidiary
Loan Agreement between the Republic of Indonesia and PERU1TEL; (ii) the
retention of management consultants by PERUIE'; (iii) the establishment
of day rates on the manual long distance and STJservices equal to the pre-
vailing "urgent" rate; and (iv) tVaeconclusion ofisatisfactory arrangements
for financing the foreign exchange requirements of the project other than
those covered by the proposed credit.



PEART V - THE ECONOIf
18.       The most recent comprehensive report on the economic position
and prospects of Indonesia (DAP-lOa) was issued on November 14, 1969,
and has since been supplemented by a special report, "Current Investment
Activity in Indonesia" (EAP-14a dated ilarch 27, 1970) which more
specifically discusses the 1969/70 development program, the role of pro-
ject aid and the inflow of private foreign investment. Basic data on the
economy are given in the Annex.
19.       The recent economic performance of Indonesia has been satisfactory.
The Government has succeeded in reducing markedly the rate of inflation
and, in the new conditions of relative stability, has made a substantial
start on programs for rehabilitation and development. Basic exchange re-
forms, which included the unification of the exchange rate except for a
special rate for program aid, iwere introduced in April 1970. Proposals by
the "Paris Club" of W4estern creditors and Japan for the settlement of
Indonesia's pre-1967 debt amounting to some $2.1 billion, were also accepted
in April. The 1970/71 development program will be larger than last year's,
and more of it will be financed from Indonesia's own resources. The effort
to expand the hitherto very low! levels of public saving and foreign and
private domestic investment has been impressive, and an increase of 36 per-
cent in domestic revenues is planned, to follow a similar expansion in
1969/70. At the meeting of the Inter-Governmental Group on Indonesia on
April 20-21, conmitments of aid for 1970/71 approached the $600 million re-
quested by the Government of Indonesia and endorsed by the IGGI at its
previous meeting.
20.       Nevertheless, the process of repairing the damage to the economy
and its institutions during the Sukarno regime is still in its early
stages. The effects on the infrastructure were particularly severe, and
substantial investments are required to restore and expand basic public
sector services. Government organizations and institutions also require
much technical and managerial assistance to reach more satisfactory levels
of efficiency. Progress in the economy as a wjhole will depend in part on
the rate at which the infrastructure can be rehabilitated and improved.
21.       If sound economic policies are maintained, administrative capacity
growns, and the necessary amount of financial resources, both foreign and
domestic, can be obtained, the rate of growth of about 5 percent per annum
implicit in the Five-Year Plan (1969-74) appears feasible. The Plan gives
highest priority to agriculture, both for domestic food production and
export crops. The main target is self-sufficiency in rice. Total rice
imports approached 900,000 tons in 1969/70, about 45 percent under
commercial arrangements and the rest in aid. Balance-of-payments con-
straints on the development program are likely to remain serious. Indo-
nesia's net foreign exchange position is still negative, and increased
overseas earnings will be required in future to service old and new debt.
In these circumstances there is a strong case for aid on concessional terms.

PLRT VI - COMPLIANCE WITH ARTICLES OF AGREEMENT
22.       I am satisfied that the proposed development credit would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART VII - RECOMMENDATION
23.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
Development Credit.
