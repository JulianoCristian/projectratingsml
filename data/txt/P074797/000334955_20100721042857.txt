F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
The Banking Sector Technical Assistance Project (TABS) was a follow-on of the
Financial Sector Deepening and Intermediation Project (FSDIP). The Project supported
completion of the restructuring measures initiated under FSDIP and complemented
broader reforms in the financial sector supported by the Bank and other development
partners. The Project aimed to strengthen the regulator of the banking system - the State
Bank of Pakistan (both in terms of its human resource skills and technological base),
enhance the role of the credit information, strengthen the national payments system and


                                                 ii
establish deterrents to financial fraud and money laundering. Broadly, project objectives
included:

  - Improving the standards and quality of human resource;
  - Modernizing and automating processes through use of technology and networking;
  - Streamlining and strengthening the national payments system for improved, safe,
  efficient and affordable delivery of financial services;
  - Strengthening and extending the scope of credit information services through
  enhanced quality and wider access;
  - Creating awareness and strengthening regulators and enforcers for prevention of
  money laundering and financial fraud;
  - Strengthening and building capacity for banking sector regulation and policy
  making; and
  - Supporting privatization of nationalized commercial banks.

                                                     reallocation from savings was
                                                     more than 5% of credit amount,
                                                     it was done through a 2nd order
                                                     restructuring.

1.      Project Context, Development Objectives and Design
(this section is descriptive, taken from other documents, e.g., PAD/ISR, not evaluative)

1.1     Context at Appraisal

1.1.1   The Government of Pakistan (GoP) initiated the first wave of reforms in the
        financial sector during the mid 1990s to address the wide spread governance
        problems of the financial sector, particularly in the state owned banking and
        development finance institutions (DFIs). This was done to replace the prevailing
        public sector system with one that is largely in private hands and which operates
        in a strong regulatory environment. The GoP pursued these reforms with the
        support of the Bank and other development partners. As part of these reforms,
        parallel initiatives were taken to make SBP more independent and strengthen its
        regulatory and supervisory capacity.

1.1.2   The first such technical assistance was provided to the SBP under the Bank
        supported Financial Sector Deepening and Intermediation Project (FSDIP) from
        1995 ­ 2002. FSDIP helped in bringing about a considerable change at SBP. It
        initiated a process of institution building that hitherto had been ignored. The
        project assisted SBP in improving its management structure; strengthening
        banking supervision through development and adoption of latest bank
        examination techniques and training; introducing technology and preparing an
        Information System Strategy for SBP's automation and establishing its linkages
        with the banking sector; and building general staff capacity through training. The
        support brought about significant changes in the methodology and quality of
        supervision. These improvements were reported in the Bank's financial sector
        update of May 2000 as well as the IMF report of Monetary and Exchange Affairs
        Department, April 2001.

1.1.3   With a change of management in January 2000, SBP initiated the second wave of
        reforms where it was split into two broad areas, (i) a core central bank to focus on
        monetary policy, supervision and regulation of the financial sector, foreign
        exchange management and payments system, and (ii) an independent subsidiary,
        the Banking Services Corporation (BSC) responsible for retail and treasury
        functions. Initiatives to improve the skill base through rightsizing, reorganization
        and further training were planned for the second phase. SBP's technological base
        was weak, impeding the information flow within and outside the organization.
        While electronic clearing services were introduced, substantial weaknesses
        existed in the system concerning both the design and availability of services and
        their geographic coverage. Weaknesses in the national payment system were a
        source of substantial systemic risk and lack of confidence in the banking system.
        In addition, regulatory weaknesses persisted, and the sector remained fragmented
        with a multitude of small and weak institutions.

1.1.4   The Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for year 2004 ­ 2006 also recognized the
        importance of a strong financial sector to support private sector development and



                                             6
        economic growth, and indicated the need for further improving the health of the
        country's financial system. The critical need to strengthen the institutional
        infrastructure of the central bank and the broader financial sector was foreseen as
        a key aspect of the deepening of the financial system, as new and more complex
        products and processes developed due to the advances in technology, service and
        intermediation capacity.

1.1.5   The Bank then prepared the Banking Sector Technical Assistance (TABS) Project
        to further assist the SBP in its second phase of institutional reform. TABS was
        undertaken in accordance with the CAS objectives for support of a safer and
        sounder financial sector, its rehabilitation and privatization, as well as continued
        assistance for strengthening the central bank.


1.2     Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as
        approved)

1.2.1   TABS, a follow on to the Bank supported FSDIP, complemented broader reforms
        in the financial sector. The key project objective was to transform the SBP into a
        professional, efficient and modern institution while focusing on further
        strengthening and improving functioning of SBP as a regulator and guardian of
        the banking system; and improving and modernizing financial infrastructure
        including the payments system, credit information, and monitoring and prevention
        of financial fraud.

1.2.2   The key performance indicators of the project included: (i) more qualified,
        competent and skilled staff at the SBP; (ii) market and performance based
        compensation, rewards and promotion of the staff; (iii) implementation of a Real
        Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) system; (iv) improved systems, accessibility and
        flow of information; (iv) comprehensive assessment and strengthening of the
        existing credit information system; (v) enhanced capacity for supervision and
        enforcement of money laundering regulations; and (vi) due diligence for Habib
        Bank privatization.

1.2.3   While some of the indicators were measured quantitatively (RTGS, human
        resource management system, information systems and Habib Bank due
        diligence), others used qualitative assessments to gauge the level of achievement.

1.3     Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key
        Indicators, and reasons/justification

        Neither the PDO nor the key indicators were revised




                                             7
1.4     Main Beneficiaries

1.4.1   The Project's main beneficiary was the SBP.

1.4.2   The Project also supported the due diligence for the privatization of Habib Bank
        Limited, which was privatized in 2004.

1.4.3   The project in addition, aimed to benefit financial institutions, consumers,
        corporate entities, and the general public by improving the regulation of financial
        markets, improving payment systems, improving the credit information systems,
        strengthening the capacities of the regulators (Securities and Exchange
        Commission of Pakistan) and enforcers (Ministry of Foreign Affairs) to prevent
        financial fraud and money laundering, and through better management of
        monetary policy.

1.5     Original Components

1.5.1   Human Resource Development (USD 1.12 million): The component supported
        initiatives in the following areas: (i) People Management; (ii) Performance
        Management; (iii) Team work & Leadership programs; (iv) Change Management;
        and (v) Acquisition of HR tools. TABS covered revision in HR policies and
        development of an HR management system (HRMIS) with the objectives of: (a)
        reviewing/re-aligning policies of recruitment, training, compensation,
        performance evaluation, promotion and separation; (b) strengthening the human
        resource base of SBP by attracting, retaining and motivating professional staff;
        and (c) carrying out a comprehensive HR audit to identify and fill the skill gaps in
        relation to the existing and emerging functional needs of SBP. Training and
        capacity building were key elements of the project.

1.5.2 Technology Up-gradation (USD 16.63 million): The component provided
      support for the following IT interventions:

        (i) Introduction of GLOBUS Banking Solution to help SBP achieve compliance
        with international banking standards, availability of reliable information, ease of
        introducing new products into the market, as well as efficiency and controls of
        banking operations, currency management, government securities, prize bonds
        management, National Savings Schemes, foreign exchange, debt management and
        treasury operations. TABS aimed to support the implementation and branch roll
        out of Globus.

        (ii) Introduction of ERP Oracle to facilitate the introduction of international
        accounting standards and a consolidated chart of accounts, integration of
        departmental functions such as financial accounting, human resources, budgeting,
        payroll, procurement, inventory and asset management.




                                             8
        (iii) Establishment of a Data Warehouse which would be the central repository of
        information that provides comprehensive and high integrity data in a form
        suitable for decision support to end-users and to the decision-makers. In
        technologically advanced environment, it has become essential that systems and
        data structures be redesigned for sustainability and scalability.

        (iv) Strengthening of Hardware and Networking: including expansion of the
        systems to 15 SBP branch offices beyond the Central Directorate and Karachi
        Office, including entire roll out of Globus, ERP/Oracle financials and networking
        of the branch offices.

        (v) Training and Change Management: This included training programs in
        networking as well as conducting similar programs during transition and before
        switch over. Business change management initiatives were also supported, so that
        SBP was fully prepared to accept the new systems and processes.

1.5.3   Strengthening and Streamlining the National Payments System (USD 5.0
        million): Prior to TABS, the financial system lacked the capacity to efficiently
        and securely process large value and other time critical funds transfers. The
        strengthening and streamlining of the national payments system infrastructure was
        also pending. TABS supported the implementation of a Real Time Gross
        Settlement (RTGS) system and its integration with Globus enabling SBP to
        provide a model 1 Delivery versus Payment (DvP) system.

1.5.4   Strengthening and Extending the Scope of Credit Information Bureau (CIB)
        (USD 0.60 million): The State Bank's CIB was established in December 1992.
        The system prior to TABS was semi automated and relied on paper based input-
        output processes. TABS supported the following:

        (i) Strengthening the existing system and extending its scope to ensure that
             optimum benefits are provided to participants, consistent with best
             international practice;
        (ii) Improving the knowledge and skills of a small group of SBP specialists; and
        (iii)Enhancing the technical platform to provide a basis for an on-line secure
             connectivity with the system users.

        A review of the international best practices for private credit bureaus and their
        functioning was also envisaged under the project.

1.5.5   Anti Money Laundering (AML) and Financial Fraud (USD 0.80 million):

        (i) The Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP) is the regulatory
        and supervisory authority for non-bank financial markets including stock market,
        Non bank financial institutions (NBFIs) and insurance. Both SBP and SECP
        initiated measures to strengthen their in-house capacity/ competencies to control
        and prevent money laundering activities. TABS provided support for the training



                                            9
        of the essential staff of SBP, SECP, Anti Money Laundering (AML) unit of
        Economic Crimes Wing (ECW) of the Federal Investigation Authority, and the
        judiciary. Enhancements in the existing computer systems for monitoring and
        record keeping were also to be supported to improve the capability of enforcing
        these new policies.

        (ii) TABS also supported the Secure Messaging System (SMS) for the Foreign
        Affairs Ministry (MoFA) for AML/Counter Terrorism. In addition to
        strengthening the AML/CFT capability of MoFA and its Strategic Exports
        Controls Division, financing was also provided through reallocation of TABS
        funds, primarily for foreign source networking and related equipment for the
        MoFA.

1.5.6   Banking Sector Capacity Building (USD 4.65 million): TABS included support
        for further work in the development of financial markets. The project assisted the
        SBP and policy makers in keeping pace with developments in global financial
        markets through participation in seminars and specialized training programs. The
        privatization of the nationalized commercial banks was supported under this.
        Additionally, TABS assisted in developing research capabilities within the SBP.

1.6     Revised Components. Other than extension of Closing Date and some
        reallocations, there were no significant changes to the Project's Original
        Components.

1.6.1    Extensions in Project Closing Date: Upon the request of SBP, the Project's
        Closing Date (PCD) of December 31, 2007, was extended twice. The first
        extension was requested by the SBP for 12 months (up to December 31, 2008)
        mainly to complete the implementation of the RTGS System. Subsequently, the
        PCD was again extended selectively, from December 31, 2008 until June 30,
        2009, due to delays in the shipment of the Disaster Recovery System. As a result
        of this extension, SBP was able to procure the Disaster Recovery System, the Hot
        Back-up for RTGS and the SMS for the MoFA for AML/Counter Terrorism. The
        Disaster Recovery System and the RTGS Hot-Back-up was completed by June
        2009. Most of the hardware and software procurement for the Secure Messaging
        System (SMS) was completed by June 30 2009; however, the new timeline for
        permanent connectivity's completion is end of year 2010. SBP has conveyed to
        the Bank team that the activities to put the system in place will continue after
        project's closing.

1.6.2   Reallocation of Credit Funds: At the SBP's request, Credit funds were
        reallocated from Category 4 (Unallocated) and Category 2 (Consultants' service)
        to Category 1 (Goods) and Category 3 (Training, workshops and study tours).
        This reallocation was largely made for the Disaster Recovery System, the Hot
        Back-up for RTGS and for the Secure Messaging Service (SMS). Since
        reallocation of savings under Category 2 was greater than 5 percent, this was done
        through a second order restructuring which was approved by the Regional Vice



                                            10
        President (RVP) on June 26, 2009. This allowed SBP to cover all costs incurred
        prior to June 30, 2009.

2.      Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1     Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry: The Bank had been
        supporting banking sector reforms in Pakistan for over a decade, prior to TABS,
        through project (FSDIP) and policy lending (Banking Sector DPL, Banking
        Sector Restructuring and Privatization ­ BSRP). The lessons of these earlier
        operations were taken into account in the design of TABS. In addition, all
        stakeholders including the SBP, MoF, commercial banks, actively participated in
        project design. Although there were delays in completion of the RTGS, the
        successful completion of the Project and a very positive impact and achievement
        of the development outcomes is a clear indication of its satisfactory "Quality at
        Entry".

2.1.1   Project preparation clearly identified risks as well as appropriate risk mitigation
        measures. The latter were generally accurately identified except for the security
        risks and the time required for installation of a complex IT architecture--both of
        which were not envisaged during preparation.

2.2     Implementation: The project implementation was affected by several external
        factors related to foreign vendors working in Karachi and significant events such
        as the terrorist incidents, which led to security situation in the country and caused
        vendors to invoke `force majeure' and leave Pakistan. SBP and the Bank project
        team had to deal with at least three such incidents during the implementation
        period resulting in significant loss in momentum and project implementation
        delays. Many innovative ideas were deployed to maintain momentum including
        project funding to relocate several SBP staff from Karachi to Johannesburg
        (South Africa), during a critical period for the project team. These extra-ordinary
        measures were responsible for ensuring that ERP, Banking and Data Warehouse
        components were largely completed within project timeline.

2.2.1   Implementation was also affected by SBP's internal processes. At project
        appraisal, it was envisaged that the RTGS system would be contracted out by the
        end of 2003. The original bid validity of 21st April, 2003 was extended till
        January 15, 2004 due to delays in bid evaluation. Eventually, the contract with the
        firm `CMA Small System A Sweden', was signed in November 2004 with the
        effective date of February 2005. The time delay between the RTGS project
        initiation and implementation was largely due to complex business and pre-
        requisite infrastructure requirements for the Globus and RTGS interface. Another
        reason for delay was the unfamiliarity of the SBP management with the new
        systems. Despite the visits of SBP's senior managers to a number of other
        countries for studying their RTGS systems, the process took longer than
        anticipated.




                                             11
2.2.2   The overall RTGS implementation had several aspects of legislative framework,
        integration with other systems, setups of telecommunication networks, and overall
        reengineering in the funds and securities settlements. It also required maintaining
        a robust support system for about 40 financial institutions. Managing multiple
        local and international vendors to achieve overall project integration was a huge
        challenge as well. Timely availability of experienced resources required for the
        execution of the project, both in the SBP and with vendors, proved to be a big
        impediment.

2.2.3   Negotiations for signing the contract with M/S Temenos also took long and the
        contract was signed in May 2007 as against the initially envisaged date of end
        2003. The delay was primarily caused due to contractor's disagreement with
        certain contractual terms. Tax matters were yet another aspect that required
        lengthy dialogue until resolution.


2.3     Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

        The Project's M&E systems were well designed and implemented, and the SBP
        and the Bank were effectively able to track project implementation and results.
        The Bank team conducted Implementation Support missions periodically during
        the life of project and key implementation issues and progress were recorded in
        the Implementation Status Reports.

2.4     Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance.

2.4.1   There was full compliance with applicable Safeguard and Fiduciary Policies.
        Only the Safeguard Policy; `Environmental Assessment' (OP 4.01, BP 4.01, GP
        4.01) was applicable, and it was determined that the Project did not have any
        direct adverse environmental impact.

2.4.2   Procurement and Financial Management: As of June 29, 2009, all
        procurements had been completed and there were no major issues pending. A
        review of the financial management arrangements during the Implementation
        Support missions provided reasonable assurance that the Credit proceeds were
        being used for the intended purposes. The quarterly financial monitoring reports
        were received on time and found to be in order. Audited financial statements of
        the project and entity were received and accepted by the Bank.

2.5     Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

2.5.1   The project was completed on June 30, 2009. In spite of delays in project
        implementation, almost all the project components have been successfully
        implemented. Full completion of only one activity will take place beyond the
        Project Closing Date, which is the full installation and integration of SMS
        software and hardware for AML. This should be done latest by December 2010
        with support from the SBP.


                                            12
2.5.2    Meanwhile, SBP is keenly interested to leverage the existing IT platform by going
         for a second wave of IT business applications that will realize and capture
         additional business benefits. Almost 93 new requests received from SBP business
         departments and external financial institutions, are being considered internally by
         SBP for financing.
2.5.3    The SBP management has also recently expressed its desire to seek further
         assistance from the Bank to initiate a follow-on TABS ­ 2 Project, to further
         enhance the payments system, IT platform and capacity building of SBP officials
         in key areas.


3.       Assessment of Outcomes

3.1      Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

         The Project's Original Objectives remained relevant throughout the course of the
         project, and remain relevant today. Considering the rapidly changing
         technological architecture of the banking system, globally and domestically, the
         Project's interventions were very timely and appropriate. In addition, given the
         critical importance of a sound, stable and competitive banking system to
         supporting economic growth--which was one of the fundamental pillars of
         Bank's 2004 ­ 2009 CAS for Pakistan--the Project has played an important role
         in this regard.

3.2      Achievement of Project Development Objectives

3.2.1    All the PDOs have either been fully or largely achieved. The independent
         feedback of various stakeholders including the financial sector (commercial
         banks) about project achievements and progress on PDOs demonstrate the
         positive impact of the project on SBP and the overall financial sector. While SBP
         and banking sector institutional reforms have been underway, since the initiation
         of the FSDIP project, there has been a marked improvement in the functioning of
         the SBP and the banking system as a result of the TABS Project. Specifically:

         SBP's HR Policies have been transformed from the old governmental HR system,
         where salaries were linked to government pay scales; recruitment was only at
         entry grade; and promotions were seniority based, to a more flexible,
         professional and dynamic HR system wherein salaries are now linked to market
         salaries, promotions are performance driven and mid-level managers are recruited
         from the market. SBP now functions as an autonomous and best practice central
         bank, compared to working like a bureaucratic government department a decade
         back.
         SBP is now a fully IT based organization, compared to being a mostly manual
         based institution prior to the project. As a result, information for monetary, fiscal
         and exchange rate management is now available in real time; weekly and
         quarterly reports are prepared with a lag of a few days; and communication both


                                              13
        internal and with the banking system is now mostly electronic rather than paper-
        based as in the past.
        Key stakeholders, banks and MoF, are unanimous in their views that the quality
        of SBP's banking supervision has undergone a sea change, in terms of focus,
        coverage, quality of analysis, and timeliness. Supervisory reports are now
        considered best practice. As a result of improvements in the banking supervision
        and prudential regulations, the banking system is more diligent, as clearly
        highlighted in the 2010 Financial Sector Assessment (FSA) conducted by the
        Bank. The SBP, due to its strengthened capacity, was able to successfully manage
        the liquidity crises that hit the banking sector in the last quarter of 2008.
        The banks and MoF are unanimous in their views that SBP has undergone a
        transformation in its conduct of monetary policy.
        Credit information sharing among the banks has also been significantly upgraded,
        as a result of TABS support for e-CIB initiatives and strengthening of the existing
        CIB.
        AML laws, policies and institutional capacities have been significantly
        strengthened through the establishment of SMS, a Financial Monitoring Unit,
        enactment of the AML Law, and training of staff from the MoFA. These
        capabilities were non-existent prior to TABS. The procurement of hardware and
        software has been completed by the MoFA, however, its integration and
        implementation will happen at the end of year 2010 with assistance of the SBP.
        Central banks of other countries in the South Asia Region have already received
        technical assistance from the SBP during the year 2009. SBP officials visited
        Nepal to train the Nepal Rastra Bank officials in Stress Testing methodologies,
        and Bangladesh Central Bank officials visited the SBP in Karachi to study its
        systems for banking surveillance and supervision.

        Technology Up-gradation         and      Development    of   Payments      System
        (Substantially Achieved)

3.2.2   Computerization and automation of the entire business of SBP and its field offices
        is a major step towards modernization. SBP is now adding newer applications and
        functionalities that leverage the existing IT platform. A Disaster Recovery System
        (DRR) has also been installed to protect against loss of data and to ensure
        business continuity. SBP will be taking over the full cost of maintenance and
        upgrading of the entire IT platform after project closing.

3.2.3   The infrastructure development on modern lines such as the Globus, RTGS, e-
        CIB, and communication system have contributed significantly towards
        institutional modernization of SBP. With the establishment of the RTGS, inter-
        bank gross settlements are now automated and taking place in real time, compared
        to manual systems that existed prior to TABS. This has greatly reduced the
        systemic risks. The System is clearing up to 1,200 transactions daily, for a
        maximum value of Rs. 800 billion and a daily average of Rs 200 ­ 250 billion,


                                            14
        covering almost the entire banking system. Tameer Bank, a leading microfinance
        bank, is now also a member of the RTGS and is availing the online facility. The
        integration of RTGS and Globus has enabled SBP to provide a model 1 DvP
        capability for secondary market trading in government securities, and centralized
        settlement of retail clearing. By virtue of this integration, the SBP can provide a
        repo based intra-day liquidity to RTGS participants. Consequently, TABS has
        developed a robust and secure inter-bank money market, while enabling banks to
        better manage their liquidity position, and settlement of payments in real time.

        Human Resource Development (Satisfactorily Achieved)

3.2.4   Under the TABS, SBP has improved its recruitment, compensation rewards policy
        and systems, by bringing them in line with the market standards. In addition,
        training has been introduced as a key pillar for professional development and
        growth. As a result, SBP is now a more professional institution compared to what
        it was before the beginning of the Project. The HR policies include: market based
        compensation; merit based promotions; lateral induction at middle and senior
        levels (Deputy Governor and Executive Directors being hired from market) and in
        specialized departments (Housing, etc.); and a structured training program for all
        level of officers.

3.2.5   Fifty seven percent of the officers working in SBP fall in the age bracket of 40
        and below, as compared to thirty percent in 2004. The induction and training of
        new, younger staff has created performance based culture in all the important
        areas of the organization. About ten percent of the officers in monetary and
        research cluster are PhDs, as compared to only three percent PhDs in 2004.
        Similarly, During the last 5 years, SBP professionals with relevant qualifications
        and skills have been inducted in different specialized areas like Housing Finance,
        IT, HR, Research, Treasury, Economics, Banking etc.

3.2.6   Under HR development, TABS supported the following two types of training for
        SBP staff: (i) short term management development program under which over
        1,280 staff were trained; and (ii) specialized foreign training, under which 384
        staff were trained in all the core areas of responsibilities of SBP. The National
        Institute of Banking and Finance (NIBAF) is also strengthened to provide training
        to domestic and foreign central banking professionals.

3.2.7   There has been a strong positive impact of new HR policy on staff performance,
        efficiency and turnover, as a result of the following:
        For salary survey purposes, a list of benchmark institutions has been indentified
        for SBP. The first salary survey was conducted in year 2007. Based on the
        findings of the survey, new Compensation and Benefits Structure was introduced
        under which the progressive retirement benefits in the shape of defined
        contributions were launched.




                                            15
        Through the second Compensation and Benefits survey conducted in year 2009,
        the Total Remuneration approach has been adopted, as the basis for benchmarking
        with comparator institutions.
        The results of the surveys have been used to introduce market aligned benefits for
        SBP employees.
        Retention has improved as a consequence of improved HR polices, with turnover
        showing a declining trend.
         2006                    2007                  2008           2009
         7.31%                   8.36%                 5.37%          2.5%

        SBP has also been conducting employee motivation/engagement surveys through
        an external consultant to obtain feedback on the HR policies. The first survey was
        done in 2003, with subsequent surveys in 2004, 2005 and in 2009. The results of
        the surveys provided an input in formulating the HR strategy of various
        departments.

        Capacity Building and Institutional Strengthening (Fully Achieved)

3.2.8   Under TABS, SBP has strengthened its managerial and professional capacity.
        SBP also significantly delegated decision making powers to avoid delayed
        process of approvals and paper based activities. With the view to create efficiency,
        and strengthen SBP's co-ordination with government departments and ministries,
        restructuring of SBP was carried out in September 2006, and the following new
        departments have been created.
        Exchange & Debt Management Department
        Payment Systems Department
        Consumer Protection Department
        Risk Management and Compliance Department

3.2.9   Additionally, the following four thematic clusters were formed within SBP to
        improve reporting lines:
        Banking Cluster
        Monetary Policy and Research Cluster
        Financial Markets and Reserve Management Cluster
        Corporate Cluster

        Drafting and Enactment of New Laws (Fully Achieved)

3.2.10 As part of TABS, several laws were drafted, and their status is as follows:

        The Payment Systems and Electronic Fund Transfers Act 2007, has been enacted
        and is in operation.




                                            16
        The Anti-Money Laundering and Combating Terrorism Financing Bill 2009 has
        been approved by the parliament (National Assembly and the Senate). The new
        law with amendments incorporates FATF 40+9 recommendations.
        Deposit Protection law has been drafted, finalized and sent to Ministry of Finance
        for submission to the parliament.
        Amendments in Banking Companies Ordinance (BCO) have been passed by the
        National Assembly and are now with the Senate.
        The amendments to the SBP Act have been presented to the National Assembly.
        Consumer Protection law has been prepared and is being reviewed by the Law
        Division.
        Draft Credit Bureau Act has been approved `in principle' by the Cabinet and
        expected to be presented to the parliament once it has been reviewed by the Law
        Division.


3.2.11 Other Impacts of the TABS: The Automation of the Central bank has had a
       ripple effect on the financial sector with major banks and financial companies
       embarking on their own automation projects, partly to integrate and interface
       better with SBP systems. This has spurred productivity and improved business
       agility, controls and information availability in the banking sector at large.

3.2.12 Another spin-off effect has been the growth of local IT industry and the presence
       of global IT vendors in Pakistan. SBP automation project was considered to be the
       largest IT investment in the financial sector and has spurred growth of related IT
       vendors and IT skills. Automated systems like accounting entries, data
       consolidation, standardized automated reporting are some of the visible benefits
       of the Project. The SBP management believes that there has been a very positive
       impact on staff productivity and efficiency, and that automation of data
       collection, reporting and analysis functions has enabled staff to focus more on
       core functional areas

3.3 Efficiency

3.3.1   The Economic Rate of Return (ERR) or Internal Rate of Return (IRR) is not
        calculated as this is a technical assistance project. Nevertheless, strengthening of
        the SBP and enhancing the national payments system and credit information
        services in the country, have had a significant positive impact on financial sector
        stability and general business environment. The independent feedback received
        from the financial sector institutions has confirmed these developments and their
        positive impact on the industry.

3.3.2   Some notable improvements in SBP's performance over these years are also
        reflected in the series of the Financial Sector Assessments Program (FSAP) and
        FSA conducted by the Bank and IMF in 2004, 2008 and 2010. For instance, the
        2004 FSAP noted that revising key financial sector legislation including the SBP


                                            17
        Act and Banking Companies Act (BCO) in accordance with sound international
        standards were needed to avoid the SBP relapsing into past practices and
        unwarranted government interference. Under the TABS, the SBP reviewed these
        laws, and the amendments to BCO and SBP Act are now in the Parliament for
        approval. It is expected that these revisions will make the existing laws more
        conducive to the changing global economic and regulatory environment, and will
        further strengthen SBP's authority in managing and preventing a crisis.

3.3.3   The FSAP 2004 and 2008 also emphasized the need to introduce RTGS to
        increase efficiency and counter systemic risks. The recent FSA 2010 notes that
        SBP has made considerable progress to increase the safety and efficiency of the
        payments by successfully deploying the RTGS. The deployment of RTGS has not
        only reduced the transaction costs, but more importantly it has allowed the banks
        to manage their intra-day liquidity in a much more efficient manner, thereby
        improving deployment and returns, both for the industry and the banking sector.
        During the last quarter of 2008 when there was a tight liquidity situation, the SBP
        team used the RTGS system very effectively by closely monitoring the daily
        liquidity positions of the banks and taking prompt actions.

3.3.4   Investments in technology and human resource through TABS has resulted in
        much improved functioning of the Central Bank that has had its impact on
        performance of the financial sector despite the global financial crises and tough
        economic conditions in the country. Although these gains are hard to quantify but
        the results of the financial industry indicate that the country weathered these
        crises well and none of the institutions failed although the sector did witness a
        liquidity crunch towards late 2008. Through the support provided by TABS, the
        national payments system has been strengthened and streamlined, thereby
        reducing systemic risks, enabling efficient use of the available money stock,
        improved confidence in the banking system, and development of new financial
        services. SBP has also put in place a liquidity facility which is available to small
        banks without the usual collateral. This has been done to prevent a liquidity
        crunch similar to the one that took place in year 2008. The off-site Supervision
        and Enforcement department monitors system liquidity on a regular basis through
        weekly reporting from the banks. This has been made possible by the extensive
        investments in IT under the TABS.

3.3.5   Similarly, e-CIB services have considerably increased the efficiency and
        soundness of credit decisions which were expanded to cover all consumers in
        addition to the corporate sector. Expansion of these services has also curtailed
        frauds as well as defaults in the market.

3.3.6   The SBP has also reduced the group credit exposure limit in a phased manner and
        by the end of year 2013, this will be brought down to 25% from 45% in year 2009.
        The changes have already been reflected in the Prudential Regulations for the
        commercial banks




                                            18
3.3.7   SBP has also since 2008, started to announce and implement the monetary policy,
        consistent with its objectives of macroeconomic stability and low inflation.


3.4     Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

3.4.1   Rating: Satisfactory. These ratings are fully justified in light of the satisfactory
        completion of all key project components, beneficial impact on SBP, the positive
        assessment by the commercial banks of Project's results on the banking system,
        and validation of these by the ICR mission conducted in May 2010.


3.5     Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

3.5.1   An indirect impact on poverty is envisaged through improved capacity of the SBP
        for consumer protection and the establishment of consumer protection department.

3.5.2   An expected positive impact on expansion of financial services and an indirect
        impact on poverty reduction through financial inclusion by way of introduction of
        new regulations/ guidelines for Microfinance Banks and Branchless Banking. The
        enhanced capacity of SBP's officials due to TABS has enabled the institution to
        draft and introduce Mobile Banking Regulations, that have already enabled the
        telecom services provider, Telenor, and Tameer Bank to launch `Easy Paisa' that
        facilitates domestic remittances even in remote areas of the country.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

3.5.3   TABS provided significant support to SBP for modernizing its IT systems and
        imparting the desired training to the staff. The project has managed to bring about
        a change in the institution's procedures around credit information, clearance of
        cheques, and provision of up-to-date monetary data and information. There has
        been noteworthy change in the HR policies as SBP has managed to attract
        experienced professionals from the market and the turnover has also reduced
        significantly. The quality of SBP publications (quarterly reviews, annual reviews,
        etc) have also improved significantly.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

        None

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

3.6.1   The Bank provided SBP with a detailed questionnaire for assessment, by SBP
        senior management, of the Project's impact on SBP. According to SBP's own
        assessment:

        The project has had a positive impact on SBP's professional capacity to supervise
        banks and undertake monetary policy. SBP believes that due to institution's
        autonomous status, all internal policies, procedures and operations of SBP are
        now more independent of outside interference. The general superintendence and
        direction of the affairs and business of SBP now fully vests in the SBP's Board.
        With financial and operational independence, internal management of SBP is
        based on the principle of autonomy and accountability.

        The SBP now formulates its monetary policy more independently taking into
        account its own analysis and professional judgment. The Project helped SBP
        enhance its skills levels through qualitative and quantitative up-gradation of its
        staff's capabilities.

        In respect of banking supervision, banking policies, operations and development
        of new products, SBP has gone through a major transformation. One specific
        problem area, i.e. quality of lending by the banks, was previously more vulnerable
        to outside interference, as a result of which banks had accumulated massive non-
        performing loans (NPLs). This area is now under close oversight and scrutiny by
        the SBP, due to improved quality of supervisory staff. Consequently, ratio of
        NPLs had come down over the last few years; however owing to the recent global
        financial crisis and domestic economic slowdown, some banks have witnessed an
        increase in the NPLs in the last one year.

3.6.2   Feedback of the Banking Sector The Bank team also provided a questionnaire to
        a large number of local and foreign banks operating within the country to obtain
        their feedback on the outcomes of the TABS project, especially with regards to
        SBP's role as a regulator, and in conducting monetary policy. An interesting mix
        of responses was received from 10 banks, accounting for 25% of the banking
        system:

        Almost all banks unanimously responded very positively in respect of SBP's
        performance in regards to conducting the monetary policy. All banks indicated
        that there is:
        (i)     A qualitative positive change in monetary policy management by SBP. In
                addition to regular periodic revision of the monetary policy, SBP now



                                            20
                actively resorts to monetary policy revisions to address macroeconomic
                indicators requiring immediate attention;
        (ii)    SBP has taken swift action, during the recent past, against the increasing
                inflationary pressures through monetary tightening; and
        (iii)   The prudent monetary control by SBP has been evident from a gradual
                stability in inflation, economic growth and liquidity management.

        The banks also noted considerable improvements in SBP's banking regulatory
        and supervisory capacity. The depth of the annual review conducted by the SBP
        team each year has increased, as the coverage of the review now encompasses:

        (i)     The compliance with the SBP regulations by the banks in their regular
                credit and investment operations; and
        (ii)    Key aspects such as governance of the institutions, business plan/strategy,
                human resource management, customer service quality, etc.


        Similarly, most of the respondents were appreciative of automation efforts such as
        RTGS, Globus, NIFT and e-CIB. While all banks have noted the very positive
        impact of the RTGS, some banks have expressed concern that the turnaround time
        for clearing cheques is still three days.

        Various banks have recommended the incorporation of `group based reporting' in
        e-CIB reports so that banks receive information on entire group in one e-CIB
        report. There are still demands on the CIB to provide information on corporate
        loans overdue under 90 days, which is not available in the current e-CIB system.

        The banks also recommended reforms in the regulations (such as SME Prudential
        Regulations), to ensure better penetration of financial services through technology
        driven innovation. Similarly some small banks have suggested expansion of
        SBP's regulations, so that `muqaddams' and service providers of security, custody,
        credit reports/industry checks can also be included in the framework. Suggestions
        have come in for tailored supervision in the areas of mobile and paperless banking.

        There is a widely held view that integration of the entire banking system is vital
        for supporting a strong anti money laundering regime in the sector.

        A matrix of comments received from the banking sector is enclosed at the end of
        the ICR.

4.      Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

        Rating: This has been rated as Moderate, taking into account the impact to-date
        on the ground, the strengthening of SBP's professional capacity and the very
        encouraging autonomy and independence it is exhibiting in banking supervision
        and conduct of monetary policy and. The team believes that there is only a


                                            21
        moderate risk that the positive impact on Development Outcomes could be
        undermined in future.


5.      Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
        (Relating to design, implementation and outcome issues)

5.1     Bank Performance

        The Bank overall performance rests on the performance achieved in ensuring
        quality at entry and quality of supervision

(a)Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

        Rating: Satisfactory.

5.1.1   The Bank provided the TA to SBP as a continuation of its support to financial
        sector reforms. The MoF and SBP were fully committed to these reforms and
        requested Bank support in this regard. The Bank's CAS put a special emphasis on
        strengthening and deepening the financial sector in Pakistan. The Bank team
        remained fully engaged with the Government through policy dialogue and
        technical assistance.

5.1.2   The above notwithstanding, one area that could have been improved during
        preparation is the realism of the complex IT processes, architecture and capacity
        that was required to implement the RTGS system. This may have reduced the
        delays that were encountered subsequently during the implementation.

(b) Quality of Supervision

        Rating: Satisfactory.

5.1.3   This rating is fully justified taking into account the generally satisfactory
        implementation of the Project, and the Bank's pro-active support to SBP in
        overcoming challenges faced during implementation--especially dealing with
        timely extension of project closing dates to address the delays caused by external
        factors.

5.1.4   The Bank's task team comprised lead technical specialists, both national and
        international, who contributed significantly through country and sector specific
        knowledge. The international expertise on IT was much needed and was made
        available to the SBP as and when needed. Similarly, technical assistance was
        provided by legal experts on the draft laws, such as the BCO amendments, SBP
        Act, Credit Bureau Act, Payments System Act and the Banking Act.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
        Rating: Satisfactory.

5.1.5   Overall, the Bank performance has been satisfactory. Throughout the preparation
        and implementation of the project, the Bank team remained fully engaged with
        the SBP and responded effectively to emerging issues. Continuity of key IT and
        HR experts throughout project implementation contributed to providing timely
        advice on policy and implementation issues. The Bank team proactively followed
        through outstanding issues and actions and regularly documented the same in the
        supervision mission aide-memoires.


5.2    Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance

        Rating: Satisfactory.

        This rating reflects MoF's strong support for the Project objectives, as well as full
        support to SBP in implementing the TABS.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

        Rating: Satisfactory

5.2.1   Although the Project implementation was delayed by 2 years, SBP's performance
        is being rated as Satisfactory in the light of results on the ground and the very
        positive assessment of the financial sector on the impact of TABS on SBP and the
        banking system. For the most part, the delay in implementation was due to (i) the
        complexity of IT procurement which stretched SBP's IT procurement capacity
        and (ii) unforeseen contractual issues due to the deteriorating security situation.
        Both these situations were not envisaged, either by the Bank team or the SBP's
        team.

5.2.2   The SBP top management showed high level of commitment to project objectives
        and activities. A strong project management team was put in place throughout the
        implementation to oversee the critical IT investments. Senior SBP management
        including the Deputy Governor and the Executive Directors for HR, Banking
        Policy and Supervision Department regularly reviewed the progress on ground.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

        Rating: Satisfactory

5.2.3   Overall, the Borrower's performance is rated Satisfactory. It is evaluated in terms
        of the high level of commitment of the both the MoF and SBP during project




                                             23
      preparation and implementation; strong and regular oversight by SBP
      management; and presence of strong project management team.


6.    Lessons Learned

6.1   Overall, the Project can be classified as a `success story', in bringing about
      technological transformation of the central bank and strengthening its professional
      capacity. The following are the key lessons that emerge from the implementation
      experience of the Project:

6.2   The first, and perhaps the most important, lesson is the critical importance of
      committed and reform minded senior management team, and capable project
      team, for implementing and sustaining deep institutional reforms, especially
      technologically and institutionally complex reforms in an institution, which
      historically worked like a rigid and bureaucratic government department. Prior to
      TABS, promotions were seniority based and all mid and senior level
      appointments were from within SBP. Bringing about a paradigm shift in the
      culture of a public sector organization, especially in the socio-political setting
      where politicization is deep and incremental changes are the norm, could not have
      happened without the commitment of senior management. Hence, for the Bank, it
      is essential that before it approves an institutional reform project, it should ensure
      that the organization's management is fully committed to reform, has support of
      senior policy makers, and there is enough assurance that the management team
      will be in place for the full duration of the project. Without this 'success
      ingredient', institutional reform initiatives are unlikely to succeed.

6.3   A second important lesson relates to implementation of large scale 'state of the art'
      IT programs in a public sector setting, with limited initial in-house IT knowledge
      or capacity. Globally, there are more cases of failure than successes. The
      experience under the TABS was very challenging for both the Bank and the SBP
      teams. Some of the critical success factors include: (i) senior management
      commitment to the program, and to supporting change management and
      perception management, given the cultural change that takes place when moving
      from a manual based institution to an IT based institution (ii) sound project
      planning, with clearly defined realistic timelines , taking into account SBP's
      available capacity and past experience, (iii) up-front training of SBP staff (v)
      strengthening of SBP's procurement policies and capacity, to enable it to handle
      complex IT procurement (vi) re-engineering of the business process that were part
      and parcel of the automation initiative.

6.4   The Bank team believes that delays in completion of project activities could have
      been avoided if there was greater realism built into assessing the implementing
      agency (IA) capacity for handling complex transactions especially those involving
      IT and automation. In the case of TABS, perhaps there could have been greater
      capacity building efforts for the SBP's IT team, particularly for the component on



                                           24
      RTGS and Globus interface. Ideally, the training should have been imparted prior
      to the procurement of IT systems and equipment

6.5   The final lesson relates to ex-ante assessment of the likelihood of
      reforms bringing about the expected level of improvement in the institution's
      performance. The critical issue is to rigorously examine whether the IA has the
      necessary legal and administrative autonomy and 'space', so that the reformed IA
      and its better trained staff fully deliver on the institution's key mandates. While
      better qualified staff, market linked salaries and merit based promotions are
      necessary, they are not sufficient in themselves to ensure institutional
      performance.

6.6   Clearly SBP's performance in conduct of monetary policy has been very good in
      the last 24 months. The broader banking sector reforms, which were implemented
      during 1997 ­ 2006 (and to some extent TABS), could have focused more on
      additional measures to strengthen SBP's autonomy enabling SBP to take bolder
      steps, such as on interest rate, exchange rate, SBP's financing of deficits, and on
      managing external imbalances resulting from loose fiscal policy.


7.    Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners

(a) Borrower/implementing agencies

7.1   The Borrower, SBP, has prepared its own completion report which is attached in
      the last section of the ICR. In addition, various departments of the SBP provided
      comments on the draft ICR, most of which have been incorporated in the report.
      The SBP's own evaluation confirms the ICR assessments and rates the project as
      a successful intervention.

7.2   The draft report was also shared with the MoFA and SECP. Their comments are
      summarized in Annex 8. Both the MoFA and SECP have raised their concerns
      over delays encountered in the implementation of their activities under TABS
      (related to AML training and procurements), as well as reallocation of funds by
      the SBP without prior consultations. Both entities have suggested that in the
      future, funding should be provided directly to the respective agencies rather than
      through a centralized special account maintained by the primary borrower.

(b) Cofinanciers
       None

(c) Other partners and stakeholders

7.3   The Bank team conducted an independent survey of the banking sector to capture
      their feedback on the impacts of TABS on the banking sector. The feedback from
      various banks is summarized in a matrix attached at the end of the ICR.

Output Targets:
(i)     Provision of specialized training in "soft skills'    -   Bringing in trainers from abroad was problematic due to
        areas, particularly management of change and              security conditions being unfavorable.

(ii)    Appointment of well-regarded senior level trainers        to other components including RTGS and `Beneficiary
        from abroad to bring in new ideas to supplement           Survey' has been problematic owing to SBP's internal
        internal programs and courses offered within              procurement policies and procedural delays.
        Pakistan; (iii) taking part in international seminars
        and conferences;
(iii)   Hiring consultants/ advisers to support training
        needs, IT and HR functions;
(iv)    Conducting studies for development of financial
        markets and services including a comprehensive
        diagnostic study on Habib Bank Limited; and
(v)     Building capacity at the Ministry of Finance
        (banking wing) for strategy and policy making to
        keep abreast of developments in the sector.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis
(Including assumptions in the analysis)

A 3.1 As noted in the PAD, there is no economic evaluation methodology for the
technical assistance projects. However, as envisaged during the project design, the
strengthening of SBP, enhancing the national payment systems and credit information
services in the country has had a positive impact on financial sector stability, general
business environment and economic development. This is evident from the responses
received by the Bank, from the financial institutions across the country. A matrix
containing these responses is attached with the ICR.

A 3.2 Investments in technology and human resource through TABS has resulted in
much improved functioning of the Central Bank that has had its impact on performance
of the financial sector despite the global financial crises and tough economic conditions
in the country. Although these gains are hard to quantify, but the results of the financial
industry indicate that the country weathered these crises well and none of the institutions
failed, although the sector did witness a liquidity crunch towards late 2008. Through the
support provided by TABS, the National Payments System has been strengthened and
streamlined, thereby reducing risks, enabling efficient use of the available money stock,
improved confidence in the banking system, and development of new financial services.
Additionally, strengthening the quality and extending the coverage of CIB through the
electronic platform has facilitated better allocation of credit in the economy, improved
borrower discipline, and reduction in frauds and defaults. This is also captured in the
attached matrix of comments received from the financial institutions.

A.3.3 Regulatory improvements, encouragement of modern banking practices, and the
use of technology opened doors for expansion of financial services. Although it is still
early but the use of electronic modes of payments is on the rise and is helping outreach of
financial services.

A 7.1 Summary of SBP Comments on Draft ICR/ SBP's Evaluation Report

SBP's own Evaluation Report is attached with this ICR at the end. In addition, the draft
ICR prepared by the Bank team was shared with SBP, and comments of SBP were
conveyed to the Bank via email. The comments and feedback mostly pertain to the IT
component of TABS project.

SBP's Evaluation Report provides a detailed assessment of the milestones achieved under
TABS and how these have transformed the SBP into a modern and efficient regulator of
the banking sector. The evaluation report notes the considerable improvement in
technical expertise of the SBP staff since 2002. SBP now has a much deeper
understanding of the financial markets, and is significantly better equipped to deal with
the issues of banking sector. SBP's operational staff appreciates the importance of
effective maintenance, support and service level agreements as these were given high
priority during the project. The project suffered substantial delays due to security
situation, as foreign consultants could not travel in time to deliver their services.
Accordingly, new methods of project execution like formation of virtual teams, use of
internet connectivity etc. were explored and adopted where required.

Above all, SBP is now being witnessed by all stakeholders as more efficient, modern,
professional and equipped with latest technology.


A 7.2 Summary of Comments Received from MoFA and SECP

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MoFA) and Securities & Exchange Commission of
Pakistan (SECP) shared their comments with the Bank which are summarized below:

MoFA:
The AML/Counter Terrorism project for the MoFA, based on the concept of a wider
range of secure communications capability was a new initiative. The MoFA had
previously not participated in any such Bank funded project.

The contribution of the project has been strengthening of the AML/CT capability of both
the MoFA and its Strategic Export Controls Division (SECDIV) in terms of secure
communications, data storage and retrieval. The reallocated amount under TABS,
intended for consultancy services and training purposes could not be utilized fully as the
reallocation was done at the end of year 2008, leaving little time for the planning and
commencement of these activities.

While all the permitted hardware and software procurement for the MoFA part of the
project was completed, its integration and implementation is expected to take place at the
end of 2010 when the New High Security Block of the MoFA, adjacent to the existing
block is completed.



                                           35
The SBP has assured to assist the MoFA in system integration and in any further
assistance required for the MoFA through a TABS ­ 2 project.

SECP:
SECP's share under the project component `Anti Money Laundering (AML) and
Financial Fraud' was USD 0.35 million. SECP could only utilize USD 0.2 million and
the remaining unutilized amount of USD 0.15 million was reallocated by SBP without
prior consultations with the SECP. SECP feels that future allocations to the entity should
be direct as the involvement of a third party causes procedural delays.

On its role in preventing Money Laundering (ML) and Terrorist Financing (TF) activities,
SECP informed the ICR mission that in year 2009, it issued circulars for conduct of
business by NBFCs and Modarabas thereby safeguarding them against AML/TF and
other illegal trades. The circulars provide for a comprehensive KYC policy to be in place,
specify the minimum requirement for account opening, and identification and verification
of documents.

Annex 8. Comments of Co-financiers and Other Partners/Stakeholders


There were no co-financiers.

The Bank, however, sought feedback on TABS from the banking sector through a
questionnaire to various financial institutions. The responses received from the financial
institutions have been summarized in the matrix attached with the ICR.

             IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION RESULTS REPORT
                       SBP'S OWN ASSESSMENT

Q1: Assessment of the operation's objective design, implementation and operational
experience, as well as an assessment of the outcome of the operation against the agreed
objectives;

Assessment of the operation's objective design, implementation and operational experience
including outcome of the operation has been divided largely in the following areas with details in
the ensuing paragraphs.

        RTGS-Development of payment system.
        Technology Up-gradation.
        Credit information Bureau.
        Anti Money Laundering
        Human Resource Development

RTGS-Development of Payment System


The acquisition and implementation of the Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) system at SBP
covered the following:
        Acquisition and installation of a comprehensive and robust RTGS system
        Necessary trainings of concerned SBP and commercial banks personnel
        Initial visits by senior and mid level officers to other central banks and institutions
            for knowledge transfer
        Establishment of appropriate legal infrastructure (including the enactment of
            Payment Systems and EFT Act 2007) for the new system ensuring provisioning of
            final and irrevocable immediate settlement of payment instructions

The implementation of the RTGS system has achieved major policy objectives in the area of
Payment Systems as described below:-

    1. RTGS System implementations has significantly reduced the settlement risk by enabling
       SBP to migrate from deferred gross settlement system (previously used for interbank
       funds and government securities settlement) to Real Time Gross Settlement System. This
       in turn has also helped in minimizing systemic risk in interbank funds and securities
       settlement.
    2. RTGS Implementation has also resulted in centralization of NIFT's all three clearing
       cycles resulting in a single country wide clearing nets settled electronically in RTGS
       System instead of settling numerous individual net settlement batches (for each clearing
       cycles) previously used to settle retail clearing at SBP BSC's sixteen (16) field offices.
       This has resulted in significant time reduction in retail clearing settlement.
    3. RTGS System Implementation has also helped to increase the settlement timings i.e. from
       1:30 PM previously to 5 PM now therefore increasing efficiency of the large value
       payment systems by providing enhanced timing for money market operations.
    4. Government Securities are now settled on real time DvP (delivery vs payment) basis
       instead of deferred gross settlement previously used to settle government securities.


                                               40
Further, transactional activities of PRISM indicate that the system was used to settle 236,412
transactions during FY09. The value of these transactions was Rs 62.2 trillion, which is 4.8 times
the GDP for the year. Trends in the number of transactions and their corresponding value
indicate that in FY09, PRISM was (on average) used to settle 750 transactions on a daily basis,
worth Rs 200.0 billion, which implies that the average value of each transaction is slightly higher
than Rs 250 million. During the first eight (8) months of FY10 (July ­ Feb), the system was used
to settle Rs. 46.5 trillion worth of 189,353 transactions. Accordingly, the average value of each
transaction also slightly increased to Rs. 253 million.
The real time settlement mechanism of such large value transactions is a welcome development
for the payment system infrastructure of the country, as it contributes to effective risk
management by reducing systemic and credit risks. It also allows banks in managing their
liquidity more prudently. System tools like, ILF and queuing allows banks to manage their
payments as well as position most efficiently.
Settlement of multilateral NIFT clearing batches in RTGS on country wide basis has significantly
reduced the need for banks to manage dispersed liquidity and maintain it on a more centralized
basis in one location. Further, the settlement time has also been reduced significantly and banks
are now able to see their clearing position in real time via the online web-portal developed by
NIFT.
PRISM is also likely to strengthen the transmission mechanism of monetary policy, in Pakistan as
it is operated on a market-based mechanism and given the two-way causal relationship between
monetary policy and the payment system. At one end, a well designed and efficient payment
system influences the demand for money and the efficiency of some monetary policy instruments
by affecting the speed of execution of financial transactions. On the other hand, monetary policy
influences the available liquidity in the payment system and the opportunity cost of settling
transactions.

Technology Up-gradation

Technology up-gradation was essential to meet the rising demands of bringing efficiency and
quality in business operations, economic & banking sector data analysis and to transform the
work culture of SBP and SBP (BSC) with an automated IT environment. The key purpose was to
replace the outdated and legacy information systems with new and modern IT infrastructure
having automated IT systems and support infrastructure to enable SBP conduct its banking
operations and other key functions efficiently and smoothly. It was also required to strengthen
regulatory framework for FIs through improve procedures, monitoring and enforcement and
establish good corporate governance practices within the organization.

An efficient data processing, financial and non- financial reporting, data analysis and
communication system to addresses the automation needs of SBP and its subsidiaries specifically
and also to facilitate reporting and data acquisition from key stakeholders i.e. scheduled and non-
scheduled banking sector companies, IMF (International Monetary Fund), MoF (Ministry of
Finance), FBR (Federal Board of Revenue) etc.

In order to meet the above stated broad objective following specific steps were planned and
implemented.
     Automate and integrate the core banking, currency issue & management business
        functions. Important business functions as a part of automation includes government
        securities, deposit banking, foreign exchange management, investment accounting,
        government banking, currency issuance, prize bonds etc. Automation and reengineering
        the core business processes were suppose to bring the following efficiencies in system
     Reduced transaction time.


                                                41
       Standardized business processes across the system.
       Open technology platform.
       Compliances to industry standards and best business practices.
       Convenient, faster, reliable and integrated information.
       IT infrastructure with most recent technology.

       Future oriented stability and flexibility.
       Easy access to the integrated information.
       Higher efficiency in surveillance of SBP and whole financial sector.
       Thorough control of foreign exchange.

Automate and integrate the non-banking business functions i.e. assets & inventory management,
cash management, payroll function ( Salary, advances, funds, pension), medical services,
performance management system, general ledger, accounts payable and procurement. The key
benefits were:
         Create value through integrating activities across organization.
         Implementation of best practices.
         Standardization of processes.
         Single source of data for reporting.

         Online/Real time maintenance of employee's data.
         Improved budgetary controls.
         Online approvals of financial instruments.
         Centralized payments.
         Efficient processing and improved controls through isolation of purchasing, invoicing
            and payment areas (with only on payment desk for all kinds of non-banking
            payments).

Globus Core Banking System:

   System automatically processes all accounting entries and other calculations thus
   eliminating the paper work and manual calculations.
   System provides real time positions of securities and accounts to users and management.
   More reliable and timely information is available for Management Information System
   (MIS) purposes.
   System has real time interface with RTGS system and transactions processed on bank's
   accounts are updated in RTGS system in real time.
   One of the envisaged benefits of system implementation was elimination of Inter branch
   accounts reconciliation. It was achieved through Auto Inter Company Transactions refer
   to as online Funds Transfer facility where offices transfer funds to other offices on line in
   Globus.
   Inter systems reconciliation was achieved through implementation of cash management
   module of Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP). This includes the payments made to
   various contractors where cheque is issued to contractors from ERP and payment is made
   to them from Globus. An interface has been developed from where transactions
   pertaining to various ERP modules responded in Globus are reported to Cash
   Management module on daily basis.
   Compliance to reporting to IMF is achieved through Monetary and Financial Statistics
   Manual (MSFM) project. SBP had to revise its data collection process according to the
   standards defined by IMF in shape of MFSM. Globus team in consultation with Data
   Ware House (DWH) team designed and implemented the solution and MSFM reporting
   is now through DWH.
   System has enabled SBP to introduce new products into the market like recently done in
   shape of launching of Sukkuk, Pakistan Investment Bonds (PIBs) and 30 years bonds.
   SBP has gained more efficiency and control along with less risk through implementation
   of system. Example includes Foreign Currency Deposits where system checks limit of
   counterparties online and also provides MIS reports to Risk Management & Compliance
   Department to monitor limits in real time.
   System has enhanced skill level of the staff resulting in improved productivity evident
   from the fact that business is now daily closed at 5.00 to 6.00 pm.
   Last but not the least Globus has introduced modern banking practices in bank.

Oracle ERP System:

   Integrated Oracle ERP system enhances the management decision making process
   Bring about improvement in the quality & timeliness of required information.
   Delegation of Powers & Restructuring.
   Seamless Integration among different offices/departments and applications.
   Cultural changes observed after Automation.


                                           43
      Complete automation of all the Financial, Administrative and HR Functions
      Online availability of all financial reports.
      Efficient processing and improved controls.
      Consolidation of the functions.
      Technology enabled business processes.
      Manual registers have been discontinued and replaced by different reports of Oracle ERP.
      The General Ledger (GL) entries generated within Fixed Assets, Purchasing, Inventory,
      Accounts Payable, Payroll and Globus will be directly entered into the system by the
      concerned departments, eradicating the need for creating any GL entries for these
      functions within the GL module. The role of Accounts/Finance Department of SBP and
      BSC has been changed towards monitoring, controlling and reporting.
      Limited or no flow of manual vouchers required from any of the offices for verification
      and processing.
      Automated consolidation of accounting information at SBP, SBP BSC Karachi Office
      and offices after implementation of systems at all offices. This ability to consolidate
      information is a crucial benefit of having data available electronically across the various
      offices on the ERP systems.
      Accuracy and validity of information of the transaction file transferred from Globus to
      Oracle GL.

Data Ware House System:

   Banking and Money Subject Area:-

      Development and testing of Reporting Chart of Accounts (RCOA) weekly completed and
      rolled out to production. This application is now live and the banks are successfully
      submitting weekly statements electronically. The SBP users are generating output reports
      from this data and manual returns have been discontinued from the banks.
      Development of RCOA Annex A-07 (Classification of Credit by Borrowers) completed
      and rolled out to production. This system is currently in parallel run and banks are
      successfully submitting their monthly returns electronically. Manual returns from banks
      will be soon discontinued
      Development and testing of RCOA Quarterly completed and rolled out to production.
      This system is currently in parallel run and banks are successfully submitting their
      quarterly reports electronically. Output reporting requirements of all the departments are
      being catered as Quarterly Reporting Chart (QRC) data is used by almost all departments
      for reporting. Once the reporting is finalized, manual reporting of QRC will be
      discontinued which will be a major milestone for the Data Warehouse Division. Data
      Validation reports for RCOA quarterly data, requested by Off-Site Enforcement
      Department (OSED), are also under development.

   Balance of Payments Subject Area:-
    Development on the new application for Balance of Payments whereby the Statistics
      Department users will be able to load data in an Excel file and perform validation
      checking on it, before it is bulk loaded into the Data Warehouse. Previously, data was
      entered one transaction at a time using a data entry application which was very time
      consuming.
    International Transaction Reporting System (ITRS) application released to all 2000+
      branches of all the Commercial Banks of Pakistan. This application is being used to enter
      Foreign Exchange Returns transactions. Once the data is entered, this application


                                             44
       generates the Comma Separated Values (CSV) file according to the requirements of State
       Bank of Pakistan.
       Development of Exchange Rates Application whereby all the head offices of the
       commercial banks report the daily exchange rates of the currencies on a monthly
       frequency. Using this on-line application, banks prepare the excel sheet and load it from
       their premises.

   Capital Market Subject Area:-
    Fully automated the generation of Balance Sheet Analysis (BSA) Book. Previously,
      developers prepared this report manually for the users. SBP in-house team has developed
      new reports for the purpose and also trained the users regarding using Adobe Acrobat and
      a PDF page numbering software. All this made it possible for the users to successfully
      publish the BSA Books for year 2005 and 2006 themselves without the involvement of
      developers.
    Many new reports demanded by the users were developed, tested and attached in the
      production system and are working successfully. One of these reports was especially
      required by the Economic Advisor which was completed exactly according to the
      requirements and attached in the production system.
    Changes in Data Entry screens were also catered as per users' requirements e.g. the need
      for a separate window for data entry was also fulfilled.
    Other minor bugs and issues reported in the system were rectified and resolved and the
      system finally got signed off by the business users, which was pending for a long period.

   Price Trends Subject Area:-
       Development of the new Price Trends application. This application is now in use by the
       Business users. It contains implementation of 5 new variations of price trend calculations;
       3 Index-based and 2 Price-based. Previously, only one set of price-based calculations
       could be performed.

   MFSM Subject Area:-
    Development of Phase 1 of MFSM; sectoral Balance Sheet Preparation.

   Agricultural Credit Subject Area:-
    Successfully catered the loading and merging of 6 monthly data for the last one and a half
      year.
    Removed minor bugs from the database procedures and reports.

Networks and Infrastructure:

SBP has deployed Fast Ethernet, structured network system in all SBP centers, in 15 different
cities of Pakistan. The Main Data Center is situated at 6th Floor of the main building of State
Bank of Pakistan in Karachi, which has State of the Art Campus Clustered setup for the core
applications of Globus and Oracle ERP. Main building has a campus network of three building
interconnected over Giga bit Fiber Optic backbone system consisting of more than 3500 nodes in
overall. Primary server farm has both Reduced Instruction Set Computing (RISC) and Intel based
servers and enterprise storage with multiplatform Operating Systems. A hot backup site has been
established clustered with the primary site over Fiber Optic cabling system. The campus network
has a large setup having more than 3000 desktops and workstations interconnected over 100Mbps
LAN.




                                               45
In total across all SBP offices there are more than 4500 structured 10/100 Megabits per second
LAN nodes so far installed under the scope of Automation Project.

All countrywide SBP (BSC) offices are interconnected using terrestrial based leased line digital
cross connect links at primary data centers and satellite links at backup data centre of SBP beside
that the disaster recovery centre is connected to Primary and backup data centre using terrestrial
circuits.

All network points are powered by conditioned electricity supplied by (UPS) of APC (American
Power Company) that are supported by Automatic Voltage Regulators (AVR) ­and backed up
Generators dedicated for IT load at each office.


        Automated accounting entries, data consolidation, standardized automated reporting.

        System automatically processes all the accounting entries and other calculation through
        Globus core banking solution thus substantially reducing the quantum of work related to
        book keeping, reconciliation and settlements of accounts in the areas of government
        banking, deposit banking, securities and money market as well as the currency issuance
        and distribution system.
        Systems provide real time position of securities and accounts thus provide an immediate
        platform for decision making and other detailed MIS reports to concerned departments
        for Forex and money market management.
        Automated systems have facilitated the launching of new products especially securities
        such as Sukkuk and other bonds. Besides Globus provides the foundation for the RTGS
        operations through its interface where the current accounts of financial institutions are
        maintained in Globus and settlement takes place in RTGS.
        Risk management and more internal controls have been achieved in the business
        processes with the automated system. An example is Foreign Currency Deposits where
        system checks limits of counterparties online and also provides MIS reports to Risk
        Management and Compliance Department in real time.
        Data Acquisition Portal provides a greatly improved facility through online data
        collection from financial institutions.
        The Data Warehouse provides requisite statistical information utilized for
        multidimensional trend analysis and projections in developing the Monetary, Agriculture
        Credit and Exchange policies of the Central Bank.
        All export/import data from financial institutions is processed in Data Warehouse and
        effectively and efficiently utilized for calculation of Balance of Payments and Current
        Account status of Pakistan.
        IMF reporting compliance (MFSM) has been achieved through Data Warehouse system.
        In the Organizational Financial System that includes General Ledger, Payables, Asset
        management and procurements; Automation has substantially reduced the manual work
        of the resources.
        In Human Resources Management Areas, the Recruitment, Internal Transfers and
        Posting, Compensation and Benefits Including Medical Services System, Training and
        Performance Management System are all integrated to each other thus increasing the
        overall efficiency and productivity of work force.
        All GL entries generated within respective systems mentioned above are directly entered
        into the system by concerned departments. This has provided a great facility to
        Accounts/Finance department of SBP and SBP (BSC) by focusing them on monitoring,


                                                46
   controlling and reporting functions.
   Consolidation of books in sixteen SBP BSC and SBP main office was a very resource
   intensive task prior to automation which in now totally automated through Globus core
   banking solution and single consolidated GL report is available on daily basis from
   Oracle ERP GL module thus resulting in availability of consolidated information.
   Integration and re-engineering of different HR, BSSD, Finance and SBP (BSC) functions
   through the automated systems i.e. Globus banking and Oracle ERP, like for example,
   payment transactions to various contractors is entered in Globus against the cheques
   issued through Oracle ERP system. An interface is operational between Globus and ERP
   to reflect the transactions on daily basis in Oracle Cash Management Module.
   Countrywide infrastructure in SBP, BSC and field offices and NIBAF has facilitated the
   internal communication and exchange of information within the organization through
   instant access to email, Intranet Portal and SBP website as well as access to other IT
   resources has result in building up the capacity of SBP's workforce for IT enabled
   banking and ERP operations.
   Automated systems result in convenience and efficiency of internal working as is evident
   from the fact that after automation business in all offices daily closes timely by 6:00 PM
   as opposed to mid-night closing in the manual system.
   The compilation of Weekly Statement of Affairs has been reduced from two weeks to
   two days through an online Data Acquisition Portal.
   Export/import data compilation has been reduced from two weeks to five days.
   Distribution of salary and pension processing across seventeen offices has been
   converged to single centralized processing with the attendant reduction of work and the
   processing time has reduced from fifteen days to five days and the processes are
   integrated with Human Resource Information System(HRIS) and Finance.
   SBP's Internal and external websites provides instant and convenient access to
   publications, circulars & notifications, administrative orders, economic indicators and
   data including Karachi Inter Bank Operating Rates (KIBOR) rates to the employees
   within SBP and other stakeholders of SBP i.e. financial institutions. The provision of
   documentation availability through an online channel made not only a convenience in
   accessibility but also brings a huge efficiency in terms of timely communication within
   and outside SBP irrespective of geographical locations.

   Staff productivity of key business areas pertaining to SBP Banking cluster and SBP
   Economic cluster has increased with automated systems as the data collection; reporting
   and analysis function with automated systems has facilitated them on focusing their
   respective core functional areas.
   Staff objective settings and performance assessment has been made transparent and
   provides convenience in setting staff goals against their respective business plan in the
   start of business year. Oracle Performance Management System (PMS) module facilitates
   the individual contributor, unit leads, team leads and departments heads in setting their
   respective goal and KPI's against the business objectives. This results in proper planning
   and assessment of work from the bottom level worker to high ups as per the set business
   objectives in business plan of that year.

   SBP has passed through a major hiring process in 2007 recruiting the IT personnel in
   different specialized areas of infrastructure and business applications. The hiring was
   aimed to bring functional specialization, standardization, capacity building and
   contingency planning of human resources. Currently Information System &Technology
   Department(IS&TD) of SBP has over 130+ employees in ten different domain of I.T


                                          47
        infrastructure, I.T business applications, Administration, Planning & Coordination and
        I.T Security.
        SBP keeping in view the mission critical importance of its infrastructure and services
        decided to plan and develop a Disaster Recovery site geographically separated from the
        primary site hosted at Karachi. In addition to Disaster Recovery site SBP has operational
        Clustered High Availability Backup Site.

        The Information System & Technology Department is now headed by the Chief
        Information Officer(CIO) reporting to Deputy Governor, and is structured with two
        deputy CIO's heading the two main work streams i.e. infrastructure and business
        systems.
        Recruitment, retention and continuous training. ­ Key project resources have been
        retained by giving them permanent employment status.
        Essential technical trainings are imparted to key technical staff working on the
        implementation of new systems.
        Outstanding issues pertaining to residual work and settlement of payments of the
        automation project was completed satisfactorily within the TABS deadlines. This was
        effective in the smooth transition of the project into live operations.
        In June 2009, SBP had its fourth consecutive financial closing on the implemented
        automated systems.
        Products life cycle management- regular maintenance contracts and replacements of
        obsolete products is managed through organizational budgeting and procurement.
        The project of NOC (Network Operations Centre) was initiated on the recommendations
        of the World Bank. This project is aimed to bring the proactive management of I.T
        resources which has enhance internal capabilities in customer support services, I.T assets
        management and I.T capacity planning.
        A new I.T security team reporting to the CIO has been created. Presently all of the key
        implementation areas are being managed by the internal resources along with the vendors
        support through maintenance and support contracts. However, certain areas are being
        evaluated for possible outsourcing. Routine recruitment is being pursued to fill attrition
        gaps.

Credit Bureau Business


The World Bank funded project under Technical Assistance for Banking Sector (TABS) was
aimed to transform State Bank into a highly professional, efficient and modern central bank, fully
equipped to play a meaningful role in the economic and social development of Pakistan. In order
to cater evolving needs for comprehensive credit information and associated credit scoring tools,
strengthening of existing credit bureau services and providing an enabling environment for
establishment of credit bureaus in the private sector was recommended. State Bank of Pakistan
(SBP) hired services of M/s Sidat Hyder Morshed Associates (SHMA) as a consultant, to carry
out a comprehensive assessment/study of the existing credit information systems in Pakistan. The
job included specifying the parameters under which the private credit bureau would be
established, collect and disseminate data, safeguarding the interest of stakeholders, laying down
the enabling legal frameworks for the provision of optimum benefits to the participants consistent
with best international practices. Training of CIB officials in the critical design and operational
aspects of credit reporting systems and their role in a market economy was also part of
consultant's assignment. The consultant had prepared a comprehensive study report highlighting
enabling environment for incorporation and functioning of private credit bureaus business in



                                                48
Pakistan. A draft law titled "Credit Bureau Act" was also proposed for effective regulation of
credit bureau business in Pakistan. The SHMA report was approved by the State Bank. The
proposed legislation was comprehensively reviewed by SBP legal advisor and deliberated upon in
series of meetings of Banking Laws & Review Commission (BLRC). Presently, proposed law is
with the Ministry of Finance which will be tabled in National Assembly and Senate for its
enactment.

The proposed legislation will provide an enabling environment for incorporation and functioning
of credit bureau business in Pakistan. Besides, technology transfer, the credit bureau business will
bring in expertise of international repute. The healthy growth of credit bureau business will result
in increased access to credit, more equitable allocation of credit and greater private sector lending.

Anti Money Laundering

The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) is the primary regulator for Banks and DFIs in Pakistan while
the Securities & Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP) is responsible for regulating the non-
banking financial sector. The regulatory measures taken by SBP under the head of AML are as
under:-


Being regulator of banks / DFIs, State Bank of Pakistan is fully cognizant of its role in ensuring
clean and transparent banking system in the country. Toward this end, requirement of
determining the true identity of prospective account holders was imposed by State Bank as far
back as 1992. This was in addition to, prudential regulations on prevention of criminal use of
banking channels for the purpose of money laundering and other unlawful trades. The regulatory
regime continued to evolve and strengthened in the light of changes and developments in the
financial market and international best practices. During the process, State Bank has taken
following steps to curb and control money laundering:
 Issuance of Prudential Regulations: The basic elements of anti-money laundering for financial
institutions include risk based system of know your customer (KYC), account monitoring, record
retention, due diligence in correspondent banking relationship and reporting of suspicious
transactions. Though Banking Regulations were in vogue since long, a comprehensive set of
Prudential Regulations was enforced in June, 2004 and updated from time to time. These
Prudential Regulations contain Know Your Customer, Anti-Money Laundering Measures, Record
keeping, Correspondent Banking Relationship, Reporting of Suspicious Transactions,
appointment of Compliance Officer. Implementation of these regulations is ensured through on-
site examination and off-site surveillance. Officers of Inspection Department specifically verify
the adequacy of KYC policies and other Anti-money laundering safeguards during their on-site
inspections. Inspection of banks/ DFIs is conducted on periodic as well as on need basis. The
inspection report is shared with Banking Supervision Department for enforcement action.
Banking Supervision Department takes action against banks/ DFIs who are found deficient in
compliance of regulations and other remedial measures are also taken to ensure compliance in
future.
Guidelines on Internal Controls: Internal controls go a long way in preventing financial crimes
in the financial institutions. As a part of its ongoing efforts to encourage banks/DFIs to adopt
robust risk management practices, the State Bank of Pakistan has prepared detailed Guidelines on
Internal Controls. The guidelines were circulated amongst banks in May 2004. These guidelines
require all banks/DFIs to ensure existence of an effective system of internal controls, which is
commensurate with the nature, size and complexity of their business; minimizes the risk inherent



                                                 49
in their activities; and responds to changes in the business and general economic environment in
which the banks/DFIs operate.
Rupee Travellers Cheques (RTCs): The banks in Pakistan were issuing Traveller Cheques in
local currency called "Rupee Travellers Cheques" (RTCs) in exceptionally high denomination of
up to Rs.500,000 which was not in line with the true spirit and purpose of Traveller Cheques.
Instead of using RTCs to meet the needs of travellers, the holder of these instruments often used
them as a mode of settling undocumented transactions, thereby, defeating the objective of the
Government of documentation of the economy. SBP, therefore, prohibited the issuance of RTCs
in denominations exceeding Rs.10,000/- since May, 2002. State Bank of Pakistan is now
considering to revisit the issue keeping in view the recent development on AML issues.
Formation of Exchange Companies: Through an amendment in Foreign Exchange Regulation
Act, 1947, money changers have been replaced with Exchange Companies. These companies are
subject to proper monitoring and on-site inspection by SBP. With the powers to conduct on-site
inspection of such companies, State Bank keeps an eye on their activities. Banks/ DFIs and
Exchange Companies are encouraged to provide competing services in the formal sector in order
to remove any incentives being provided by Hawala operators. SBP has issued effective
regulations for Exchange Companies which are updated from time to time.
Money Laundering and Islamic Banking: Anti-money laundering safeguards are inherent in
Islamic Banking.
Policy for discouraging use of Alternate Remittance System (ARS): The SBP's regulatory
measures of licensing the Exchange Companies to undertake the business of sale/purchase of
foreign currencies, transfer of funds in a legitimate manner has helped in switching remittances
from hawala/ hundi operators to the Exchange Companies which are monitored / supervised
regularly by the State Bank of Pakistan. However, to eliminate illegal networks of hawala/hundi,
coordination and cooperation between law enforcing agencies is required across jurisdictions on
an ongoing basis.
Establishment of Financial Monitoring Unit (FMU): Financial Monitoring Unit was
established pursuant to the enactment of AML Ordinance-2007, the requirement of reporting
suspicious transactions to different agencies now stands revoked / overridden and now the
Financial Monitoring Unit (FMU) is the designated authority to receive, analyse and disseminate
the Suspicious Transaction Reports (STRs). FMU is a financial intelligence unit established
immediately after the enactment of AML Ordinance and is housed in the Central Bank i.e. State
Bank of Pakistan.
Mutual Evaluation Process by a WB/APG: A joint team of World Bank and Asia Pacific
Group on Money Laundering conducted an onsite Mutual Evaluation (ME) of Pakistan from 26th
January 2009 to 7th February 2009. The Mutual Evaluation was coordinated by FMU. As a part
of their evaluation, the team held more than 60 meetings with concerned stakeholders and a
number of private and public sector entities. The Mutual Evaluation process represents a central
pillar of the work of the APG/FATF. Through this process, the APG/FATF monitors the
implementation of the FATF Recommendations and assesses the effectiveness of the anti-money
laundering and counter-terrorist financing systems in APG/FATF member jurisdictions. The ME
process involves several steps which include offsite information gathering and onsite visit
followed by a draft ME report and a final report on the basis of representations / submissions / by
and discussions with the concerned jurisdictions. The team gives rating on FATF 40+9
recommendations in the categories as Compliant, Largely Compliant, Partially Compliant and
Non-Compliant. The report is then finally adopted at the APG annual meeting.




                                                50
The ME process is an intrusive evaluation with extraordinary details and despite limited resources
it was accomplished in a professional manner with the coordination of SBP, SECP, Ministry of
Finance, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Social Welfare, Ministry of Interior, NAB, FIA,
ANF, FBR etc. APG's annual meeting was held at Brisbane Australia from 6-10 July 2009 in
which besides some other countries, Pakistan's ME report was discussed and adopted. The ME
report is based on ratings on FATF 40+9 recommendations.

Human Resource Development

SBP has been able to achieve major milestones through the TABs funding project. HR has since
seen a gradual process of improvement and the basic HR systems and structures have been
formalized as a result of this funding. SBP has been able to have major breakthroughs in HR
systems and process in the following areas:

Performance Management System

    a. The new Performance Management System is successfully being implemented in SBP.
       The approach of evaluating the objectives along with the efforts carried out in the
       achievement of objectives i.e. goals and competencies, makes a well balanced system
       towards evaluating performance of an individual.
    b. Performance planning process i.e. the planning of goals and competencies is carried out
       in the beginning of the financial year while the evaluation is done at year end. Both these
       key phases involve a participative approach toward managing the performance of an
       individual. The Performance Management system has been implemented in the Bank
       after rounds and rounds of testing and then subsequently mass dissemination to the Bank
       employees.
    c. The Performance Management System has long since been automated with the Planning
       and Appraisal process completely being done on Oracle Applications, thus making it a
       paperless Performance Management system. The launch of the automated PMS in its
       second round of completion and is running smoothly in SBP.
    d. An appeal process is also put in place to provide an avenue to individuals who are not
       satisfied with their Performance evaluation.
    e. The reward, based on the Performance evaluation has been made increasingly
       competitive through the time. Last year the Annual Merit Increase has been substantially
       improved to reward high performers. The AMI rate for top performers has increased from
       7% in 2002-03 to 22% in 2009.

Competency Model for SBP

    a) The Performance Management System is derived from the Competency based
       Management approach based on the Hay Iceberg Model. Competencies models have
       been integrated into various systems in HR which include Career Development process
       (Promotion), Recruitment, Training and Performance Management System. With the
       change in the promotion process from a year end process to the concept based on internal
       job postings, the use of competencies has been further enhanced. The internal job
       postings process also integrates the competency whereby a list of behavioral based
       questions is given to interviewers to assess the potential of a candidate.
    b) In PMS competencies are divided into three broad clusters, The Core competencies,
       Functional specific competencies and Roles specific Competencies. A total of 29


                                               51
       competencies have been divided into these three clusters, with each competency having
       four levels, i.e. the Individual Contributor, Unit Head Divisional Head and HOD.
    c) Competencies in recruitment have been integrated by introducing behavior based
       interview questions, while in Training, soft skills training components was completed
       under the TAB program on a Bank wide level.


Recruitment

To fill the short and long term skill gap in SBP and vigorous but merit based hiring process has
been going on in SBP. Qualified professionals have been indicted at various levels in regular as
well as on contract basis. Other reforms have been introduced in the recruitment process by hiring
executive search firms for senior and specialized positions, development of a web based
recruitment systems to shorten the recruitment lead time etc.

        Currently 8% of the officers in monetary and research cluster are PhDs while in 2004
        only 3% staff was PhDs.
        57% of the officers working in SBP lie in the age bracket of 40 and below as compared to
        40% in 2004. Hence the induction of employees in the lower age bracket has contributed
        toward the performance based culture.
        SBP talent base comprises of professionally qualified people having qualifications of
        CISA, CPA, CIA, ACMA, ACA, FRM, PHR, e-commerce, information technology.
        Since the last 5 years, SBP has been able to recruit professionals possessing the relevant
        professional qualifications and skills set at different levels in the specialized areas like
        housing finance, IT, HR, research, treasury, economics, Banking etc.
        The career development policy has been firmed up and revised to make it purely on merit.

Market aligned Compensation and Benefits Structure

A list of benchmark institutions was indentified for SBP and the first salary survey was conducted
in year 2006. Based on the findings of the survey the New compensation and Benefits structure
was launched for employees in OG-2 and above positions in 2007. The main features of the
NCBS were introduce the market based compensation structure in SBP by launching market
based salary scales, revised retirement benefits by introducing defined contribution plans. The
NCBS was a voluntary scheme in which options were required to be given by employees in SBP
to opt for the revised package. The NCBS was successful scheme with almost half the population
of OG-2 and above employees moving to the new structure by forgoing their pensionery benefits.
This market alignment was further improved and built upon through the second Compensation
and benefits survey conducted in year 2009 under which the Total Remuneration approach has
been adopted as the philosophy of benchmarking with comparator institutions.
As a result of various initiatives of retention, attraction and engagement retention has improved
since the turnover has shown a declining trend.
        2006                      2007                    2008            2009
        7.31%                     8.36%                   5.37%           2.5%

Voluntary Separation Scheme

After a detailed and comprehensive analysis, a Voluntary Separation Scheme was launched in
SBP and SBPBSC OG-1 and below on 2nd April 2007. The VSS scheme provided the incentive


                                                52
for remaining as well as completed years of services, optional medical encashment, prize Bonds,
Leave encashment and 50% Commutation. Employees who opted for the scheme for the package
were relived on 5th June 2007.


HR Automation

Various HR processes have been automated along with a strong centralized employee information
data on the Oracle Platform. Other modules which are integrated with the centralized data base
are the PMS, Leave, Payroll, medical, Funds, Advances, Travel payments etc. The HR centralized
data base is increasingly used for advanced decision making process and input for various other
processes such as career advancement, recruitment, manpower planning, budgeting etc.


Organizational Structure

       a) A massive restructuring of SBP was carried out in SBP in September 2006, which
          included creating of various new departments, merging Departments and creation of
          various committees to improve the overall decision making process. SBP was divided
          into the following groups of distinct clusters each headed by a DG/ED.
                i. Banking Supervision, regulation and Development Finance Groups
               ii. Monetary Policy and Research
              iii. Financial Markets and Reserve Management
              iv. Corporate Services Group

       b) A new scale of OG-8 was also created so as to streamline the grade hierarchy in SBP

Restructuring of HRD

A Training Department was created to specially focus on training in SBP, while a separate
Business Support Services Department was created to cater to all corporate functions. HRD was
restructured by forming 3 divisions, Reward Management and HRIS Division, Talent
Management Division and Regulation and Compliance Division.

Employee Engagement Surveys:-
SBP has been conducting employee motivation/engagement surveys through an external
consultant to obtain feedback on the HR policies. The first survey was done in 2003, then 2004,
2005 and then in 2009 the results of the surveys provided an input in formulating the future
strategy of related departments.

        Employee's Foreign Training Program Financing Under TABS ( 2002-2008)
        No. of Trainees: 384 and almost all the trainings were of technical nature i.e., Central /
        Commercial Banking or IT issues

Q 2: Evaluation of the borrower's own performance during the preparation and
implementation of the operation, with special emphasis on lessons learned that may be
helpful in the future

The SBP has applied the required administrative procedures under the loan agreement. It has
applied its normal financial controls to the loan via internal and external audits. The SBP has
addressed the topics covered by the project's terms of reference. Overall, the SBP has shown
commitment by designating necessary resources to achieve the project objectives as set out in
TABS.

State Bank has a very advance human resource and service support structure in place; which has
evolved over the years. However, when TABS was conceived and implemented, it did not assess
the specialized project management capacity needed for this intervention. Thus in this technology
intensive, multi-sectoral intervention, establishment of a stand-alone dedicated project
coordination unit was not considered. Thus, there were some delays related to administration and
proper allocation of funds under different categories.

SBP has greatly benefited from the digitization of all the employee benefits support system.
Moreover the residual capacity; particularly in IT procurements, has helped Bank in undertaking
much larger and complex IT projects subsequently.

SBP's performance has significantly improved during the last ten years, as a whole. Doing a
high-tech and complex project like the RTGS was an excellent experience as it greatly enhanced
the technical and project management skills and business knowledge of the teams involved.

The following are major achievements & lessons learnt during implementation of the project:

        There has been considerable improvement in SBP staff's technical expertise since the
        inception of this project in 2002.
        There has been a significant change in SBP's understanding of the financial markets as
        compared with the position in 2002.
        SBP is significantly better equipped to deal with issues of banking sector.
        SBP's expectations of banks in terms of anti-money laundering are now very clear and
        understandable.
        Banks are much stronger in anti-money laundering since the inception of this project in
        2002. The new law on anti-money laundering has made significant changes on the
        standards of AML.
        Timely and relevant trainings are extremely important. It was ensured that the teams
        involved receive adequate training on all aspects of the system being implemented prior
        to the roll out of the program.
        Effective maintenance, support and service level agreements are also extremely
        important and have been be given high priority during the project.
        SBP's internal procurement processes should be upgraded and fast tracked by adequately
        staffing and undertaking capacity building of the Procurement Division in order to bring
        it in line with the IT needs.




                                               54
        Due to security situation, there have been travel issues with foreign consultants which
        have significantly contributed to project delays. Accordingly, new methods of project
        execution like formation of virtual teams, use of internet connectivity etc should be
        explored and adopted where required.
        Reliance on single technology for communications is not practical, for such a big and
        critical setup. Dual media approach wired and wireless are essential for the continual time
        sensitive banking, currency and ERP operations, especially where public dealing is
        required.
        SBP (project team) had to compensate the technical lacking where vendor suffered
        shortage of capable resources to design and configure connectivity solutions. This
        enabled project teams to acquire greater product knowledge.
        Output of all clusters within State Bank of Pakistan is now more analytical, thorough and,
        comprehensive, which has been acknowledged by all the stakeholders.
        The co-ordination with Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Law Division has significantly
        improved.
        The handling of issues and development of new policy guidelines is now being done
        efficiently and within set timelines.
         E-mail facility/ service in all offices facilitates users in timely communication, setting up
        meetings and meet deadlines of critical activities.
        National Institute of Banking and Finance (NIBAF) provides training to domestic and
        foreign central banking professionals. A number of officers from State Bank of Pakistan
        trained under TABS deliver lectures in various training programs organized by NIBAF.

State Bank of Pakistan is now being witnessed by all stakeholders as more efficient, modern,
professional and equipped with latest technology.


Q 3 Evaluation of the performance of the Bank, any co-financiers, or of other partners
during the preparation and implementation of the operation, including the effectiveness of
their relationships, with special emphasis on lessons learned, along with providing feedback
on the quality of the Bank's contribution, from identification to supervision;

The Bank has met efficiently the project needs for timely and appropriate payments to the SBP
and vendors under the loan agreement. The bank has held number of meetings with SBP and
taken a close interest in the progress of the project. The Bank has been reviewing the applications
of SBP for funding authorizations and funding variations to ensure that they fall within the
project scope and funding agreement and sought clarification as necessary and also provided
requisite NOCs where expenses crossed the given threshold. All other expenses were reviewed
during World Bank Missions. The World Bank has been supporting SBP by providing reference
of experts and engaging them to successfully implement various TABS initiatives ( e.g HR
Advisor from Malaysia, RTGs Advisor from the World Bank in Washington). This
supplemented with the lending and supervisory performance has enabled SBP to reach this far in
terms of successful achievement of the project's objectives. SBP's project team would like to
acknowledge the support and advice provided by the concerned teams of the World Bank
especially the missions that visited SBP during the entire course of the project. Their advice in
both the technical and business areas as well as financial assistance whenever required has been
wonderful. The missions acted as connoisseurs when it came to project implementations and
provided succinct but erudite advice to the concerned teams and this helped to goad the project
further.




                                                 55
IDA missions provided implementation support to the Banking Sector Technical Assistance
Project (TABS) over the period and reviewed the progress in implementation of the project with
various officials of the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) focusing specially on the status of the
remaining activities and the likelihood of their completion within the current Closing Date. The
missions always expressed its appreciation and gratitude to all the officials that gave their time
generously and shared their views, ideas, and suggestions for improving the implementation and
effectiveness of this project.

It may be informed that World Bank Mission has been reviewing the implementation progress of
the project from time to time. The mission also noted that most of the reforms activities are
broadly on track and reform objectives of the project are being met. In addition to that, the World
Bank Mission recommended the Disaster Recovery Component, which too has been successfully
completed.

The State Bank of Pakistan appreciates the timely and accurate allocation of funds under different
categories. This made possible for SBP to meet the objectives under different heads in timely
manner.


Q4: Description of the proposed arrangements for future operation of the project; and

The development of the financial sector has also been an important theme in the Country
Assistance Strategy of the World Bank in Pakistan which notes that the World Bank will support
further financial sector reforms in several areas including, strengthening and further deepening
capital markets; mortgage loans; SME financing; and improving financial markets infrastructure
and legal framework.

A brief description of the present arrangements to further strengthen financial sector of Pakistan
is in the ensuing paragraphs. This would provide a glimpse that State Bank of Pakistan is already
working on different areas to achieve these objectives.


        Necessary amendments in Banking Companies Ordinance (BCO) for enhanced powers of
        SBP were drafted and submitted to the cabinet. After approval of cabinet, these
        amendments have also been passed by the National Assembly. These are now pending
        with the Senate for consideration.
        State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has initiated Basle Core Principles(BCP) self assessment
        process and this will be completed by the end of year 2010. Previously a joint team of
        World Bank and IMF (Team) conducted a full scope BCP assessment under Financial
        Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) during 2004. Team assessed SBP compliant with 16
        principles, Largely Compliant with 5 principles, and Materially non-compliant with
        4 principles on essential criteria.
        MOU between SBP and SECP has been signed and letter of understanding has also been
        exchanged to establish a Task Force for joint inspections of financial conglomerates as
        well as to establish a task force to review the supervisory architecture and to address
        regulatory arbitrage concerns.
         In order to strengthen the autonomy and governance of the central bank and to develop a
        strategy for financial sector development, the creation of above task force would envision
        direction for the future of the financial sector as well as effective prudential and market


                                                56
        conduct regulations. The task force will study the impediments towards achieving an
        inclusive financial sector and recommend medium term development strategy for the
        financial sector. As far as evaluating of performance in key functional areas of Central
        Bank, the implementation of the strategic goals and strategic planning is an ongoing
        process, which will involve embedding the values into the organizational culture and
        realignment of the SBP structure with the SBP's vision in the periods ahead
        Amendments were earlier incorporated in the AML Ordinance 2009 and subsequently
        made part of recently enacted AML Act 2010 through the Parliament. This has and would
        further strengthen the legal and regulatory framework for AML.
        The consultants already engaged under TABS proposed a law titled "Credit Information
        Bureau Act" for effective regulation of Credit Information Bureau Business in Pakistan.
        This draft law is already with Ministry of Finance for enactment since 2007. After
        enactment of the above law, SBP shall be able to develop a mechanism to get the
        provisions of this act implemented, like developing licensing criteria, publication of rules,
        developing applications for applying to establish credit bureau, advertisement in
        newspapers and other rules and regulations.
        SBP is working on Consumer Protection Law in consultation with legal consultants; the
        same shall be submitted to MoF after finalization. Once this law is enacted, this would
        definitely increase public confidence.
        The Draft Deposit Protection Law has already been submitted to Ministry of Finance,
        Government of Pakistan. This would further safeguard the interest of small depositors.
        PRISM System is capable to integrate with other NPSS (National Payment & Settlement
        Systems) like Central Depositary Company (CDC), NCCPL, and Commodity Exchange
        as well as with external payments system. In order to achieve this, a comprehensive
        National Payment System vision needs to be developed with the full ownership of SBP's
        top management. This NPS Visions once developed should become a baseline for all the
        future developments related to Payment Systems

State Bank of Pakistan therefore suggests dedicated project coordination, commensurate with size
of investment with effective exit strategy, in the areas highlighted above may be considered. SBP
also suggests that a Project Steering Committee (PSC) may also be formed to look into future
development and suggest that the projects are embedded into mainstream operations ab-initio.
State Bank of Pakistan further suggests that monitoring mechanism of World Bank should take
potential beneficiaries on board from inception which would entail real-time monitoring.

 Some of the consolidated requirement for future projects have already been documented, which
aim to strengthen the existing IT infrastructure to provide quality service to the internal clients
(SBP, SBP-BSC & NIBAF) and external clients ( Financial Institutes, FBR, MOF, Government
organizations etc). These projects are mainly focused on

                  Business Applications upgrade i.e. Globus and Oracle ERP upgrade.
                  Infrastructure upgrade of Hardware servers, UPS systems and Network
                  Communication systems.
                  Developing and strengthening I.T security systems.




                                                57
As a way forward, World Bank should consider running programs of shorter period in area of IT
where (a) sustainability warrants intensive integration of proposed technology with its roadmap,
(b) a phased approach, is needed in area of training and development where next phase of training
financing should be released on basis of efficacy and direct application of training; and (c) clear
incentive structure should be established between required technology and business needs as there
are some areas in technology which are under-utilized. Any downstream investment should duly
incorporate lessons in designing the overall policy development content.

There are number of parallel investments going on in different areas through various
international agencies/multilateral agencies. To extract maximum benefits, World Bank may
discuss and evolve a strategy to consolidate the coordination and logistics of these programs to
avoid potential duplications.


Q 5: Providing information to the Bank on the economic, financial, social, institutional and
environmental conditions, and on implementation and operation results.

State Bank of Pakistan, time and again intimated World Bank about the progress in economic,
financial, social, institutional and environmental matters. SBP on the request of Government of
Pakistan has also been providing progress report on the project for onward transmission to the
World Bank. Besides, statements of expenditure, all other information relating to the project were
also provided to the World Bank.

In addition to the above, World Bank missions also visited Pakistan from time to time to review
the implementation progress of the project.

The way forward is to identify areas where further improvements are needed whereby new
projects of similar nature can be developed for SBP.

                                               e) Inter-Bank transactions are done through this system efficiently
                                               f) Securities kept with SSP can be viewed online.

                                           -   Some improvements are needed in the system, such as allowing SSP cheque movement for payments of SSP
                                               Telegrahic Transfers, payment of Advance Tax, Zakat and cash withdrawal.

                                           -   One of the surveyed banks has architected a technology strategy that is in line with its business vision. The
                                               strategy is reviewed and adjusted periodically to account for changes in business direction.

                                           -   Another bank has strengthened its application portfolio by acquiring and implementing software to automate
                                               processes across business domains. Policies and procedures have been implemented in IT to ensure that proper
                                               guidelines have been established for all areas of technology. The establishment of these policies and procedures
                                                                                   1
                                      help it monitor, identify and mitigate the risks as and when detected.

                                  -   SBP went through evolution by bringing in up to date data collection systems to ensure a vigilant watch over
                                      Pakistan Banking Industry. Firm implementation of these components at central bank must reflect over the
                                      Pakistan Banking industry to grow further with satisfaction and in controlled environment to align with global
                                      financial markets.

                                  -   TABS supported initiatives have enabled the banks to provide better customer service with improved safety
                                      and controls. Introduction of ATMs and then their linking towards a single network is an example of
                                      technology up gradation. In addition, many branchless banking facilities are also being provided by different
                                      banks e.g. cash deposit through A TM, funds transfer from one account of a bank to another Bank's account,
                                      receipt of cheque book requisition. Almost all banks are also providing 24-hours phone banking facilities by
                                      which customer can make transactions, pay their utility bills, get information about their accounts/balances etc.
                                      Many banks are also providing mobile alert facility by which transactions in customers' accounts are promptly
                                      communicated to them.

                                  -   On most matters pertaining to mergers and group diversification, the banks found the SBP to be open to
                                      discussion and to have taken a balanced view. In some cases regulatory directives have not been in consonance
                                      with international best practices e.g. the removal of Forced Sales Value (FSV) benefit and then its subsequent
                                      piecemeal reintroduction. By materially impacting profitability of banks, this issue is of special concern to a
                                      foreign shareholder who may wish to invest for the long-term based upon certain assumptions of provisioning.

                                  -   Regulatory review has helped the microfinance banks to develop and implement secure practices. However, the
                                      integration of microfinance banking systems into the mainstream RTGS is yet to be achieved.

2   Improvements        in  the   -   The monetary policy management of SBP has undergone some major changes during the last few years.
    monetary policy management        Principal among these measures has been the move from biannual review of monetary policy to bimonthly
    and banking regulation and        review, plus an independent Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) and an interest rate corridor have also been
    supervision as a result of        created. These measures have made monetary policy more responsive and pro-active to what is a rapidly
    capacity building of SBP in       changing and fluid economic environment. The volatility in inflation figures, high dependence of the country
    the last few years.               over pledges by other countries for foreign inflows and deteriorating balance of payments called for cautious
                                      stance by SBP, which to a large extent remained up to task, and provided updated data on foreign inflows,
                                      weekly inflation and liquidity situation, however to some extent the SBP has been guilty of reactive rather than
                                      proactive.

                                  -   The SBP now is in a better position to more comprehensively develop expectations on inflation and interest
                                      rates. The interest rate corridor will improve monetary transmission mechanism, liquidity management and




                                                                          2
                                        reduce volatility in the inter-bank market. Bank can now park excess liquidity with SBP at the floor level that
                                        is 300 basis points lower than the discount rate. If there is shortage of liquidity in the market, banks can use the
                                        SBP discounting window to borrow the required amount of funds.

                                    -   Furthermore, in order to maintain a tight leash on liquidity the SBP is very active with regards to open market
                                        operations (OMOs) and conducts them very frequently. Excessive use of OMOs going forward helps to
                                        promote transparency in the liquidity management framework.

                                    -   Over last 5-7 years, banking sector has seen revolutionary improvement in the area of regulation and
                                        supervision. The banking prudential regulations are now at par, if not ahead, with the international best
                                        practices observed across the globe. The quality of central bank's inspection reports has improved, their
                                        contents are now more focused and highlight most of the operational issues faced by the banks.

                                    -   There has been remarkable improvement in monetary policy management by SBP. Regular publication of clear
                                        monetary policy statements and monetary policy press releases as per pre announced schedule has improved
                                        transparency and communication with the financial markets. SBP has also introduced an interest rate corridor
                                        to reduce interest rate volatility. The overnight rate is now targeted through frequent OMOs. These steps are
                                        positive and have improved the transmission effectiveness of the monetary policy.

                                    -   The SBP is implementing the Financial Inclusion Program (FIP) worth GBP 50 million. The program was
                                        designed and developed through broader consultations with the stakeholders. This will help SBP implement
                                        Pakistan's Microfinance Strategy, which was approved by the Prime Minister.

                                    -   Current performance of the SBP's monetary policy management has given mixed signals because while
                                        inflation (YoY) and balance of payment position has improved; fiscal and real sector performance remains
                                        tenuous. Domestic financial markets functioned adequately but lending to private sector has remained subdued.
                                        From a forward looking perspective, expected improvement in external current account and emerging global
                                        economic recovery augur well for Pakistan's economy. But, limited progress on electricity shortages and
                                        stressed fiscal position dilute some of optimism. Similarly, inflation outlook is not completely benign yet as
                                        depicted by recent monthly trends. On data dissemination, however, an area that requires further improvement
                                        is providing numbers on corporate debt/commercial papers and liquidity in the market.

3   Noteworthy improvements in      -   The banking supervision of SBP is now more specific and in-depth on all sectors. The supervision reports

regard to highlighting early
warning       signals,    key    -   The CAMELS system of rating of financial institutions now addresses all essential elements of good
systematic risks and potential       governance and accordingly rate financial institutions. Not only that the rating is improved, it is noted that the
portfolio issues?                    supervisor's comments in respect of financial/operational health of borrowers have proven essential tool to
                                     proactively address portfolio management issues and greatly assist management in devising remedial strategies
                                     accordingly.

                                 -   As a governing body for the country's banking sector, State Bank's horizon of governance and control has
                                     expanded in breadth and profundity. SBP governance spectrum has expanded to cover several new initiatives
                                     and requisite modifications to existing rules & regulations. Considering the worsening of economic scenario
                                     and the consumer credit cycle in Pakistan, all actions by the SBP were executed timely and implemented when
                                     they were desired.

                                 -   Publishing of Fair Debt Collection Guidelines is an effective attempt by SBP to fix any emerging issue that can
                                     be harmful to the consumer and organizations related to banking industry.

                                 -   New additions to the regulatory framework such as putting the ceiling on Maximum Debt Burden and
                                     Maximum Exposure in Unsecured Products, is a step towards risk and exposure management for the bank and
                                     the borrower.

                                 -   SBP inspections are now more comprehensive and interactive. The enhanced quality of findings assists banks
                                     to improve controls, fix processes and make required amendments in policies for better risk management of the
                                     portfolios. However, the finalization of the inspection report needs to be expedited. Additionally the
                                     information in the inspection report should be rationalized.

                                 -   SBP has improved both its onsite and offsite surveillance. Now it can encourage banks to improve the
                                     governance and controls while managing key risks. Generally, changes witnessed in the regulations ensure
                                     more safety & soundness of banking system and expanding banking net.

                                 -   SBP guidelines on various aspects like Basel-II, Internal Control Framework, CDD/ AML etc. were given to
                                     banks to make them aligned with best international practices. Also off-site monitoring and assessment of bank's
                                     financials and systems is being conducted through a comprehensive questionnaire, called IRAF. Also, SBP
                                     keeps continuing vigilance over banks asset quality and soundness of their balance sheets.

                                 -   The annual review conducted by the SBP team now also includes other aspects such as; governance of the
                                     institution, business plan/strategy, human resource management, customer service quality etc.




                                                                         4
                                     -   The evolution of SBP's monitoring through development of various tools including stringent risk rating criteria,
                                         checks on adequacy of banks' capital, monopoly control and corporate governance and assessment of overall
                                         health of the financial institutions have also kept the banks on their toes to keep improving their weak areas to
                                         avoid criticism/penalties (which sometimes is hefty) and down grading of their ratings. However, there are
                                         certain areas where banks need expansion of SBP's regulatory framework such as assessment and controls of
                                         service providers of security, custody, credit reports/market/industry checks and muqqadams etc.

                                     -   SBP now has very strict rules for the Non Performing Loans (NPL). It requires to classify the account as NPL
                                         not only on objective basis but also, at times, on subjective basis. However, subjective basis creates huge
                                         burden on the part of the Bank as far as its profitability and position is concerned. Further, it depends upon the
                                         subjective decision of the concerned inspector which is not desirable as the subjective criterion should be
                                         sparingly exercised as against present trend of maximum classification on this basis. Moreover, this defeats the
                                         very purpose of SBP Prudential Regulations on objective basis.

                                     -   Some more work needs to be done on the SME Prudential. However, In the absence of adequate consumer
                                         rights protection bodies, the SBP in trying to protect consumer rights, has at times given directives that have
                                         made it difficult for banks to pursue willful defaulters thereby having to incur avoidable loan losses.

                                     -   While the quality of field inspection staff has improved over the years, there is still room of further
                                         improvement both on the technical side and also in terms of business knowledge. There is certainly value
                                         addition in qualitative assessments; however, the communication style of the report at times does not capture
                                         the message that needs to be conveyed. The materiality of issues identified need to be judged better by the SBP
                                         audit teams and should be quantified in the report. The focus of the inspection report now needs to shift to
                                         assessing the risks that the bank faces and perhaps reduce the emphasis on noting specific deviations from
                                         policies and regulations.

4   Impact of up-gradation of the    -   Up-gradation of Payments Clearance System Banks are required to hold current accounts with (SBP) which are
    payment clearance system,            primarily used to settle large value inter-bank fund transfers between banks and to meet certain statutory
    especially    in     liquidity       requirements. These systems offer better mechanics for settlement of large value payments, because of their
    management and on bank's             ability to allow market participants to monitor their positions and settle their transactions in real time.
    corporate and individual             Furthermore, they give customers full and immediate utilization of their liquidity by enabling them to transfer
    customers.                           their large payments across banks. Manual processing of checks has been discontinued and now it's being done
                                         by an automated clearing houses run by NIFT. All Payment instruments issued by the BSC field offices,
                                         commercial banks and other financial institutions now have been standardized and "Machine Readable"
                                         through usage of (MICR). Furthermore, in July 2008 SBP started posting of Multilateral Net Settlement
                                         Batches (MNSBs) of clearing in RTGS System while in August, 2008 SBP launched online Interbank




                                                                             5

                                  -   RTGS has not had significant impact on turnaround time for clearance. Generally it takes one day to collect the
                                      cheque which is deposited within banking hours and funds to customers are available at third day except where
                                      customer can withdraw through ATM in the late evenings of 2nd day. Some banks facilitate intercity
                                      collections through on-line banking system and some still use legacy systems of sending cheques which
                                      generally take 3 - 4 working days.

                                  -   RTGS offers a much quicker and efficient method of transferring funds, and better payment mechanism for
                                      large value payments e.g. inter-bank lending, borrowing, with the ability to allow market participants to
                                      monitor their liquidity positions on-line and accordingly settle their payments on gross basis in real time. It has
                                      also minimized the systemic risks that are inherent in large value net settlement systems.

                                  -   An offshoot of the RTGS is the Pakistan Remittance Initiative (PRI) which has enabled (in its initial stage), the
                                      five large Banks in Pakistan, to exchange remittances received from abroad for their customers. These
                                      remittances are exchanged between the 5 banks twice daily enabling banks to credit their customers' account
                                      same day, where as previously this process took at least 3 working days. Another important change due to the
                                      introduction of PRI is the customers' departure from using unauthorized/illegal Hawala and other such
                                      mechanism for transfer of funds/remittance.

                                  -   In previous days banks have to gather at SBP to exchange funds through SBP Cheque in long queues which is
                                      now settled through RTGS at their own premises.

                                  -   Following areas in RTGS might still require improvements:
                                          o Balances of stations other than Karachi are not online therefore the remittance of funds is still done
                                              through TT.
                                          o Islamic Export Refinance Finance balances are not credited on real time basis, if credited before close
                                              of market than will help in making smart investment decisions
                                          o Online Statement should be provided through RTGS (Historical & Current both)
                                          o RTGS should be installed separately on Islamic Banking Divisions (banks with Islamic branches) in
                                              order to eliminate SBP Cheque movements.
                                          o Statement of issue of securities showing movements of transactions of each day including opening and
                                              closing balances cannot be viewed in DEPOIX.
                                          o Same day, intercity clearing return should be uploaded before close of RTGS.
                                          o RTGS for seamless inter-bank fund transfer should be deployed with all banks.

5   Impact of newly established   -   Pakistan's first consumer credit wave was triggered with the launch of e-CIB. The defaulters' pool is mainly




                                                                           6
Credit Information Bureau            comprised of customers with multiple products holding across the industry and availing much higher limits
(CIB) on banking system's            compared to their repayment capability. This over leveraged customer pool was formulated at the time when
accessibility, timeliness, and       positive credit bureau was not available and low cost of credit was driving a rapid dispersion of consumer
reliability                          products. e-CIB holds great significance and is used in all credit decisions for new acquisitions to existing
                                     portfolio management such as extension of new facilities, enhancements in existing facilities, portfolio and
                                     remedial actions, collection / recovery activities and development of Scoring models.

                                 -   The CIB has proven to be an extensive facilitation tool in minimizing the risks associated with credit
                                     disbursement. The restrictions placed by SBP or by the banks' internal policy parameters on maximum
                                     exposure in a firm/borrower and credit history of a firm/borrower can be accessed easily. This certainly helps
                                     the banks to improve their credit quality and keep their portfolios clean.

                                 -   Banks are facing technical issues for data conversion & uploading to SBP's e-CIB and innovation &
                                     improvement in terms of technology is required.

                                 -   SBP has recently instructed banks to report Obligor Risk Rating to the CIB, which will help SBP in comparing
                                     risk rating of similar customers across all banks. This will further bolster the risk management framework of
                                     the local banking system.

                                 -   Presently, banks submit their data by 15th of each month. It takes around two to three weeks to update the data
                                     at SBP and hence there is a lag of almost a month between the time the e-CIB is asked and the outstanding
                                     position of the customer. In addition, in case of Corporate Customers, e-CIB describes an overall outstanding
                                     position of the customer and bank-wise facilities are not being provided at this point in time. Presently,
                                     submission of data is the responsibility of the Banks which use different method for preparing the file to be
                                     submitted to SBP. During the process, there are possibilities of non-reporting, wrong reporting etc. which can
                                     create a question mark on the reliability of data at e-CIB site. It is also recommended that coverage of e-CIB be
                                     enhanced to cover instances of dishonored cheques, tax defaults and law suits.

                                 -   Although at times banks do face problems i.e. access and reliability of the data being reported. The group
                                     reporting structure requires introduction of certain functions which will enable the banks to collect data of
                                     entire group in one e-CIB report.

                                 -   Other areas where some improvement is required:
                                     - Longer repayment history such as 3 years
                                     - Availability of negative information (defaults) for the last 3-5 years
                                     - Availability of information related to settled / restructured accounts
                                     - Company details in e-CIB should be more elaborate & individual e-CIB format & fields should be




                                                                         7
                                             incorporated along with relevant fields related to companies.
                                         -   Availability of bureau score
                                         -   PDF Format for individual e-CIB report to be changed to the format that can be easily uploaded to
                                         -   the respective bank's system
                                         -   Availability of consumer repayment behavior on different utilities such as electricity, gas,
                                             telecommunications etc.

6   Impact on the banking system     -   The prudential regulations issued by SBP cover the necessary features of AML regime for financial institutions
    as a result of improvements in       as required under FATF recommendations. A major step is the replacement of Money Changers with properly
    the system and procedures for        regulated Exchange Companies; hence the business of money changing and the underlying transactions has
    strengthening       anti-money       been formalized. Bank accounts of proscribed entities and individuals are frozen by SBP as per UNSC
    laundering      (AML)      and       Resolutions. Report of frozen accounts is called from banks and proper record of frozen account is maintained.
    reducing financial fraud.
                                     -   The banks were issuing Traveler Cheques in local currency called "Rupee Travelers Cheques" (RTCs) in
                                         exceptionally high denomination of up to Rs.500,000 which was not in line with the true spirit and purpose of
                                         travelers, the holder of these instruments often used them as a mode of settling undocumented transactions
                                         thereby, defeating the objective of the Government of documentation of the economy. SBP, therefore
                                         prohibited the issuance of RTCs in denominations exceeding Rs.10, 000. An important factor is the presence of
                                         terrorists out-fits and their needs for financing their activities through laundered money, all these factors
                                         demand that there should be more stringent policies and regulations in place for curbing money laundering
                                         practices.

                                     -   Each bank has issued its anti money laundering guidelines. Compliance of these guidelines is being checked on
                                         continuous basis by internal, external and SBP auditors. System is also being improved to support the
                                         monitoring. Each bank also ensures correctness of the identity of the customer through verification of
                                         whereabouts by using" Verisys" system of NADRA.

                                     -   In line with SBP's directives, all banks obtain information on the form "Know Your Customer". This
                                         information includes depositor's sources of income, expected number of transaction (debit/credit) per month,
                                         expected value of transactions etc. This information is then checked with the actual transactions in the account
                                         and any suspicious activity is probed-in extensively. Identified suspicious activities are reported to SBP's
                                         "Financial Monitoring Unit" (FMU).

                                     -   An effective AML regime is not possible without an efficient, strong and robust Financial Intelligence Unit
                                         (FIU), under the country's respective AML Law. Pakistan's FMU is not adequately capacitated or engaged with
                                         banks. Cash Transaction Report (CTR) has yet to be introduced by the FMU. FMU needs to turn itself into an
                                         active, robust and effective institution for ensuring an effective AML regime in the country.




                                                                             8
                                       -   Monitoring AML is system dependent or resource intensive. Although SBP has guidelines / regulations; yet it
                                           may take more time to mature since most of the banks / institutions are not operational with integrated banking
                                           systems. True sense of AML is only possible when entire banking system is integrated which may take time.

7   Areas that need further            -   Improved credit information and credit rating systems would facilitate efficiency, modernization of payment
    strengthening, in respect of           systems can attain certainty. In the area of financial transactions, upgrading land and property registries and
    technology up-gradation and            improvement of procedural issues in the legal system is required for the protection of banks. In recent years,
    regulatory capacity, to meet:          SBP has introduced a broad range of prudential regulations to strengthen risk management, internal controls,
    the growing demands of                 corporate governance and capital adequacy. SBP has also provided banks with guidance for promotion of
    banking      services     within       development financing and consumer credit.
    Pakistan,             increasing
    sophistication of the banking      -   Banking sector as a whole is passing through a critical phase. Enhanced supervisory reviews coupled with
    system especially to manage            growing involvement of courts are affecting day to day decision making of banks. Under these circumstances,
    systematic risks, and to cope          there is a need to create awareness on different restructuring aspects and introduction of best industry practices
    with the increasing demand             for addressing NPL's. Debt equity swaps, management takeovers and acquisitions by force, are few aspects that
    domestically and globally.             industry needs to be educated on in order to clean-up balance sheets of individual bank.

                                       -   Detailed regulations / guidelines on restructuring and remedial actions for Retail portfolios are required to
                                           manage and regularize the development and execution of these actions across the industry.

                                       -   Availability of analysis on industry-wide consumer data and research reports on the overall consumer industry
                                           & specific products can help build a strong understanding of this banking sector and devise polices and action
                                           plans for consumer portfolios. Frequency of publication of these reports should be at least on quarterly basis.

                                       -   Greater assistance should be provided in implementation of Basel II requirements on consumer portfolio.
                                           Execution should be phased out and extensive trainings related to the same should be conducted.

                                       -   Training areas should be identified through monitoring of regulatory issues, during inspections and regular
                                           feedback from banks. Training courses should be arranged or training material to be provided to the relevant
                                           bank staff in order to improve their processes, risk management techniques along with development of human
                                           resource pool.
                                        
                                       -   Acceptance of VaR based calculation as basis for Market Risk capital, which is currently only accepted on
                                           standardized basis.

                                       -   More emphasis on future outlook, quality of financials, valuation and credibility of collaterals, sectoral

    exposure, customer ratings in a more scientific manner, product programs, will lead to further improving the
    overall environment.

-   Guidelines on subjective provisioning be further clarified through guidance on the criteria to ensure improved
    alignment between bank practice & policy and SBP Inspection recommendations.

-   Penetration of banking system in Pakistan is low as compared to other countries. It requires lot of innovation
    and technology up-gradation to expand the banking frontiers. There is a need to launch technology led delivery
    models while ensuring minimum regulatory standards & controls which ensure cost affordability by clients and
    sustainability of financial system.

-   Timely updating of liquidity position of all banks and the composition of the banking sector's deposit base,
    which are updated with a significant lag.

-   Volume related data may be provided for inter-bank foreign exchange market.

-   There is an inevitable shift of bank customers into the individual salaried and self employed sectors as well as
    the lower tiers of SME and agriculture sectors. Banking regulators, in discussions with banks, will have to
    develop a detailed understanding of the characteristics of these customer segments and develop a detailed
    knowledge of inherent risks in these segments. The SBP will then be better equipped to mitigate risks through
    effective regulations that are tailor-made for each segment.

-   Work needs to be done on "group based regulation" where a bank forms part of group consisting of NBFI's as
    well as other corporate entities.

-   Paperless and mobile banking are also areas which will demand specially tailored supervision and regulations.

-   One thing that is required for better liquidity management is that SBP needs to have online connectivity / one
    account concept of their field accounts, so that balances at other centers can also be used at Karachi and vice
    versa. Moreover, bank to bank customer transaction through RTGS would also be beneficial for further
    development of electronic banking.

-   The banking industry should now begin to move towards the Image Clearing System which will greatly
    enhance the speed of payment settlements in the banking system.
