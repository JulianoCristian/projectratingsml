The second component supports completion of the\n            automation project as designed under the Information System\n            Strategy Plan formulated under FSDIP; implementation and\n            bramch roll-out of the banking system GLOBUS; integration of\n            all department functions related to financial accounting,\n            human resources, budgeting, payroll, procurement, inventory,\n            and asset management; improvement of the data warehouse; and\n            financing of hardware and networking as well as training and\n            change management initiatives.
