The project will support activities in all\n            departments of Haiti, where the cholera epidemic is rampant.\n            Population growth, the unregulated agricultural activities\n            and commercial utilization of resources for energy and waste\n            production, significantly affect natural ecosystems and\n            Haitians have a significant impact on their management.\n            Nevertheless, the disadvantaged rural and urban centers bear\n            the brunt of environmental degradation with consequent\n            increased exposure to epidemics such as cholera. Urban areas\n            are particularly vulnerable in the absence of policies and\n            best practices in waste management. This ESMF provides\n            information on expected impacts of the project, safeguard\n            policies triggered by the project and a protocol of best\n            practice management of medical care, waste and protection of\n            medical personnel confronting the epidemic of cholera. These\n            activities will not produce any large scale, significant\n            and/or irreversible impacts. The Project is thus using a\n            tried and tested approach in an emergency context in which\n            the potential incremental scale of environmental impacts is\n            minor and can be easily localized, and measures to mitigate\n            the impacts are already standard practice among the\n            non-public sector service providers. Based on the experience\n            from other emergency interventions to stem an epidemic, the\n            likely key environmental risks associated with activities\n            for this type of project include: healthcare waste\n            management, worker health and safety, and minor works.\n            Moreover, it is recommended that the project does not focus\n            on the financing of activities whose environmental and\n            social aspects are very difficult to manage, given the\n            limited available capacity of national and local\n            stakeholders on issues of environmental and social management."}, "docdt": "2011-02-01T00:00:00Z"}
