The closing date of the project will be extended\n            from June 30, 2013 to December 31, 2013. The extension will\n            allow the Government to finalize the remaining\n            rehabilitation work, which already started in May 2013,\n            taking into account possible delays due to the upcoming\n            rainy season. Specifically, it will allow the completion of:\n            1) rehabilitation of rooms for infectious and diarrheal\n            diseases; 2) installation of incinerators for proper waste\n            management; and 3) additional support for epidemiological\n            surveillance. This will be the first and only extension for\n            the project."}, "docdt": "2013-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
