Pakistan were as follows: outcomes\n            were satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was\n            substantial, the Bank performance was moderately\n            satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was also\n            moderately satisfactory. The key lessons learned are as\n            follows:   Project design in an emergency situation needs to\n            consider the balance of responding to urgent versus long\n            term needs. The implementation agencies' institutional\n            capacity and readiness should not be underestimated or\n            considered less important in emergency situations. In\n            countries where cholera outbreaks follow seasonal cycles,\n            training of health care workers prior to the epidemic may\n            help to increase awareness. Coordination of service delivery\n            at decentralized level and better communication of the\n            Project activities ensure community participation and\n            ownership of interventions. Projects with weak counterpart\n            administrative capacity require innovative approaches to\n            supervision and strong stakeholder commitment."}, "docdt": "2014-09-17T00:00:00Z"}
