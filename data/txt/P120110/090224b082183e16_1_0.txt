                         The objective of the Project is to improve the health and hygiene practices in order to reduce the spread of cholera and strengthen the institutional capacity to respond
                         to outbreaks. The Project is financing two Components: (i) Support to the Government’s Response to Cholera at the Decentralized Level; and (ii) Emergency Response
                         Capacity Building.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The Haiti Cholera Emergency Response Project was approved by the Board on January 18, 2011, made effective on February 7, 2011 and the closing date has been postponed to
                         December 31, 2013 as per Government's request. The analysis of the revised baseline and end-line surveys confirmed that the PDO indicator measuring (i) the percentage of
                         population in project intervention areas who knows the cholera early warning symptoms (knowledge of 2 out of 2 symptoms) and (ii) prevention steps (knowledge of 4 out of 6
                         prevention steps), has been largely achieved. This partial achievement is explained by the fact that even though people knowing 4 out of 6 prevention steps have slightly increased
                         (from 13 to 14 percent), it has not achieved its target of 18 percent. However, the population knowing the early warning symptoms has increased from 64 to 82 percent far surpassing

                         its target of 69 percent The second PDO indicator regarding improved access to clean water has been achieve and surpassed. Since the Project was mainly focus on health rather
                         than access to water, the target of this indicator was to maintain the level of access to safe water through activities carried out by partners, mainly non-governmental organizations, in
                         the field. The third PDO indicator regarding institutional capacity building has been also achieved. This is thanks to the regular implementation support, the continue dialogue with the
                         Government and partners, and the flexibility to adjust Project activities to better respond to changes in the Government’s strategy for the elimination of cholera.

                         The Project has supported the service delivery in public and non-public facilities to contribute to the control of the epidemic by providing: (i) treatment services, (ii) health promotion
                         and behavioral change activities, and (ii) improved water and sanitation (including waste management) at the health facility and community level.

                         The Cholera Project achieved good results (see below). Another Bank-financed Project - the Maternal and Child Health Project CH ($90 m), is investing another US$20 m on cholera
                         treatment, prevention and control to follow up on these successful activities. This will increase sustainability of initial activities funded by the Bank and fund new ones that have
                         proved to work.

                         Project Results:
                         Health
                         - The percentage of population in interventions areas knowing the cholera early warning symptoms has increased from 64 to 82 percent surpassing its target of 69 percent.
                         - The percentage of population knowing cholera prevention steps slightly improved from 13 to 14 percent but did not reach the target of 18 percent.
                         - Almost 4,500 localities have received health education and/or prevention activities, surpassing the target of 2,214.
                         - Cholera treatment has been integrated into the existing health facilities through the creation of 16 rooms for diarrheal diseases treatment across the six departments of intervention.
                         - More than 250 health facilities were supported. This includes 82 health centers and posts, treatment centers and units surpassing the target of 42.

                         Water and Sanitation
                         - The percentage of population in intervention areas with access to improved water sources or treated water slightly improved from 78 to 79%.
                         - The number of people receiving water treatment products and soap increased from less than 200,000 to almost 800,000.
                         - Over 50 latrines and 7 water pumps in Truitier, an endemic area in Port Au Prince, have been rehabilitated and are in use and managed by local community organizations.
                         - All facilities have benefited from technical and financial support for waste management and environmental protection, including the installation of 8 incinerators acquired by the
                         Ministry of Public Health and Population (MSPP), 4 incinerators acquired and installed by the Project, the emptying of 4 septic tanks, and the undergoing construction of 3 ecological
                         sanitary blocs.

                         Institutional Capacity
                         - All 6 intervention Departments have a Departmental Cholera Management Plan.
                         - A national cholera focal point and 6 coordinators at the Departmental level have been put in place.
                         - The Project has been supporting the Direction d’Épidémiologie de Laboratoire et de Recherche (DELR) and the Laboratoire National de Sante Publique (LNSP) through the field
                         technicians collecting specimen to detect cholera cases as well as the development and finalization (including recent validation by the Minister) of the National Plan of
                         Epidemiological Surveillance.
                         - The Project has been supporting the Direction National d’Eau et Assainissement (DINEPA) through the technicians on water and sanitation (TEPACs) and the rehabilitation of at

                         least 20 water points.
                         - The Project contributed to the upgrade of the national Standards for Biomedical Waste Management and the Hygiene Promotion Plan. It also provided financial, technical and
                         training support at all levels.
                         - More than 5,500 community agents, supervisors, and institutional personnel throughout the 6 departments were recruited and trained, far exceeding the project target of 2,633
