i) improve the living\n            conditions of disadvantaged targeted rural communities by\n            responding to their priorities; ii) strengthen capacity of\n            communities in identifying and ranking their priority needs;\n            and in partnership with nongovernmental organizations (NGOs)\n            and local authorities, to plan, implement, and supervise\n            actions to respond to those needs; and iii) strengthen\n            institutional and policy-making capacity at the local and\n            national levels in the fight against hunger and poverty. The\n            project has two components: a) Community development will\n            include training for the community and for the NGOs\n            recruited for community development activities; an\n            information, Education, Communication (IEC) program tailored\n            to community needs; and an information campaign to keep the\n            public abreast of project development. b) Policy and\n            institutional development will strengthen local and national\n            decision-making on poverty issues. This component will\n            finance the activities of the Observatory for Sustainable\n            Human Development, created to provide policy-makers with\n            information on poverty issues. This component will also\n            support a permanent poverty monitoring system."}, "docdt": "1998-02-20T00:00:00Z"}
