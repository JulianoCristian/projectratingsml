infrastructure\n            rehabilitation and maintenance to help mitigate further\n            deterioration in the delivery of essential municipal\n            services; and (b) create temporary job opportunities at the\n            local level through the launching of labor-intensive\n            employment generation schemes. The closing date for the\n            project will be extended from June 30, 2011 to September 30,\n            2011. The reasons for the extension are as follows: (i)\n            there was a 6 month delay in the signing of the Grant\n            Agreement, the signing of the Administration Agreement with\n            Denmark on December 10, 2009; (ii) all preparation\n            activities were completed on the assumption of a January\n            2010 start date. However, the delay in signing the Grant\n            Agreement, coupled with the fluctuations in the Gaza Strip\n            market, meant that several of the activities had to be\n            re-done, resulting in a further delay in sub-project\n            implementation. This will be the second extension of the\n            project but the first extension of the Trust Fund."}, "docdt": "2011-06-22T00:00:00Z"}
