                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The objectives of EMSRP II are to (a) provide funding for infrastructure rehabilitation and maintenance to help mitigate further deterioration in the delivery of
                         essential municipal services, and (b) create temporary job opportunities at the local level through the launching of labor-intensive employment generation
                         schemes. In addition, through the Municipal Development Lending Fund (MDLF), the Project would pilot innovative initiatives to improve municipal service cost
                         recovery (through the introduction of pre-paid electric metering systems) and leverage partnerships with local NGOs to deliver services more effectively.
