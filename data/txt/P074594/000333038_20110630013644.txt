   EMERGENCY MUNICIPAL SERVICES REHABILITATION PROJECT II

                                RESTRUCTURING PAPER

                                   ANNEX 3:
                           Extension of Closing Date

1.     The closing date for the West Bank and Gaza Emergency Municipal Services
Rehabilitation Project II (TF096990, P074594) will be extended from June 30, 2011 to
September 30, 2011.

2.      The objectives of the project are to: (i) provide assistance for mitigating further
deterioration in the delivery of essential municipal services in the West Bank and Gaza; (ii) create
temporary job opportunities at the local level; and (iii) promote pilot initiatives that foster
collaboration among local governments and NGOs and promote municipal cost recovery. The
project objectives continue to be achievable. In summary, a municipal transfer system
has been formulated and funds are currently being transferred to municipalities in a
transparent and equitable manner, based on an agreed formula; 80% of beneficiaries
report satisfaction with the municipal services; 142,000 person days of work have been
created (target of 140,000); municipalities are also increasingly focusing on public
disclosure - 56% of the municipalities disclosed their financial data and budgets, 60%
disclosed their ranks, and 92% disclosed the projects information and achievements.
Finally, the project is 90% disbursed.

3.     The Emergency Municipal Services Rehabilitation Project II (P074594) closing
date was scheduled for June 30, 2011. It has three linked Trust Funds including
TF094522 (World Bank Additional Financing), TF092840 (Swedish Trust Fund) and
TF096990 (Danish Trust Fund). By June 30, 2011, TF094522 (World Bank Additional
Financing), and the TF092840 (Swedish) will be fully disbursed and will be closed.

4.     However, TF096990 (Danish Trust Fund), and therefore the project, requires an
extension. The reasons for the extension are as follows: (i) there was a 6 month delay in
the signing of the Grant Agreement, following the signing of the Administration
Agreement with Denmark on December 10, 2009; (ii) all preparation activities were
completed on the assumption of a January 2010 start date. However, the delay in signing
the Grant Agreement, coupled with the fluctuations in the Gaza Strip market, meant that
several of the activities had to be re-done, resulting in a further delay in sub-project
implementation.

5.    This will be the second extension of the project but the first extension of the Trust
Fund.
