Original/Current Project Development Objectives/Outcomes
The objectives of EMSRP II are to (a) provide funding for infrastructure rehabilitation and maintenance to
help mitigate further deterioration in the delivery of essential municipal services, and (b) create temporary
job opportunities at the local level through the launching of labor-intensive employment generation
schemes. In addition, through the Municipal Development Lending Fund (MDLF), the Project would pilot
innovative initiatives to improve municipal service cost recovery (through the introduction of pre-paid
electric metering systems) and leverage partnerships with local NGOs to deliver services more effectively.
