The six\n            operations are: Electric Utility Management Project, Third\n            Emergency Services Support Project, Second Gaza Emergency\n            Water Project, Second Emergency Municipal Services\n            Rehabilitation Project, Third Palestinian Non-Governmental\n            Organization (NGO) Project, and Tertiary Education Project.\n            The Electric Utility Management Project will carry out the\n            urgent restoration of the damaged network, specifically, for\n            procurement of essential distribution equipment for Gaza\n            Electric Distribution Company (GEDCO) to replace damages and\n            restore the Gaza distribution network to ensure it operates\n            in a technically stable manner. The Third Emergency Services\n            Support Project will mainly fund operating costs for\n            Ministries of Education, higher education, health, and\n            social affairs but also recurrent expenditures to ensure the\n            public facilities can remain operational. The Second Gaza\n            Emergency Water Project will finance the rehabilitation of\n            the damaged water works and equipment as a result of the\n            recent escalation of conflict in Gaza. The Second Emergency\n            Municipal Services Rehabilitation Project will finance\n            emergency municipal services assistance grants,\n            labor-intensive employment generation activities, and\n            project management costs. The Third Palestinian\n            Non-Governmental Organization (NGO) Project will support NGO\n            grants for service delivery, given its ability to address\n            the direct needs of the population towards recovery. The\n            Tertiary Education Project will help to increase the finance\n            of the ongoing Quality Improvement Fund (QIF) aimed to\n            provide support to improve the quality of Palestinian\n            tertiary education institutions and programs."}, "docdt": "2009-05-13T00:00:00Z"}
