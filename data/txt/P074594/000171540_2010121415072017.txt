Re: West Bank and Gaza:  Swedish Trust Fund for EMSRP II Grant Agreement (TF092840)

Amendment to Trust Fund Grant Agreement 
Excellency:  
 
 
We refer to the Swedish Trust Fund for EMSRPII Grant Agreement related to the Second

Grant Agreement), between the Palestine Liberation Organization (for the benefit of the 
Palestinian Authority) (the Recipient) and the International Development Association (the World 
Bank), acting as administrator of the Swedish Trust Fund for EMSRP II (Trust Fund), as 
amended.   
 
The Bank has received the second tranche of the additional contribution to the Trust 
Fund from the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency.  As a result of currency 
conversions, total grant proceeds has increased by three hundred twenty nine thousand sixty eight 
United States Dollars and forty five cents ($329,068.45). Accordingly, we propose to amend the 
Grant Agreement to reflect this increase. 
 
Accordingly, the Grant Agreement is amended as follows:

a
mount defined as “Grant” in Section 3.01 of the Grant Agreement is amended to 
read “eight million six hundred fifteen thousand two hundred fourteen United States Dollars and 
eighty six cents ($8,615,214.86)”.

The table set forth in paragraph 2 of Section IV. A of Schedule 2 to the Grant 
Agreement is amended to read as follows:
