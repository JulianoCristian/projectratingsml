Some lessons learned includes:\n            similar emergency initiatives would clearly benefit from\n            performing Beneficiary Impact Assessments (BIAs) at key\n            points during the project (e.g. early on after\n            effectiveness, mid-term and closing) to help focus and steer\n            the project and draw out lessons learned particularly when\n            the baseline data are inadequate. Attractive as they may be\n            it is not a good idea to include pilots in emergency\n            projects unless they are clearly related to the emergency at\n            hand or some very important allied project objective, and\n            also have strong local ownership. The view of this\n            Implementation Completion Report (ICR) is that they should\n            be included only when the potential learning payoffs are\n            highly relevant to the emergency in question. Otherwise,\n            they are likely to be treated as a distraction which is\n            partly the case under the EMSRP II. An unplanned and\n            unheralded achievement in Gaza was the adaptation of\n            existing machinery and equipment (tractors, etc.) for\n            critical infrastructure and service delivery tasks when the\n            import of materials and spare parts was severely restricted\n            by Israeli blockades. Local Bank staff recognized the local\n            need and potential and provided support accordingly to local\n            engineers and mechanics. While not explicitly stated in\n            project documents, EMSRP II was in fact part of an evolution\n            of municipal sector institution building in WBG a shifting\n            from individual project funding to a much broader, more\n            equitable, more transparent, and more sustainable\n            programmatic approach as witnessed by the successor\n            Municipal Development Project (MDP). However, the reform\n            process has taken 8-10 years and it has required much\n            nurturing by successive and committed on-ground Bank teams."}, "docdt": "2011-12-20T00:00:00Z"}
