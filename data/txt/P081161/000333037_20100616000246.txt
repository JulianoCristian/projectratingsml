A.     INTRODUCTION

1.     The Government of China (GOC), through the letter from the Ministry of Finance (MOF)
dated April 2, 2010 (attached hereto) has requested the adjustment of the loan allocation for the
Chongqing Small Cities Infrastructure Improvement Project (Loan No. 4794-CHA), and
accompanying amendment of the Project's Loan Agreement.

2.      The Project development objective is to support emerging small cities to improve the
efficiency and effectiveness of infrastructure service delivery, and to accommodate the rapid urban
growth. The Project consists of six parts: (i) water supply; (ii) flood protection, (iii) road
improvement and construction; (iv) sanitation; (v) institutional strengthening; and (vi) resettlement.
The proposed changes do not affect the Project development objective and the outcome targets.
The total loan amount of US$ 180 million remains unchanged.

B.     BACKGROUND AND PROJECT STATUS

3.      The World Bank approved an IBRD loan for US$180 million for the Project on June 21,
2005. The Project was declared effective on February 28, 2006. Based on the latest mid-term
review mission conducted during January 18-21, and March 1-5, 2010, the project is on track to
achieve its development objective which is "to support emerging small cities to improve the
efficiency and effectiveness of infrastructure service delivery, to accommodate rapid urban
growth". There is no need to modify the development objective. The MTR identified some cost
savings that will enable the borrower to fine-tune certain components by reallocating available
resources among components.

4.      The project is composed of the five following components: water supply, river embankment,
road, public toilet reconstruction, and institutional strengthening and training. It consists of a total
of 44 civil works contracts in various stages of implementation. Out of which, 18 contracts
completed, 22 contracts under construction, 3 were cancelled, and 1 is yet to start.

5.      As of May 19, 2010, 2010, US$127.52 million, or about 70.8% of the loan amount of
US$180 million was disbursed, leaving an undisbursed balance of US$52.48 million. So far the
total committed amount is US$162 million. Counterpart funds disbursed up to January 21, 2010 are
US$ 109 million. The projected disbursement according to the PAD, at this stage of
implementation, was expected to be about US$150 million, or 83% of the loan. Implementation of
ongoing contracts is largely progressing satisfactorily and most contracts have been or are close to
completion. It is expected that by June, 2010 there will remain about ten civil works contracts still
on-going and requiring construction supervision services. All contracts are still expected to be
completed before the Loan closing date of June 30, 2012. The project was amended in February
2001 to reallocate US$1.2 million of the Loan proceeds from Category (5) "Unallocated" to

                                                   3
Category (3) "Consultants' services and training", with the purpose of financing the purpose of
financing the preparation of the new Chongqing Urban-Rural Integration Project.


C.      PROPOSED CHANGES
6.       The proposed change is to adjust the loan proceeds among items of each categories, namely
to re-allocate all the undisbursed amount under civil work category which from 1-A to 1-G, the
goods category of 2-B, and category of consulting service category of 3-B and 3-F, as well as
category 5 (unallocated) to the newly created item 1-H of Works - Pooled works for all Parts of the
Project. The purpose of such re-allocation is to facilitate the reimbursement process for remaining
works under the project.

7.     Based on discussions with clients, and the supervision conducted recently, the task team
supports the re-allocation request for the following reasons:

     a) All activities originally proposed and designed, with the exception of Yongchuan sub-
        project, will be fully completed within the expected closing date, i.e. June 30, 2010. With
        the overall project progressing smoothly, the over-detailed breakdown of each category
        (civil works, goods, and consulting services), the originally estimated allocation of loan
        proceeds to each item of categories turned to be very accurate, especially the execution of
        the civil works which have been dynamic which will cause frequent adjustment among
        items or categories. The client proposed to set up a new item under the civil works which is
        1-H as CW ­ Pooled works for all Parts of the Project, and re-allocate all undisbursed
        amount of all civil works, i.e. 1-A to 1-G, and 2-B of goods category, and 3-B and 3-F of
        consulting service, as well as category 5 to 1-H. Any future expenses of the civil works will
        be reimbursed through 1-H.

     b) The proposed re-allocation will not cause any extra activities under the project, and will
        enhance the facilitation of the future reimbursement process to avoid the potential frequent
        re-allocations among categories. There will be no change regarding project performance
        indicators.

     c) The same project management office and the implementing agency will be responsible for
        the project management and implementation until project completion.

     d) The reallocation includes the cancellation of Part A.3 of the Project (Yongchuan sub-
        project). The Yongchuan sub-project was cancelled after project effectiveness upon the
        request by the client due to: i) lack of financial reimbursement capacity of the PIU; and ii)
        their inability to find another PIU to implement the works. There are no safeguards
        triggered due to the re-allocation.
