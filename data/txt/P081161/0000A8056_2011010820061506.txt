                         Works that are key to improving the efficiency and effectiveness of infrastructure service delivery are either completed or under construction and all contracts are expected to be
                         completed by June 30, 2012. So far the project has improved the water supply in 10 of the target of 16 towns, with works ongoing in the other six towns. For the roads component,

                         the subproject for Shizhu Road is complete, while works are underway for the other three subprojects. These subprojects will help reduce travel times between project areas. The
                         flood protection work for Rongchang and Shizhu are completed while the Nanchuan part will be completed in December 2010. These works are raising flood prevention standards to
                         20 years over the five-year standard at the beginning of the project. The public sanitation component has completed 188 public toilets to improve living conditions in the cities. As
                         Chongqing is facing issues surround the sustainability of its water resources, Chongqing Municipality is encouraged to take appropriate policy actions listed below.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         To increase the financial viability of the participating water companies, the borrower needs to increase water tariffs and to increase its water extraction and resource fees to
                         encourage water conservation. The borrower is also being encouraged to implement policies to better manage water resources in western Chongqing.
