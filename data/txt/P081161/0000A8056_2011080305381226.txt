                         Overall, the project is on the track to achieve its development objectives as all contracts are still expected to be completed before the Loan closing date of June 30, 2012. Under the
                         water component, the project has improved the supply of raw and treated water in 10 out of 15 towns in the participating counties, and work is underway to bring better quality water

                         to the last five towns. Some 300,000 people now have access to improved water and the target of providing access to 372,000 is achievable. For the four roads designed to reduce
                         travel times between project areas and the highway network, two roads (Shizhu and Yubei) have been completed and have met their travel time reduction targets, while the other two
                         roads (Tongnan and Qianjiang) are under construction. The contractor and the supervising engineer should further enhance quality control at all sites to increase sustainability. The
                         project has raised flood prevention standards from five years to 20 years, with the completion of flood protection works at Rongchang, Shizhu and Nanchuan. The public sanitation
                         component has completed installation of 153 public toilets to improve living conditions in the cities. The financial viability of the participating water companies could be improved to
                         increase their efficiency and effectiveness.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         To increase the financial viability of the participating water companies, the borrower needs to increase water tariffs and to increase its water extraction and resource fees to
                         encourage water conservation. The borrower is also being encouraged to implement policies to better manage water resources in western Chongqing.
