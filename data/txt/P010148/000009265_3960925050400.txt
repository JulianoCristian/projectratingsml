1970. In this time, three credits have been negotiated.
2.       Initially in 1973, and at IDA request, a separate Water Supply and
Sewerage Board (WSSB) was created. This proved to be inadequate. Boards
in Nepal have tended to be seen as temporary creations to implement
projects, and WSSB w6s no exception. it was regarded as another Government
department under the Ministry of Water Resources, and senior staff were
often appointed by secondment from the Department of Water Supply and
Sewerage (DWSS).1/ In fact during the first ten years of its life there was
constant staff shuffling between WSSB and DWSS.
3.       The institutional goal of IDA in the seventies was the creation of
a quasi-Government Corporation with broader responsibility and greater
autonomy in the management of water supply and sewerage, and this milestone
was reached in July 1984 when WSSB became the Water Supply and Sewerage
Corporation (WSSC).
4.       There were serious management problems plaguing WSSB and they
continued even after the Board became a Corporation until the WSSC Board
was reconstituted in 1988. The new Executive Chairman appointed in early
1988 reorganized WSSC and introduced a number of improvements. Foremost
among them, were resolutions of the WSSC Board in 1988 and 1989 to increase
tariffs substantially. However, His Majesty's Government (HMG) has
declined to sanction them.
5.       The comments made in ID)A's first and second project Audit Report 2/
dated November 198u are still relevant. In particular:
"A major deficiency of project implementation was the fact that
WSSB/WSSC did not act soon enough and forcefully enough to tackle
the problem of water system leakage/wastage/metering to manage
demand, but rather concentrated on supply augmentation alone until
very late in project implementation."

urban and rural water supply except for urban areas within the purview
of WSSC.

6.       Credit effectiveness was delayed eight months and the closing date
extended three times from December 31, 1985 to June 30, 1988. It would
seem that the appraisal of the third project was premature without more
preparatory work on institutional strengthening and distribution system
management (para 3.06).
7.       The physical, instwtutional and financial performance of Credit
No. 1059-NEP has not bee. satisfactory in that:
(.l) the "as built' situation differs considerably from that envisaged
at appraisal; in many towns, the actual water source yields are
less than appraisal forecasts (para 3.06).  Groundwater yields in
the Kathmandu Valley are deteriorating (para 3.08) and after
allowing for losses, the water availability is not likely to be in
excess of 70 liters per capita per day in 1990. In certain
instances the quality of the water is less than satisfactory (para
3.09);
(b) the financial situation in WSSC is worsening and has reached
almost crisis proportions (Chapter IV). Despite IDA's best
efforts, there has been only one tariff increase (in 1981) since
1975. Apart from withholding approval for tariff increases, the
Borrower has aggravated the financial crisis in WSSC by not
providing a budget allocation for capital works and by delaying
payment of dues to WSSC (para 4.15 and 4.16).
(c) following a Royal Commission (Pokhrel) report in 1987, the
evolution of WSSC was under critical review, including the options
of merging it with DWSS, and creating a number of town water
supply boards (paras 5.18, 5.19 and Annex 8). HMG has since
decided that WSSC will continue for the present with a long-term
objective that local governments will operate and maintain the
systems in future when their capacity is strengthened. The lead
time required for strengthening of WSSC was seriously
underestimated (paras 5.02). The most significant recommendation
was for the establishment of a Public Utilities Board for tariff
setting for utilities. This recommendation has not been accepted
by HMG (para 5.17).
8.       Until early 1988, there was a general failure on the part of WSSC
to involve the public and local agencies, or integrate water supply and
sewerage investments with other urban progrr,ms (para 6.06). A separate
sewerage system has been seriously questioned [para 3.31 and Annex 8, para
3(a)] and the minimum sewer diameter of 150 mm installed at IDA suggestion
is said to be unworkable (paras 3.32 and 3.43). The US$12 million
investment in sewerage services spent under the three IDA credits is at
risk of being lost (para 3.33).
9.       Despite the foregoing there has been some solid achievements:
(a) bulk and domestic water meters have been installed on a wide scale
(paras 4.10);



- vi -
(b) WSSC has developed construction management skills (para 3.47);
(c) accrual accounting systems are in place (para 4.13);
(d) a reorganization of WSSC and efforts to improve the public image
of WSSC were introduced in 1988 by the new management (para.
5.17); and
(e)  over 9S  Z of the credit (i.e., $26.96 million out of US$27
million) has been disbursed (para 3.52).
10.      HMG is aware of the situation (para 5.17) and has indeed taken
measures to address them through the:
(a) constitution of a commission to report on WSSC (Pokhavel, et al);
(b) reconstitution of the WSSC Board with greater representation;
(c) appointment of a dynamic Chairman with a greater measure of
autonomy;
(d) formulation of a 15-year development program for WSSC; and
(e) a public statement of policy for the sector at a donor conference
in early 19'9.
IDA is discussing a fourth project drawing on the lessons learned from the
project under review, focussing on reorganization, rehabilitation, source
optimization, leak detection and on institutional development program with
financing from the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP).



PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
NEPAL
THIRD WATER SUPPLY AND SEWERAGE PROJECT
(CREDIT 1059-NEP)
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01     The International Development Association (IDA) has made two
previous credits to Nepal's water supply and sewerage sector: a credit of
US$7.8 million (Credit 470-NEP) in 1974 and a second credit (Credit
704-NEP) of US$8.0 million to His Majesty's Government of Nepal (HMG) which
onlent the proceeds to the then Water Supply and Sewerage Board (WSSB).
Both projects required supplemental financing: US$4.0 million was provided
by IDA under Credit 470-NEP Rev in 1977 and supplementary assistance of
US$3.0 million was provided for the second project by an IDA-administered
European Economic Community Special Action Credit (26-NEP) signed in 1979.
The closing date for the second project was extended twice from June 30,
1982 to June 30, 1985, and US$0.70 million was cancelled.
1.02     The Third Water Supply and Sewerage Project was designed to
continue HMG efforts to provide safe water supply to alL urban areas by
1990 through a series of projects expanding WSSB's operations to new
provincial towns. The main objectives were:
(a) to further improve the water supply situation in the four areas
covered under the second project through extending supply hours
and expanding services to a larger portion of the population;
(b) to augment and extend the water supply systems in six additional
towns which also cover areas with a distinctly rural character;
(c) to extend the sewerage system in the Kathmandu Valley; and
(d) to continue to assist WSSB's development into a self-sufficient
public utility organization and to improve the local capacity in
carrying out design and supervision of water supply and sanitary
engineering works.
1.03     The r.umber of urban areas (municipalities called town panchayats)
numbered about 29 at project start which has increased to 33 now. Under
the third project, WSSB's jurisdiction was extended to 13 towns. In 1984,
WSSB was converted to a corporation (WSSC) with a greater measure of
autonomy. As the financial performance of WSSB under the second project
was poor, the third credit was used as leverage for enhanced revenues, ir.
that a 452 tariff increase was achieved through a condition of credit
effectiveness. The augmentation and extension of water supply in the ten
towns was achieved. Little progress was made in the extension of sewers in
Kathmandu.  Financially, ISSC is not yet self-sufficient, though design and
supervision capacity has improved.

II. PROJECT PREPARATION AND APPRAISAL
Preparation and Appraisal
2.01     The project was prepared and appraised on the basis of updating:
(a) feasibility studies and reports on the:
(i) master plan for water supply and sewerage for Greater
Kathmandu and Bhaktapur carried out in the period 1971-1974;
(ii) water supply, sewerage and drainage reports for each of the
towns of Pokhara, Birganj and Biratnagar (1971-74).
(b) feasibility studies for Nepalganj, Bhairawa, Butwal, Hetauda,
Janakpur and Dharan which were financed under the second project;
and
(c) preliminary engineering designs financed under a US$250,000
Project Preparation Facility, carried out in the period January-
June 1980.
2.02     Many substantial changes were made in the process of completing
the final engineering. The original designs envisaged that an incremental
average laily flow of water of approximately 207 mld would be added by the
project but only 162 mld was achieved. Four tubewells were abandoned at
the Dhobi Khola well field because of inadequate recharge, and the
experience under implementation indicates that the project was under-
engineered at the time of appraisal. Resistivity tests were not carried
out until November/December 1983 when water drilling contracts were let and
design changes difficult to carry out in an efficient manner. The risk in
1989 is that the groundwater yields will continue to diminish as the
acquifer is mined, and given the rapid urban population growth in Nepal,
this is potentially a crisis situation.
2.03     Project appraisal took place in January 1980 and the appraisal
report is dated May 29, 1980. In retrospect, it may have been premature to
appraise a third project based on system expansion and an enlarged role of
WSSB before completion of the first and second projects, especially since
the first two projects were not meeting their institutional and financial
objectives. More attention should have been given to institutional
strengthening needs and system distribution management. At the time of
appraisal, technical assistance provided by the British Government, through
the Overseas Development Administration (ODA), under bilateral arrangements
was under critical review because of a failure by the then WSSB 1/ to take
advantage of the available services and provide the necessary counterpart
staff. Despite this, the Staff Appraisal Report (SAR) gave an optimistic
assessment of WSSB, i.e., "After a slow start..., WSSB has considerably
improved its project implementation capabilities and has started to build
1/ Water Supply and Sewerage Board, (WSSB) was the predecessor of WSSC
which was created in July 1984.



- 3 -
up operational units capable of constructing, operating and maintaining
their installations."
2.04     On the subject of groundwater, the SAR states:  "Knowledge on
groundwater availability has improved considerably through the two IDA
projects in the Kathmandu Valley and through the work of the Ground Water
Resources Development Project." However, the SAR hints at possible
pollutants, i.e., "the groundwater is of acceptable quality, but in some
cases iron and manganese content may be above the level recommended by the
World Health Organization (WHO)."
2.05     Overall, the appraisal population forecasts were better in the
third project though the forecasts for individual towns varied quite a bit.
The worse case is Biratnagar which in 1980 was forecast to have an urban
population of 97,700 in 1990; latest estimates have increased this figure
to approximately 150,000. 2/ Fortunately, there are plenty of shallow
private wells in Biratnagar or the water supply situation would be
critical; two of the three wells drilled under the second project collapsed
during the third project and production is much less than that envisaged at
appraisal.
2.06     At the time of appraisal, WSSB's financial position was
deteriorat_.ng and, possibly, IDA saw the third project as the only way of
securing a much needed tariff increase.
Cost Estimates
2.07     The third project components included water supply augmentation
and extensions in ten towns, extensions to the sewer network in Kathmandu
and Lalitpur, and consultants services. The cost estimates (in US$
million) in summary were:
2/ Some Terai towns have exhibited extremely high growth rates that have
exceeded any population growth forecasts.

2.08     The IDA credit of US$27.0 million was intended to finance about
83? of the total project cost, net of duties and taxes. For financing of
the feasibility studies as well as training, it was the intention to apply
for UNDP technical assistance. The credit was to finance all direct and
indirect foreign currency costs (US$17.1 million equivalent) and about 61?
(US$9.9 million equivalent) of local currency costs of the project. The
remaining local cost of US$6.3 million equivalent was to be financed by HMG
in the form of equity through normal budget allocations.
2.09     Under the first and second projects, IDA funds were made available
to WSSB at rates of 62 and 92, respectively. These rates were chosen to
reflect the cost of capital at the time the credits were negotiated. At
the time of negotiating the third credit, the financial position of WSSB
was such tha  T- decided to reduce the onlending rate to "The rupee
equivalent ofm l     1tVt it, tb    passed on to WSSB on terms and conditions
similar to those of the IDA Credit, but with a 20 year repayment period,
after five years of grace,' according to the SAR. The SAR states that this
should not set a precedent for the future lending (para 4.09).



- 5 -
2.10     The SAR, negotiations and supervision reports at the time were
dominated by financial matters and concern over WSSB's deteriorating
earnings position. A tariff study (October 1979), financed under the
second project arid carried out at a cost of US$80,000, recommending
customers spend 5: of their income for water 3/ had not been implemented.
In addition, HMG was, and had been continuously, in arrears on its payments
for standpipe water supplied free to low income consumers.
2.11     The SAR argued a case for a lowering of the existing rate of
return covenant of 62, and noted that low income families (in Bhaktapur)
would have to spend up to 12Z of their incomes for water if a return of
this magnitude was to be obtained. At appraisal, it was considered
politically infeasible to raise tariffs beyond a level of 3Z of family
income in 1980. It was therefore proposed that starting 1983, tariffs and
HMG contributions should be set at levels to cover WSSB's annual operating
expenses, and the greater of depreciation or debt service (including
amortization). This covenant, however, was to prove unachievable, and
WSSC's debt under the first and second projects was converted to equity in
December 1986 with IDA concurrence (para.4.09(f)). Sewerage charges were
initially set at 251 of water charges, to be subsequently increased to.
The SAR noted that the targets were not very ambitious as they were aiming
to cover no more than cash expenses with revenues. It was also
acknowledged that even these modest targets would require substantial
tariff increases over time which would "test heavily WSSB's commercial
sense and HMG's political will.' Tariff increases of 40? in FY82 and about
25Z in FY83 were forecast in addition to the 45? increase required as a
condition of effectiveness.
2.12     The justification for the project was based on least cost
solutions assessed at a discount rate of 10?. The program of well
drillings and investigations in the Kathmandu Valley suggested that well
fields were the cheapest solution for the next stage of Kathmandu's water
supply development, and could be developed at half the cost of surface
schemes outside the Valley.
2.13     Benefits at appraisal were considered to be:
(a) manpower relief, women in particular would be released to pursue
other activities, e.g. farming in the Terai towns;
(b) stimulation of industrial development by the enhanced provision of
a reliab'.e water supply;
(c) environmental improvement; improvements in the quality of water
and health conditions would have a significant impact on the
growth of tourism which in turn would increase employment
opportunities; and
3/ This was recommended in order to achieve a previous project covenant of
6? rate of return on average fixed assets in operation. WSSB managed to
achieve a 1? rate of return in 1978.



-6-
(d) health improvement; it was considered that an improvement in water
quality would reduce the high prevalence of water borne diseases,
reduce health care costs and increase productivity.
2.14     The project was also considered to benefit the poverty groups
through the increased availability of standpipe water provided free of
charge.
Negotiations, Approvals and Effectiveness
2.15     The negotiations highlighted IDA's concern for WSSB's
deteriorating financial position and the Agreed Minutes reflect this.
Large sections are devoted to arrears and payments for standpipe water,
rates, charges and tariffs.
2.16     The principal covenants, in addition to the usual onlending
agreements, audit requirements, land purchase, etc., are concerned with
finance (para 4.03).
2.17     The agreement for the third project between IDA and HMG was signed
on Sepbember 29, 1980; there were five conditions for project
effectiveness:
(a) a 45Z increase in tariffs;
(b) introduction of sewerage regulations;
(c)  execution of the Subsidiary Loan Agreement between the Borrower
and WSSB;
(d) appropriations to pay all arrears on standpipe water; and
(e) appointment of consultants for detailed design and supervision.
With the exception of the Subsidiary Loan Agreement, HMG had difficulty in
meeting the conditions and effectiveness was delayed from December 30, 1980
to August 27, 1981. Detail design did not commence until September 1981,
20 months after appraisal.
Objectives of the Project
2.18     The main objectives of the project were:
(a) to further improve the water supply situation in the four areas
being covered under the second project in the Kathmandu Valley
towns, Pokhara, Biratnagar and Birganj, through extending supply
hours and expanding services to a large portion of the population;
(b) to augment and extend the water supply systems in six additional
towns, i.e., Bhairawa, Butwal, Dharan, Hetauda, Janakpur and
Nepalgunj, which also cover areas with a distinctly rural
character;



7-
(c) to extend the sew- -ge system in the Kathmandu Valley; and
(d)  to continue to asb  t WSSB's development into a self-sufficient
public utility organization and to improve the local capacity in
carrying out design and supervision of water supply and sanitary
engineering works.
ProJect Description
2.19     In the Kathmandu Valley, the project aimed to expand on the
experiences of the first and second projects and extract more groundwater;
similarly, groundwater was to be extracted near Pokhara, and at Biratnager,
Birganj, Bhairawa, Janakpur and Nepalganj. River and spring sources were
planned for the northern Terai towns of Butwal, Dharan and Hetauda.
2.20     In the event, groundwater was identified as the source of water
supply for all towns with the exception of Pokhara where a surface water
intake was provided, though groundwater was originally identified as the
water source.
2.21     The project included the following major components:
(a) further extensions of water supply source and distribution works
in the Kathmandu Valley, Pokhara, Biratnager and Birganj, the
towns where water supply systems had bee- constructed in the first
two projects;
(b) augmentation and extension of water supply systems in six towns,
i.e., Bhairawa, Butwal, Dharan, Hetauda, Jarakpur and Nepalganj;
(c) extension of the sewerage network in Kathmandu and Lalitpur;
(d)  vehicles, tools and equipment; and
(e) consultant services fort
(i) preliminary engineering financed under the Project
Preparation Facility;
(ii) detailed design;
(iii)  feasibilit' studies for future projects (under UNDP
financing); and
(iv) training and fellowships (under UNDP technical assistance).
2.22     The project underwent considerable change and revision in
execution as described in Chapter III (paras. 3.05 - 3.23).

III.  PROJECT IHPLEMCNTATION AND COSTS
Start-Up
3.01     The third project was appraised at a period when the first and
second projects were under implementation. It was the fifth financing
operation of a sequence which included a Supplemental Credit and an
European Economic Community Special Action Credit. Start-up was slow and
effectiveness was delayed almost a year. Problems of staffing, installation
of bulkmeters, implementation of the sewerage subcomponents, and financial
issues began to dominate the dialogue between IDA and HMG. The preliminary
engineering, on which the appraisal had been based, needed review as
detailed design proceeded, specially with regard to the availability of
ground water.
3.02     As an institution, WSSB was also going through change.  It was
moving from an organization responsible for water supply and sewerage
services in five towns serving 560,000 people (1980) to one aiming to serve
1.1 million people (1990) in 13 towns scattered all over the Kingdom. In
addition, major sewerage services and associated responsibilities (in the
Kathmandu Valley towns) were about to come on strRam. The then parent
ministry, the Ministry of Water, Power and Irrigation, 4/ response to this
was to shuffle staff from the Department of Water Supply and Sewerage
(DWSS) to WSSB, while the IDA was pressing for more autonomy and the
conversion of WSSB to a corporation. Neither strategy addressed the
fundamental issues of system management.
3.03     The strain of all this began to show in system management.  The
ODA training officer (Distribution), on finishing his term of duty in May
1982 wrote as follows:
"The distribution department continues to be poorly operated,
badly equipped and for the most part without effective or
serviceable transport. Interest in training rose to a peak during
the last year but has since that time, taken a downward plunge.
This can be attributed to a sudden and unannounced departure of                      F
the Project-in-Charge 5/ who had been with WSSB since its
inception. Bulk metering should by now have been instituted, WSSB
advised me that the items required for the installation had been
ordered almost a year ago. These specials have only just been
ordered from India. The possibility of these essential items ever
being installed is now remote ....n
3.04     WSSB became a Corporation in July 1984 and a new Project-in-Charge
was appointed, it was felt at the time that there was now hope for
improvement and IDA's attention reverted to engineering, procurement and
4/ The WSSB were under this Ministry at the time of appraisal. It moved
to the Ministry of Water Resources around 1983 and to the newly formed
Ministry of Housing and Physical Planning in 1988.

financial issues. It was at this time that design changes became
necessary. In the case of the Kathmandu Valley towns, Pokhara and Dharan
the changes were significant.
Revisions
3.05     The greatest changes in the third project, as originally designed
and as finally built, occurred in water supply source works in general, and
in the numbers, positions and yields of the tubewells in particular.

actually achieved are given in the following table:

The results were well below projections; the only cost effective way of
increasing water supply at the tap, is to mount a major leak detection,
source optimization and unaccounted for water program.
3.07     The design considerations which led to this situation are as
follows.
3.08     Kathmandu Valley:  The original design for Kathmandu and Lalitpur
envisaged an average peak day supply of 83 mld with an average daily yield
of 65 mld from 17 tubewells; together with a peak daily supply for



- 10 -
Bhaktapur of 10 mld from two tubewells. In practice, the achievement was
very different. The wells produced less water than originally anticipated.
A large number of tubewells had to be dug at locations further away from
the areas to be supplied. A total of 28 wells were constructed for
Kathmandu and Lalitpur four of which, in the Dhobi-Khola area, were
abandoned; the 24 wells only capable of yielding, on an average day,
approximately 39.5 mld. 6/ In addition, three tubewells were drilled to
supply Bhaktapur with a average daily yield of 6.25 mld.
3.09     Recent consultant studies (1988) on the feasibility of long-term
water supply source development outside the valley have indicated that the
Kathmandu Valley groundwater yields are diminishing. It estimated that the
1988 existing sources will not have a safe reliable average daily yield in
excess of 78 mld in 1992. In their draft final report, 7/ the consultants
indicate:
"The production from individual WSSC tubewells has fallen
considerably and quickly since they were drilled. The capacity of
IDA supplied first project wells has reduced by 12Z per year while
the production from the third project wells is already
considerably less than was estimated in 1986. This is a point of
some concern because it is difficult to select pumps which will
operate in a stable and efficient manner. Furthermore, it results
in pumps too big for the present well capacity causing dynamic
water levels to drop down to the well screens.  This then causes
oxidation and severe iron encrustation in the well."
3.10     The actions recommended to minimize these effects are:
(a) make a theoretical assessment of the optimum pumping discharge for
each well in each of the well fields;
(b) carry out controlled pumping tests in each well field;
(c) define a safe discharge drawdown regime for each well and select
pumps accordingly from the stock available;
(d) install the pumps and throttle the gate valve as necessary to
ensure the pumping is suitable for the well's condition; 8/
(e) monitor dynamic water levels during production and adjust the gate
valve as necessary; and
(f) periodically carry out rehabilitation of the tubewells when the
monitoring results indicate it is necessary.

maintenance.

The groundwater of the northern zone well fields has high iron and ammonia
contents and low pH.9/   The natural recharge of the aquifer has been
estimated by several methods using the deta available and has been assessed
as 30-40 mld. An assessment has been made of artificial and induced
recharge and it is concluded that none of these techniques will allow the
groundwater resource to be increased very much. Treatment is recommended
to correct these factors before water enters the supply.
3.11     The consultant goes on on to discuss the possibility and likely
yields from conjunctive use of ground and surface water; i.e. reducing
groundwater extraction during the monsoon period and boosting surface 'rter
yields, enabling some enhanced recharge to take place. This would involv-
careful monitoring and additional trunk mains and reservoir storage to
accommodate the seasonal variations. It would also require a much higher
level of system management than has been achieved so far.
3.12     Pokhara:  At the time of the 1973 Feasibility Study and Master
Plan, the consultants recommended the Mardi Khola as a water source and
mentioned in passing that groundwater should be investigated in more
detail.
3.13     In 1979, the Master Plan was updated and groundwater was
recommended on the basis of cost. After further work the third project
design proposed two tubewells of four mld each, located near the banks of
the Seti River, to the north of the town.
3.14     However, consequent to concerns over tubewell discharge in similar
conditions elsewhere, the design was reexamined, and following a surface
geophysical resistivity survey in November 1983, the design consultants
recommended a change from the original concept.
3.15     The new proposals suggested the Mardi Khola scheme be
reinvestigated in detail to produce a yield of around 14 to 20 mld. This
was adopted and constructed under the third project.  Design weaknesses led
to regular failures of the temporary intake during flood, and transmission
main due to landslides. However, it is untreated water which is entering
the Pokhara system and a 17 mld treatment plant is urgently needed. The
design of the plant has been completed, but funding not yet secured.
3.16     Janakpur:  An additional well and associated pumping main has been
constructed, though according to the SAR, surface water sources were to be
exploited.
3.17     Hetauda:  The original third project design involved the
construction of two shallow tubewells on the east bank of the Rapti Khola,
but a surface geophysical resistivity survey in December 1983 predicted
yields of 1.5 to 1.8 mld per borehole, much less than the forecast demand.
In July 1986, three tubewells to the south were recommended and drilled;
none is yielding more than 1.5 mld. A fourth hole was drilled near the

- 12 -
original site to the east of the Rapti Khola. The yield was small, 0.5
mld, the water coming from near the surface, and the consultants
recommended the development of a radial collector to the northwest of
Hetauda. This is considered to be a suitable source for 3-6 mld. The
recommendation has not yet been implement3d due to funding constraints.
3.18     Dharan:  The source of water supply envisaged in the original
third project design consisted of two tubewells situated on the east bank
of the Sardu Khola, close to Dharan. But because ot uncertainties arising
elsewhere, it was decided to carry out a surface geophysical resistivity
survey, the results were inconLIusive.
3.19     Subsequent investigations revealed the most likely groundwater
sources were approximately 10 kms to the South of the town requiring multi-
stage pumping and a total lift of 300 meters. This scheme was constructed.
It is interesting to note that the design report calculated an energy cost
of NRs 5.8 million per year based on pumping 12 m1d against a head of 310 m
(energy cost NRs 1.1 per kwh). This would have amounted to 28Z of WSSC's
operating expenses 10/ in 1986 but seems to have passed without comment by
WSSC or its consultants.  In the event, the source Supply 11/ is below the
1990 demand forecast, pumping costs in 1988 will not amount to NRs 5.8
million, but water availability will probably be under 50 liters per capita
per day.
3.20     Butwal:  In 1980, it was proposed to improve the existing radial
col -.tor and road bridge (the latter to carry the trunk main).  Both were
wasned away in the flash floods of 1981 and 1982. As a consequence, the
design was modified to sink two tubewells to the South of the town where
geological conditions were expected to be most suitable. Both wells have
been successfully drilled.
3.21     Bhairawa:  At appraisal it was envisaged to use two tubewells --
one of which was existing, and install a high service pumping station and
chlorination reservoir. Later investigations revealed the existing well to
have suspect screening and a casing diameter of eight inche. (too small to
accommodate a suitably sized pump). The resulting design revealed no need
for the pumping station and chlorination reservoir, as facilities
constructed under previous projects could be utilized.
3.22     Birgani:  Two additional tubewells were required.
3.23     Biratnagar:  Except for the drilling of one additional well,
little changed from the original lesign. An existing well, drilled in
1981/82, and two wells drilled under the second project, collapsed in 1984;
it was decided to redrill all three wells. It was hoped to obtain an
average daily yield of 8 mld, but only 5.34 mld has been obtained.
10, This is the energy cost for 75,000 people (i.e., less than 102 of the
people requiring service); it could absorb over 28Z of the budget.
11/ Source supply was averaging 5.34 mld in May 1988.

Implementation Schedule
3.24     A comparison of actual schedules and those estimated at appraisal
for the third project is as follows:
Commencement         Project Period            Completion
(months)
Appraisal   Actual   Appraisal   Actual   Appraisal   Actual
Sep. 80     Sep. 81  63            81       Dec. 85        June 89
(Almost complete)
3.25     Gtven the experiences of the first and second projects, the
implementation forecasts of the third project were too optimistic; but
extra delays were caused by: (a) delays in effectiveness and appointment
of design consultants; (b) design changes; (c) slowness on the part of
local civil contractors; kd) concern over sewerage designs; (e) delays in
granting road opening permits; as well as (f) inertia in WSSC itself.
3.26     originally it was intended that construction would reach a peak in
19382 and 1983; in the event it was 1986 before implementation reached its
pear.
3.27     Sewer construction under the second and third projects has been
problematic due to density of development and the disruptions to traffic.
Despite prequalification and international competitive bidding, the
successful contractors were not up to the task. The third project
compounded the problems in that sewers were required to be laid either in a
river bed or in densely used narrow streets.
3.28     Annex 1 sets out the construction schedule as envisaged at
appraisal with the actual achievements also recorded. Some adjustments and
aggregation has been necessary as the actual constructed work differed from
the appraisal conceptions. A schedule of the major contracts of the third
project is given in Annex 2.
Performance of Consultants, Advisors, Contractors, Suppliers and TWSSC
3.29     Consultants:  A number of consultants were involved within the
development of water supply and sewerage services in Nepal in the last 18
years or so. The performance of consultants engaged for the third project
was genarally satisfactory. There have been some instances where their
performance and judgements could have been better.
5.30     The original WHO-supervised study gave the following reasons for
recommending separate systems for sewerage and surface water drainage:



- 14 -
(a) the ratio of storm flows to dry weather flow is greater than 60 in
Nepal; 12/
(b) priorities for sewerage are dfferent from those of storm water;
(c) combined systems imply a commitment to pollution control; and
(d) combined systems are generally more expensive. 13;
3.31     These views were endorsed by UNDP, WHO and subsequent IDA
missions. International experience, however, indicates that in densly
developed cities in developing countries subject to a reasonable amount of
rainfall, there is little alternative than to use the surface water drains
as a surrogate for a sewerage system, install storm weter overflows and
intercept the foul discharge. The Pokharel Commission Report prepared in
1987 concluded that the decision to go for a separate system was a wrong
one (Annex 8 Para 3(a)].
3.32     The performance of the contractor undertaking sewerage work was
questionable at best 14/ and the confidence of the highway authority and
the public at large was eroded. In part, the latter could be due to the
full cost of reinstatement to required standard not having been provided
for under the preject. The public also believed that the minimum size of
the tertiary systems (150 mm diameter recommended by IDA), was too smell
and becaus*i of this refused to connect their properties to the system.
3.33     As a result of the foregoing, most of the investment in sewerage
(approximately US$12 million), for the first, second and third projects has
not been optimized. Very few connections have been provided.
3.34     The operational experiences with groundwater extraction reinforces
the uncertainty which can exist in untried and untested conditions. The
original 1974 Master Plan (para 2.01) advised great caution in trying to
exploit the northern aquifer in the Kathmandu Valley because nothing was
known about its storage capacity and recharge capabilities. Exploratory
wells and careful monitoring of water levels and disch3rge characteristics
were recommended before going ahead with permanent construction. The
preliminary engineering, carried out under IDA's Project Preparation
Facility, did not pursue this further, and WSSC and the consultants went
ahead with detail design -- basing their forecasts on less than adequate
pump testing. This proved to be unfortunate.
3.35     At Pokhara, Hetauda and Dharan, there was considerable vacillation
in choosing design solutions for source works. The result is that at
Pokhara, poor design details resulted in high annual maintenance costs due
12/ The experience is that it is hard to achieve self-cleansing velocities
in times of low flow.
13/ This is the case in towns with basements requiring deep sewers to
intercept the foul flow, hardly applicable to Kathmandu.
14/ The highway engineers considered that the sewerage contractor was
destroying roads and footways.



- 15 -
to failures of the intake structure and transmission main resulting from
floods and landslides, respectively. Moreover, a 17 mld treatment plant
has yet to be built; at Hetauda the town is relying on unstable tubewells
with a proposal to build a radial collector on the banks of the Rapti
Khola; and at Dharan considerably more pumping capacity is required than
previously envisaged.
3.36     Poor design details at the Pokhara intake and the transmission
main have resulted in high annual maintenance costs to WSSC, apart from the
disruption of the supply. The intake comprising of gabions, in wire cages,
gets washed out during monsoon flows and the transmission main, which is
inadequately anchored, ruptures regularly due to landslides that are a
common feature in the terrain.
3.37     There were three other consultancy assignments carried out under
the aegis of, or in parallel with, the third project, as discussed in paras
3.38, 3.39, and 3.40 below.
3.38     The first one concerned a Manpower Survey and Training Plan
i financed by UNDP (Project Number NEP/791032) and undertaken mainly in 1983
with the final report submitted in July 184.  The report covered the Water
and Sanitation Sector in Nepal; the main thrust of the recommendations was
the need to coordinate the training effort across the agencies active in
the sector, viz. WSSC, DWSS and the Ministry cf Panchayat and Local
Development (MPLD). Broadly, the recommendations called for the setting up
of a Steering Group on training, followed by training trainers (managers)
overseas and later the formation of Regional Training Cells. DWSS has
carried out some training, but WSSC efforts have been limited to sending:
a few overseers and foremen to India, two technicians to India and in-house
training for accountants.
3.39     The second consultancy 15/ was concerned with a diagnostic review
of WSSC. The report cost over US$80,000 to prepare and highlights the
management shortcomings of the corporation (see para 5.09).
3.40     The third consultancy assignment concerned the provision of water
supply and sanitation services in ten additional towns. 16/ IDA acted as
Execu-ing Agency for this UNDP study which was competently carried out. In
October 1984, IDA and WSSC were actively discussing a possible fourth
project and enlarging WSSC's responsibilities to take over operational
responsibilities in the ten towns. This was very optimistic and was not
implemented in this format.

- 16 -
3.41     Advisors:  Two ODA (Britain) financed advisors, 17/ (a chemist and
distribution engineer) were in place during the start up period of the
third project, and both advisors had considerable difficulty in carrying
out their assigned roles. In May 1981, ODA were considering withdrawing
their personnel because of WSSB's failure to take advantage of the
advisors' presence and provide necessary counterpart staff. ODA, at IDA's
request, were persuaded to continue to provide technical assistance, but
wit,- iimited success (see para 3.03).
3.42     Contractors:  During the first and second projects, the
construction of sewerage schemes by an Indian contractor caused much delay
and public criticism. The contracts were poorly executed and roads
rendered unusable for long periods. The experience worsened during
implementation of the third project, and in April 1988 WSSC considered
terminating the contract. The contract, which commenced in June 1984, and
was due for completion in December 1985, was far behind schedule. Almost
four years after commencement, only 7% of the primary mains, 6.2% of the
manholes and 8.131 of the laterals had been completed, even though all the
asbestos cement pipes and fittings had been delivered.
3.43     Not all the delay could be blamed on the contractor.  An elaborate
bid evaluation and IDA delay over a letter of credit, also took time. 181
Further delays resulted from: (a) road opening permits being withheld,
primarily because of the contractor's performance on the first and second
projects; (b) concern over the minimum diameter of laterals (150 mm); and
(c) lack of public acceptarnce and a concern over whether there was a need
for a sewerage system at all.
3.44     A contract for well drilling in the Terai towns also ran into
trouble. It was originally awarded to an Indian firm, but it was
terminated in September 1984 after repeated failures by the contractor.
The contract was re-bid and completed by a Chinese contractor who
successfully drilled the wells in the Kathmandu Valley and Dharan.
3.45     Local contractors performed most of the smaller construction
contracts.  In general Litey were rather slow, under-capitalized and poorly
equipped. Quality of work by local contractors was generally poor and work
was not always finished in a satisfactory manner.
3.46     Suppliers (mainly foreign) performed satisfactorily.
3.47      Water Supply and Sewerage Corporation:  While the project
demonstrated WSSC's capability to handle the procurement of complex water
supply contracts carried out by multi-national contractors, supervision of
works and contract administration suffered from lack of experienced staff
17/ These advisors were the last of eight provided over a period of eight
years from 1973-1981.

- 17 -
and indecision. It also demonstrated its lack of experience with the
design and supervision of sewerage works and its vulnerability to
conflicting advice.
3.48     Management shortcomings in WSSC were revealed in the course of the
project and is discussed further in Chapter V. here was also a failure to
build a corporate commitment to provide a reliable and efficient water
supply and sanitation service. The emphasis was on procurement and
contract supervision with little attention paid to the performance of the
newly created assets, the building up of resources (financial and human) or
an operation and maintenance capability. WSSC satisfactorily carried out
the design of the distribution network and small scale engineering work.
3.49     An absence of planning and programming characterized the
management, and WSSC appears to have had little vision of its role in urban
development either at the city or national level.
3.50     Throughout its existence WSSB and WSSC was interlinked with DWSS,
the leading agency of the sector. Senior staff of WSSC were frequently on
secondment from DWSS, and in the early years of the third project caused
IDA supervision missions much concern.
3.51     WSSC's problems, however, should not be viewed in isolation; it
was a creation of the government. As such, it needs careful supervision
and nurturing. There is little evidence to indicate that DWSS, its parent
ministry 19/ and the Ministry of Finance carried out effective reviews of
WSSC's deficiencies and problems. The long delays by the HMG in payments
for standpipe water and other ministries in respect of their financial
obligations to WSSC have compounded the Corporation's financial dilemma.
Timely and effective performance reviews might have prevented some of the
institutional deterioration which took place.
Disbursements
3.52     Schedules comparing the disbursement forecast at appraisal and
those actually made are given an the Basic Data Sheets at the beginning of
this report and are shown graphically in Annex 3. Due to the slow start
up, disbursement lagged by about 12 months for the first three years then
widened to a three year lag for the rest of the project. By the closing
date, US$26.96 million of the US$27.0 million had been disbursed; the
remainder of the undisbursed credit was cancelled.

Status of Covenants
3.55     By and large, most covenants under the credit have been met (Annex
9). The one major exception relates to the financial covenants discussed
in Chapter IV.
IV. FINANCIAL PEEPORMANCE
Financial Covenants
4.01     WSSC's financial performance was inadequate.  There was a constant
lowering of covenanted agreements which softened the required financial
performance terms and/or prolonged the time necessary for implementation.



- 19 -
4.02     Despite covenants, actior. plans, a tariff study and a constant
flow of correspondence between HMG and IDA, only one tariff increase was
implemented in September 1981, in response to a condition of effectiveness
for the third project. The previous increase had been in April 1976. The
financial situation facing the Corporation is critical and there is risk of
salary payments being delayed now that the credit has closed (i.e. after
June 30, 1988). WSSC recognizes the need for a tariff increase but so far
HMG has shown a marked reluctance to do so until the level of service
available to customers is improved. The quality of service cannot be
improved without additional revenues. Unfortunately, there are too many
lower grade staff employed and there is political reluctance to reduce the
payroll; both the financial performance and the level of service are
deteriorating.
4.03     At the time of signing the credit, the following financial
covenants (apart from the tariff increase required for effectiveness) were
agreed:
(a)  Clause 4.04 (b)  commencing in FY81 the Borrower will pay when due to
WSSB all amounts owed by the Borrower on account of
water consumed through standpipes and shall annually
establish payments per standpipe at rates to be
agreed between the Borrower and the Association;
(b)  Clause 4.04 (c)  cause sewerage rates and charges to be levied upon
all consumers serviced by the sewerage system at a
level not less than: (i) 25X for FY81; and (ii) 502
thereafter, of the metered water charges to such
consumers.
(c)  Clause 4.06 (a)  Borrower shall cause WSSB to provide revenues to
cover in FY81 and FY82 WSSB's cost of operations,
maintenance and administration and provide for
adequate depreciation on all depreciable assets, in
operation, based upon the estimated useful life of
such assets, computed in accordance with the
straight-line method; and 21/
(d)  Clause 4.06 (b)  Borrower shall cause WSSB to provide revenues to
cover in FY83 and thereafter WSSB's cost of
operations, maintenance and administration and its
cost of amortization and interest on debt or
depreciation, computed in accordance with Clause 4.06
(a) above, whichever is higher.
4.04     In regard to Clause 4.04(b), the Borrower was already in arrears
in payments for standpipe water at the time of negotiations, and the
situation hardly improved throughout the project. In April 1988, the
21/ This covenant was met in 1982.



- 20 -
arrears stood at NRs 5 million (NRs 12 million in November 1987). These
arrears persisted throughout the project although payments were made from
time to time.
4.05     The introduction and collection of sewerage charges has presented
problems to WSSC for a long time. A combination of questionable designs,
slow and poor construction and frequent blockages due to misuse has
produced a system which has been partially rejected by the public. As a
result, little revenue has been collected.
4.06     As the time of the original project closing date approached
(December 31, 1985), IDA intensified its attention to the poor financial
performance of WSSC. Supervision missions went to Nepal in September and
November 1985 with the prime purpose of looking for ways and means by which
WSSC could be pursuaded to meet its obligation under Clause 4.06(b).
Action plans were drawn up with a view to obtaining some movement towards
meeting the covenant. This was the least which could be accepted if the
completion date was to be extended. However, IDA had to be realistic;
without continuing financial support, the project would languish. Yet
there was little prospect of a tariff increase until after the April 1986
election. Attention was therefore focussed on non-tariff adjustments which
would provide relief in the short-term.
4.07     On the November 29, 1985 HMG sought and obtained a one-year
extension to the project closing date after agreeing to the following:
(a) outstanding debt and accrued interest on the first and second
projects would be converted to equity; provision was to be made
for this in HMG's FY86 budget;
(b) water tariffs would be increased by 65Z no later than July 16,
1986. This was also to apply to standpipe water, and implied a
commitment by HMG to pay increased cost  per standpipe. Monthly
rental was to be increased from NR's 145 per month to NR's 240 per
month; and
(c)  HMG would cause WSSC to automatically increase all tariffs
annually by an amount equal to the weighted average annual
increase in WSSC's power and chemical costs, with effect from
FY87-88.
4.08     IDA maintained a continuing dialogue on this and HMG finally
responded by: (a) increasing the standpipe charges to NRs 240 per month;
(b) paying NRs 4.0 million of standpipe debts; and (c) converting debt and
interest due under the first and second projects into equity. These
actions were accomplished in December 1986, and justified a further
extension of the completion date to December 31, 1987.
Operating Results and Rate of Return
4.09     The disappointing financial performance of WSSB/WSSC over the
project period was due to poor performance on operations and revenue
collections, and the lack of tariff revisions. Annexes 5, 6, and 7 provide



- 21 -
details of the SAR forecasts and actual out-turns over the period 1980-88
respectively for the Income Statement, Sources and Application of Funds and
Balance Sheet Statements. The main issues to note are as follows:
(a) for all years after 1980, actual revenues in the Income Statements
fell short of forecast revenues and the gap widened progressively
such that by 1987 actuals were only 42% of forecast;
(b) for all years after 1983, the actual costs of water production and
distribution rose relative to forecasts as did the costs of
administration reflecting the increases in staffing;
(c) maintenance costs did not display the same trend and signified the
low levels of resources being devoted to this essential activity;
(d) depreciation remained well below forecast, reflecting the slow
implementation of the third project;
(e) interest charges remained below forecast, which was primarily a
reflection of the slow implementation of the project; although
after 1986, this was due more to the conversion of first and
second project debt to equity;
(f) internal cash generation was negative after 1982 and avoidance of
a large shortfall was achieved only by the conversion of debt to
equity in 1986 and the resultant reductions in interest and
principal repayments;
(g) drawdown of loans was below forecast until the last few years of
the project period, reflecting slow project implementation; and
(h) fixed assets in the balance sheet were well below forecast
throughout the period and had fallen to 60X of forecast by 1987.
Connections and Metering Program
4.10     The bulk meters obtained under the first and second projects were
finally installed by September 1984, but practically all of such meters on
the surface water sources were inoperable April 1988. The retail metering
program also lagged; the appraisal forecasts and actual achievements are as
follows:
Metered            Unmetered           Totals          Standpipe
Appr.  Actual       Appr.   Actual    Appr.  Actual          Appr.
1987    78,416   64,714      4,000   12,243   82,416   76,957          2,048

- 22 _
As stated previoussly, the build-up of sewer connections was slow. In May
1984, there were 130 registered consumers and approximately 6,000 in 1987
against 9,J30 and 13,530 respectively, forecast at appraisal.
4.11     The connection charges increased in 1987, now look high.  A
deposit of NRs 1,000 is required for a water connection plus NRs 400 for
the connection itself. In addition, the consumer is expected to buy the
pipes, pay for the road opening permit, trench digging and reinstatement.
These costs are an incentive to make illegal connections and do little to
enhance consumer relations.
Unaccounted for Water
4.12     The extent of unaccounted for water, currently estimated to be
above 602, is too high and, unlike many other situations, 22/ it appears
to be largely linked to leakage and losses. Various attempts have been
made to audit consumer records and trace leakages, throughout the third
project, without much success. In 1988, GTZ,23/ the technical assistance
arm of the Federal Republic of Germany, provided assistance to WSSC to
carry out a pilot leak detection exercise on a selected zone, and there is
promise that this assistance will continue. Given the serious water
problem facing the Kathmandu Valley towns, a reduction in the amount of
water lost must be a high priority.
Accounting and Audit
4.13     Commercial accounting systems were introduced into the former WSSB
during the first project with the assistance of ODA advisors and the
syst'ms were refined during the second project. Manual systems were
generally been employed, but in recent years a computer programmer and two
operators have been employed.
4.14     Throughout its relatively short life WSSB had been plagued by a
shortage of qualified accountants, and this was compounded in early 1983
when the HMG imposed a requirement on WSSB to submit its accounts on a cash
basis, to satisfy government budgetary procedures. This effectively
required WSSB to prepare two sets of accounts and diverted attention from
other operational matters. This increased IDA's resolve to press for the
conversion of WSSB into a Corporation, which was done in 1984.
4.15     In 1980, receivables amounted to 662 of revenues and this had
increased to 742 in 1987. In both instances, this was pa:tly due to
overdue HMG contributions for standpipes.  HMG payments for standpipe
charges were persistently late. According to IDA supervision reports,
arrears were as high as NRs 14 million in November 1987 and NRs 5 million
in March 1988. In 1987, the receivables of NRs 20.31 million implied the
need for a vigorous follow-up on billings, collection and an increased
allowance for bad debts.
22/ In many cities, illegal connections, poor billing performance and
government agencies obtaining water without payment, is the basis of up
to 502 of all unaccounted for water.
23/ Gesellschaft fuer Technische Zusammenarbeit



- 23 -
4.16     A major factor contributing to the cash flow crisis in WSSC was
due to HMG not making budget provision for WSSC's capital works under the
project, thus forcing WSSC to tie up its revenue funds for capital works.
In addition, HMG was not prompt in passing on to WSSC proceeds of
reimbursements from IDA. In November 1987, arrears in respect of
reimbursements stood at NRs 45 million. IDA missions' pursuit of this
matter resulted in a payment of NRs 35 million by February 1988 (para
4.08).
4.17     WSSB's accounts continued to be audited by professional
accountants appointed by the Auwitor General. The audits were
satisfactorily carried out though invariably late. They have consistently
drawn attention to where improvements could be made in WSSC's accounting
practices and procedures, e.g., the Auditors reporting in November 1985 on
the FY84 accounts, highlighted weaknesses in the areas of billing, stores
inventory conitrol and accounting, and fixed asset accounting.
V. INSTITUTIONAL PERFORMANCE
Organization and Management
5.01     Historically, the provision of water supply was the responsibility
of the Ministry of Water Resources (MWR). In 1971, the Local Development
Department of the Ministry of Panchayat and Local Development (MPLD), was
given responsibility for village water development. In 1972 the government
established in MWR a separate Department of Water Supply and Sewerage,
divorcing it from irrigation.
5.02     In 1973, the government created the Water Supply and Sewerage
Board under MWR, to implement the first (and subsequently the second) IDA-
supported project. This was done to satisfy IDA which requested one
executing agency. At the time of appraisal, WSSB was under the Ministry of
Water, Power and Irrigation; it reverted back to the Ministry of Water
Resources in 1983; and moved to the newly created Ministry of Housing and
Physical Planning in 1988. The lead time required for introducing reforms
under the prevailing political and social attitudes was under-estimated by
IDA staff.
5.03     The staff at the outset numbeted approximately 500 seconded to
WSSB from the existing Pani Goswara (water units) and the DWSS. Pani
Goswara Staff were involved in supply and distribution, while DWSS staff
took over the construction management. The development of WSSB into a
fully fledged institution offering career development and long-term employ-
ment was slow. Initially, it was perceived as a temporary organization
with senior staff seconded from DWSS. This attitude continued into the
third project and led IDA staff to press hard for the Board to be granted
"Corporation" status.
5.04     In the event, the evolution of WSSC into a broad autonomous
institution for the development of urban water supply and sewerage
services, is still underway.



- 24 -
5.05     In fairness, WSSC has not been the master of its own destiny.
There have been too many influencing factors over which it had little
control, e.g., setting of tariffs and non-payment by government for
standpipe water and other public uses. Staff numbers have increased too
quickly without adequate procedures in place for transferring and absorbing
existing agency staff; e.g., there are over 100 former employees of Pani
Goswara (water units) whose pension rights are not regularized.
5.06     WSSC was expected to cope with the development of complex water
supply systems scattered across the country and the construction of
sewerage schemes with little or no prior experience. It has grown from an
agency employing 500 staff, dealing with four towns serving 450,000 people
to one with 2,000 staff dealing with 13 towns with a projected population
of 1.1 million in 1990. In parallel, its financial systems were being
changed from cash to accrual accounting.
5.07     Apart from the early advisory assistance from ODA, expatriate
assistance has focussed heavily on engineering and construction. UNDP also
funded a Sector Manpower Survey and Training Plan, and GTZ, the German
bilateral agency, assisted with an unaccounted for water analysis in a zone
cf Kathmandu. More attention should have been paid to institutional and
management issues.
5.08     Concern over the general malaise that was overtaking WSSC led to
two studies of the management and other issues facing WSSC being carried
out during the third project.
5.09     The first study, A Diagnostic Review of the Water Supply and
Sewerage Corporation - November 1986, initiated by IDA, was carried out by
an expatriate consulting firm. 24/ Their findings of the management
deficiencies in WSSC were as follows:
(a) formal staff meetings were not regularly called;
(b)  recordkeeping was outmoded and ineffective;
(c)  proper resources were not provided to work crews;
(d)  regular written reports to the General Manager from Managers were
not required;
(e) performance was not monitored;
(f)  individual customer complaints consumed management time;
(g)  educated staff were underutilized throughout;
(h)  no formalized training program was in place;
(i)  financial reports were almost non-existent;
24/ Camp Dresser and McKee International Inc. (November 1988)



- 25 -
(j) poor housekeeping existed almost everywhere;
(k) targets for meter setting and leaks repair were not set;
(1) organizational maintenance standards were not in place;
(m) outstanding performers received no special recognition;
(n) underutilized employees slept or lounged in the offices;
(o)  the engineering section was under-developed and had little data;
(p) there was no planning unit;
(q) water quality was not routinely monitored;
(r) the budget was imposed from the top and not developed by managers;
and
(s) there were no project management units for implementation of new
water supply and sewerage works.
5.10     As a response to growing public concern and criticism with urban
water supply and sanitation which reached a peak in early 1987, HMG
appointed a Water Supply and Sewerage Service Commission 25/ to review the
situation and prepare a report (Annex 8).
5.11     In constituting the Commission, 1iG indicated that it was
concerned with:
(a) the defects in implementation of IDA credit-funded projects;
(b) the paralyzing impact of institutional and personnel management
problems as well as the political implications of an unproductive
financial burden from long-term public debt; and
(c) the unease of IDA with the performance of WSSC.
5.12     The government, however, felt that the remedy proposed by IDA,
i.e., a massive tariff increase, should only be promulgated with great
caution.
5.13     The study Commission was mandated to examine the achievements of
the three projects implemented by WSSC with assistance of IDA, and to
assess the water supply and sewerage service actually received by the
people as opposed to what was envisaged or promised.
5.14     In the three months available to it, the Commission held 42
meetings and made many site visits. The result of their deliberations is a
perceptive and critical report known as the Pokhrel Commission Report.
25/ Also known as the Pokhrel Commission.



- 26 -
Perhaps the report is too critical, but there can be no doubt about the
sincerity and concern of its authors.
5.15     The Commission observed that WSSC evolved into nothing more than a
contracting and construction agency. It had many management shortcomings
(not least of which concerned 27 unit chiefs reporting directly to the
General Manager) and failed to fulfill its mandate. The Commission did not
stop with WSSC. They identified shortcomings in the performance of
government ministries, consultants and IDA.  One of the conclusions was
that the objectives of the three IDA supported projects had not been
achieved very effectively.
5.16     The Commission, convinced of the gravity of the situation and the
magnitude of the problems in WSS, made sweeping and the far-reaching
recommendations. The principle institutional recommendations were:
(a) the absorption of WSSC staff into DWSS;
(b) the development and strengthening of DWSS into a national
organization with urban and rural responsibilities and divided
into five Development Zones;
(c) each geographically distinct town should have its own Water Supply
and Sanitation Board; the Kathmandu Valley with its three towns,
sharing many common services for water, should have an enlarged
Board; and
(d) the establishment of a Public Utility Commission with authority to
approve tariffs.
5.17     HMG has acted on some of the recommendations.  It has revamped the
Board of WSSC26/ and appointed a new Executive Chairman who has settled in
quickly and commenced the process of restructuring the organization.  He
has set up a complaints department, improved the management reporting
system; installed small tanks at strategic locations to provide a more
balanced distribution system; and started a sewer cleaning service.
5.18     Recommendation (a) above would put the clock back given the
efforts to strengthen WSSC over the past three projects. At this time, IDA
does not support the creation of separate Water Supply and Sanitation
Boards in geographically distinct towns and a Board to service the three
Kathmandu Valley towns for the same reasons. HMG has not acted on this
26/ The Board of WSSC (for the three Kathmandu Valley Towns now consists
of: Chairman; Chief Engineer (Member Secretary); 3 Mayors; Chief
Engineer DWSS; a Highway Engineer; Representatives of: Zonal
Commissioner, Chamber of Industry and Commerce, Ministry of Housing and
Physical Planning and the Ministry of Health (11 members).



- 27 -
recommendation but has stated that local communities should assume
responsibility for operating and maintaining water supply systems.
However, 'communities" has yet to be defined and no action has been taken
yet. IDA does not support the transfer of responsibilities to local
governments until their capacity has been demonstrated.
5.19     In response to concerns over HHG's Basic Needs Program, DWSS and
WSSC were transferred, in early 1988, to the newly created Ministry of
Housing and Physical Planning, and MPLD's responsibilities for water were
transfez.red to DWSS.
Manpower Development and Training
5.20     Despite UNDP funding a Manpower Survey and Training Plan (Project
Nuwber NEPI79/032), WSSC accomplished little systematic training during the
course of the third project, and there is no established post of Training
Officer in the Corporation. Human resource development is a problem
encountered in many developing countries and is often compounded by over
staffing and low salaries. WSSC is no exception to this. The more
competent staff are attracted to contract evaluation and construction
supervision. Operation and maintenance and leak detection receive scant
attention, and there are few legal incentives available to motivate staff.
5.21     Restructuring, staff reduction, more use of the private sector,
improved salaries and management together with incentives linked to
performance and productivity improvement, will have to be introduced.
Training will be an essential part of this process and will have to proceed
in parallel as improvements are made.  The importance of this capnot be
overemphasized and should be a lead objective in any subsequent project.
VI. IDA PERFORMANCE
6.01     IDA's appraisal was premature and too optimistic.  The preliminary
engineering. cn which the appraisal was based emphasised groundwater
exploitation as the least cost solution. This conclusion was based on
inadequate tests. The design changes which emerged during the course of
the project were considerable yet there is little discussion of their
likely impact in Back-to-Office Reports. In the case of Dharan, the
changes required a considerable increase in pumping and related energy
costs, (para 3.19) and in the Valley Towns (paras 3.08-3.10) and Pokhara
(paras 3.12-3.15) there is cause for concern.
6.02     During the appraisal process and throughout the project, IDA kept
up continuous pressure on HHG and WSSC to meet the covenants and improve
the financial performance. The effect however was disappointing; no tariff
increase was made after the project became effective. IDA was correct,
however, in keeping the project alive by granting credit extensions without
WSSC formally meeting the financial covenants. Too much time and effort
was expended seeking tariff increases and other illusive objectives. It
would have been more productive for IDA staff to seek ways and means of
improving source and distribution system management and developing WSSC's
awareness of its role in the urban sector in Nepal.



- 28 -
6.03     The five conditions for effectiveness resulted in delays while
they were being met. In retrospect, it might have been better to have
postponed the appraisal.
6.04     Despite the problems with the first and second projects and WSSC's
difficulties in meeting its financial and institutional objectives, IDA
adopted a pragmatic view and continued with its efforts to develop WSSC
into a national urban water supply and sanitation institution. The third
project aimed to add a further six townLc to the seven already under WSSC's
jurisdiction. Studiec were also included in the project to prepare a
fourth project and bring a further ten towns under WSSC management. This
has proved too much for a newly created agency. The perfcrmance expected
of WSSC was too ambitious given the resources available; it should not have
been attempted without more managerial and institutional support and the
background of an urban management and development approach.
6.05     IDA pushed for WSSB to be transformed into a Corporation, the aim
being to free the Board from some of the bureaucratic constraints which
constrain government agencies. This objective has been partially achieved,
and major decisions are still subject to HMG aprroval. In the event, the
number of staff employed increased rapidly after the creation of the
Corporation.
6.06     Until early 1988, there appears to have been little attempt by
WSSC to involve the people and grassroots agencies in formulating
solutions, and IDA did not bring this to HMG's attention. Similarly, there
is no evidence of any attempt to integrate water supply and sanitation
prograns within the rubrique of an urban development analysis and/or as
part of broader urban development programs.
6.07     Any further IDA involvement should concentrate on institution
strengthening, rehabilitation, leak detection, optimization of existing
sources, distribution system management and operation and maintenance
issues.
VII. ECONOMIC REEVALUATION
7.01     The project was justified on the basis ofr
(a)  least cost solutions;
(b)  rate of return of 3Z (para. 7.03);
(c)  benefits to water carriers; industrialists, employers and
potential employers; and the people in general through health
benefits;
(d)  improvements in institutional capacity; and
(e)  impact on the poverty groups.
The above were achieved to varying degrees.



- 29 -
Least Cost Solutions
7.02     Project experience and the design revisions carried out in the
course of implementation (para 3.05) question the feasibility of some of
the original proposals. In the case of Pokhara, a 17 mld water treatment
plant will be required because of the switch from a groundwater source to
surface water; a radial well field is needed at Hetauda; and the increased
pumping costs at Dharan will ultimately be reflected in the revenue costs.
In addition, it is questionable whether the separate sewerage system will
prove viable over the long term.
Economic Rate of Return (ERR)
7.03     The ERR included in the SAR of 'about 3 percent" was calculated on
the costs of the project, net of duties and taxes and expressed in constant
prices after making allowances for foreign exchange and labor shadow
pricing. Benefits were assessed at 3Z of average consumer family incomes
for water consumption, plus actual sewerage revenues for those customers
with sewer connections. This low rate of return was justified on the
grounds that many social benefits (such as public health) were not counted
in.
7.04     The ex post economic rate of return has been calculated using the
same basic assumptions as were used in the SAR. The ex post ERR was 2.25
percent. This is low, but compares reasonably favorably with the -,praisal
estimate.
7.05     There are, of course, a number of difficulties with adopting this
approach to the calculation of the ERR, but undoubtedly the chief of these
is the measure of benefits. While 3Z of income may well be an appropriate
measure of water supply bene9its to use for a specified standard of service
(e.g., for 12 or 16 hours per day of wholesome supply), the actual service
delivery has fallen short of the standards used in the appraisal. Benefits
ought to be reduced accordingly. In the absence of any clear technique to
achieve a reduction, this 2.25? ERR estimate should therefore be regarded
as an upper limit of the return to consumers. Wider social benefits would
still need to be taken into account, as mentioned in the appraisal report,
although these tco have fallen short of expectations at the time of
appraisal.
Benefits
7.06     The project did not deliver the benefits envisaged at appraisal.
Approximately 602 more water is now available at source, but by 1990 the
population served will have increased by 502. The actual amount of water
available at the tap however is probably only 30% up on that existing at
appraisal. The net effect of this is that consumption, in per capita
terms, is dropping. While the amount of "free" water available for the
poor is increasing, the connection costs are now so high that the
possibility of the poor having an individual connection is dropping.



- 30 -
Institutional Capacity
7.07     Improvements to institutional capacity have not been achieved (see
Chapter V).
Project Risks
7.08     Project risks were understated at appraisal.  There was evidence
at the time of appraisal that WSSB was not evolving into a viable agency
capable of delivering water supply and sewerage services of the type and
quality required. The risks associated with the reality of the situation
should have been clearly spelled out.
VIII. CONCLUSIONS
Institutional Development
8.01     The difficulties associated with institutional development in
Nepal should not be underestimated. The problems are not always internal
and it is necessary to review and address, (at the time of project
preparation and appraisal), the external operating environment, and the
extent to which the government monitors or influences institutional
performance.
8.02     In the case of Credit 1059-NEP and the evolution of WSSC, it would
appear that there was too much shuffling of staff, changing of the parent
ministry, insufficient supervision by over-sight ministries and government
was not willing to permit sufficient autonomy for WSSC to function
efficiently. Despite the above constraints and the rapid growth of towns
under its jurisdiction, WSSC was expected to provide a far higher quality
of service even though the service and coverage have improved considerably
over the past decade.
8.03     Throughout the three projects, the relationship of WSSC with the
lead agency DWSS did not appear to have been clearly defined, and this is
reflected in the recommendations of the Pokhrel Commission (paras 5.16(a)).
Project experience with water supply and sewerage projects in the sub-
continent indicates that these services are best regarded as a municipal
function; sometimes needing subventions from other sources of municipal
revenue. Nepal and WSSC seem to fit into this pattern.
Operation, Maintenance and System Management
8.04     Insufficient attention was given to operation, maintenance and
distribution system management. This may be partly due to the fact that
senior technical staff in WSSC devoted a lot of time to contract
processing. This was understandable considering the importance IDA
attaches to the procurement process. In a situation of scarce professional
resources, however, this can have an effect on other management and
operational issues. During the third project, many contract decisions were
delayed for one reason or another and took time to resolve. In future,
efforts should be made to make contract decisions in more a timely and



- 31 -
efficient manner. This would enable management (and IDA supervision
missions) to focus on other matters and inter alia, make concerted efforts
in regard to the problems of unaccounted for water.
8.05     Consultants and IDA staff sometimes do not have a background in
line management and/or operation and maintenance activities. This problem
can be addressed by actively seeking and recruiting consultants and
advisers with relevant operational experience.
8.06     Experienced operational professionals on their own however will
not be enough. A corporate culture devoted to providing a reliable service
must be developed. This could be achieved by offering good career
prospects, incentives and a realistic compensation package to the staff,
or by utilizing the private sector wherever possible.  The implications of
this on the management of WSSC were considerable and some (possibly)
painful and far reaching decisions will have to be taken if long term
improvement is to be achieved. Not least of the problems is the need to
reduce the number of employees and improve the caliber and productivity of
those who remain.
Water Supply and Sanitation in Urban Development
8.07     Water and sewerage projects in urban areas should not be developed
in isolation, but derived from an urban analysis and structure plan.
Programs developed in this way would require public participation and
enable affordable programs based on realistic standards to be prepared.
8.08     An approach of this sort, if adopted in the earlier years, would
probably have influenced the design and extent of the sewerage system. In
all probability, more appropriate and affordable sanitation programs would
have been adopted. To a certain extent, this issue has been overtaken by
events. The Water and Urban Departments in the Bank were merged in 198.
and subsequently absorbed into the recently formed infrastructure
divisions. During 1988, structure plans and infrastructure assessments
were prepared for Town Panchayats in Nepal as part of the UN!)P- assisted
Management Support for Town Panchayats Project (NEP/86/021)). For the
Kathmandu Valley, a broad development approach may emerge with the recent
creation of the Kathmandu Valley Development Authority.
Ground Water Resources
8.09     There are many examples of instances throughout the world where
groundwater extraction has not been fully utilized, and IDA staff have
quite rightly pressed for more ground water extraction. The extent of
groundwater availability has frequently exceeded forecasts.
8.10     Experiences with Credit 1059-NEP, however, have shown that the
analysis of groundwater aquifers in stratified sub soil is complex;
recharge cannot be taken for granted and there is no substitute for
geophysical resistivity surveys, specialist review and well testing.

Tariff Increases
8.11     Throughout the third project, IDA pressed for a tariff increase
(para 4.02). Despite IDA's efforts, however, HMG granted only one increase
in 13 years. In the meantime, normal financial performance targets were
softened, debt was converted into equity and IDA money was made available
at rates below the costs of capital. In addition, and what would appear to
have been a desperation move on the part of the Borrower, water supply
connection fees were increased to a level which are counter productive
(para 4.11). Few families can afford to connect. HMG could not
politically justify tariff increases without improvements in the quality
and level of service. Instead of persisting in making its case for a
tariff increase by a review of costs and revenues, it would have been more
appropriate for IDA to press for an improvement in operation and
maintenance practices (and possibly assist in obtaining bilateral
assistance).
8.12     The lesson to be drawn would seem to be that when a borrower seems
intransigent or reluctant to act on an issue, ft is prudent to seek the
underlying reason for the intransigence and address this matter as the
first priority.
8.13     HMG, in a policy statement in 1988, has emphasized cost recovery,
set new targets for coverage and calls for greater involvement of
communities in water supply operations. HMG has also comn,enced preparation
of a comprehensive development program for the urban water supply and
sanitation sector including investment proposals and financial, operational
and management improvements. These initiatives have provided IDA the basis
for continuation of efforts to develop the sector and WSSC in particular.

HIS MAJESTY'S GOVERNMENT OF NEPAL
WATER SUPPLY AND SEWERAGE SERVICE
SITUATION STUDY CO*HITTEE
POKHREL COMMISSION (1987)
Principal Findings and Recommendations
1.       The Report of the Commission, known as the Pokhrel Commission
Report, included the following findings:
(a) The supervisory and tutelage ministries did not conduct regular
and effective reviews;
(b) The WSSC's consultant's performance was unsatisfactory;
(c) With the exception of the Project Performance Audit Report, the
World Bank's reviews and appraisals tended to focus on the
symptoms rather than the disease;
(d)  WSSB/WSSC has been allowed to evolve into an over-centralized
construction contracting bureaucracy;
(e) The present tariff for water supply is low from an economic
perspective. However the structure of WSSC and its profligate
administrative culture does not indicate that giving WSSC mcre
money is going to improve water supply and sewerage services;
(f) WSSC's attitude to controlling leakage and wastage is indifferent
at best. There is tremendous resistance to installing bulk meters
and those installed at surface water sources do not function; and
(g) The stated objectives of the three World Bank supported projects
have not been met very effectively. In terms of performance, the
physical targets have either not been achieved or achieved much
behind schedule. The expectation of 24 hour service, pollution
free water and convenient sewerage have mostly not been provided.
2.       The Study Committee felt that simple patch work would not solve
the problems of WSSC but felt that bold measures should be taken. The

ANNEX 8
Page 2 of 2
Commission inter alia made the following recommendations, aimed to make
water supply and sewerage units, service orientated rather than
construction orientated:
(a) That a Public Utilities Commission be established; one of its
duties being to fix tariff levels;
(b) DWSS be strengthened and given national urban and rural
responsibilities for water supply and sewerage. Five regional
branch offices for DWSS were also recommended;
(c) Geographically distinct towns should have their own WSS Boards,
which should include the local mayors as Board members; other
members would be representatives of the local Chamber of Commerce,
the local Health Unit and Government Ministries; and
(d) The staff of WSSC be absorbed into DWSS (the Report notes that
this measure will mean effectively dissolving WSSC as it now
exists).
3.       The Pokhrel Commission also felt that:
(a) the decision to opt for a separate sewer system was a serious
mistake:
(b) sewerage costs should be borne by a large tax base such as
property tax;
(c) the indiscriminate hiring of consultants for work which could be
done by in-house engineers has created an atmoshphere of
professional irresponsibility, and it is recommended that
preliminary engineering should be carried out 'in house';
(d) study of leakage and wastage control both in distribution networks
and production points should receive priority;
(e) catchment areas of surface water resources must be afforested and
conserved; and
(f)  HMG's subsidies for standpost water should be paid to the Nagar
Panchayats (in accordance with an agreed formula) who should pay
the local WSSCs. Payment for more standposts than what HMG deems
reasonable can be borne by the resources of the local Panchayat.
