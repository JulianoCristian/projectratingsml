  to meet its goal of providing safe water supply to all the\n            urban population by 1990. The five year project (FY1981-85)\n            would: (i) improve and extend water supply and sewerage\n            works initiated under the previous two projects, to further\n            extend the supply hours and increase the number of persons\n            served; (ii) upgrade and extend water supply systems in six\n            additional towns; and (iii) provide institutional support to\n            the WSSB. After completion of the project, about 97% of the\n            population in the Kathmandu Valley and Pokhara and 60% of\n            the population in the additional towns would have access to\n            24-hour service of safe water. Consultant services would be\n            provided to assist with complex design work, preparation of\n            specifications and bidding documents as well as tender\n            evaluation of major contracts and for general construction\n            supervision. This technical assistance, support for the\n            in-house training program and the prudent project\n            implementation schedule reduce the risks of slow project implementation."}, "docdt": "1980-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
