The Water\n            Supply and Sewerage Board lacked the financial income and\n            operational management skills to oversee the project. The\n            Bank put too much pressure on the Water Supply and Sewerage\n            Board to improve its financial performance and meet its loan\n            agreements. This situation neglected the main objectives of\n            the project and caused several problems. Start-up was slow\n            and effectiveness was delayed. The implementation of the\n            project was also delayed due to design changes, slowness of\n            local civil contractors, concern over sewerage designs, and\n            inertia in the Water Supply and Sewerage Board itself. There\n            are many lessons to be learned from this situation. First,\n            the Bank spent too much time and effort on financial issues\n            and illusive objects. It would have been more productive to\n            focus on improving source and distribution system management\n            and developing the Water Supply and Sewerage Board's\n            awareness of its role in the urban sector in Nepal. Second,\n            institutional development problems are not always internal.\n            It is necessary to review and address the external operating\n            environment and the extent to which the government monitors\n            or influences institutional performance. Finally, water and\n            sewerage projects in urban areas should not be developed in isolation."}, "docdt": "1989-09-29T00:00:00Z"}
