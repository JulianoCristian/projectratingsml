PROJECT SUMMARY 
 
a) 
Project rationale, objectives, outputs/outcomes, and activities. 
Background and rationale   
Following the 92-94 energy crisis Armenia has achieved remarkable results in reforming the 
power sector.  It has restored round-the-clock supply of electricity, brought the tariffs to cost-
recovery levels and successfully privatized the majority of the energy sector assets, including the 
electricity distribution network.  A strong regulator plays an important role in the sector. With 
reforms steadily improving the sector financial performance, sector efficiency and quality of 
power supply, the key remaining challenge is to ensure sustainable and reliable power supply by: 
(a) shifting reliance from costly sources of energy (e.g., electricity for heating) to lower cost 
alternatives (home insulation, gas, solar heating); (b) increasing the energy diversification and 
achieving higher degree of energy self-sufficiency through the utilization of indigenous 
renewable energy resources. 
 
Presently, Armenia has sufficient electricity generating capacity to meet electricity demand, but 
new capacity is high priority, as demand (expected to grow at 2-3% annually) will outstrip 
supply in the 2008-10 timeframe when the 400 MW nuclear plant may end its operating life
1
.
Also, electricity supply is affected by aging and deteriorated thermal and hydro plants; 70% of 
the country’s hydro plants are more than 35 years old and 50% are more than 50 years old. 
 
Armenia has significant renewable energy resources, but they play limited role in the country’s 
energy supply.  Approximately 740 MWs of small hydro, wind and geothermal resources have 
been identified, which, if implemented, would represent 25% of the present installed capacity. 
Hydro and some of the wind resources are estimated to be most attractive. According to different 
estimates over 250MW of capacity could be added through small hydro power projects (SHPPs) 
that are competitive with other forms of new generation. Commercially viable grid-connected 
wind power projects (WPP) with total capacity of 195MW and annual generation of 0.55 GWh 
have been identified based on site-specific assessments carried out in some parts of the country.  
 
The existing legal and regulatory framework in Armenia is generally supportive to the 
development of renewables. Among others, it guarantees power purchase agreements (PPA) for 
all small renewable plants at tariffs set by the Public Services Regulatory Commission (PSRC) 
and provides payment assurance. A recent resolution of the PSRC set attractive tariffs for newly 
constructed run-of the river SHPPs (USc 4.5/kwh), wind and biomass (USc 7.0/kwh) for 15 
years.  
 
Despite the significant opportunities for renewable projects, private investment in such projects 
is impeded by a number of barriers and constraints, including: 
ƒ
High capital outlay and preparation costs for small renewable projects; 
ƒ
Limited access to long-term finance, lack of management and technical capacity, and low 
capital base of financial institutions; 
ƒ
Unfamiliar risk profile of borrowers and related perception of high risk for renewable energy 
projects;

The GOA is negotiating the closure of the plant with the EU. 
Page  3

ƒ
Lack of experience of project sponsors, local FIs and engineering and consulting industry 
with renewable technologies and the appropriate project financing structures; 
ƒ
Legal and regulatory barriers with gaps in regulations and procedures for resource allocation;  
ƒ
Lack of reliable information about potential sites for renewable energy projects.  
 
Renewable projects include a spectrum of options ranging from cost-effective and potentially 
financially attractive projects (e.g., SHPPs on water pipes and canals) to more expensive options 
which are difficult to finance (e.g., SHPPs and WPPs with site-specific considerations, which 
increase cost or reduce utilization; also, photovoltaics).  While the Project will focus initially on 
the most cost-effective projects, it is envisioned that it will continue supporting renewables by 
assisting to remove market barriers. 
 
GEF’s involvement will help remove many of the barriers to the development of renewable 
energy and create a sustainable environment upon exit. Without GEF participation, private 
developers will not develop and finance renewable projects. Without GEF, there will be lack of 
resources to build knowledge about renewable energy among private investors, FIs, policy-
makers, and other stakeholders. GEF support will lead to sustainable financing of renewables 
resulting in long-term reductions of greenhouse gas emissions. In addition, the World Bank and 
GEF will add creditworthiness to the Renewable Resources and Energy Efficiency Fund (R2E2 
Fund), the implementing agency for the Project, and enhance its ability to replenish and leverage 
other financing, particularly from EBRD as well as from Cafesjian Family Foundation (CFF), a 
Diaspora development organization, without sovereign guarantee.  
 
Project objective 
The project development objective is to increase the privately owned and operated power 
generation utilizing renewable energy.  
The project global objective is to reduce greenhouse 
gas (carbon dioxide) emissions by overcoming barriers to the development of the renewable 
energy.  
 
By targeting the development of a niche area of power generation capacity (mainly SHPPs and 
WPPs), the Project will increase the role of renewable resources in Armenia’s electricity 
generation mix in the future. The development of renewable energy is worthwhile since: (i) its 
generation costs are generally competitive with other forms of electricity generation; (ii) it will 
increase diversification of electricity supply and energy security; (iii) it will contribute to the 
reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, and pollution in general, and (iv) it will contribute to 
meeting the county’s “renewable obligation”. While the capacity added through the Project 
support will not be sufficient to completely replace nuclear generation, it will still be an 
important contribution for the retirement of the nuclear plant. 
 
Project activities  
During project implementation, the R2E2 Fund will provide technical assistance (TA) to remove 
barriers for the development of renewable energy and debt financing, as well as technical, legal, 
managerial and business support to a selected number of projects. The Project will contribute to 
development of about 80MW of additional renewable energy generating capacity during the first 
5
years through the following two components. 
 
Page  4
4
A. 
Technical assistance to remove barriers and support project implementation (US$3.7, of 
which US $3.0 million from the GEF
). 
This component covers the following areas: 
1.  Improvement of legal and regulatory framework and capacity building for state agencies 
(US$ 500,000):
(a) revising the existing legislation and regulations to improve and 
streamline procedures for transparent and fair allocation of resources (e.g. land rights, 
water permits, and licenses); (b) developing sub-legislation to operationalize the law on 
renewable energy and energy efficiency, (c) reviewing and amending the rules of 
acceptance for small renewable generation for the system operator, (d) strengthening the 
capacity of the PSRC, the Ministry of Energy (MOE), State Water Committee, and 
Meteorological  Service.  
2.  Support in facilitating investments in renewable sub-projects (US$ 2,000,000)
:
(a) TA 
and capacity building to local FIs, private investors, local engineering and consulting 
industry, including information and incentives about new renewable energy technologies 
and associated benefits; (b) developing a comprehensive database of renewable energy 
resources, with a related open source  Geographic Information System (GIS), and a web 
portal for identification, assessment, and monitoring of potential renewable energy 
projects; (c) field survey of potential sites; (d) establishing a one-stop-shop for potential 
investors to facilitate the process of obtaining required permits, licences, and other 
documents; (e) TA to potential investors for project preparation activities, such as 
business plans, feasibility studies, and preliminary designs.  
3.  Mechanisms to leverage additional financing (US$ 440,000):
assistance will be provided 
to the R2E2 Fund to prepare a long-term strategy for the mobilization of additional 
financing for developing renewable energy, including: (a) roadshows and conferences for 
potential investors; (ii) design and piloting of different financial instruments to accelerate 
lending to sub-borrowers, replenish funds and enhance the leveraging impact of the 
Project. These instruments may involve risk sharing arrangements like partial risk 
guarantees, or syndicated loans by local and foreign financial insitutions, or asset backed 
securities, such as bonds or other suitable marketable instruments secured against the 
portfolio of renewable projects by the R2E2 Fund.  
4.  Project implementation and monitoring (US$ 760,000):
(a) TA, equipment, and logistical 
support to implementing agencies for project implementation, monitoring, supervision, 
collection and dissemination of lessons learnt; (b) institutional support to the R2E2 Fund 
to act as an umbrella institution for CDM transactions. The latter will be financed 
exclusively from the government funding.  Sub-projects receiving GEF funding for 
project preparation will not qualify for CDM.  Since, IDA, EBRD and other funds will be 
on-lent to sub-borrowers on non-concessional (market) terms, some sub-projects will 
qualify for CDM provided they have not received GEF support. The contribution of 
CDM to project financial viability will be limited; it is expected to be only 
complimentary and is not intended to be a major part of the Project and have a major 
impact on Project implementation. Also, a firewall will be built to clearly separate 
projects which qualify for CDM to projects which do not qualify.  This firewall will be in 
the form of criteria which are followed early in project assessment to classify the project 
in the GEF or CDM category. 
Page  5

The TA component will be co-financed by the Government of Armenia through US $500,000 
cash commitment and in kind contribution (e.g., offices), as well as by project developers (about 
US $200,000) who will be required to co-fund feasibility studies and project preparation 
activities.  Guidelines for selection of projects to receive TA, including criteria to identify the 
most attractive projects, screening of initial proposals, ensuring commitment of developers (co-
funding by the developers and collateral to secure the Fund-provided TA) will be developed 
during the Project appraisal;  
 
B. Financing of investments (US $21.4 million, of which US $5 million from IDA loan, US $7 
million from the EBRD, US $3 million from Cafesjian Foundation, US $6.4 million from project 
developers):  
 
Private investors will be able to access financing for the development of renewable energy 
projects. Based on comparative analysis of economic and financial viability of different types of 
renewable projects, it is expected that the financing will be mainly targeted at SHPPs on natural 
(run-of the river) and artificial (drinking water, irrigation pipes and canals) water flows and 
WPPs. The sub-loans are expected to be in the range of US $100,000 to $2 million with an 
average project size of US $500,000. The demand for the financing is expected to be significant 
since different studies confirm that there is significant potential for SHPPs and WPPs that would 
be competitive with other forms of new generation and that under current conditions could add 
over 300 MW of capacity. Further, there are already 35 SHPPs with roughly 90 MWs of total 
capacity that have obtained all or most of the pertinent water permits, land rights and licenses 
and are ready for implementation if long-term financing is available. In addition to new SHPPs, 
there are currently 30 SHPPs with about 45 MW of total capacity operated by over a dozen of  
local private companies, which is generally in need of rehabilitation and has the potential to 
increase the electricity output. USAID sponsored round-table discussions and conference on 
renewable energy with participation of potential and existing project developers have also 
revealed significant interest in and demand for this Project. The demand for financing under this 
Project is also expected to come mainly from local private companies since the renewable 
projects in Armenia are on average too small in size to attract international investors.  
 
Detailed analysis of available resources and potential sub-projects is provided in Annex 1 of the 
Project Brief. 
 
b) 
Key indicators, assumptions, and risks (from Logframe) 
Key indicators for the Project development and global objectives, include: 
 
a)  Installed capacity (MWs) of renewables added to the power grid; 
b)  Renewable generation (GWhs) added to the generation mix. 
 
Key risks to the project development objectives and mitigation measures are: 
 
ƒ
Changes in the legal and regulatory framework, such as abolition of PPA, revision of tariffs: 
Mitigation of these risks will be addressed through the on-going World Bank involvement in 
Page  6
6
the sector reform.  Also, the Project technical assistance components will ensure active 
participation to enhance further the emphasis on renewable. 
 
ƒ
Private sector (prospective project owners) is not willing to borrow for renewable energy 
projects: There is substantial number of already identified project sites. In addition, there are 
over 30 small hydro projects with a cumulative capacity of over 90MW that have obtained all 
or most of construction licenses, land and water rights, permits and completed feasibility 
studies. With the removal of existing bottlenecks, capacity-building, public outreach 
activities, and other TA provided by the Project most of these projects should be financed 
and implemented.

OUNTRY 
E
LIGIBILITY
Armenia ratified the United Nations Climate Change Convention on May 14, 1993 and is, 
therefore, eligible for GEF assistance in the climate change focal area.  Also, Armenia ratified 
the Kyoto Protocol on April 25, 2003, and therefore has a significant incentive to promote 
renewable energies, which help reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. 
 
b) C
OUNTRY 
D
RIVENNESS
Armenia is committed to promote the development of renewable resources. Further, on February 
25, 1998, GOA adopted Decree #115 on Measures to Perform Obligations of the Republic of 
Armenia under a Number of Environmental Conventions, which set forth the state agencies 
responsible to perform different tasks under the Convention. To carry out the basic obligations 
under the Convention, the “Armenia – Country Study on Climate Change” project has been 
underway since 1996 financed by the GEF.  Until now the following activities have been carried 
out within the framework of the Convention: 
ƒ
The First National Communication of the Republic of Armenia has been prepared, which 
included the greenhouse gas inventory, information on anticipated climate change in 
Armenia and its consequences, a vulnerability assessment of natural ecosystems, different 
sectors of economy due to climate change, adaptation measures in regards to negative 
consequences, as well as a mitigation strategy of greenhouse gas emissions. The National 
Communication was presented at the 4
th
 Conference of the Parties (Buenos-Aires, 1998), and 
can be found in the Internet (
http://www.nature.am
).
ƒ
A
manual of scientific papers entitled “Armenia: Climate Problems” has been published, 
which contains surveys of Armenian experts on a variety of climate change issues. An 
information center furnished with state-of-the-art equipment has been created to support 
mitigation strategies.  
ƒ
International cooperation and information sharing related to the execution of the Convention 
is carried out.  
 
Starting 1999, the project “Removing Barriers to Energy Efficiency for Municipal Heat and Hot 
Water Supply” is underway (GEF-financed and UNDP-implemented), which has been developed 
in-line with the national strategy in restraining the emission of greenhouse gases, because the 
heating sector has a great potential for energy savings and reduction of CO2 emissions.  
Page  7

ƒ
Currently, measures are taken to develop and strengthen Armenia’s capacity to participate in 
the Convention on a sustainable basis. Armenian has participated at the 10 COPs and its 
subsidiary bodies. The country has expresses its position on participation in the process of 
reducing greenhouse gas emissions and stated its willingness to voluntarily undertake 
commitments, in anticipation of pertinent assistance from developed countries. 
ƒ
Since Armenia has ratified the Kyoto Protocol currently preparatory activities are underway 
to develop and implement collaborative mechanisms such as the “Clean Development 
Mechanism” (CDM).

ROGRAM  AND STRATEGIC PRIORITY
The project is proposed to the GEF under Operational Program No. 6 (OP-6): Promoting the 
Adoption of Renewable Energy by Removing Barriers and Reducing Implementation Costs.  The 
specific strategic priorities supported by project in the context of the GEF Business Plans for 
FY04-06 and FY05-07 are: (a) - Transformation of Markets for High-volume, Commercial, 
Low-GHG Products or Processes; (b) - Increased Access to Local Sources of Financing; (c) - 
Power Sector Policy Frameworks Supportive of Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency; (d) - 
Productive Uses if Renewable Energy; and Capacity Building
2
.
The relevance of the proposed 
project for (b) is especially strong since it focuses on mobilizing the resources of local 
commercial banks and other private financiers by removing actual and perceived barriers to 
renewable investments.  Revolving funds are characterized as one of the proven mechanisms in 
promoting the objectives of OP-5 and 6. 
 
Also, there is consistency between on-going sector reforms and the strategic priorities of GEF.  
For example: 
ƒ
As part of sector reform, tariffs for newly constructed renewables have been changed, 
making renewable projects more attractive; 
ƒ
Privatization of the distribution network supported by other structural reforms has resulted in 
elimination of the sector financial deficit and full payments to the small hydro plants; and 
 
Further streamlining of the licensing process and transparent regulatory framework will reduce 
risks associated with renewable (as well as other) projects..Some additional reforms are needed 
to facilitate the development of renewables; for example, the tariff and off-take requirement 
needs need to be extended to SHPPs on artificial water flows since their tariffs are determined on 
cost-basis and may be restraining in some cases. 
 
The GEF funds under the proposed project would be used to remove barriers and leverage 
commercial financing in renewable projects by as much as 5-10 times.   
 
b) S
USTAINABILITY 
(
INCLUDING FINANCIAL SUSTAINABILITY
)
The existing legal and regulatory framework should ensure sustainability of renewables by 
providing: 
2
Specified in GEF Business Plans for FY04-06 and FY05-07 
Page  8
8
ƒ
Tariffs at full cost recovery level
:
The existing tariffs of US cents 4.5/kWh for new SHPPs on 
natural water flows and US cents 7.0/kWh for wind, with the  investment cost of US $200-
1,000 per kW make these projects commercially feasible and include adequate provisions for 
operating and maintenance expenses. In addition, the tariffs for small SHPPs are competitive 
with alternative forms of new generation and therefore are sustainable.  
ƒ
Power purchase agreement (PPA)
:
The PPA guarantees 100 percent purchase of electricity 
generated by renewable sources of energy thus assuring revenues for the renewable energy 
generators to sustain operations; 
ƒ
Timely and full payment to electricity generators: 
Power sector reforms implemented in the 
country, including the privatization of the distribution company, elimination of the sector 
financial deficit, establishment of direct contractual relationship between the distribution 
company and the generators and the operation of a special escrow account ensure timely and 
full payment by the distribution company to the upstream generators and service providers.  
 
The Fund strategy is to maximize the number of renewable projects, which can be financed by 
the private sector; in the long-term, it encourages financing by local and international financial 
institutions. However, it also recognizes that certain renewables (e.g., PV or projects which are 
marginally non-competitive due to site-specific considerations) may deserve continuing support, 
which the Fund will be ready to provide pending finalization of it exit strategy and decision 
about its role after the initial 5 years of operation. After the completion of the Project the Fund 
will sustain its operations from: (i) interest rate revenues; (ii) revenues received from other 
financial instruments, financial intermediation, and advisory activities; (iii) the financing of 
government and donors.    
 
Most of the TA that will be targeted at the streamlining of legal/regulatory framework, at 
capacity building and awareness raising will no longer be needed once the renewable sector is 
put on a sustainable commercial development path. The funding for training necessary for 
keeping up-to-date with the available new renewable technologies will be provided by the 
respective entities. The financing needs for project preparation activities, the second key TA 
supported area, are also expected to gradually decrease with the removal of existing barriers, 
reduction of perceived risks and larger availability of financing. Project developers will finance 
the project preparation costs in the future either through own funds or through lending. 
Sustainability of other TA components will be achieved through the capacity building of the 
local consulting and engineering industry, the R2E2 Fund, local financial institutions, and project 
developers. The Fund will finance the update and maintenance of the GIS system and the related 
database from its own revenues and the budget of the Ministry of Energy. In addition, the Fund 
may start charging for access to the database and GIS.     
 
c) R
EPLICABILITY
The overarching goal of the project is to build a sustained market-based capacity to develop and 
finance renewable projects on commercial terms. The following should ensure project 
replicability: 
ƒ
Removal of existing legal, regulatory, informational, and other barriers preventing 
development  and implementation of renewable projects; 
Page  9
9
ƒ
Projects funded by the 
R2E2 Fund are intended to have a “
demonstration effect
”
in that they 
will prove the financial viability of renewable projects and attract additional financial 
resources from international and local financial institutions and other investors; 
ƒ
Capacity-building for private investors, FIs and other relevant market players to familiarize 
them with the renewables and remove perceived risks associated with such projects; 
ƒ
Development of financial markets should lead to increased availability of long-term funds 
and ability of local FIs to finance projects with relatively long payback periods like 
renewables. 
ƒ
Development of financial instruments for the replenishment of funds and mobilization of 
additional financing for developing renewable energy.

NVOLVEMENT
The key stakeholders of the sector include the GOA, PSRC, EBRD, CC, other donors, local FIs, 
existing and potential project developers and NGOs dealing with renewable energy, 
environmental and energy efficiency issues. Extensive consultations, bi-lateral discussions have 
been carried out with these stakeholder groups to develop the Project design and scope. 
Specifically, the barriers impeding the development of renewables in Armenia as well as the 
measures needed to remove them (as addressed under the TA component of the Project) have 
been largely identified through stakeholder consultations. The feedback from the stakeholders so 
far has been positive due to the beneficial environmental impact that the Project is expected to 
have, the close alignment of Project objectives with the GOA’s policy priorities in the energy 
sector and the overall attractiveness of the renewable projects for the private sector. The project 
design and implementation arrangements will be finalized during the stakeholder conference 
planned in August when the Project is scheduled for appraisal. In addition, a stakeholder meeting 
will be organized to discuss the Environmental Management Plan of the Project.  
 
e) M
ONITORING AND 
E
VALUATION
The Board of Trustees (BOT) and the management of the R2E2 Fund will have the overall 
responsibility for Project implementation and for monitoring of project outcomes.  A 
management information system for Project monitoring and evaluation will be developed by the 
R2E2 Fund, covering, 
inter alia
,
the project pipeline, amount invested, loans not requiring 
guarantees, co-financing, leveraged and associated financing (wherever possible), cost-
effectiveness of sub-projects, defaults, fund reflows, energy saved and GHG (CO2e) reduction. 
CC will present periodic financial reports to the R2E2 Fund. The Fund will collate these reports 
and together with its own reports present them periodically (quarterly and annually) to the BOT 
and the Bank. The R2E2 Fund will also assemble information from the PSRC and the national 
power dispatch center. In addition, a sample of sub-projects will be reviewed annually by the 
Bank to monitor implementation progress. The financial statements of the R2E2 Fund and CC 
will be audited annually by an independent firm. Also, comprehensive evaluation of the project 
results will be undertaken during the project mid-term review. 
 
The lessons learnt from Project implementation and related monitoring results will be 
disseminated by the R2E2 Fund through a regional conference and through a documentary film. 
In addition, the Project ICR will document key lessons of the Project.

The Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) adopted by the GOA in October 2003 emphasizes 
the need for policy reforms in five key areas, including promotion of private sector development, 
and improvement of public infrastructures. More specifically, the PRSP states “Maintaining and 
strengthening energy independence by developing indigenous and alternative energy sources and 
promoting energy efficiency.  Regarding the development of indigenous resources, priority 
should be given to developing renewable energy production”. The project contributes 
substantially to the country’s energy security by diversifying the energy resource base and 
utilizing indigenous resources. Increased reliance on renewable energy will also generate 
environmental benefits. Thus, the project will support key policy areas of PRSP. The Energy 
Law and the recently adopted Law on Renewables and Energy Efficiency clearly articulate the 
importance of renewable resources and provide framework for facilitating their development.  
 
The Project will allow mobilizing financing from the EBRD and CFF. In addition, KFW project, 
in the amount of EUR 6 million (around US $7 million), which will soon become effective, will 
complement the Project (associated and leveraged financing is not included in the above table). 
KFW project will make funds available for financing of loans to be extended by Armenian 
commercial banks to owners/operators of small hydro power plants.

The R2E2 Fund will also serve as the financing mechanism for an IDA financed and GEF/UNDP 
co-financed Armenia Urban Heating Project.  The Fund infrastructure and support of operating 
costs will be shared between the two projects. This should enable economies of scale and reduce 
the implementation related expenses.

RRANGEMENT
The project will be implemented by the R2E2 Fund, which is established by the GoA to promote 
the development of renewable energy and energy efficiency markets in Armenia and facilitate 
investments in these sectors. The R2E2 Fund will serve as a one-stop-shop where the potential 
investors can get the information and support for obtaining required permits, rights, licences, and 
other necessary documents. The project implementation as well as overall R2E2 Fund operations 
will be overseen by BOT consisting of qualified experts from both the private and the public 
sector with an appropriate mixture of knowledge and expertise.  
 
RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN R2E2 FUND AND OTHER ENTITIES   
 
The funds available in the investment component of the project will be channeled by the R2E2 
Fund to Cascade Credit, a non bank financial institution registered and licensed with the Central 
Bank of Armenia and owned by the CFF. CC is selected as an implementation partner for the 
project since it has assembled a strong management team, the CFF has a substantial track record 
of investing in renewable energy initiatives (solar, wind and hydrogen fuel sells technologies) in 
Armenia, and most importantly CFF is ready to commit US $3 million as a co-financing for 
renewable projects.  
 
Financing by KFW is channeled through local banks, independently from this project.  However, 
coordination arrangements  have been agreed to ascertain the efficiency of the two financing 
approaches. KFW funding channeled through local banks will be primarily targeting the 
rehabilitation and upgrading of existing SHPPs and co-financing of bigger projects. This 
provides a good opportunity for co-financing of this and KFW projects and creation of 
syndicated loans thus allowing further diversification of portfolio and leveraging of additional 
funds.

Introduction 
 
Armenia has a total of 3,196 MW installed capacity consisting of 408MW nuclear, 1,032MW 
hydro and 1,756 MW thermal power plants burning natural gas.  Presently, Armenia has 
sufficient electricity generating capacity to meet electricity demand, but new capacity is high 
priority, as demand (expected to grow at 2-3% annually) will outstrip supply in the 2008-12 
timeframe when the 400 MW nuclear plant may end its operating life
3
.
Also, electricity supply 
is affected by aging and deteriorated thermal and hydro plants; 70% of the country’s hydro plants 
are more than 35 years old and 50% are more than 50 years old. 
 
Following a severe energy crisis in 1992-94, Armenia has achieved remarkable results in 
reforming the power sector.  It has restored round-the-clock supply of electricity, brought the 
tariffs to cost-recovery levels and successfully privatized the majority of the energy sector assets, 
including the electricity distribution network.  A strong regulator plays an important role in the 
sector. With reforms steadily improving the sector financial performance, sector efficiency and 
quality of power supply, the key remaining challenge is to ensure sustainable and reliable power 
supply by: (a) shifting reliance from costly sources of energy (e.g., electricity for heating) to 
lower cost alternatives (home insulation, gas, solar heating); (b) increasing the energy 
diversification and achieving higher degree of energy self-sufficiency through the utilization of 
indigenous renewable energy resources. 
 
Armenia has significant renewable energy resources, but they play limited role in the country’s 
energy supply.  Approximately 740 MWs of small hydro, wind and geothermal resources have 
been identified, which, if implemented, would represent 25% of the present installed capacity. 
Hydro and some of the wind resources are estimated to be most attractive. Over 250MW of 
capacity could be added through small hydro power projects (SHPPs) that are competitive with 
other forms of new generation. Commercially viable grid-connected wind power projects (WPP) 
with total capacity of 195MW and annual generation of 0.55 GWh have been identified based on 
site-specific assessments carried out in some parts of the country, too.  
 
The existing legal and regulatory framework in Armenia is generally supportive to the 
development of renewables. Among others, it guarantees power purchase agreements (PPA) for 
all small renewable plants at tariffs set by the Public Services Regulatory Commission (PSRC) 
and provides payment assurance. A recent resolution of the PSRC set attractive tariffs for newly 
constructed run-of the river SHPPs (USc 4.5/kwh), wind and biomass (USc 7.0/kwh) for 15 
years.  
 
However, there are a number of barriers which keep most of these projects from materializing 
including: 
·
High capital outlay and preparation costs for small renewable projects; 
·
Limited access to long-term finance and management capacity constraints; 
3
The GOA is negotiating the closure of the plant with the EU. 
Page  14
14
·
Unfamiliar risk profile of borrowers and related perception of high risk for renewable 
energy projects; 
·
Lack of experience of project sponsors, local FIs and engineering and consulting industry 
with renewable technologies and the appropriate project structures; 
·
Legal and regulatory barriers with gaps in regulations; long and often non-transparent 
process for obtaining the necessary permits, licenses and other required approvals; and 
tariffs for existing and newly constructed SHPPs operating on artificial water flows 
requiring further improvements to eliminate uncertainties and attract project financing; 
·
Lack of reliable information about potential sites for renewable energy projects. 
 
Rationale for GEF involvement 
 
The justification of this project for GEF participation is based on removal of barriers and 
enabling mobilization of financing from IDA, EBRD and CCF.  GEF funding ($3 million) is 
directed to the removal of barriers to create a sustainable renewable energy market in Armenia 
and assistance in preparation of renewable energy project. 
Without GEF participation, private 
developers may not be able to develop and finance projects that benefit project partners and the 
country at large. Also, without GEF, there would be a lack of resources to build knowledge about 
renewable energy among private investors, FIs, policy-makers, and other stakeholders.  GEF 
support will lead to sustainable financing of renewables resulting in long-term reductions of 
greenhouse gas emissions.  
 
As a result of GEF participation, 180MW of additional renewable projects are expected to be 
implemented and approximately $140 million investment be leveraged. 
 
In addition, the Bank and GEF involvement is essential to add creditworthiness to the Renewable 
Resources and Energy Efficiency Fund (R2E2 Fund) and enhance its ability to replenish and 
leverage other financing, particularly from EBRD as well as from the Armenian Diaspora 
without sovereign guarantee.  
 
The following sections describe the baseline (without GEF) and alternative (with GEF) 
scenarios, along with the corresponding global and local benefits due to the alternative scenario, 
and the cost-effectiveness of greenhouse gas reductions.  
 
The baseline scenario 
 
The baseline scenario
is without GEF support.  As elaborated in Annex 1 of the PAD (Country 
and Sector or Program Background) and the Project Executive Summary, presently Armenia’s 
power sector relies on hydro, nuclear and thermal power.  The generation contributed by these 
sources varies; nuclear depends on the plant availability, while hydro on rainfall.  Thermal power 
(mostly old and inefficient plants burning natural gas) contribute 25-50% after nuclear and hydro 
contributes its maximum available energy.  However, in the near future (uncertain yet, but 
expected in the 2008-12 timeframe) the nuclear plant is expected to retire.  New capacity to 
replace this plant, as well as meet growing electricity demand, would come from new power 
plants burning natural gas (CCGTs) and renewables. 
Page  15
15
 
While there are significant renewable resources available, most of them are not expected to be 
implemented due to the barriers stated above.  Some renewable projects will be implemented as a 
result of the Government’s reforms and financing from KFW of Germany (around US $7 million 
allocated).  The total investment on renewable projects that would be implemented under the 
baseline scenario (without GEF support) is estimated at US$ 12 million financed by the KFW of 
Germany and some private investments. This will add roughly 20MW of capacity in the next 5 
years.  An additional 20 MWs is estimated in the following 15 years requiring an investment of 
$20 million. In addition, KFW will provide about US$ 1,000,000 to assist in preparation of sub-
projects and capacity building of limited number of banks that will participate in its program.    
 
This limited renewable development will be due to the barriers and risks inhibiting or delaying 
their implementation (see Annexes 1 and 4 for detailed description of the barriers).  Also, even if 
some of the renewable projects materialize without GEF support, they are expected to take 
longer to be implemented (compared to the alternative scenario below, with GEF intervention), 
cost more per kW of installed/available capacity and not utilize modern and efficient 
technologies. For example, there have been cases where a SHPP utilized used water pumps 
operating in reverse mode instead of buying a more efficient hydro turbine; while reducing 
project investment costs this greatly compromises the plant efficiency and associated greenhouse 
gas reductions.  Finally, the capacity of the industry (consulting, engineering, manufacturing and 
construction) is another limited factor. 
 
Greenhouse gas reduction benefits
:
The greenhouse gas reduction resulting from the renewables 
built under the baseline scenario (estimated to be 20MW the first five years and 20 MW more the 
remaining 15 years) would result in 1.4 million tons of CO
2
emission reduction over 20 years.  
This assumes approximately 2,000 tons CO
2
/yr-MW based on the emission factor of 
650kg/MWh and plant factor of 35%
4
.
GEF Alternative Scenario 
 
Under the alternative scenario,
GEF support (along with GOA co-financing) is expected to 
remove most of the existing barriers and reduce the impact of others; thereby making some of 
renewable projects viable and enhancing the sustainability of renewable resources in Armenia.  
 
The Project will support the following activities:  
A. 
Technical assistance to remove barriers and support project implementation..
This will cover 
the following areas: 
1.  Improvement of legal and regulatory framework and capacity building for state agencies 
(US$ 500,000):
(a) revising the existing legislation and regulations to improve and 
streamline procedures for transparent and fair allocation of resources (e.g. land rights, 
water permits, and licenses); (b) developing sub-legislation to operationalize the law on 
4
It is expected that the renewable generation will replace some of the generation by the thermal plants, which 
account for over 30% Armenia’s power generation. The thermal plants are based on old technology and have a very 
low level of efficiency with natural gas consumption of 375-380 grams/kWh. 
Page  16
16
renewable energy and energy efficiency, (c) reviewing and amending the rules of 
acceptance for small renewable generation for the system operator, (d) strengthening the 
capacity of the PSRC, the Ministry of Energy (MOE), State Water Committee, and 
Meteorological  Service.  
2.  Support in facilitating investments in renewable sub-projects (US$ 2,000,000)
:
(a) TA 
and capacity building to local FIs, private investors, local engineering and consulting 
industry, including information and incentives about new renewable energy technologies 
and associated benefits; (b) developing a comprehensive database of renewable energy 
resources, with a related open source  Geographic Information System (GIS), and a web 
portal for identification, assessment, and monitoring of potential renewable energy 
projects; (c) field survey of potential sites; (d) establishing a one-stop-shop for potential 
investors to facilitate the process of obtaining required permits, licences, and other 
documents; (e) TA to potential investors for project preparation activities, such as 
business plans, feasibility studies, and preliminary designs.  
3.  Mechanisms to leverage additional financing (US$ 440,000):
assistance will be provided 
to the R2E2 Fund to prepare a long-term strategy for the mobilization of additional 
financing for developing renewable energy, including: (a) roadshows and conferences for 
potential investors; (ii) design and piloting of different financial instruments to accelerate 
lending to sub-borrowers, replenish funds and enhance the leveraging impact of the 
Project. These instruments may involve risk sharing arrangements like partial risk 
guarantees, or asset backed securities, such as bonds or other suitable marketable 
instruments secured against the portfolio of renewable projects by the R2E2 Fund.  
4.  Project implementation and monitoring (US$ 760,000):
(a) TA, equipment, and logistical 
support to implementing agencies for project implementation, monitoring, supervision, 
collection and dissemination of lessons learnt; (b) institutional support to the R2E2 Fund 
to act as an umbrella institution for CDM transactions.  The latter one will be financed 
exclusively by Government funds. 
B. Investments in renewable projects:  
As a result of GEF participation  during the initial five years, approximately 80MW of small 
renewable capacity will be built requiring an investment of $42 million in addition to what is 
projected for the baseline (US $5 million from IDA, US $7 million from EBRD, US $3 million 
from CFF, and US $27 million from private investors and local financial institutions), which are 
not expected to participate without GEF; 40 MWs will be the result of Component A (Technical 
Assistance to remove barriers and assist in project preparation) and an additional 40 MWs a 
combination of Components A and B (TA and Direct Investment in projects).  Approximately 
50% of the projects will be new run-of the river SHPPs, 30% will be SHPPs on artificial water 
flows, and the remaining will be wind power generation. SHPPs on artificial water flows are 
estimated to cost US $150-350/kW (mean value: $300/kW), run-of-the-river SHPPs are 
estimated to cost US $400-800/kW (mean value: $500/kW), and WPPs are estimated to cost in 
the range of US $900-1200/kW (mean value: $1,000/kW). 
 
Projects which are expected to be implemented under the alternative scenario include: 
·
Rehabilitation and upgrading of existing SHPPs;
 
Page  17
17
·
Run-of-the-river SHPPs; 
·
SHPPs on artificial water flows (drinking water and irrigation pipes and canals); 
·
WPPs; and 
·
Other renewables, which could not be implemented without the removal of the stated 
barriers or; due to marginal cost-effectiveness and financial viability.
 
After the initial five years, 100 MWs of additional SHPPS and WPPs are expected to be built 
from the interest earned by the R2E2 Fund and CC, as well as the re-paid principal and leveraged 
financing. This would require an investment of US $100 million; approximately US$30 million 
of which will come from re-paid principal and interest earned and the remaining US $70 million 
from project sponsors and other financial sources.   
 
These projects represent additional investments of US$142 million that would have not 
materialized without the removal of barriers supported by GEF and the funding by the R2E2 
Fund.
 
Greenhouse gas reduction benefits:
Under the Alternative (with the project) scenario, the 
greenhouse gas reduction will increase (above and beyond the baseline level) by 6.2 million tons 
of CO
2
over a 20-year period: 
·
3.2
million tons CO
2
over a period of 20 years (160,000 tons CO
2
/yr) from the 80 MWs 
built in the initial five years of the R2E2 Fund operation; and 
·
3.0
million tons of CO
2
emission reductions over a 15-year period from the 100 MWs 
built after the initial five years of the R2E2 Fund operation. 
 
Under a more optimistic scenario, assuming emission factor of 720kg/MWh and plant factor of 
40% (yielding greenhouse gas reduction of 2,500 tons CO
2
/yr-MW), the additional cumulative 
reductions brought by the GEF project case will amount 7.75 million tons of CO
2
.
Local Benefits
:
This includes: (i) reduction in local pollution (mainly NOx emissions from 
natural gas-fired power plants); (ii) employment 
in rural areas; (iii) reduction of the country’s 
vulnerability associated with the reliance on unstable supply of fuel; (iv) contribution to the 
GOA’s policy to diversify electricity generation and increase energy security; (v) reduction of 
foreign exchange requirements associated with the purchase of natural gas; (vi) facilitation of 
private sector development. 
 
Also, the project will have a positive impact on Armenia’s consulting and manufacturing 
industry, as well as the financial sector. The R2E2 Fund will actively seek co-financing from 
other FIs. The project will build the institutional capacity and know-how in planning, assessing, 
and financing renewable projects.  Also, the private sector would be interested and will have the 
experience to develop renewable energy projects.  Finally, new financial instruments will be 
available, such as partial risk guarantee, asset backed securities, etc.  
 
Incremental Costs and Benefits 
 
A
summary of the costs and benefits is presented also in the following Table.  Since GEF will 
contribute $3 million, the unit abatement cost works out to US$0.48 per ton of CO2 removed.

higher leveraging ratio.  
 
Poor repayment rate may indicate CC’s 
weaknesses in due diligence process of 
sub-projects, eligibility and selection 
criteria of beneficiaries, monitoring 
mechanisms and inadequate collateral 
requirements. Additional capacity 
building of CC and revision of due 
diligence and credit assessment 
mechanisms might be necessary.

constraints, Unfamiliar risk profile of borrowers and related perception of high risk, Lack of 
experience, Legal and regulatory barriers, Lack of reliable information about potential sites for 
renewable energy projects. The PAD provides adequate justification that these are indeed the 
relevant barriers. The approach taken also appears to be well oriented towards reducing these 
barriers.  
 
2. Has the most appropriate and effective approach been used to reduce the costs of the 
technologies? 
 
The costs of the technologies (mainly hydro and wind power) depend on factors that are not country 
specific. However, project identification and development costs are indeed country specific and can 
add a substantial amount to the direct costs of the technologies. The technical assistance components 
of the proposed project appear to be well oriented to reducing these indirect costs. Quite a 
substantial part of the proposed budget ($1.6 million) is directed to capacity building and related 
activities. 
 
3.  Was the potential market determined on the basis of RETs data and databases? 
 
The potential market for RETs was determined in previous work, as part of the PDF-B grant, a study 
sponsored by the US-
AID, as well as other studies. These included a “technical and financial 
feasibility assessment of an initial portfolio of bankable projects.” Potential hydro and wind power 
projects are listed in the PAD (Annex 1, Tables 2 and 3). Moreover, the project proposes to create an 
extended data base on renewable energy, based on GIS.  
 
4. Has an evaluation of the demand-side mechanisms to support after sales-service been 
undertaken? 
Page  26
Project Executive Summary Template: Version 2 
 
December 2003
 
26
 
The technologies for renewable power generation connected to the grid are on the supply side, so 
that no specific demand-side activities are needed for implementing the proposed projects.  
 
5.  Adequacy of the financing mechanism?   
 
The PAD reports that there are guaranteed support prices for renewable electricity so that projects 
are likely to be profitable for the investors. However, securing initial financing is a problem because 
of the small and undeveloped capital markets in Armenia. Moreover, loans for individual projects 
are too small for international FIs. Thus the project proposes the creation of a local FI for providing 
the loans, with larger-scale financing from the World Bank (IDA), EBRD, and other sources. This 
mechanism appears to be adequate. A financial institution for renewable energy projects has been 
shown to be highly successful in India (Indian Renewable Energy Development Authority). Such a 
specialized bank, with adequately trained staff, could overcome one of the barriers facing the 
financing of small, renewable power projects: lack of experience of traditional lending institutions. 
Thus, the financing mechanism proposed appears to be entirely adequate. 
 
6.  Adequacy of the introduced financial incentives?   
 
The proposed project introduces no financial incentives in the form of subsidies for renewable 
power projects. Such subsidies may not lead to the creation of a sustainable infrastructure for 
renewable energy projects. By focusing attention on reducing barriers and therefore the transaction 
costs of project identification, financing, and implementation, the proposed project paves the way to 
sustainability. 
 
Team response: 
In addition, the project addresses the liquidity of the financial sector by providing 
long maturity funds to project developers.
 
7.  Comments on the design of demonstration project?   
 
The technologies involved are fairly well known worldwide. Thus there is no need for technology 
demonstration, and the project proposes none. However, the IDA loan component associated with 
the GEF grant includes financing of a number of renewable power projects. This demonstration of 
project financing is important to induce other lenders to commit financing to renewable power 
projects in Armenia, which is an essential component of creating a sustainable infrastructure for 
project development in the future. 
 
8.  Will a process be put in place to monitor the project? 
 
The monitoring parameters and process indicated in Annex 3 appear to be excellent. 
 
9.  Is the barrier removal supported by an underlying policy framework? 
 
Armenia already has certain laws and regulations in place that recognize the benefits of, and provide 
special incentives to, renewable power projects. The technical assistance included in the proposed 
project includes a component for the improvement of legal and regulatory framework and capacity
Page  27
Project Executive Summary Template: Version 2 
 
December 2003
 
27
building for state agencies. This component should help remove institutional barriers to renewable 
power. 
 
10. Is the proposed activity feasible from an engineering and technical perspective? 
 
The project activities involve the promotion of off-the-shelf technologies for renewable power 
generation, so that there are no fundamental engineering or technical obstacles. The proposed 
project includes a significant capacity building component. The training to be provided would 
enable local technical professionals to implement potential projects. 
 
Identification of global environmental benefits
Global benefits are expressed in reduced emission of green-house gas. However, auxiliary benefits 
may occur in other areas such as land degradation and biodiversity. 
 
The PAD, Annex 15, Incremental Cost Analysis claims that CO2 emissions reductions from 
renewable power to be 2,500 tons CO
2
/yr-
MW, citing a “Memo by PA Governmental Services to 
The World Bank dated October 30, 2003.” This reviewer has made an independent estimate of 
project economics and emissions reductions, shown below.

Assuming that the renewable power project displaces CCGT power stations, we would expect the 
emissions factor to be no more than 500 kg/MWh, as shown in the table above. A total capacity of 
80 MW would then reduce CO
2
emissions by 122,640 tonnes per year. This is equivalent to 1,533 
tCO
2
/MW-yr. This is the highest possible emissions factor that may be reasonably considered. Some 
of the electricity generated by projects supported by this initiative may offset generation from large 
hydro, in which case the average emissions factor would be lower than this value. The value of 
2,500 tCO
2
/MW-yr (given in the PAD, Annex 15: Incremental cost analysis) appears to be 
excessively high, assuming either low efficiency power plants (e.g. natural gas open cycle gas 
turbines) or high carbon content fuels (petroleum or coal). The use of these alternative generation 
technologies is not supported by the documentation presented in this PAD and Annexes. Please 
check the PA Memo and revise the estimate. Note, however, that even with lower
emissions 
Page  28
Project Executive Summary Template: Version 2

28
reductions, abatement cost is likely to be quite low (see Annex 15, sub-section of incremental costs), 
perhaps rising to $1.15 per tCO
2
.
Team response: 
Emission reductions were estimated assuming that renewable generation will 
replace some of the generation by the thermal plants, which account for over 30 percent of power 
generation in Armenia. The thermal plants are based on old technology and have low level of 
efficiency with natural gas consumption of 375-380 grams/kWh. Therefore, the emission factor of 
700kg/MWh was used. In addition, since hydro plants are expected to represent most of the added 
renewable generation capacity (including hydros on water pipes and canals with capacity factors 
often close to 100%), the average plant factor was assumed 40 percent. However, based on the 
reviewer’s comments the project team will revise the preliminary estimates and use base case 
scenario with emission factor of 650kg/MWh and 35% plant factor (yielding annual emission 
reductions of around 2,000 tCO2 per MW).  A more detail assessment of the GHG reduction 
potential will be carried out during the project preparation and implementation, and will follow 
Kyoto Protocol and Marrakech Accords procedures/requirements re. CDM projects. Among others, 
it will be assessed whether new CCGT plants that might be constructed in the future should be used 
in the base case scenario, in which cases a lower emission factor may need to be used.  As the 
reviewer pointed out, the cost-effectiveness ($/ton of CO2 removed) is still expected to remain quite 
low.
 
How does the project fit within the context of the goals of the GEF
Operational Programmes detail the strategic considerations in the focal area and outline the type of 
activities and approaches GEF supports to address long-term programme priorities of the 
Conventions to mitigate climate change. Addressing this question requires the knowledge of the 
Operational Strategy and Programmes of the GEF. 
 
The proposed project fits in perfectly with Operational Program #6: 
Promoting the adoption of 
renewable energy by removing barriers and reducing implementation costs.
 GEF Business Plans for 
FY04-06 and FY05-07 identify four Strategic Priorities. The proposed project is consistent with 
three of these priorities, and a part of the fourth.  
 
Regional Context
The regional context is generally less relevant in the Climate Change focal area than in Biodiversity 
and International Waters. 
 
Renewable power generation depends on local resources, and thus the regional context is not 
relevant except for hydropower projects on rivers that are national boundaries. This issue is 
mentioned further below in “Secondary issues: Other beneficial or damaging environmental 
effects.” In all other ways the impact of the project in the regional context is highly positive. 
Armenia imports energy from other countries, and some of this import takes place through countries 
where there is a potential for conflict. The increased dependence on local energy resources, as a 
consequence of this project, would reduce the potential impact of supply disruptions arising from 
foreign suppliers as well as countries through which energy must pass in order to reach Armenia.

Replicability of the project
A
key assumption is that a successful market application in one country will be replicated widely in 
other countries where the same market applications have significant GHG 
–
reduction potential. 
Therefore, to the degree possible, GEF supports the type of barrier removal mechanisms that are 
transferable to other countries. 
 
The project design takes into account the experience of other countries 
—in the region and 
elsewhere— in promoting renewable power projects. It is expected that this project would contribute 
to a growing body of experience that will be available to other countries. 
 
Sustainability of the project
Relates to removing all barriers and not to merely subsidizing. In some instances projects merely 
surmount a barrier while leaving it in place.   
 
Questions that could be raised: 
 
1.  Continuity of the generation systems after the subsidies and the intervention? 
 
There appears to be relatively high purchase prices for renewable power projects. In Annex 1 text 
prior to Table 2 states: “…attractive tariffs for newly constructed SHPPs operating on natural water 
flows (4.5 cents/kWh) and wind, biomass and waste (7 cents/kWh) until 2016.” This reviewer 
estimates conventional power generation is likely to be 3 cents/kWh, using natural gas combined 
cycle power plants, considering relatively low gas prices. Annex 9 provides estimates of CCGT 
generation for a specific project, to be 6 cents/kWh, considering relatively high gas prices. The PAD 
mentions elsewhere that, following reforms, the tariffs are cost based. It is not clear where the 
subsidy or price support for renewable power would come from. If they are from general revenues, 
this means that other public expenses would be reduced. Alternatively, these subsidies could be 
based on a carbon tax on, say non-renewable power generation, in which case, the cross subsidy 
would be limited to the power sector, in effect internalizing externalities associated with imported, 
non-renewable fuels. While the nature of the cross-subsidy appears to be existing prior to, and 
therefore not a part of, the proposed project, the PAD should clarify the nature of the subsidy, since 
it affects sustainability. 
 
Team response: 
There are no state subsidies to the power sector and no subsidies are anticipated as 
a
result of the Project. SHPP tariffs are competitive with other forms of generation (with tariffs for 
SHPPs on artificial water flows below USc 3.5/kWh and tariffs for run-of-the-river SHPPs at USc 
4.5/kWh). The weighted average tariff for all the renewable sub-projects to be financed is assessed 
at USc 4.3/kWh (assuming that the financing will be allocated in the following proportions: 50% to 
run-of-the-river SHPPs, 30% to SHPPs on artificial water flows and 20% to WPPs), which is 
comparable to the costs of thermal generation. While the tariffs for some renewables (wind) are not 
competitive, supporting their implementation is important because they contribute towards a 
“renewable obligation”. Finally, the addition of renewable capacity will be gradual and the 
contribution to the energy mix in the beginning will be very small; therefore the impact of 
increasing renewable generation on end-user tariffs will be small, if any.

2.  Has an appropriate cost recovery been demonstrated? 
 
Economic and financial analysis adequately demonstrates cost recovery for typical projects. Of 
course, economics for renewable power projects are site specific, so that the analysis would only be 
valid where the natural resource and site conditions are adequate for project development. Adequate 
cost recovery also requires a power purchase agreement (PPA) with adequate purchase prices for 
renewable power. This was discussed in the previous point. 
 
3.  Has the question of competitiveness been raised? 
 
The question of competitiveness may arise in different contexts. In the first place, the project gives 
preference to those renewable power technologies that are most likely to be competitive with 
conventional alternatives (based on fossil fuels, large hydro or nuclear). Another context is 
competitive procurement. Procurement arrangements are discussed in Annex 8. In the question of 
competitive bidding, the proposed project would follow the 2004 World Bank guidelines. These 
guidelines cover procurement of works, goods, consulting and non-consulting services, etc. These 
are deemed to be adequate in ensuring transparency as well minimizing overall costs through 
competition. However, please note that in the reviewed version many of the detailed parameters in 
Annex 8 are missing. These will need to be completed prior to the finalization of the PAD. 
The procurement arrangements will be finalized during the appraisal. The procurement rules will be 
based on the World Bank rules but will allow sufficient flexibility to reduce transaction cot and 
preparation time and get low cost.  
 
4. Has the project taken an approach that stresses continuity for the institutional logistics 
development? 
 
A
significant part of the GEF budget ($400,000) focuses on “Improvement of legal and regulatory 
framework and capacity building for state agencies.” The specific activities to be supported in this 
category are well oriented towards promoting institutional continuity. 
 
5.  Have issues of ownership of the technology been considered? 
 
The project would focus on private ownership of small renewable power plants. This has shown to 
be effective even in countries where large power plants are operated by state-owned companies. 
 
Secondary issues 
 
Linkages to other focal areas
Efforts must be made to design projects that are consistent with the operational strategies of the 
other focal area and avoid negative impacts in focal areas outside of the focus of the project. One of 
the strategic considerations in the operational strategy is that where feasible and cost-effective, 
activities will be designed to contribute to global environmental benefits in other focal areas and in 
the cross-sectoral area of land degradation. 
 
Page  31
Project Executive Summary Template: Version 2 
 
December 2003
 
31
The type of project activity would have no significant adverse effect on other GEF focal areas or in 
land degradation. The only exception could be “International waters”, and is discussed below. 
 
Linkages to other programmes and action plans at the regional subregional levels
GEF activities are to be coordinated with past, ongoing and prospective work of the Implementing 
Agencies and other bodies. In addition, GEF activities should build upon bilateral and technical 
assistance and investment activities. Is there evidence that the GEF intervention will be undertaken 
building on other ongoing initiatives? 
 
The proposed project is strongly linked to other activities, both past and prospective. In the first 
place, as a consequence of past initiatives to promote renewable energy in Armenia, there is already 
in place favorable tariffs and purchase guarantees, e.g. $0.045 /kWh for small hydro and $0.07 /kWh 
for wind power, with purchase guarantees for 15 years. At these prices, many renewable projects in 
these categories can be viable. Moreover, the GEF project is accompanied by financing from several 
sources, namely IDA, EBRD, Cafesjian Foundation, and other sources. These loans would 
complement the barrier removal to be provided by the GEF grant and make it possible to implement 
projects, while leaving infrastructure in place for future renewable power projects.  
 
There are several mentions of the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) within the Project 
Appraisal Document. Note, however, that projects that receive public funding are normally excluded 
from the CDM. CDM projects are usually project specific, so that there is no direct incompatibility 
between the GEF grant (directed at reducing barriers which are not project specific) and potential 
CDM projects. However, specific projects that receive loans from the IDA, EBRD, and GOA are 
likely to become excluded from consideration by the CDM. Moreover, the “additionality” of CDM 
projects need to be demonstrated through “investment analysis” or by showing that the project in 
question faces barriers. If the GEF project is successful in removing barriers, then potential projects 
are unlikely to qualify under the CDM on the basis of barrier analysis. CDM investment analysis 
requires showing that the proposed project activity is economically or financially not attractive 
compared to other alternatives, without revenues from the sale of carbon credits (CERs). Thus, 
potential CDM projects in renewable power generation are likely to be limited to such small hydro 
and small wind power projects that are financially marginal. 
 
Team response: 
The project team is well aware that GEF funded activities do not qualify for CDM.  
Hence, activities (e.g., a few projects which receive TA
 (“initial demonstrations”)) funded by GEF 
would not qualify for CDM. However, the Fund will support a spectrum of projects, some of which 
(“follow-up projects”) may qualify for CDM.  IDA and EBRD funds will be on-lent to sub-
borrowers on non-concessional (market) terms, the sub-projects will qualify for the CDM provided 
they have not received GEF support. The contribution of CDM to project financial viability will be 
limited; it is expected to be only complimentary and is not intended to be a major part of the Project 
and have a major impact on Project implementation. During the Project implementation each sub-
project will be evaluated to determine whether it meets the CDM requirements, including 
additionality, eligibility (in case it receives ODA or government assistance), etc. While some sub-
projects may not meet CDM requirements, some of the sub-projects are expected to meet them. The 
PAD will be revised to make this more explicit. Also, a firewall will be built to clearly separate 
projects which qualify for CDM to projects
which do not qualify.  This firewall will be in the form of 
Page  32
Project Executive Summary Template: Version 2 
 
December 2003
 
32
criteria which are followed early in project assessment to classify the project in the GEF or CDM 
category. 
Other beneficial or damaging environmental effects
What will be the environmental impact of the project activities? 
 
Positive or negative transfers to the focal area of biodiversity and international waters and also 
land degradation may occur as a result of energy projects. 
 
The project proposes to promote the development of renewable power, especially small hydro and 
wind power. Wind power has perhaps the lowest environmental impact of any power generation 
technology. It has no transboundary effects. Large dams have been questioned on the basis of 
flooding of large areas, leading to the loss of biodiversity. The proposed project would only consider 
small hydro, with a large number of run-of-river projects that involve little or no flooding, so that 
there would be an insignificant impact on biodiversity. Insofar as any hydro project may be on a 
river that is a boundary with another country, e.g. Turkey, there will be many bilateral issues 
involved, including the question of “International Waters.” “Projects on International Waterways” 
are mentioned in Section 6 of the Appraisal Summary: 
Safeguard Policies
.
If the projects to be 
considered for implementation include boundary rivers, this issue needs to be discussed. 
 
Team response: 
This issue will be addressed before appraisal in accordance with the WB 
safeguards policy on international water.  
Degree of involvement of stakeholders in the project
In OP5, the participants are industries and para-statal organizations. In projects dealing with 
energy efficiency in rural areas, public participation of affected beneficiaries is essential to the 
success of the project. In OP6, local participation is a by-ingredient in the design, implementation 
and operation of isolated systems. The forms and degree of participation will vary as some 
technologies may require communities to act in concerts, while other technologies require the 
participation of electric utility companies, industrial enterprises etc. 
 
This project falls within GEF Operational Program #6: 
Promoting the adoption of renewable energy 
by removing barriers and reducing implementation costs
.
Questions that could be raised: 
 
1.  Assess the degree of stakeholder involvement. 
 
Potential stakeholders relevant for small power projects have been correctly identified, and the PAD 
states that most stakeholders were consulted in project preparation, and as a part of “identification of 
capacity building needs” in the associated PDF-B grant. The PAD also mentions a future 
stakeholder meeting to be held in July 2005. Nevertheless, the PAD does not provide any details by 
which this reviewer can determine the opinions expressed by the stakeholders, and whether/how 
these opinions were taken into consideration. 
Page  33
Project Executive Summary Template: Version 2 
 
December 2003
 
33
 
Team response: 
The key stakeholders include existing and potential project developers, NGOs 
dealing with renewable energy, environmental and energy efficiency issues, the GOA, the PSRC, key 
co-financiers (EBRD, Cafesjian Family Foundation), and local FIs. Extensive consultations, bi-
lateral discussions have been carried out with these stakeholder groups to develop the Project 
design and scope. Specifically, the barriers impeding the development of renewables in Armenia as 
well as the measures needed to remove them (as addressed under the TA component of the Project) 
have been largely identified through stakeholder consultations. The feedback from the stakeholders 
so far has been positive due to the positive environmental impact that the Project is expected to 
have, the close alignment of Project objectives with the GOA’s policy priorities in the energy sector 
and the overall attractiveness of the renewable projects for the private sector. The degree of 
stakeholder involvement will be elaborated in more detail in the PAD.   
2.  What is the degree of commitment of those involved in the project? 
 
As commented in the previous item, the PAD and its annexes do not contain details of the 
stakeholder consultation process in order to determine the degree of commitment of those involved. 
 
Team response: 
The established legal and regulatory environment in the country (PPAs, fixed cost-
recovery tariffs for small hydros and wind, full and timely payments from the distribution company, 
etc. as described in Annex 1) is supportive to the development of the renewable energy, and is a 
testament to the strong commitment of the GOA and the PSRC to the Project. Further, the GOA has 
highlighted the development of renewable energy resources as a priority area in the PRSP and has 
committed US $500,000 for barrier removal and project preparation (TA) as co-funding to GEF.. 
EBRD, which is a key co-financier, has recently approved the Project Structure Review and is 
currently in the process of preparing for the due diligence and negotiations. The Cafesjian Family 
Foundation, an American Diaspora development organization, has also committed to participate in 
the Project and has sent a comfort letter indicating that is prepared to provide US $3 million in co-
funding. Finally, the series of consultations arranged during the Project preparation or organized 
by the USAID have indicated strong interest for the Project among private investors.   Also, see 
comments above. 
3. 
Women’s participation (in rural energy projects)? 
 
The project involves supply-side activities involving power generation, where the electricity to be 
generated would be combined with electricity generated in other power plants before reaching end 
users. There appear to be no gender specific issues that might be present in demand-side measures, 
e.g. involving end-use energy efficiency in the household sector or in commerce and industry where 
end use activities may be gender specific. 
 
4.  Assess the degree of coordination and cooperation with the NGO and private sector (in rural 
energy projects). 
 
While the activities are not specifically “rural energy projects” in the usual definition, since they 
involve the supply of energy, nevertheless, the role of NGO and private-sector stakeholders can be 
relevant, both in terms of local environmental impact as well as land ownership and siting issues. 
Page  34
Project Executive Summary Template: Version 2 
 
December 2003
 
34
The PAD claims that the project concept would be presented to NGOs in a future workshop (July 
2005). 
 
The implementation arrangements (Annex 6) mentions that the project would be implemented by a 
Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Fund (R2E2 Fund) which would be governed by a Board 
of Trustees (BOT). Three of the nine members of the BOT will be representatives from the private 
and NGO sectors. This should provide adequate representation in principle.  
 
Capacity building aspects
Often a strong technical assistance is necessary during the preparation and the implementation 
phases. One of the generic barriers to energy conservation and efficiency is lack of trained 
personnel and technical and managerial expertise.  
 
How will the project build capacity in the sector where the project will be implemented? 
 
Project preparation was supported by a PDF-B. The PAD content reflects these prior efforts. Project 
activities include a great deal of capacity building not only for project implementation but in order 
to ensure sustainability of renewable power project development well beyond the end of the specific 
GEF grant and associated loans.  
 
Innovativeness of the project
For example, the success of renewable rural electrification will highly depend on innovative 
financing. 
 
This reviewer disagrees that successful project financing needs to be “innovative.” Tried and tested 
financing schemes often work, and with increasing experience in the promotion of renewable power 
projects, including financing aspects, it is more likely that successful financing will involve 
replication, adjusted for local realities, of solutions found to be successful elsewhere. This project 
appears to reflect the know-how accumulated in other projects as well as knowledge of the specific 
national context.  
 
Other observations (not necessarily minor)
Note that the table in Section D.1 (PAD, Appraisal Summary, p. 18) shows different purchase prices 
that are different for natural water flows ($0.045/kWh) and for artificial water flows ($0.022/kWh). 
Since electricity purchase prices are key to project cost effectiveness, these values need to be 
clarified, together with a reference to the law or regulation where the values are specified. 
 
Team response: 
Tariffs for newly constructed small run-of-the-river hydro and wind plants are set 
at USc 4.5/kWh and USc 7.0/kWh levels, respectively. These tariffs are fixed till 2016 according to 
the PSRC resolutions No 20 and 21 respectively from February 9, 2004. Cost-based tariffs are set 
by the PSRC for hydros on artificial water flows with 20% before-tax ROA allowed in the tariff. The 
tariffs for these SHPPs vary between USc 1.5-3.5/kWh with average tariff of USc 2.2/kWh used for 
economic analysis purposes. However,
under the current regulatory regime
tariffs for these SHPPs 
Page  35
Project Executive Summary Template: Version 2 
 
December 2003
 
35
have no impact on their internal rate of return.  In addition, the Energy Law requires that the 
distribution company sign PPA with all the licensed renewable energy plants.    
The same section (D.1. Appraisal Summary, p. 18) mentions “tariffs” for different types of power 
generation technologies. Normally “tariff” is used to denominate price paid by end users of 
electricity. Since electricity purchased comes from different types of power plants with different 
generation costs, as well as transmission and distribution value added and losses, tariffs 
do
not
 
depend on technology. Thus, the document should clarify if this refers to the cost of generation 
(which depends on investment and operating costs, and does depend on technology choice) or to the 
wholesale selling price of generated electricity. The selling price may be fixed by a guaranteed 
purchase price which can be technology specific (such as implied here for renewable electricity), be 
determined by market conditions (supply vs. demand) in which case it is not technology specific. 
 
Team response: 
The “tariffs” refer to the generation costs of different technologies (price paid for 
purchasing electricity from different generators by the distribution company) and this will be 
clarified in the PAD.  
The same section (D.1. Appraisal Summary, p. 18) gives the “tariff” of a new CCGT power plant to 
be $0.04 to 0.05 / kWh. If this refers to the cost of generation from a combined cycle power plant 
using natural gas, this value seems very high. Please specify assumptions on natural gas prices, 
especially for power plants. 
 
Team response: 
The key assumption underlying this estimate of generation costs of a new CCGT 
plant are: (i) investment cost of US $750/kW (the estimated cost of a 200MW CCGT being currently 
constructed in Armenia through the financing provided by the Japanese government); (ii) natural 
gas consumption of 150 gram/kWh; (iii) natural gas price of US $130/1000m3 at the border (prices 
of natural gas Russia charges for its export of natural gas to the European markets), (iv) ROA at 
20% (this is consistent with the ROA allowed by the PSRC for different generators and reflects 
Armenian cost of capital).  These assumptions are spelled out in Annex 9. 
The text somewhat below Figure 3 of Annex 1 states that: “Armenia receives natural gas from 
Russia at substantially subsidized prices (US $53 per m3) and if the geopolitical situation changes 
and subsidies are removed the resulting impact of gas price increase on the Armenian economy will 
be significant.”  
 
Note that there is a typographic error in the price: it might be US$ 53 per 1000 m3, i.e. US$ 0.053 
per m3. If so, it is not that cheap! Moreover, it is not clear what is implied by subsidies: e.g. (a) does 
Russia (or Russian producers) supply natural gas at prices below what it/they charge(s) other 
countries? Or (b) does the government of Armenia subsidize prices? Or other?  Annex 9 specifies 
the border price of natural gas to be $130/1000 m
3
.
This suggests that GOA is subsidizing natural 
gas to users. Please confirm. 
 
Team response: 
The current gas price of US $53 on the border is indeed for 1000m3 and this typo 
has been corrected. This price is significantly lower than the prices (in the range of US $130-135 
per 1,000 m3) Russia charges for its exports of natural gas to the European markets. Russia charges 
different prices for the
supply of natural gas to different countries and these prices often do not

36
reflect economic costs. Russia charges one of the lowest prices for its export of natural gas to 
Armenia, despite the fact that Armenia is a remote and small consumer. Annex 9 provides a 
comparative analysis of the economic costs of different generation alternatives and therefore uses 
the international price for natural gas of $130 per 1000 m3. The “subsidy” in the PAD implies the 
difference between the price Russia charges to Armenia and the international price of natural gas 
(the price charged to European consumers).  The GOA does not subsidize natural gas prices to the 
end-users, and the end-user tariff is determined by adding transmission and distribution margin to 
the border price of gas. The meaning of the “subsidy” will be clarified in the PAD.        
Definitions of what constitutes “small” in small hydro vary. Since two studies on small-hydro 
potential is cited in the PAD and Annex 1, the definition used in these studies and in the PAD 
should be clarified. 
 
Team response: 
The regulator uses 10MW as a threshold for small hydro generation. 
 
PAD and annexes make reference to “small wind” or SWPP. “Small” is not defined in terms of 
power ranges. Because of scale economics, large wind power plants are more suitable for grid-
connected power generation. Indeed, Annex 1, Table 3 lists potential grid-connected wind farm 
projects. The capacities range from 20 MW to 150 MW, thus indicating that these are no way “small 
wind”. There are no specific negative environmental impact of large wind compared to small wind. 
Thus, it is not clear why the project would limit itself to small wind power. And, as suggested by 
Annex 1, Table 3, no such limitation is implied. If the project is to include all types of wind power, 
the text needs to be modified in many places to reflect this. If the project does indeed propose to 
exclude large wind, then the reasons for such exclusion need to be specified, and the text changes 
especially in Table 3 and elsewhere in Annex 1. While one reason for excluding large wind might be 
that at large scale, wind is likely to be more competitive with non-renewable power generation, 
substantial barriers exist for a full market penetration of wind power in many countries. This is 
likely to be the case in Armenia, where there appears to be limited experience with wind power. 
This reviewer thus does not believe that wind power should be limited to “SWPP”, whatever that 
means. 
 
Team response: 
The comment is acceptable and the PAD will be revised accordingly.
 
Text following Table 3 of Annex 1 mentions solar resources. It is not clear what solar technologies 
are being considered, since hydro and wind are indirect forms of solar energy, so that the radiation 
levels are not directly relevant. 
 
Team response:
 
Reference to solar includes solar thermal for heating and electricity production, as 
well as photovoltaics as options which may be supported by the fund in the future (beyond the 
original 5 years of operation). This will be made clear in the PAD. 
Minor point: Under “Barriers to the development of renewable energy” (Annex 1, p. 28 et seq.), the 
document correctly notes that typical project investment sizes for small renewable projects 
(estimated to average $800,000) are too small for international investors. However, later on it states 
that “renewable projects are too large for most Armenian FIs.” One would have thought that the size 
of renewable projects could be in the range of national FIs. What exactly is the investment r
ange

37
available to these FIs? 
 
Team response: 
Except for two-three large commercial banks, the loan portfolio of most of the FIs 
is below US $20 million. Renewable projects in the range of US $800,000-1,000,000 are quite large 
for most of the FIs, since these FIs can absorb limited number of loans in the sector, and therefore 
the business development and learning curve for the business would not be worth for them. Further, 
the restrictions imposed by the Prudential Standards of the Central Bank of Armenia, particularly 
the limitations imposed for the risk exposure of one borrower restrict lending opportunities of the 
magnitude indicated above. 
Note
:
Annex 14 provides “Country at a glance” for Macedonia FYR, and not Armenia! Please 
replace with Armenia table. 
 
Team response: 
This has been incorporated in the PAD.
 
c)  GEFSec Comments and IA/ExA response
Pipeline entry: 
 
No reference to the National Communications to the UNFCCC
:
We added description of all the country’s related activities, including presentation of the 
National Communication at the 4
th
 Conference of the Parties (Buenos-Aires, 1998); this 
information was added in the Country Drivenness and National Level of Support section. 
 
Consistency of project with strategic priorities S2 and S3 must be justified further:
 More material 
was added in the GEF Program and Policy Conformity section. 
 
Related projects in ECA region were not mentioned:
 All relevant ECA projects were added and 
it was described how lessons learned will be incorporated in the On-Going and Planned 
Programs section. 
 
Relationship with GeoFund should be clarified:
 More clarification was provided in the On-
Going and Planned Programs section and references to geothermal projects were deleted from 
the Project Design and Financing sections. 
 
Is the main issue risk or liquidity for financing renewables in Armenia
?
It was elaborated further 
that both risk and liquidity are issues, but risk is more prevalent in Armenia and this will be the 
focus of the GEF-funded project (see Project Design section). 
 
Please clarify how the risks and barriers will be addressed
;
some are beyond the scope of the 
project and they could not be addressed
:
Currency convertibility and country risk are deleted 
from the section Barriers to the Implementation of Renewable Projects. Also, the list of proposed 
GEF interventions matched with the existing barriers was added as a table in the “Incremental 
Reasoning” section.

The incremental cost reasoning is confusing
…
and
must be redrafted
:
The Incremental 
Reasoning section was redrafted and clarifications to all the points raised during the May 3 
meeting and the written comments by GEF were addressed. 
 
Please clarify who will manage the fund and the roles of the Review Board:
 Further clarifications 
were added in the Implementation Arrangements section. 
 
The concept does not provide enough information to substantiate its expectation of future 
sustainability:
 Information was added in the following sections: 1. Sustainability; 2. Annex B 
was added providing detail status of projects which have been approved and are awaiting 
financing; 3. Sections on Energy Strategy and Barriers to the Implementation of Renewable 
Projects providing more information about policy and regulatory actions, which ensure 
sustainability. 
 
The list of stakeholders is missing:
 The list was added in the Implementation Arrangements 
section.

GEFSec comments
Response to comments
1. Country ownership 
 
Country Driveness:
Please provide a clear description of the 
project’s consistency with national 
communication to the UNFCCC as well as 
national or sectoral development plans. 
Describe what more ‘needs to be done on 
the regulatory side’. 
 
Armenia ratified the United Nations 
Climate Change Convention on May 14, 
1993 and is, therefore, eligible for GEF 
assistance in the climate change focal area.  
Also, Armenia ratified the Kyoto Protocol 
on April 25, 2003.  In its national 
communications, Armenia clearly identifies 
renewables as a key option for controlling 
greenhouse gas (GHG).  [for example: the 
National Communication of Armenia was 
presented at the 4
th
 Conference of the 
Parties (Buenos-Aires, 1998) and it is 
available at: 
http://www.nature.am
]
The Government’s strong commitment to 
the Project is evidenced by the adoption of 
the Law on Energy Saving and Renewable 
Energy, policies and regulations to 
encourage renewable energy in Armenia. 
Moreover, the GOA has highlighted the 
development of renewable energy 
resources as a priority in the PRSP.

(See Annex 1 of the PAD for details) 
 
Most renewables are addressed adequately 
in the Law on Energy Saving and 
Renewable Energy.  Further improvements 
needed in the regulatory side include: 1) 
streamlining the approval process; and 2) 
tariffs for existing and newly constructed 
small hydro plants operating on artificial 
water flows require further improvements 
to eliminate uncertainties and attract 
project financing. 
 
2. Program and policy conformity 
 
Program designation and conformity
Please provide a clear explanation of 
project conformity with S2 (increased 
access to local sources of financing) and S3 
(consistency with strategic priorities). 
 
The project is proposed to the GEF under 
Operational Program No. 6 (OP-6): 
Promoting the Adoption of Renewable 
Energy by Removing Barriers and 
Reducing Implementation Costs.  The 
relevance of the proposed project for S2 is 
especially strong since it focuses on 
mobilizing the resources of local 
commercial banks and other private 
financiers by removing actual and 
perceived barriers to renewable 
investments.  Revolving funds are 
characterized as one of the proven 
mechanisms in promoting the objectives of 
OP-5 and 6. 
Also, there is consistency between on-
going sector reforms and the strategic 
priorities of GEF.  Reform provides for 
renewable tariffs; streamlining of the 
licensing process and transparent 
regulatory framework to reduce risks 
associated with renewable (as well as 
other) projects; and financially sound 
power sector able to commit to full 
payments (including to renewables).

Conformity section of Annex 1] 
 
Project design:

strategy, goals, objectives, outputs, 
activities, risks and assumptions. 
 
privately owned and operated power 
generation utilizing renewable energy. The 
key indicators are: 
c)  Installed capacity (MWs) of 
renewables added to the power grid; 
d)  Renewable generation (GWhs) added 
to the generation mix. 
Details on project objectives and outputs 
are provided in Annex 3 of the PAD; 
project activities are described in part B3 of 
the PAD and Annex 4, and critical risks 
and assumptions are provided in section C5 
of the PAD.   
Sustainability:
Please provide in some more detail 
clarification of points: (a) evidence of the 
commercial feasibility of the project; (b) 
the level of private sector interest; and (c) a 
rationale for the continued commercial 
financing post-project. 
 
(a) Renewable projects are estimated to 
yield healthy cash flows with financial 
returns varying between 15-25 percent; 
also, 35 small hydro projects (with 
roughly 90 MWs of total capacity) 
have obtained pertinent permits and 
they are ready for implementation.  
(see section D1 and Annex 9 of the 
PAD for details); 
 
(b) The demand for the financing is 
expected to be significant since 
different studies confirm that there is 
potential for SHPPs and WPPs that 
would be competitive with other forms 
of new generation and that under 
current conditions could add over 
300MW of capacity. USAID 
sponsored round-table discussions and 
a
conference on renewable energy with 
participation of potential and existing 
project developers have also revealed 
significant interest in and demand for 
this Project (see Annexes 1 and 4 for 
details). Finally, the selection of a 
consulting firm that will assist the 
implementing agencies to build initial 
portfolio of sub-projects is underway. 
The firm will be funded from PDF-B 
grant. 
 
(c) Removal of existing legal, regulatory,

informational, and other barriers 
preventing development and 
implementation of renewable projects, 
capacity building and demonstrational 
effects that projects funded by the 
R2E2 Fund and Cascade Credit would 
have is expected to ensure 
sustainability post-project. In addition, 
the project will assist in designing new 
financial instruments and leveraging 
additional resources from international 
and local financial institutions and 
investors (see section C4 and Annex 4 
of the PAD for details). 
Replicability:
Please outline steps to be undertaken in 
order to disseminate lessons from this 
project to be replicated elsewhere, with 
emphasis on other countries within the 
region. Given the large number of projects 
within the region with similar goals and 
designs, some commitment to regional 
sharing of lessons learned would be 
appreciated. 
 
The lessons learnt from Project 
implementation and related monitoring 
results will be disseminated by the R2E2 
Fund through a regional conference and 
through a documentary film. In addition, 
the Project ICR will document key lessons 
of the Project.     
 
Stakeholder involvement:
Describe how stakeholders have been 
involved in project design and development 
and how they will be involved during 
implementation.  
 
The project design and implementation 
arrangements have been developed in close 
consultation with the key stakeholders. The 
key stakeholders include existing and 
potential project developers, local 
engineering and consulting industry, 
 
advocacy groups, NGOs dealing with 
renewable energy, environmental and 
energy efficiency issues, the GOA, the 
PSRC, key co-financiers (EBRD, Cafesjian 
Family Foundation), and local FIs. 
Extensive consultations, bi-lateral 
discussions have been carried out with 
these stakeholder groups to develop the 
Project design and scope. Specifically, the 
barriers impeding the development of 
renewables in Armenia as well as the 
measures needed to remove them (as 
addressed under the TA component of the 
Project) have been largely identified 
Page  42
Project Executive Summary Template: Version 2 
 
December 2003
 
42
through stakeholder consultations. The 
feedback from the stakeholders so far has 
been positive due to the positive 
environmental impact that the Project is 
expected to have, the close alignment of 
Project objectives with the GOA’s policy 
priorities in the energy sector and the 
overall attractiveness of the renewable 
projects for the private sector. Further 
outreach actions, including an investors’ 
workshop, are envisaged during further 
stages of project preparation and 
implementation.  Broad-based participation 
and public involvement are incorporated in 
the project design.  Organized outreach and 
public information campaigns are included 
in the TA component.
 
(See Annex 6 of the 
PAD for details). 
 
Monitoring and Evaluation:
Describe how the project design has 
incorporated lessons from similar projects 
in the past. 
 
Describe an M&E plan, based on project 
logframe, including same indicators, 
benchmarks, etc. compared to the baseline.  
 
The project reviewed and drew lessons 
learned from numerous projects and 
programs on renewables and energy 
efficiency, which have been implemented 
by the World Bank, GEF and others. The 
project design has especially benefited 
from these types of projects implemented 
in the Eastern Europe. (See section B4 and 
Annex 2 of the PAD for details). 
 
The Board of Trustees and the management 
of the Renewable Resources and Energy 
Efficiency Fund (R2E2 Fund) will have 
overall responsibility for Project 
implementation and for monitoring of 
project outcomes.  A management 
information system for Project monitoring 
and evaluation will be developed by the 
R2E2 Fund, covering, 
inter alia
,
the project 
pipeline, amount invested, loans not 
requiring guarantees, cost-sharing with 
financing partners, cost-effectiveness of 
sub-projects, defaults, fund reflows, energy 
saved and GHG reduction. (See section C3  
and Annex 3 of the PAD).
