                  ARMENIA -- RENEWABLE ENERGY PROJECT (GEF GRANT )

1.    Proceeds for Armenia Renewable Energy             PROJECT, (GEF Grant No TF056211],
P090058 will be reallocated as follows:

 Category of Expenditure              Allocation                  % of Financing
    Current      Revised         Current       Revised          Current     Revised
(3) Training                     160,000         124,669         100%
(4) Incremental                  480,000         675,331         100%
Operating Costs
(5) Unallocated                  160,000            0


2.       The project exceeded the key outcome indicators for 2009. The implementation of the on-
lending component of the project - financing of small hydro power plants - is essentially
completed and the funding is almost fully disbursed. Although the implementation of some
activities under the technical assistance component has been slow, the procurement for these
activities has already started and the task team estimates that these studies will be completed by
June 30, 2011.

3.      The proposed reallocation is necessary to finance the incremental operating costs of the
Renewable Resources and Energy Efficiency (R2E2) Fund, the implementing agency of the
project. The R2E2 Fund exhausted the funds allocated for incremental operating costs due to
significant depreciation of the US$ to the Armenian dram (over 30%) since the project appraisal
in December 2005. Moreover, the reallocation will allow the R2E2 Fund to finance the
additional incremental operating costs if the Bank approves a 6-month extension of the project
closing date.

                                  Extension of Closing Date

               ARMENIA -- RENEWABLE ENERGY PROJECT (GEF GRANT)
                                    P090058
                                   TF056211
                                     Restructuring Paper

1.    The closing date for Armenia Renewable Energy Project (GEF Grant No TF056211),
P090058 will be extended from December 31, 2010 until June 30, 2011.

2.      The actual project outcome indicators for renewable generation and carbon dioxide
emissions have exceeded the target indicators from the first year of the project implementation
till present. The implementation of the IDA-financed on-lending component is essentially
completed and the funding is almost fully disbursed. The implementation of some activities
under the GEF Grant-financed technical assistance component has been slow; however, the
procurement of these activities has already started and the task team, based on the latest
procurement plan, estimates that these studies will be completed by June 30, 2011.

3.      The proposed extension is necessary to complete some key studies - update of the
feasibility study of Loriberd hydro power plant, development of innovative financing instruments
for the development of renewable energy projects, preparation of the roadmap for the
development of renewable resources - under the technical assistance component of the project.

4.     This will be the first extension of the GEF Grant.

5.     The closing date for Armenia, Renewable Energy Project, (Credit No 4159 AM),
P083352 will be extended from December 31, 2010 until June 30, 2011 to coincide with the
extension of the closing date of Armenia, Renewable Energy GEF Project [Grant No
TF056211], P090058, which is parallel financing the IDA Project.

6.    This will be the first extension of the project.
