Around 36 percent of residents\n            of multi-apartment buildings relied on wood, household waste\n            and other polluting fuels for heating, which were\n            detrimental for health and the environment. The modern\n            heater and gas connection costs were prohibitively high. Due\n            to the lack of appropriate heating, many schools did not\n            function during the winter months. World Bank supported\n            Armenia by funding Urban Energy Project which focused on the\n            use of safe, clean and affordable heating, and renewable\n            energy generation. The World Bank energy program supported\n            the government in improving the power transmission network\n            infrastructure and reducing power supply gap."}, "docdt": "2011-04-14T07:49:01Z"}
