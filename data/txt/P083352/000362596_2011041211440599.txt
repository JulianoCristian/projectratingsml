Dear Mr. Minister: 
 
Re: Republic of Armenia: Amendments to Legal Agreements

(Credits No. 3891, No. 4038, No. 4102 and No. 4159 and TF056211) 
 
We refer to the Development Credit Agreements and the GEF Grant Agreement for the 
projects set forth in Attachment I to this amendment letter 
(individually a “Legal Agreement” and 
collectively, the “Legal Agreements”) between the Republic of Armenia (“Recipient” or 
“Borrower”, on the one part, and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development 
(variously “IBRD” and “Bank”) and the International Development Association (variously 
“Association” and “Bank”) as the case may be, on the other part, as amended to date.  We also 
refer to our recent decision to allow the transfer of Special Accounts from commercial banks into 
the Treasury of the Borrower/Recipient for projects financed by the Bank out of its own resources 
or as administrator of trust fund grants provided by other donors. 
 
Accordingly, the Legal Agreements are amended as follows: 
 
1. 
Section 2.02 (b) of the Development Credit Agreements shall be amended to read as 
follows: 
 
“(b) 
The Borrower may, for the purposes of the Project, open and maintain in Dollars 
a
separate special deposit account in the Treasury of the Borrower on terms and 
conditions satisfactory to the Association, including appropriate protection against set-
off, seizure or attachment.  Deposits into, and payments out of, Special Account shall be 
made in accordance with the provisions of Schedule 5 to this Agreement and the Annex 
thereto.” 
 
2. 
Section 2.02 (b) of the GEF Grant Agreement shall be amended to read as follows:  
 
“(b) 
The Recipient may, for the purposes of the Project, open and maintain in Dollars 
a
separate special deposit account in the Treasury of the Recipient on terms and 
conditions satisfactory to the Bank, including appropriate protection against set-off, 
seizure or attachment.  Deposits into, and payments out of, Special Account shall be 
made in accordance with the provisions of Schedule 5 to this Agreement and the Annex 
thereto.”

3. 
Schedule 5 to the Legal Agreements shall be amended by incorporating the provisions of 
the Annex set forth in Attachment II to this amendment letter as an Annex to Schedule 5 and as 
an integral part of each Legal Agreement. 
 
All terms of the Legal Agreements not hereby amended shall remain in full force and 
effect. 
 
Please indicate your agreement with the foregoing amendments to the Legal Agreements 
on behalf of the Recipient/Borrower by countersigning and dating the two original copies of this 
amendment letter and returning one countersigned original to us. Upon receipt by the Bank of this
