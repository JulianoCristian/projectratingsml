                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project exceeded all of the target outcome indicators. As of December 31, 2010, the renewable generation added to the generation mix was 416.6 GWh, compared to the project
                         final year target of 336 GWh. As of the same date, the installed capacity of renewables connected to the power grid was 130 MW, which is above the project target of 127 MW. The
                         carbon dioxide emission reduction of 270,770 tons of CO2 equivalent has already exceeded the project target of 218,400 tons.

                         Implementation of the investment component of the project is almost entirely completed. The project financed a total of 26 small hydro power plants, which will have 53 MW of
                         installed capacity upon completion. Under the technical assistance component, the project supported removal of informational and regulatory barriers impeding the development of
