larger post-conflict social project aimed at enhancing the\n            capacity of recipient communities in war affected rural\n            areas to reestablish normal economic and social activities.\n            The project consist of two components.  The first is\n            technical assistance to help the Government continue to\n            strengthen a reintegration strategy to provide a\n            comprehensive and consistent framework across sectors and\n            provinces for planning and implementing the rehabilitation\n            and integration need of all war affected segments of the\n            population.  The second will test the Municipio Recovery\n            Program (MRP) for its potential for wide-scale replication\n            in war impacted areas of Angola.  In  particular, it will\n            test (I) the approach and (ii) the delivery mechanism of the MRP."}, "docdt": "1998-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
