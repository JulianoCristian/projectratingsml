I. SECTOR BACKGROUND
A.  Introduction
1.01     Korea's urban /1 population (23 million of a total population of
38 million in 1980) has been increasing at more than three times the rate
of the total population, by an estimated annual rate of 5%, between 1975
and 1980, compared to about 1.5% for the national population during the
same period.  Household sizes are becoming smaller (5.§" persons per house-
hold (p/hh) in 1981 compared to 5.44 p/hh in 1975), resulting in even more
rapid growth of urban households - 7% annual increase during the same
period.  About 60% of the country's households are estimated to live in
urban areas; by 1991 this level is projected to grow to 75%, comparable to
most developed countries.  This rapid urbanization and growing personal
incomes had put great pressure on urban housing markets by the mid-1970s,
stimulating growth in housing production levels and, with supply lagging,
inflation in the housing sector.
1.02     During 1979 and 1980 government began to develop specific measures
to increase output of both the public and private sectors and issued a
"Master Plan for Public Housing Construction and National Urban Land
Development" in October, 1980.  This plan included quantitative targets for
increasing housing production and investment; expanding the public sector
role; and measures to reduce cost, increase supply of funds and to provide
incentives for developers and builders.  The Bank participated in
discussions on these and other measures with the government as part of a
dialogue on the development of the housing sector and Bank support for the
sector. This dialogue resulted in the First National Urban Land Development
and Housing Project (Loan 1980-KO, in May 1981).
1.03     The most important developments in Korea in the urban sector since
the first project was appraised have been the continuing decline in housing
production, from 250,000 units in 1979 to about 150,000 in 1981, along with
an associated worsening ratio of housing units to households, down to 73.7
nationwide in 1981 from 76.5 in 1979 (60.1 in cities, down from 60.4); the
publication of the Fifth Five-Year Economic and Social Development Plan,
1982-1986, (Fifth Plan) and subsequent policy initiatives designed to
reverse this decline.  The government has made it a priority to address the
problems which have accompanied urban growth over the past 20 years.  The
Fifth Plan emphasizes meeting basic needs of urban dwllers and improving
the quality and availability of urban services. Housing, water supply and
/1  Def ined as city areas in the 1980 census.  This understates urban
population compared to previous definitions which indicated towns with
populations of over 20,000.  Including such towns would result in 67%
of the population defined as urban.

sewerage, urban transport and general infrastructure are the primary
Components of the government's urban development strategy, and among these,
housing is the first priority.  The Bank supports this strategy, emphasizing
policy and institutional development through an ongoing dialogue with the
government.  This chapter summarizes the policies and performance in the
sector during 1980 and 1981, the current status of the sector, recent policy
developments including housing in the Fifth Plan, prospects for the future,
and Bank role and strategy in the sector in Korea.
B. The Housing Sector in Korea
Policies and Performance During 1980 and 1981
1.04     By 1978 housing production in Korea hit a peak of 300,000 units for
the year, 185,000 provided by the private sector, and housing investment as
a percentage of Gross National Product (GNP) rose to 6.0%.  However, between
1965 and 1978 average rates of increases of land and housing prices were
exceeding those of wages and prices by significant margins.  Average annual
wage increases for the period were 25.9%, general price increases (Consumer
Price Index) averaged 13.7% annually, while residential land prices rose
39.9% yearly, and housing prices, 30.1%. These circumstances prompted the
government-to introduce a number of measures between February and December
1978 to dampen what was perceived as speculation-induced inflation in the
housing market including, inter alia, designating areas/i where capital
gains taxes on property sales would be up to three times the standard rates,
and applying "standard land pricing," which was well below market value, as
the basis for compensation for public acquisition in urban planning areas./2
The effects of these measures combined with stagnation in the growth in real
incomes have been dramatic. Housing production in 1979 fell by 16% to
251,000 despite a small increase in public sector production, as private
sector units declined by 28% to 133,000 and housing investment as a portion
of GNP fell by 15% to 5.1%. This decline continued in 1980, with both
public and private sector production falling.  Whereas 62% of the housing
units in the peak year of 1978 were produced by private sector, by 1980 the
105,000 units of privately developed housing represented just under half of
that year's production, and a 43% decline from the peak year.  Public sector
production which had exceeded plan targets (see Table I.1) in 1978 and 1979,
fell 2,000 units below the 1980 plan to 106,000 units.  In 1981, private
/1 Three hundred and sixty three dongs (neighborhoods) and four apartment
areas which included most of the suburban areas of major cities were
designated "specific areas."
/2 These were designated under the Land Utilization and Management Act
and covered most urban areas.

sector production fell by a further 31% compared to the previous year, to
72,000 units, while the public sector reduced its production by 27% to
77,000 units.  Housing investment during 1981 represented 4.2% of GNP as a
result. However, since 1979 the rates of increase in housing and land
prices have also fallen dramatically, well below those of both wages and
prices. During 1980, housing and land prices increased 4.3% and 5.2%
respectively over the previous year, while wages and general price levels
gained 22.7% and 34.6% respectively. Housing and land prices almost
stagnated in 1981, rising only 1.1% and 1.4% above the 1980 level, while
wages and general prices climbed over 20% during the year.
1.05      These drastic cuts in housing production led the government to relax
some of its "anti-speculation" measures. In December 1980 the capital gains
tax structure and rates were revised, introducing a category for units
smaller than 25 pyong/l (py) held by individuals more than two years, and
permitting variations in the rates applied of plus or minus 15% by
Presidential Decree.  The new rates (see Table I.2) represented a reduction
in base rates of between 20% and 40% for individuals and 20% to 30% for cor-
porations on legal transactions. Penalties on illegal transactions (sale
without registration) were also reduced by 5%. In addition to the reductions
in base rates, the full 15% downward variation permissible was applied for
individual transactions and a 7% reduction was applied for corporations.
Consequently, rates applied currently are between 50% and 70% lower than
pre-December 1980 rates. In June 1981 the most severe of the anti-
speculation measures, the "specific areas" designation, was lifted.

1.06      Despite these relief measures, private developers' output in the
housing sector has continued to decline and at a rate more rapid than that of
the public sector. Whereas in the past housing units produced by both
private and public developers were generally pre-sold before construction,
since 1979 both groups of developers have experienced inventories of unsold
units from each year's production. Howver, while the major public
developer, Korea National Housing Corporation (KNHC), by end March 1982
reduced its inventory of unsold units from about 20% to about 10% of last
year's production through advertising and publicity, the large private
developers, who are members of the Korea Housing Association (KHA), had 47%
of 1981 production still unsold.
1.07       The decline in effective demand and the differences between demand
in the segments supplied by the public and private developers are attri-
butable to various causes.  Short-term investors who were attracted to the
market in the 1970s by rapidly rising prices (which their activities helped
to fuel) have found that real estate no longer provides a rate of return
comparable to other investment opportunities. Indeed, for the past two
years regular bank savings accounts gave higher yields than housing.
Consequently, buyers primarily interested in the investment aspect of
housing have left the market.  Howver, during the 1970s when they were
active, price increases for land, houses and rents rapidly outgrew increases

in wages, making housing less affordable to consumer/investors./1 In
addition, consumer/investors have had great difficulties in entering the
market because of high cash requirements (60-80% down payments were needed
for KHB financed units up to 1981). Although real estate price increases
have moderated over the past two years, it appears that even those consumer/
investors able to meet the down payments are reluctant to purchase units
when the value of their investment is appreciating at a rate that is well
below inflation rates.  In addition, the recession since 1979 and the
uncertain policy environment characterized by frequent changes in signals
have also discouraged real estate investment.
1.08      These various factors have had a greater impact on the private
developers than on the public developers, because the short-tern investor
would normally be more active in the income range for whom private
developers build, consequently their absence from the market would directly
affect those developers.  In addition, mortgage financing terms are
structured to reduce the proportion of financing to be provided as unit
sizes increase. As a result, proportionally more cash is required to
purchase units built by private developers and only buyers with substantial
savings or access to cash can enter the market.  Land prices are higher for
private developers compared to public developers (over 2.5 times more based
on a preliminary review undertaken during project preparation) and real
estate related taxes which private developers (but not public developers)
pay add an estimated 9-12% /2 to the cost of units.  Together, these factors
raise the affordability requirements considerably for privately developed
units.
1.09     The problem for public developers have been less severe.  Lower
costs of land, taxes and financing enable overall development costs to be
more affordable to potential buyers.  Since an eligibility requirement for
publicly developed housing is that applicants do not own other houses,
short-term investors are generally ineligible.  Consequently, the decline in
demand affecting the public developers is more directly related to consumers
unable or unwilling to commit the significant amount of cash (from 40% of
cost, upwards) required as a down payment on a house during a time of
economic uncertainty.
1.10      The inability or unwillingness to purchase newly constructed units
does not reflect disinterest on the part of Koreans in improving their
housing conditions, as the decline in demand for new units has been
accompanied by increased expansion of existing units. Although the ratio of
housing units to households and owner occupancy (down to 60% in 1980 from
63.5% in 1975) has continued to decline, living area per capita nationwide
/I Defined as purchasers seeking housing as shelter as well as a means of
accumulating assets.

increased from 2.4 py in 1975 to 2.8 py in 1980 (2.14 py to 2.6 py in cities).
In the current context, it appears that Korean housing consumers are trying
to satisfy their requirements for shelter by renting additional space rather
than investing in home ownership, and that landlords find it profitable to
provide such space by expansion and subletting of existing houses.
Recent Developments
1.11     In January 1982 the government announced a number of stimulation
measures designed to accelerate economic growth. The housing sector received
a special provision of W 300 billion for five-year loans to be made available
to the private sector through the Citizens National Bank (CNB) and the Korea
Housing Bank (KHB) for purchases of existing houses or construction of new
units.  These funds were to be committed by the end of June 1982.  To reduce
uncertainty about the future of capital gains tax rates, the existing tax
regime which was due to expire in September 1982 was extended to end-March
1984. The period during which a homeowner could own a second house without
incurring capital gains taxes on its sale was extended from a year to
18 months to encourage those who could "trade up".
1.12      Indications as of April 1982 were that performance in the sector
in the first quarter 1982 was improving relative to the same period last
year. Overall building approvals at the local government level were up 16%
in January 1982; for residences only, approvals up 30%; and schemes approved
under the Housing Construction Promotion Law /1 were up 300%. Of the
special W 300 billion allocated for loans, W 261 billion had been committed
as of March 23, 1982. As 44% of that amount was processed in the week
(March 15, 1982) before, it appeared that the W 300 billion would be exhausted
well before the deadline for its use. Originally, the government had
anticipated that 10% of the total would go through KHB for new construction
while the remainder would be disbursed through CNB for purchase of existing
units; however, of the W 261 billion, W 45.4 billion (17%) had been
committed by KHB. Finally, the Economic Planning Board (EPB) Business
Survey Indices indicate that while other sectors were experiencing a
recession during the first quarter 1982, housing was improving steadily from
a composite performance score of 97.7 at the end of the fourth quarter 1981,
to 108.3 for the end of the first quarter 1982.
C. Prospects for the Future
1.13      The Fifth Plan targets include investment of 5.33% /2 of GNP in
new housing, annual production of 270,000-320,000 units (100,000-130,000
/1  Projects over 20 units must receive approval under the Housing
Construction Promotion Law; smaller projects get permission from local
governments under the Architecture Act.
/2 This differs from the EPB macro investment target of 6.2%, probably
because the macro figures may include investments in rehabilitation and
extentions to existing units.



public, 170,000-190,000 private), overall numbers of units to be built by
the public (570,000) and private (890,000) sectors, distribution of units
between urban (92%) and rural areas (8%) and an investment plan totalling
W 19,125 billion (see Table 1.3). These targets appeared optimistic when they
were announced in the summer of 1981, and by March 1982 the 1982 target had
been scaled down from 270,000 to 200,000 units.

1.14      Associated with plan targets were a number of measures to be
taken to improve performance in the sector. Funds for public housing are
to be expanded by increasing government contribution from 1% to 2% of the
budget by 1986, introducing pension funds as a financing source and
encouraging investments in housing through savings at commercial banks,
insurance companies, and long term (contract) savings schemes for low-income
families willing to purchase a house.  Central to this strategy is the
establishment of the National Housing Fund (NlIF) which is to be the vehicle
through which funds would be mobilized and which would bring stability to

the public sector housing finance system./1 The mortgage finance system
would be improved by increasing mortgage ?Tnancing as a proportion of house
costs which would make mortgages more accessible to low-income families.
The private sector is also to be encouraged to provide housing by other
developments in housing finance, including an increase in KHB's long-term
mortgage financing capabilities and establishing medium-term mortgage
financing by commercial banks; reform of the tax system to reduce taxes to
builders and purchasers; and development of a steady supply of land through
the public sector. Rapid and extensive development of land by the public
sector, mainly the Korea Land Development Corporation /2 (KLDC), is also seen
as an important means of stabilizing housing prices.  The objective of
reducing costs is to be addressed by standardization of components and
technological improvements. Additional objectives of the plan include
promoting the provision of rental housing and improving planning and
management of housing developments.
1.15      The general thrust of the objectives and policies for the Fifth Plan
appear appropriate. Improvements in the availability and structure of
mortgage financing for both public and privately developed units are perhaps
the most important steps which may assist the growth of the housing sector.
The NHF was established in July 1981 and is already utilizing pension funds
as a source of finance. While an additional W 300 billion, over and above
the W 440 billion previously earmarked for KHB, was made available to the
private sector under the stimulation measures mentioned earlier, no
fundamental changes have been made in the system for providing mortgage
financing to the private sector. It would be appropriate for significant
changes to await the results of the study of housing finance being
undertaken as part of the housing sector study supported under the first
project (para. 1.21), and that such changes be consistent with the overall
financial sector reforms contemplated by the government.
1.16      The measures proposed to increase private participation in the
sector are also important, but stop short of opening the market to private
developers to try to provide low-income housing. Korean officials believe
that the size of units purchased are a reasonable guide to the level of
income of purchasers. On that basis the housing market is roughly divided
between units of 25.7 py or smaller developed by the public sector to meet
demand up to the 50th percentile of the urban household income distribution,
and larger units developed by the private sector for the upper end of the
market. (In fact, there is some overlap as private sector developers also
build units smaller than 25 py). KNHC and local authorities have access to
land and financing at much lower prices,/3 and are not subject to real
/1 See Chapter III for detailed description of NHF.
/2 See Chapter III for detailed description.
/3 The only exception to this is the program for housing cooperatives.
These cooperatives can obtain land and financing on the same terms as
KNHC. See paras. 4.20-4.22 for more details.

estate related taxes which add significantly to the cost of private
developments. In effect, these subsidies to public developers give them a
major competitive edge over private developers. Whereas subsidies may be
justified in housing as a benefit distribution to lower income families, the
method of allocation in Korea neither ensures this end nor justifies
exclusion of the private developers. To be eligible for publicly developed
units,/1 applicants are only required to demonstrate that they do not own
another house/2 and can provide the necessary downpayment. The government's
assumption is that the families will seek the largest units they can afford,
therefore, the size of the unit will determine which income group will be
interested. If this is true (and there have been no empirical tests), the
subsidies are extended to all units in proportion to their cost, resulting
in greater amounts for larger units (and for families with higher levels of
income) than for smaller units for poorer families. Consequently, the
present system does not ensure equity in subsidy allocation because of
public sector distribution and does not suggest excluding private builders
if they were to restrict allocation in the same manner as the public
developers./3 In order for private developers to have access to land and
financing at the same price as public developers, existing laws, in
particular the Residential Site Development Promotion Law and the Housing
Construction Promotion Law, would need to be revised. This issue of private
sector participation in housing is one of the topics of the housing sector
study financed under the first project and an element of the ongoing
dialogue between the government and the Bank. Incentives and disincentives
(which are, in effect, subsidies) in the housing sector, and their
allocation, are proposed to be the subject of a study financed under this
project. Agreement on this study was obtained at negotiations.
1.17      The recent stimulation measures and the Fifth Plan program for
housing are designed to boost production but without the serious
inflationary effects of the 1970s.  The success of this strategy will
ultimately depend on the performance of the economy as a whole.  If there is
strong growth in the economy, supply capacity, latent demand and an
increasing amount of appropriately structured financing should result in a
resurgence of growth in housing.  If this growth is not to be accompanied by
high levels of inflation in housing and land prices, restraints on the

income requirements, and income verification is required on application.
/2 By providing a certificate from the Gun (county) office stating that
there is no house registered in the ownership of the head of household
in the county.
/3 While public developers are also responsible for ensuring that successful
applicants do not resell their units in a manner that violates their
agreement, this responsibility could be, for example, passed to the
mortgage holder, relieving developers of that problem.

supply of urban land and uncertainty in the policy environment will need to
be reduced.  In particular, financing will have to be directed predominantly
to consumer/investors rather than to speculators.  Concomitantly, the
private sector should produce for the consumer/investor group of whom a
large portion are low income.  It will be necessary, therefore, that the
government remove barriers to private sector participation in the low-income
market and ensure that measures to increase the availability of mortgage
financing with down payments that are affordable by the target group are
instituted in a timely manner.
D. Bank Role and Sector Strategy
Performance under the First Project
1.18      The first project was approved in April 1981 and became effective
in August 1981.  Four primary objectives underlie that project:
(a)  to develop the capability in KLDC to provide serviced residential
sites on a large scale;
(b)  to provide affordable housing to the second quartile of the income
distribution through KNHC;
(c)  to establish a framework for project identification, preparation,
appraisal and implementation through which the Bank could support
future projects on a programmatic basis; and
(d)  to assist in establishing a policy framework for the Korean
housing sector.
1.19      Soon after its establishment in March 1979, KLDC sought Bank
assistance, and although it was less than two years old at the time of
appraisal of the first project, the organization's performance by that time
indicated that it could be an important and effective agency. Its
performance on the first project has fully supported that assessment as all
land development activities have been executed on time and well under
budget.  Extension of the land development program under the loan by the
addition of three sites has been possible as a result.  KNHC has also carried
out all necessary preparatory activities for housing development, including
detailed designs and contract preparation, on schedule and all indications
are that its activities will also meet project objectives.
1.20      Regarding the third objective, results so far are mixed.  The
Ministry of Construction's Housing Bureau (MOC-HB), KLDC and KNHC initially
established a preliminary framework for the housing project cycle, including
a Working Group of these three agencies to be responsible for city and site
selection and developing and maintaining design standards.  However, this
Working Group, which was not able to take binding decisions, has not
functioned on a continuous basis and coordination has been sporadic. During



- 11 -
the preparation of this second project, MOC agreed to establish a senior
level Liaison Committee, chaired by the Director General, MOC-HB, and
including director level representatives of the MOC Land Bureau (LB), KLDC
and KNHC. This committee will be responsible for coordination of program
planning and implementation involving the latter two agencies.  For example,
MOC, KLDC and KNHC have now jointly developed a set of criteria for city and
site selection accommodating the special concerns of each agency which will
be used to choose future sites.  Significant progress has not yet been made
on establishing appraisal capacity for public sector land development and
housing projects in the government.  While KHB has extensive procedures and
experience in appraising private sector proposals, there has been no
recognized need for a similar function for public developers.  The MOC
Housing and Land Bureaus carry out technical reviews of plans prepared by
KNHC and KLDC respectively to ensure compliance with appropriate standards,
but the economic and financial reviews associated with a Bank-type appraisal
are absent.  A study of the requirements for and location of appropriate
appraisal capacity for public developer proposals is proposed to be carried
out under this project. Agreement on this study was obtained at
negotiations.
1.21      The fourth objective, assisting in establishing a housing policy
framework, is being met.  The Bank has participated in discussions of policy
proposals for the housing Master Plan during spring 1981, followed up during
the review of the draft Fifth Plan.  These discussions have continued,
focusing on the NHF and the 1982 implementation plan for the Fifth Plan. To
facilitate mutual understanding between the government and the Bank on
problems and prospects for the sector, a Housing Sector Study was financed
under the first project.  To oversee the study, which is being carried out
by KRIHS, the government formed an Advisory Committee chaired by the
Director General, MOC-HB and including representatives of EPB, Ministry of
Finance, KNHC, KLDC and KHB. The study which began in May 1982 will:
(a)  assess housing (sales and rental) demand and identify
housing solutions that would be acceptable in the
Korean market;
(b)  assess the total amount of financing available to the
housing sector together with the necessary terms and
conditions for mobilizing and allocating these resources;
(c)  examine the role and performance of the private sector
in the housing market and how its participation may be
increased;
(d)  examine the impact of housing demolition and expansion/
renewal policies on the housing market; and
(e)  develop a housing sector information and monitoring system.



- 12 -
The Bank has been intensively involved in the discussions of the methodology
and work plans for these studies and will be similarly involved in the
discussions of the findings and implications of these studies at both the
interim and final report stage. The occasion of the presentation of the
interim results (late November this year) will be used by the government and
the Bank as a forum for formal policy dialogue on the sector.
Sector Strategy and Project Rationale
1.22      The Bank's sector strategy focuses on encouraging and supporting
the following key activities:
(a)  ensuring stable and adequate resources to the sector;
(b)  expanding private sector participation in the housing market;
(c)  rationalizing of roles and functions in the public sector
and strengthening the public sector institutions;
(d)  developing sound financial policies for the expansion and
utilization of the NHF;
(e)  developing a viable economic and financial analysis and
appraisal capability for housing sector programs; and
(f)  strengthening policies and programs for improved delivery
of housing to lower income families.
The first project, its associated studies and the dialogue which has taken
place to this time have developed a better understanding of the sector,
assisted institutional development and introduced solutions such as cross-
subsidization of land prices and expandable core and row houses to benefit
low-income families. This proposed second project is timely in that it
would reinforce and expand the institution building that has taken place and
will involve the NHF during its early development. Rather than focusing on
the details of specific plans and designs, this project in its preparation
emphasized reaching agreements on the process, principles and criteria by
which land and housing development programs and projects would be prepared
and implemented, as is usually necessary when initiating lending in a
sector.  In addition, this second project would help to maintain the
government/Bank dialogue, deepen Bank participation in and knowledge of the
sector and its institutions and would link with the discussions related to
and arising from the study of the housing sector financed under the first
project. Assurances on the continuation of government/Bank dialogue on
housing policies were obtained at negotiations.

II. PROJECT COMPONENTS, COSTS AND FINANCING
A. Objectives
2.01      This project is intended to advance the Bank/government dialogue
on sector policy and programs. In keeping with this, this project would:
(a)  assist in the rationalization of roles and functions and
strengthen the housing and land development institutions in the
public sector. Specifically, the National Housing Fund (NHF),
created July 1981, would assume a more prominent role in long-term
housing finance absorbing functions of the previous public sector
low-income housing finance program managed by the Korea Housing
Bank (KHB) and the foreign loan program previously managed by the
Korea National Housing Corporation (KNHC). In addition, KNHC
would be encouraged to focus on housing construction and the Korea
Land Development Corporation (KLDC) on developing land especially
for low-cost housing. The basis for formulating housing programs
and determining housing mix would be improved, and a coordinated
and rationalized system for city and site selection would be
developed and implemented;
*(b) support the development of the NHF with a view to establishing a
viable financial intermediary with the capability for project
appraisal and supervision; and
(c)  support the policies and programs for improving the delivery of
housing to lower income families by financing the development of
land and housing by KLDC, KNHC, housing cooperatives and local
authorities. The primary target income group will be the 15th to
the 50th percentile of the urban household income distribution.
B. Project Summary
2.02      The proposed project would support about 3% of the public sector
land development and 1% of public sector housing development programs in the
Fifth Plan. It would provide residential and commercial plots and housing
units for low-income households in a number of cities throughout the country
(see para. 2.03), and would be similar to and based upon the experience of
the first housing project. KLDC would acquire and develop the land, and
KNHC and housing cooperatives through local governments and private builders
would provide housing for low-income families on the low-income plots.
Off-site infrastructure would be developed either by KLDC or local
governments depending on arrangements in each city.
2.03      The project would consist of:



- 14 -
(a) development of about 1.43 million py of urban residential land
by KLDC with a total of about 22,900 low and middle-income
plots; approximately 770,000 py in six cities in Phase I, and
about 660,000 py in Phase II in a number of cities and sites to be
selected by criteria and procedures agreed with the Bank;
(b)  construction by KNHC of about 10,100 housing units for low-income
families; about 5,500 units on Phase I sites and 4,600 units on
Phase II sites;
(c) construction of about 2,500 housing units by housing cooperatives
through a program supervised by KLDC and local authorities with
about 1,300 units on Phase I sites and 1,200 units on Phase II
sites (see para. 4.20);
(d) provision of about 10,300 middle-income serviced lots; and
(e)  technical assistance to MOC-HB, KLDC and KNHC for future project
preparation, training and studies (e.g., on incentives and
disincentives, policies and practices, public sector appraisal
capacity, and monitoring and evaluation).
C. Project Details and Content
2.04       The planning principles will be similar to the other shelter pro-
jects supported by the Bank in Korea./I On sites developed for multiple
uses profits from the sale of open commercial and middle-income residential
plots would be used to cross-subsidize plots for families in the target
group of the 15th-50th percentile of the urban household income distribu-
tion.  Housing units as well as serviced plots would be provided to the
target group and sold with long-term mortgages. Within this target group,
30% of the units would be for the 15-19th percentile, 50% for the 20-39th
percentile, and 20% for the 40-50th percentile. The affordability criteria
of 40% down payment (see para. 5.03) and maximum of 30% of monthly household
income for mortgage payments would be used. Expandable core houses, row
houses and apartments would be built in appropriate proportions to achieve
the required distribution. These planning and allocation criteria were
confirmed at negotiatons.
2.05       The project will be structured into two phases.  In both phases
low-income residential areas wlll be developed as serviced sites to be sold
/1 Secondary Cities Regional Project (Loan 1070-KO, approved 1975); Second
Gwangju Regional Project (Loan 1758-KO, approved 1978); National Urban
Land Development and Housing Project (Loan 1980-KO, approved 1981).

to members of housing cooperatives for construction of house types determined
by the members. By including serviced low-income lots with housing con-
structed by small, local contractors, the project would provide a better test
for the types and sizes of units being demanded by this income group. Local
governments would be responsible for promoting the formation of these housing
cooperatives, borrowing the necessary funds from the NHF to be on-lent to the
cooperatives and supervising the implementation of the program by coopera-
tives. Agreement on the participation of housing cooperatives in the project
were obtained at negotiations.
2.06      Phase I will consist of six sites already selected (Anyang, Jeonju,
Suweon, Gangreung, Gimhae and Daijeon) for which land development will be
carried out by KLDC under CPL procedures, except in the case of Suweon,
which will be done under the LR law,/1 and on which housing will be
constructed by housing cooperatives (Daijeon) and KNHC (all others). These
sites were selected jointly by KLDC and KNHC from 18 sites visited by their
planning teams in May 1981; the Bank's September preparation mission gave
preliminary agreement to these sites. The sites at Suweon (Gweonseon),
Anyang I (Sanbon), Gangreung (Noam) and Jeonju (Hyoja) were assigned to local
consultants /2 who prepared feasibility studies and detailed engineering.
These studies were reviewed during the April 1982 appraisal mission and
indicate that these sites are suitable for financing under the project.
Development of these sites would represent about a third of the program.
2.07      Phase II will consist of a number of sites to be selected totalling
approximately 660,000 py. KLDC will select these sites based on KNHC's
requirements, specified by year, cities, size, cost and locational charac-
teristics. However, should KLDC be unable to find sufficient sites suitable
to KNHC, KNHC will be able to select sites of its own to fill its requirements
for the year.  Similarly, if KNHC is unable to use all of the low-income
residential land developed by KLDC, KLDC will sell such remaining lands to
local governments and housing cooperatives. Nevertheless, it is agreed
that at least 60% of Phase II will be developed by KLDC for sale to KNHC (see
paras. 4.05-4.09 for details). To facilitate these procedures, a senior-level
Liaison Committee of MOC (Chairman), KNHC and KLDC has been established, and
a set of city and site selection criteria has been agreed between MOC, KLDC
and the Bank. The use of this committee and the criteria were confirmed at
negotiations. This approach is in keeping with the development of guidelines,
principles and criteria for designing and implementing programs for land
development and housing.
2.08      A summary of project location (see Annex 4 for a description of
project cities) and scale is given in the following table:
/1 CPL is City Planning Law; LR is Land Readjustment Law.

Land Acquisition
2.09     KLDC is acquiring land using the Site Development Promotion Law
and direct negotiations. This law /1 facilitates the acquisition of housing
development sites in and around urban areas.  It complements the City
Planning Law (CPL) and Land Readjustment Project Law (LRPL) procedures that
are normally used in Korean practice. A discussion of the relative merits
of CPL and LRPL is presented in the Staff Appraisal Report on the first
project./2 Under these laws and standard negotiating practices of KLDC,
land acquisition can be expected to proceed smoothly with a time lag of six
months from site selection to possession. Under this project only one site
will be developed under the LRPL procedure. The LRPL procedure is becoming
less popular as a method of land development among Korean agencies concerned
because of the more cumbersome administrative requirements and the generally
longer lead time required to take posession of the land.  The size of the
sites needed to be developed in order to produce a reasonable amount of
low-income land (now averaging only 10% of gross site area) is also a
discouraging factor.
Land Development
2.10     As in the first project, KLDC will develop the sites in accordance
with existing planning regulations and standards, providing all services
stipulated for the category of land use being planned. Each site will be
designed as an integrated unit and provided with community facilities and
commercial areas. The cost of all off-site infrastructure required to
service each site as well as any main services crossing each site will be
shared by the central and local governments.

2.11      Proposed land uses for project sites are presented in Annex 5,
Appendix A and details of the corresponding site development works are

Housing Construction
2.12      On completion of land preparation, KLDC will sell to KNHC approx-
imately 40% of the net residential land area available at each multiple uses
site for construction of low-income housing of various types, affordable to
households in the 15th-50th percentile of the urban household income distri-
bution. In one Phase I site and an undetermined number of Phase II sites
the low-income land will be sold to housing cooperatives for construction of
house types determined by the members. An analysis of unit costs of
different housing types being designed and constructed by KNHC showed that
12 py and 15 py apartments were affordable to the 15-19th percentiles and
15 py row houses and 17 py apartments to the 20-29th percentiles. It has
been agreed that 30% of units will go to the income group from the 15th to
the 19th percentile, 50% to the 20th to the 39th percentile, and 20% to the
40th to the 50th percentile of the income distribution. The mix of units
within these groups has been determined by market surveys (para. 4.18). As
a result, for planning and cost estimation purposes the following unit types
and distribution have been agreed:

Public Facilities
2.13      The project sites require a number of community facilities such
as schools, markets, playgrounds, police posts, post offices, etc. A summary
of the facilities required to be provided for Phase I sites together with
estimated costs is given in Annex 5, Appendix D. These facilities are to be
provided by the local government/central government agency concerned out of
their normal budgetary allocations and phased in to suit the implementaion
schedule of the project. Assurances were obtained during loan negotiations
that these facilities will be provided in a timely manner and progress will be
monitored and reported on during project implementation.

Technical Assistance
2.14      The Technical Assistance component (see Annex 9 for details) under
this project will include:
(a)  Staff training:  In-service as well as overseas training for MOC,
KLDC and KNHC staff in areas of housing finance, real estate
development and management, engineering and construction.
(b)  Project Preparation:  Feasibility studies and detailed engineering
costs for work leading to a possible future project are estimated
at US$1.0 million, based on employing local consulting firms for a
total of about 330 man-months at an average cost of US$3,000/
man-month.
(c)  Monitoring and Evaluation:  Continuation of the programs of surveys
and analysis begun under the first project to determine the impact
and effectiveness of the land development and housing activities.
The land development program will be evaluated by KLDC and housing
will be evaluated by KNHC.
(d)  Studies in the housing sector are estimated to require about 65
man-months of total consulting time at an average cost of US$3,000/
man-month (totalling US$200,000). The content of these studies
(paras. 1.16 and 1.20) were agreed at negotiations.
D. Cost Estimates
2.15      The total project cost is estimated to be W 233.8  billion
(US$ 316.0 million equivalent) of which the foreign exchange element, mostly
indirect, is estimated to be about 32% or about US$100 million. The tax
element of total project cost is estimated at US$8.99 million. Summary

2.16      Project costs were estimated by KLDC staff and consultants for
land development on the basis of detailed designs for Phase I sites and for
housing construction by KNHC staff on the basis of similar on-going pro-
grams. All cost estimates are based on September 1982 prices. Design and
supervision costs are estimated at 3% of civil works, and physical contin-
gencies are estimated at 10% of applicable costs for land development and
off-site infrastructure or about 2% of base cost. No physical contingencies
have been allowed for housing construction, since contracts are "lump sum"
bids for a specified number of completed units. Price contingencies for
local currency costs are based on expected increases in construction costs
of 7% in 1982, 8% in 1983, 7.5% in 1984 and 7% per annum thereafter. The
corresponding rates for foreign costs are 8.0%, 8.0%, 7.5% and 7.0%,
respectively. The overall price contingency amounts to about 9% for land
development and 24% for housing construction. Local consulting services
are estimated at an average cost of $3,000 per man-month
E. Financial Arrangements
2.17      The proposed Bank loan of $100 million (W 74 billion) including
front end fee will finance the project's foreign exchange requirements. The
loan will be made to the government of the Republic of Korea, which will
pass the funds on as loans and grants (for studies) to the project agencies
(i.e., KLDC and MOC/NHF). Details of how the Bank loan will be passed on to
the respective agencies are given in Annex 2. KLDC would provide about
US$72.8 million equivalent (W 53.9 billion) and NHF about US$47.1 million
equivalent (W 34.8 billion) from their own resources or other borrowings.
KLDC is expected to raise a substantial portion of the funds through land
sales and central government contributions. The Bank project would form a
small slice (1%) of NHF-s program over 1982-86 which is financed primarily
through the issuance of housing bonds, mobilization of local savings and
central government contributions. KNIHC and the housing cooperatives are
expected to raise additional funds required for housing construction, about
US$67.7 million equivalent (W 50.1 billion) and US$18.1 million equivalent
(W 13.4 billion), respectively, from down payments. In line with the
financing arrangements for areas promoted for housing estates as designated
by MOC, the capital cost of off-site infrastructure of US$10.3 million
equivalent (W 7.6 billion) will be shared equally by central and local
governments. Community facilities will be provided by local governments as
required. Details concerning NdF, KLDC and KNdC's sources of funds are
given in Chapter IIL. Assurances were obtained during negotiations that the
concerned cities will enter into agreements with KLDC on project
implementation and provide their share of the funds required for off-site
infrastructure and community facilities in a timely manner. The front end
fee of about US$1.48 million (W 1.09 billion equivalent) would be financed
by the Bank and is included in the loan amount. Sources of funds for the
total project are as follows (see Annex 2 for details):

Terms of Loans
2.18      ROK will repay the Bank loan over a 15-year period including an
initial three-year grace period at the standard variable interest rate. It
is proposed that the Bank loan will be onlent to the project agencies in
accordance with normal government practice, through subsidiary loan agreements
at the same interest rate as the Bank loan plus 0.05% for handling charges for
15 years with a three-year grace period.  KLDC and NHF will bear the foreign
exchange risk for their respective shares of the loan. These transactions
will be covered under subsidiary loan agreements, the signing of which would
be conditions of loan effectiveness.  These arrangements were confirmed at
negotiations.
2.19      The NHF will blend the Bank funds with its other sources of funds
and on-lend to KNHC at its prevailing interest rate under a financing
agreement, the signing of which would be a condition of disbursement.  This
arrangement was confirmed at negotiations. Interest rates are currently 10%
for construction of all units 25 py or less. Government will pass on the
responsibility for repayment of the front end fee to KLDC and NHF for their
respective portions, in accordance with current practice. The arrangements
for passing on the front end fee to the relevant agencies were agreed during
negotiations.
Inflation and Interest Rate to Beneficiaries
2.20      Despite the onset of a deep recession and negative economic growth,
Korea's rate of inflation accelerated from 22.7% in 1979 to 35.0% in 1980./i
As a result of its concern about inflation, the government instituted policies
which have reduced the rate to 14.7% in 1981 and it is expected to be about
7% in 1982. In line with the decreasing inflation rate, the government
has recently adjusted interest rates downward across all sectors, including
the housing sector, but maintaining the objective of ensuring positive
interest rates. The rate of interest charged to the project beneficiaries for
housing loans by the NHF is presently set at 10%. The onlending interest rate
is positive in real terms. Mortgage interest rate policy will be examined
further in the context of a housing sector study underway and through the
scheduled periodic review of performance on housing policies.

III. SECTORAL AGENCIES
A. Institutional Framework
Sector Institutions and their Roles
3,01      The key institutions in the housing sector in Korea are:  the
Housing Policy Review Committee, the Ministry of Construction (MOC) Hou3ing
and Land Bureaus, the Korea National Housing Corporation (KNHC), the K.;ea
Land Development Corporation (KLDC), the National Housing Fund (NHF), the
Korea Housing Bank (KHB) the Citizens National Bank (CNB), all under public
sector control and a private trade association, the Korea Housing
Association (KHA).
3.02      The Housing Policy Review Committee authorized under the Housing
Construction Promotion Law is composed of up to 20 members, chaired by the
Minister of the Economic Planning Board (EPB); Vice-chairman, the MOC
Minister; with representatives from the economic ministries;/l the Senior
Secretary to the President in charge of the economy; Chief of the Office of
Administrative Coordination in the Prime Minister's Office; the Presidents
of KNHC and KLDC and representatives of the private sector. The Director-
Generals of EPB Policy Bureau and MOC-HB are secretaries to the Committee.
A primary responsibility of this committee is to review and approve the
annual Housing Construction Plan (HCP). The Committee is advised by a
Working Level Committee, chaired by the MOC Vice Minister and with represen-
tatives from all ministries on the Policy Review Committee. The secretariat
to the Working Level Committee is the MOC-HB/Policy Division (PD). The
annual HCP establishes the year's allocation of the number of public sector
housing units to be built, the distribution of sizes, the amount and type of
loan funds and their rates and terms, by province and by developer. Prepar-
ation of this plan, which by law must be completed and reviewed by the end
of February each year, begins in September of the preceding year
3.03      Targets for KNHC (discussed in para. 3.55) are fixed by MOC-HB/PD
in consultation with the Corporation. The local government allocations are
determined following a review, in light of KNHC's allocation, of the proposals
submitted by the local authorities. MOC makes global allocations to pro-
vinces; the provincial governor decides on city and county allocations knowing
KNHC's program in the province.  The draft plan is first discussed at the
Working Level Committee before being submitted to the Policy Review Committee.
/1 Home Affairs, Finance, Education, Agriculture and Fisheries, Commerce
and Industry, Energy, and Resources, Health and Social Affairs, Labor and
Communications.



- 22 -
Once the plan is agreed, KNHC, Provincial Governors and KHB (as administrators
of the NHF) are informed of the year's program. MOC exercises no control over
the execution of the plan by the developers, it only submits a quarterly
report to EPB summarizing progress, based on data provided by KNHC and local
authorities.
3.04      MOC's Housing and Land Bureaus are responsible for, inter alia, pre-
paring recommendations on housing and land policy establishing and controll-
ing building and land development standards, and overseeing the operations of
KNHC and KLDC, respectively. Korea National Housing Corporation is the major
public sector housing developer, while Korea Land Development Corporation
develops land for both public and private sector users. The National Housing
Fund is the major public sector housing finance institution. Its policies and
programs are determined by MOC and administered by the Korea Housing Bank
staff as a separate operation to KHB-s own activities, and it provides housing
finance primarily for new construction.
3.05      Citizens National Bank's housing finance operation is a very small
part (about 6%) of its overall lending program. About W 30 billion (average
loan W 5 million) in housing loans were advanced in 1981 for the purchase of
existing houses (about 90% of funds loaned) and for home improvement and home
expansion. CNB, which is 70% government owned, is the largest deposit mobil-
izer in Korea with assets of W 2,020 billion, W 1,882 billion in deposits.
Its primary lending activities are for small-scale industry /1 (W 400 billion
or about 45% of 1981's lending) and what are called "general populace" loans
to its depositors.
3.06      The Korea Housing Association was incorporated June 14, 1978 as a
consultative organization for housing contractors. It serves as an infor-
mation clearing house for its members, gathering and disseminating data on
building materials, structural technology and cost in housing construction.
In addition, it is an effective lobby group for the interests of large private
developers. KHA currently has 70 members, of whom 93% are government desig-
nated housing contractors - the major private builders in Korea. The
organization structure of KHA consists of a General Assembly, a ten-member
Board of Directors, five executive officers and other supporting staff. The
General Assembly establishes policy, the Board of Directors formulates
organizational strategy to carry out the General Assembly mandate and the
administrative staff manages the day-to-day affairs of the association.
B. Ministry of Construction - Housing Bureau (MOC-HB)
3.07      The MOC-HB is responsible for inter alia, recommending housing
policies and building regulations, developing and supervising NHF's plans and
/1 The Bank has supported this program with two loans of US$30 million
each, one in 1980 (Loan 1829-KO) and more recently in April 1982
(Loan 2144-KO).



- 23 -
programs, and conducting research on technical issues. The Bureau has a total
staff of 42, including 35 professionals. Its four divisions are concerned
with housing policy, housing management, building technical guidance and the
architecture law.
3.08      The Housing Policy Division, with ten professional staff, recommends
housing policy for Korea concerning taxation, rental housing and foreign
borrowings and supervises KNHC. Its policies affect both the public and
private sectors involved in the provision of housing. This division is the
main point of contact for the Bank's ongoing dialogue of housing sector
policies in Korea.
3.09      The Housing Management Division has nine professional staff and has
two main functions. First, it is responsible for developing policies on the
management of collective (apartment) housing estates, including the
organization arrangements for self-management. Second, it handles the
approval of housing construction plans, which it largely delegates to the
provincial governments, except for the plans prepared by KNHC and the four
"special cities" (Seoul, Busan, Incheon and Daegu).
3.10      The Division for Building Technical Guidance, seven professional
staff, conducts research on technical issues, including construction costs,
designs and materials, and it stages an annual exhibition. In addition, it
develops standard house designs for which individual home buyers can eliminate
the need to hire an architect.
3.11      The last division, the Architects Division is responsible for the
development of the Architecture Law which stipulates building regulations. It
has a staff of eight professionals, mostly architects and engineers.
C. Ministry of Construction - Land Bureau (MOC-LB)
3.12      The MOC-LB is responsible for, inter alia, land policy, land devel-
opment, acquisition of public land, establishment of standard land prices and
the supervision of KLDC. The bureau has a staff of 43, 30 of whom are pro-
fessionals, organized in four divisions: Policy, Development, Administration
and Management, and Land Price Surveys.
3.13      The Land Policy Division, with a staff of nine (six professionals)
is responsible for recommending national land policy, controlling land
transactions, land banking (as a means of price control) and the supervision
of KLDC's finances, planning and policies.
3.14      The Land Development Division, staffed with ten professionals, over-
sees the programs for local industrial estate development and the development
of sites for heavy industry. In addition, the Division carries out long-term
demand and supply planning for various land uses and designates and oversees



- 24 -
the development of housing estates under the Housing Estates Promotion Law.
As part of this latter function, it reviews KLDC project proposals and
implementation.
3.15      The Land Administration Division, with seven professional staff, is
responsible for the purchasing of, and the compensation system for, public
lands. For this function it studies and establishes measures for compulsory
purchasing and carries out appraisals of land. Expropriation of lands is
under the authority of an Expropriation Committee which the Division operates.
3.16      The fourth division of the Bureau, Land Price Surveys, has six
professionals, who periodically survey changes in land prices, study the land
appraisal system and are responsible for the notification of standard land
prices which are used for public acquisition throughout the country.
D. National Housing Fund
3.17      The NHF was established on July 20, 1981 with the objective of
raising and facilitating the supply of housing finance to enable the govern-
ment to carry out its overall National Housing Construction Plan. Provision
of housing finance to low-income groups is an important consideration in NHF's
operation. The Fund is essentially an expanded version of the National
Housing Construction Loan (NHCL) Program started in 1973 operated by the Korea
Housing Bank, but which has become a separate fund distinct from the KHB.
While KHB is answerable to the Ministry of Finance, the NHF is directly
answerable to the Ministry of Construction who determines its overall policies
on the advice of the MOC-HB/Policy Division. For administrative purposes, the
day-to-day management of the Fund has been delegated to the President of KHB
and his designated staff.
3.18      Under the overall direction and supervision of MOC-s Housing Bureau,
NHF has recently been reorganized into one department headed by a managing
director of the.KHB. There are three divisions in the NHF responsible for
fund raising operations and administration. The method of operation is
similar to that of the former NHCL but with an expanded staff complement.
NHF-s headquarters staff currently number about 26 who rely on KHB's extensive
branch staff for administering NHF's operations.
3.19     The NHF is designed to be significantly larger and to have a much
greater impact on the housing sector than the former NHCL. While the NHCL
was empowered to tap various resources such as national housing bonds, housing
lottery, central government loans, foreign loans, and loans from the KHB
agricultural cooperative unions and local governments, it historically relied
on housing bonds for the bulk of its lendable funds. The NHCL found itself
offering increasingly higher rates for its bonds (from.6% in 1977 to 12% in
1981) while its own lending rate remained at 15.5-18% In addition, its
volume of lendable funds did not grow as rapidly as NHCL desired, since its
main source of revenue was tied to the compulsory purchase of bonds by those
who required various type of licenses, permits or registrations from the



- 25 -
central or local government. In 1980, about W 123 billion in housing bonds
were sold and about W 5 billion raised from profits on the housing lottery.
Even though this was a 30% increase over the combined amount raised in 1979,
the volume was still considered insufficient to meet the requirements for
national housing finance.
3.20      Another difficulty facing the NHCL was the restriction to 20-40% of
housing price that it could finance. This meant that potential home purchas-
ers were required to provide a down payment of 60-80% of the housing price,
which was prohibitive for the low-income groups. This limitation has been
removed so that the NHF will be able to provide financing for approximately
50% of the housing cost, on average, during the Fifth Plan. Loan ceilings are
established which permit financing of up to 60% of the house cost for the
smaller units (less than 15 py) with the proportion of financing decreasing as
house size increases. As an upper limit, the NHF does not finance units
greater than 25 py, which is considered to be the size of a moderate income
house. In 1981 about 75% of NHF's funds were directed for units of 13 py or
less with another 21% for units of 15 py.
Financial Policies and Structure
3.21     NHF housing loans are mostly made available to local governments,
housing cooperatives and KNHC. National housing funds are currently provided
mainly in the form of housing construction and housing lottery loans.
National housing construction loans, which represent about 96% of NHF's out-
standing loans as of end 1981, are released for construction of small houses
built in large quantities for low-income families without homes of their own.
The loan amount is converted to mortgages and passed on to each purchaser at
the time of house purchasing. The current interest rate for loans for con-
struction of units is 10% to be repaid over 20 years on a graduated payment
mortgage (GPM) basis, whereby payments increase by a predetermined amount over
the life of the mortgage. About 80% of the funds available for lending in
1982 are planned to finance construction of units 15 py and smaller.
3.22     A portion of NHF's loans for construction (about 10%) will be made
available for other special projects and rental housing. Included in the
category of special projects are disaster relief, redevelopment and solar
housing projects which carry an interest rate of 10%, to be repaid over 20
years. Government support in the form of equity contributions for the public
sector rental housing program was discontinued in 1981 due to a policy of
emphasis on home ownership, but support for rental housing has resumed in 1982
on a smaller scale through loans from NHF. About 9,000 rental units will be
supported by the NHF in 1982, including about 2,200 units to be constructed by
KNHC. Future plans to support rental housing are uncertain at this time, but
proposals are currently being discussed and are expected to be announced soon.
Rental housing construction loans are made at 5% to public sector agencies and
at 10% for the private sector, over 20 years.
3.23     Housing lottery loans, which represented about 3.7% of outstanding
loans at end 1981, are made to veterans and families of those who died in



- 26 -
service. The terms of lending are at 4% over 20 years on a GPM basis. The
remaining 0.3% of NHF's portfolio of loans consists of loans to small private
developers for site development which were inherited from the NHCL program.
Currently, NHF does not advance loans to private developers, but they can
seek financing from KHB and CNB.  NHF's average on-lending rate for new
loans is estimated at about 10% for 1982, and its interest income as a
percent of average loan portfolio managed during 1982 is estimated at about
12%.
3.24      With the establishment of the NHF, new funding sources will be
available. Among these new sources are various national pension funds (i.e.
Government Personnel, Military and Private Teachers' Pension Funds) and
direct equity contributions from central government. Pension fund resources
previously deposited with commercial banks will be diverted to the NHF,
which will pay the same interest rate as would be earned with the commercial
banks./l The term of the pension fund borrowings is 3 years. Pension funds
provided W 14.5 billion in 1981 as a source of housing finance to the NHF
and are expected to provide about W 46 billion in 1982 or about 11% of NHF's
total sources of funds. Government equity contributions will be made
available to the NHF for the first time in 1982, providing an estimated W 39
billion or approximately 9% of NHF's total sources of funds.
3.25     The national housing bonds, which are redeemable in five years, are
still expected to provide the largest source of funds amounting to about
W 148.3 billion in 1982 or 36% of total funds; about W 126 billion of
housing bonds were issued in 1981. The remaining sources of funds for NHF's
1982 program are expected to be provided mainly from homebuyers' savings
deposits, repayment of housing loans and profits from the housing lottery. As
a last source of funds, the NHF plans to issue national housing fund bonds to
be purchased on a voluntary basis. These bonds will carry a market interest
rate (currently 13.5%) and be redeemable in three years and are expected to be
sold mainly to pension funds and insurance companies. Since they carry a high
interest rate, they will be issued only if required. Although their market-
ability is untested, the high interest rate is expected to guarantee their
attractiveness./l They are estimated to provide about 4% of NHF's fund
requirements in 1982. NHF's 1982 average cost of borrowed funds is estimated
at 6.35% and total cost of funds at 4.85% (see para. 3.31), and its
interest expense as a percent of average funds in use is estimated at about
8.5% in 1982.
3.26     The financial statements for NHF as of December 31, 1981 and for the
Fifth Plan are shown in Annex 3, Tables 1-4. At end 1981 NHF had total assets
of W 685 billion including outstanding housing loans and mortgages of W 587
billion (86%). Collection practices are good; arrears amounted to about 3.2%
of total payments due during 1981. The legal sanctions operate effectively in
Korea, thus reducing the number of defaults on mortgages to a minimum. In
/1 A three-year savings deposit at a commercial bank currently earns 8%
per year.

addition, the current system of salary bonuses every three months allows those
late to be able to make up delinquent accounts on a quarterly basis. Collec-
tion of payments by homebuyers is the responsibility of NHF (handled by KHB
staff in practice), except in those cases where land ownership has not been
transferred,/1 for which the mortgages are the responsibility of KNHC or local
authorities. Even in these cases, payments are made by homebuyers through KHB
branch offices or where they do not exist, through commercial bank branch
offices.
3.27     NWF's operating revenues are mainly in the form of interest income
on loans and mortgages. Its operating expenses include interest payments on
savings deposits and borrowings as well as administration expenses. NHF pays
administration fees to KHB amounting to 2.2% of the average outstanding
balance of loans administered during the year, based on an estimate of KHB's
staff costs for handling the NHF program. Based on a survey of administration
costs associated with management of other government fund accounts, the NHF
fees paid to KHB have been criticized as being high. It is difficult to
assess accurately the actual costs associated with managing the fund due to
the extensive branch staff involved in administering its operations. Assu-
rances were obtained during negotiations that NHF will re-examine the fee rate
at mid-1983 to determine its appropriateness.
3.28      NHF currently offers one type of savings scheme for its depositors,
whereby the required monthly deposit varies according to the desired house
size. In order to be eligible for a mortgage under the public sector housing
program, homebuyers must have an account with NHF and must have made deposits
on a continuous basis for at least one year. Priority for loans will be given
to those who opened an account first and on the basis of size of deposits.
Currently, NHF pays interest on savings deposits (held more than two years) at
the interest rate prevailing at the time the account was opened. In early
1982, this interest rate was 13% whereas in April 1982 the rate dropped to
10% and in June 1982 the rate again dropped to 6%, in line with overall
interest rate decreases in Korea. Should interest rates on new accounts
decrease (as is currently the case), old accounts could continue to receive
previous (higher) rate of interest for indefinite periods of time, affecting
NHF's overall financial viability. MOC-HB has agreed to revise contracts on
new savings deposits to either (a) fluctuate the interest rate with changes in
commercial bank deposits or (b) set a time period for which savers are to
receive a fixed interest rate. Assurances were obtained during negotiations
that contracts for savings schemes will be revised in line with one of the two
above methods by July 1983.
NHF's Program for the Fifth Plan
3.29      The basic goals of the Fifth Plan for the housing sector are to
enhance the housing supply ratio to 78.4% by 1986 from 74.5% in 1980 and to
/1 As is often the case with land readjustment projects, for example, where
clear titles to the land may take as long as eight years.



- 28 -
increase the living space per capita to 3.4 py in 1986 from 2.8 py in 1980
through the provision of housing finance to support the construction of about
1.46 million units. NHF would need to provide about W 5,691 billion including
W 3,218 billion to support the construction of about 570,000 units (40%) by
the public sector and W 1,218 billion to finance debt servicing requirements.
The balance of units (60%) would be constructed by the private sector
financed primarily by KHB.
3.30      Of the total capital requirements, the largest share, 28%
(W 1,598 billion), is expected to be provided through the issuance of national
housing bonds which, as mentioned before, are compulsory for those requiring
certain licenses, permits or registrations (para. 3.19). The growth in funds
to be provided from this source is in line with past performance and is
considered reasonable. Government equity contributions are expected to
provide about 11% (W 603 billion) and pension funds about 17% (W 957 billion)
of the total requirement. Since these are new sources for NHF's program,
assurances were obtained during negotiations that government would provide
the appropriate level of equity contributions and cause an adequate level of
pension funds to be provided to the NHF to support this level of funding. An
additional 21% (W 1,186 billion) of funds is expected to be provided from
proceeds of housing loans collected over the period, for which no problems are
currently foreseen given the current performance with collections. The
remaining domestic sources of funds are scheduled to be provided from home
buyers' savings deposits (2%), profits from the housing lottery and interest
earnings (1%), accrued interest on housing bonds (15%), and lastly through
issuance of national housing fund bonds (2%). It is hoped that foreign
loans would provide about 4% (W 210 billion) of the total sources of funds,
of which about 60% of this is already either committed or under discussion.
No major problems are foreseen in NHF being able to meet the above
requirements, given the appropriate level of government support.
3.31      This project represents only a small slice (2%) of NHF's 1983-85
program and is intended to support the construction of about 12,550 units at a
cost of about $201.5 million, for which the Bank loan would provide about
40% of the funds requirement. The Bank loan is expected to be made available
to the NHF beginning in 1983. Although the current interest rate on the Bank
loan (11.43%) is higher than NHF's onlending rate for low-income housing
(10%), this is not expected to create any problem regarding NHF's overall
financial viability. NHF's 1982 average cost of borrowed funds is estimated
at about 6.35%, and its average cost for all resources is estimated at about
4.85% due to several sources of funds with little or no financial cost,
including government equity contributions, repayments of previous loans and
profits of the housing lottery fund managed by NHF. The Bank loan would be
blended with NHF's other resources to yield an average cost of funds which
would provide a sufficient margin for management fees.
3.32      An objective of this project is to prepare the NHF to take on major
sectoral responsibilities including the appraisal and supervision of the
public sector program, in addition to its task of onlending housing finance to
implementation bodies such as KNHC, local governments and housing coopera-
tives. Currently, NHF does not appraise public housing projects in terms of



- 29 -
applying affordability criteria or by assessing market demand. Public sector
thinking is that size of unit alone determines the income level of the home
buyer, since only low-income families would purchase small units. The ability
to conduct proper market demand surveys is being built up in KLDC and KNHC,
which will need to be assessed by the NHF in the future. A study of the
requirements for and the location of appropriate appraisal capacity for public
developer proposals is included under this project to address this issue.
E. Korea Land Development Corporation
3.33      The Korea Land Development Corporation (KLDC) is a government-owned
corporation, established on March 27, 1979 as a result of the dissolution and
restructuring of the Korea Land Bank. The latter had been created in 1975 to
acquire land held by business firms in excess of their operating needs. The
problems of coordinating land banking activities with urban development
activities led, however, to the creation of KLDC, an organization committed to
the goal of improving urban development policies. KLDC's major activities
consist of acquiring land suitable for resale and development and sale of land
for residential and industrial use. In addition, KLDC has a mandate to shape
and carry out government policies on land reclamation, as well as new town and
new city development projects. The major near-term priority for KLDC is the
development of residential land for low-income groups. A full description of
KLDC's activities is given in the appraisal report of the first project;/l
developments since then are presented below.
3.34      KLDC's establishment includes a president, executive vice-president.
auditor and five vice-presidents and has recently been reorganized into ten
departments. In addition to the Seoul-based headquarters staff, the branch
offices have been expanded from eight to eleven offices in the past eighteen
months and are augmented by project site offices as needed. The organization
structure is depicted in Chart 24024.
3.35      At a time when the staff levels of other government departments
and government-owned corporations are being reduced, KLDC has been able to
continue to expand its professional staff to 312 in its Seoul-based head-
quarters operation plus some 422 in its eleven branch offices. The staff
in the Loan Projects Department, which is responsible for administering
Bank supported projects, have been increased nearly two-fold in the past year
and a half to 40. In addition to their other duties, these staff have begun
to take over the role of project preparation which was previously handled by
local consultants, and they have nearly completed preparation of their first
project. As these staff become more experienced in this role, KLDC is
expected to further decrease its reliance on consultant staff.
3.36      During 1981 KLDC began implementation of projects under the first
Bank loan on 9 sites covering over 1 million py in large, medium and small
/1 Korea National Urban Land Development and Housing Project, Staff Appraisal
Report, Report No. 3298a-KO, March 23, 1981, Chapter III.



- 30 -
urban areas nationwide. Progress on these sites has been excellent in that
all works to-date have been completed ahead of schedule and substantially
under budget. In addition, KLDC prepared site development plans for 11 other
sites and began construction on two of these. KLDC's overall quantitative and
expenditure performance for land acquisition and land development projects
begun during the year is summarized below:
Actual as %

3.37      It is apparent from the table that expenditures for both land acqui-
sition and land development are substantially less than planned in spite of
significant overachievement of target in terms of land areas. In addition
to its ongoing program of acquisition of lands for immediate resale and for
development, a two-year program was initiated in end-1980 by government for
KLDC to acquire idle lands held by business firms in excess of their
operating needs. This is seen as a measure to reduce speculation, to make
lands available for immediate use as well as to improve the liquidity
position of firms with significant assets held in land. Because KLDC is
given the power to acquire these lands at prices below market values and can
pay for them in the form of land debentures with low interest rates, it is
not surprising that the business firms have tried to avoid sales of prime
lands to KLDC and as a result have sold off forestry and less desirable
tracts initially that were lower in value, which accounts for the lower than
planned expenditures on this item. The program to acquire the remainder of
these lands will, however, be completed in 1982. It should be noted that
KLDC does not acquire these lands for land banking purposes but rather
resells the parcels as soon as possible. About 1.35 million py of idle land
acquired in 1981 were sold in that same year.
3.38      Expenditures for land development were less than planned mainly
because contractors are bidding at about 60-70% of government estimates.
This is due largely to the keen competition for jobs as a result of the



- 31 -
general recessionary climate and to the fact that large-scale contractors
(with foreign operations) use local contracts as training and mobilization
bases to support their overall operations.
3.39      More than 2 million py of land were supplied during the year
including about 0.84 million py of residential land,/1 0.02 million py of
developed industrial land and the 1.35 million py of idle land mentioned
above. This represents about 20% more than that planned at the onset.
KLDC's performance in its first year of significant works has been
exceptional.
Financial Structure and Policies
3.40      To date, KLDC's sources of finance have consisted mainly of capital
contributions from the government as equity and issues of land debentures.
KLDC started its operations with a total capital of W 38.9 billion, of which
51% was paid in by the government and 49% by the Korea Development Bank.
Since then the government has provided W 105 billion as capital contribu-
tions to KLDC, of which W 70 billion was contributed in 1981, increasing
its paid-in capital to W 143.9 billion as of end 1981. KLDC issues two types
of land debentures:  to landowners for already developed lands which KLDC
would subdivide before resale and to businesses for idle lands which KLDC
also plans to resell without further development. Debentures on lands
already developed currently carry an interest rate of 10% per year with a
maturity of two years. This interest rate is now greater than commercial
banks' interest rates on deposits (8%). In addition, debentures are
attractive to land owners who sell their lands to KLDC because of exemption
from capital gains tax on the land transfer and exemption from income tax on
interest income. Currently, the capital gains tax rate varies between 13%
and 35%. Debentures issued for acquisition of idle business-owned lands
currently carry an interest rate of 5% with a maturity of five years.
Although interest rates are very low making the debentures unattractive,
business firms must accept the terms which have been set by government. A
total of W 121.3 billion in land debentures was issued in 1981, including W
45.6 billion for lands for resale and W 75.7 billion for idle lands. Lands
acquired for development are paid in 3-4 installments over a period of
usually less than one year.
3.41      The financial statements of KLDC for the years 1980-81 are sum-
marized in Annex 3, Tables 5-7. KLDC's current financial position appears
to be sound with adequate net working capital. Total assets as of end 1981
are W 361.0 billion, composed mainly of land for sale at W 136.6 billion
(38%) and construction in progress of W 146.6 billion (41%).
3.42      KLDC's mandate requires it to earn a profit on sales of developed
middle-income residential land as well as commercial land and lands purchased
/1 Including both developed lands and lands for immediate resale.



- 32 -
for resale including idle lands from businesses, which are sold at competi-
tive bids. For serviced low-income residential and industrial land, KLDC
earns no profit but sells the lands at a price to recover all costs, both
direct and indirect. In 1981, profit before tax amounted to about 15.8% of
total sales, including low-income residential and industrial sites. On lands
developed under the first Bank-supported project, KLDC sells serviced low-
income residential sites at a price less than cost by the process of cross-
subsidization whereby the profits generated from the sale of middle-income
areas on the same sites are used to lower the sales price of the low-income
areas. Since the middle-income areas may not be marketed before the low-
income areas are turned over to KNHC or other agencies for development of
housing, KLDC can only estimate the amount of cross-subsidy in this sale
price, for which the pricing formula is roughly equal to 75% of average;
development cost of the site. It is not possible at this time to determine
whether the pricing formula for low-income areas reflects the lowest price
reasonably achievable, but performance under the first project will be
closely monitored to determine the best pricing formula for sites to be
developed under this project.
Future Program and Financial Projections
3.43      KLDC's investment program for the 5-year period 1982-86 calls for
the acquisition of 25.5 million py of land including 15.0 million py of land
for development and 10.5 million py of land for immediate resale. About
15.5 million py of land is projected to be developed during this period,
with the main emphasis on development of low-income residential land. Based
on KLDC's exceptional performance under the first project and with an
additional staff complement, this program is considered to be within its
implementation capacity. The total capital requirements for this program
would be about W 2,734 billion (US$3.7 billion) in constant (September 1982)
prices.
3.44      The proposed project, for the development of residential sites in
6 cities in Phase I and several cities yet to be identified in Phase-II (see
para. 2.07) on about 1.43 million py of land, is estimated to cost about
W 75 billion (US$101.35 million), representing approximately 3% of the
budget projected for KLDC's total operation over 1982-86.
3.45      The financial forecasts for KLDC for the period 1982-86, including
income statements, balance sheets and sources and applications of funds
statements are presented in Annex 3, Tables 5-7. The forecasts indicate
that KLDC is expected to generate surpluses on its operations, all of which
will be retained for its ongoing program. Equity contributions from govern-
ment amounting to about W 340 billion (US$459 million) in constant prices
will be requested, which represents about 12% of the capital requirement for
the five-year development program. Discussions between KLDC staff and
senior government officials indicate commitments by government of this order
are being programmed for implementation of the Fifth Plan. The W 40 billion
budgeted by the government for 1982 has already been received. The past and
present support by government in the form of equity contributions to KLDC is



- 33 -
unusual in the current Korean economic context where government is actively
reducing budgetary allocations to ministries and agencies. This is an
indication of the high priority which government attaches to addressing
housing inequities. Government assurances to provide an adequate level of
equity contributions were obtained during negotiations. The remaining
sources of financing for the Fifth Plan include land sales, foreign and
domestic loans and land debentures.
F. Korea National Housing Corporation
3.46      The Korea National Housing Corporation (KNHC), established in
1962, is a government-owned corporation whose purpose is to supply, finance,
improve and manage housing to help reduce the housing shortage in Korea. It
is the agency charged with implementing the country's public housing programs.
KNHC operates under the direction of MOC which supervises its operations in
consultation with the Ministry of Finance.
3.47      KNHC's headquarters staff have been recently reorganized into five
operational directorates covering 14 departments (see Chart 24025). The five
directors (of planning, administration, business, architecture and construc-
tion) report through the executive vice president to the president.
Supervision of housing construction, a key element in this project, is done
by site offices that report directly to the department of construction. The
director of construction oversees the work of the department of civil
engineering as well as the department of construction.
3.48      In 1981 KNHC constructed about 45,000 units in 31 cities nation-
wide, which represents a 50% increase over its 1980 output of about
30,100 units. Almost all units built are apartments which range in size
between 7 and 25 py with the majority 13-15 py. Due to recent changes in
interest rates for mortgages and down payments required, these units are now
much more affordable to the low and middle-income groups./l
3.49      KNHC previously constructed rental housing as well as units for
sale, but in 1981 the rental housing program was discontinued by government
directive as an economic stabilization measure geared toward encouraging
greater home ownership. This program has been reinstituted on a small scale
in 1982 during which time KNHC would construct about 2,200 units, as compared
to more than 15,000 rental units constructed in 1980. The future program
will be dependent on progress with occupancy under the 1982 program. The
rental status of these units is temporary, since KNHC is expected to convert
the units to sale after about five years of occupancy, somewhat longer than
the 1-3 years previously. KNHC also manages the housing estates it builds,
/1 As an example, a 15 py apartment which was affordable at the 33rd per-
centile of the urban household income distribution at an interest
rate of 13% at the end of last year is currently affordable at the
19th percentile at an interest rate of 10%.



- 34 -
and this currently includes about 94,000 units consisting of 26,600 rental
units and 67,300 sale units. KNHC manages housing units after sales for
about 1 year, on average, before turning the units over for management by
the residents.
Financial Structure and Policies
3.50      Sources of financing for KNHC currently include borrowings from the
National Housing Fund (NHF), foreign borrowings, key money and down payments
from purchasers. Government equity contributions which were previously used
to partially finance the rental housing program were discountinued in 1981;
the future rental housing construction program will be financed by long-term
loans from the NHF at low interest rates. As of December 1981, total paid-in
capital was W 135.2 billion of which the government had provided about 94% and
Korea Development Bank about 6%. From 1978, KNHC has paid dividends to the
government and KDB at 1% of contribution amount. Retained earnings amounted
to about W 133.0 billion at the end of 1981. Long-term borrowings are
primarily from the NHF whose loans are currently at 10% for sale housing and
at 5% for rental housing, over 20 years. Six foreign loans have been made to
KNHC by USAID at terms ranging between 8 and 9.5% over 25 years, two loans by
ADB at 7.6% and 10.1% for 20 years and one World Bank loan at 9.6% for 15
years.  KNHC's average cost of borrowed funds for 1981 was about 14.6% and is
expected to be about 10% in 1982.
3.51      At end 1981 KNHC had total assets of W 815 billion including
W 204.6 billion (25%) of rental units/i and W 429.4 billion (53%) of
mortgages held by KNHC. Currently, about 122,220 mortgage accounts and
22,600 rental accounts are managed by KNHC. Collection practices are
relatively good; arrears amounted to about 3.3% for rental fees and 1.0% for
management fees due in 1981 although arrears on mortgages and down payments/2
have deteriorated to 10.3% from 2.8% in 1980. This situation is mainly
attributed to delays by home purchasers in paying second down payment
installments, which must be collected before settlement. This performance
is expected to improve as the economy recovers. KNHC charges a premium on
these late payments equal to the current commercial bank rate on short-term
loans.
3.52     KNHC's operating revenues are generated mainly from the sale of
constructed units, rental of housing units (both national housing projects and
foreigner apartment complexes), management of the housing estates and interest
payments by mortgage holders. KNHC's rental operation has, in the aggregate,
been and is expected to be profitable both while the units are being rented
and when the units are converted to sale. In addition to the rental charge,
a monthly management fee is charged the rentors to cover KNHC's costs of
managing the estates.
/1 Valued at cost less depreciation.
/2 Down payments (payable in installments before purchase) have not been
separated for collection purposes from normal monthly mortgage payments.



- 35 -
3.53     For houses constructed for immediate sale, the sales prices charged
by KNHC for the housing units are adequate to recover all expenditures both
direct and indirect. KNHC, as the public housing authority, has a policy to
sell the units it constructs at a price to recover all costs with no profit.
The sales earn profit for KNHC to the extent that sales prices, estimated
before construction is completed, exceed actual construction and overhead
costs on the pre-sold units, which has consistently been the case. Housing
units are sold on a free-hold basis currently requiring a 40-50% down
payment, with a mortgage to be provided from funds rolled over from the NHF,
at the same terms, i.e., 10% interest rate over 20 years.
3.54      For its housing management operation, KNHC prepares estimates of
its expenses one year in advance, including a provision for price escalation,
and determines the appropriate management fee to be charged. In the past,
the fees collected were sufficient such that no problems were encountered in
providing the necessary services (para. 5.04) associated with estate
management.
Future Program
3.55      To meet the government's goal of housing construction over the
next five years as enumerated in the Fifth Plan, KNHC plans to construct about
310,000 units, including about 230,000 units (mostly apartments) under its
ongoing national housing program, about 56,000 units /1 (core and row houses
and apartments) under its foreign loan program and about 24,000 rental units.
Based on government's review of its rental policies, the construction program
for rental units may change somewhat during the plan period. The 1983 program
of 60,000 units represents a 50% increase over the 1982 program of 40,000
units, but KNHC has demonstrated that it can carry out an increase in the
necessary administration requirements of this order of magnitude during this
past year. For each subsequent year of the Fifth Plan, the number of units
to be constructed represents an annual increase of about 7-8%, which is
considered to be within KNHC's ability to implement.
3.56      The total capital requirements for the construction program would
be about W 2,404 billion (US$3.2 billion) in constant prices. Down payments
from house purchases and rental deposits (key money) would provide about 40%
of the capital requirements. The main source of borrowings would be from
the NHF, which would provide about 60% of the total sources of funds. The
proportion of funds provided by the various sources is in accordance with
current practice. The financial forecasts appear in Annex 3, Tables 8-10.
3.57      The housing component of the proposed project, which includes about
10,080 units to be built by KNHC, is estimated to cost about W 119.7 billion
(US$161.8 million). This represents a small portion, about 3%, of KNHC's
total program over 1982-86.
/1 About 41,000 units of this total have been identified under ADB and IBRD
loans already approved or appraised.



- 36 -
3.58      Since 1979, KNHC has been experiencing some difficulty in selling
its units compared to earlier years when most of the units were pre-sold.
At end March 1982, KNHC had an unsold stock of about 4,570 units which
represents about 11% of the units constructed in 1980 and 1981. Although this
continues to present a real concern for KNHC, this performance has improved
over 1979 when about 57% of the units constructed in that year were unsold by
the end of the year. KNHC undertook market demand studies as part of this
project; this should reduce the possibility of unsold units in the future.
IV. IMPLEMENTATION ARRANGEMENTS
A. Project Coordination
4.01      The Ministry of Construction (MOC) Housing Bureau will be respon-
sible for project coordination through a senior level Liaison Committee
chaired by the Director-General and consisting of representatives of the
Land Bureau, KLDC and KNHC. This Liaison Committee should meet periodically
and report to the Bank on progress and project development. The Director-
General of the Housing Bureau will have ultimate responsibility for
coordination and project implementation.
4.02      The remaining sites will be selected by KLDC based on KNHC's
requirements and on the site selection criteria agreed with the Bank (paras.
4.06-4.09). These criteria were developed by MOC, KNHC and KLDC incorporating
the separate selection criteria used by each agency. The Phase I sites except
that for cooperative housing were agreed between KLDC and KNHC from a list
selected by KLDC. Already selected project sites are distributed between four
major and two secondary cities.
4.03      KLDC will be responsible for acquiring and developing the land,
marketing the commercial and residential areas, arranging for school sites
to be turned over to relevant educational institutions and ensuring that
an adequate supply of reasonably priced, serviced land is available for
low-income housing needs. For projects undertaken through CPL, KLDC will
have the sole responsibility for land development; however, the one LR
project (Suweon) will be jointly undertaken by KLDC and the city government.
The city mayor will be the legal implementing authority for the project.
Through an agreement with the municipality, KLDC will undertake site
planning, engineering and construction works on behalf of the city. All
dealings with original land owners will be undertaken by the city
government, including agreement on the basic development plan for the area.
4.04      KNHC will have responsibility for the construction and sale of
housing for low-income families on all but one Phase I site and most Phase
II sites. Lands required by KNHC for the construction of low-income housing
will generally be purchased from KLDC at cross-subsidized prices and will
subsequently be sold together with the core houses, row houses and apart-
ments that are purchased by families who meet the project's eligibility



- 37 -
requirements.  KLDC and KNHC will consult on the plans for these sites, and
KNHC will review the drawings and specifications provided by KLDC for these
sites. Assurances on these arrangements were obtained at negotiations.
KLDC and the local governments of Daijeon and any other city or cities
selected will be responsible for supervising the housing cooperative compo-
nent of the project. KLDC will advertise the terms and conditions for
participation by cooperatives and review cooperatives applications, while
the local authorities will borrow from the NHF on behalf of these organiza-
tions and disburse the funds for construction. This process is discussed in
detail in paras. 4.20-4.22.
B. Site Selection
4.05      Phase I sites were agreed jointly by MOC, KLDC and KNHC, to
satisfy their respective site selection criteria. Eighteen sites in 12
cities were examined jointly by KLDC and KNHC. Site selection criteria
(Annex 11, Item 17) common to all three agencies will be used for the
remaining sites. The criteria incorporates the major considerations of each
agency and includes a scoring and weighting system to allow ranking of
sites. Specific items considered are: city growth rate, housing deficit
and strategic importance (for city selection); marketability, location,
transport access, land use status and zoning, conditions for land develop-
ment, utilities, obstacles, surrounding environment and development regula-
tions applicable to the site (for site selection). The scoring system
includes a failing grade which would eliminate sites which are unacceptable
on any criterion.
4.06      The procedures for the selection of Phase II sites will be as
follows: Within six months of and also eighteen months after the commence-
ment of Phase I, KNHC will advise KLDC of the cities in which it plans to
build houses during the following year, specifying the number of units, size
of low-income residential land needed, the maximum cost per pyong of
developed land which would meet the affordability targets of the project,
and the locational constraints, such as accessibility to employment and
public and community facilities and amenities, which the sites must meet.
This would in effect be the application of the mutally agreed site selection
criteria to specific cities.
4.07      Within two months following receipt of INHC's requirements, KLDC
will advise KNHC of the sites which it has identified that fulfill these
criteria and which are available for acquisition and for which obtaining
development approval is plausible. It is anticipated that in some secondary
cities sites suitable to KNEIC may not be large enough to permit development
of part of the land to be sold for uses other than low-income housing,
thereby permitting cross-subsidization. In such cases, the acquisition cost
of the land and the projected cost of development must be low enough to meet
the affordability targets.



- 38 -
4.08      Within a month of receiving KLDC's list of proposed sites, KNHC
will commit itself to acquire the developed low-income land on the suitable
sites. Any units in the KNHC's Phase II program for the upcoming year which
cannot be accommodated on the agreed KLDC sites would be built on other
sites selected by KNHC and agreed with the Bank. If KLDC's output of the
low-income residential land development program for the upcoming year of
Phase II will not be fully utilized by KNHC, KLDC would develop additional
sites which would be selected using the criteria agreed with the Bank on
which the low-income residential land would be sold to local governments or
housing cooperatives for housing construction.
4.09      Sites covering at least 60% of the Phase II areas are expected to
be developed by KLDC for sale to KNHC. The Bank will review Phase II land
development and housing proposals of the agency before implementation. These
arrangements were agreed at negotiations.
C. Site Planning and Infrastructure
4.10      Feasibility studies were carried out by local consultants on the
four sites selected to be Phase I. Each site plan was developed based on
two to three alternative approaches at cost reductions, mostly in
earthworks. Efficiency of plan layout and lowered costs have been stressed
during feasibility studies and subsequent reviews by Bank and KLDC staff.
The design features of each site are summarized in Annex 5 and overall
planning criteria and design standards are briefly described in the
following paragraphs.
4.11      The housing estates are planned for mixed residential development
of low and middle-income families with sites varying from 25,000 py to
220,000 py in Phase I. CPL sites has been emphasized as a means to expedite
acquisition and implementation, although a LR site (Suweon) will be included
in the project.
4.12      Site plans have been developed based on the local municipal master
plans and with street orientations that respect the north-south axis of hous-
ing alignment. During the feasibility studies alternative site plans were
evaluated to determine least cost cut and fill options while attempting to
optimize hilly locations for good views. Generally, the site plans have
improved since the earlier Bank project, reflecting more alternative
approaches, respect for the impact of infrastructure costs as a function of
topography, and a greater level of experience and concern on the part of KLDC
staff.
4.13      Future expansion of the sites including requirements for roads,
water supply and drainage systems have been provided for. Costs for provision
for future expansion will be allocated to the municipalities.
4.14      Land use plans reflect a mix in proportions similar to the first
project, although there are some efficiencies learned through that project



- 39 -
that are illustrated in this project. Areas for roads, for example, decrease
from a range of 23-26% in previous CPL sites to 18-24% on current CPL sites.
All sites will conform to MOC criteria with a minimum 2% of the land area
reserved for parks and playgrounds; public areas between community facilities,
parks and recreation areas would range from 2% to 12%. This possible
variation depends on the existence of these facilities in immediate proximity
to the respective sites. Saleable residential land averages about 67% of
gross site area in the CPL projects. In the LR site, the residential portion
of the gross site area is 17%. Roads and circulation, water supply, sewerage,
drainage and electricity distribution, and planning and design standards are
similar to those of the first project.
D. Land Development
4.15      As in the first project, two methods of land development will be
used under this project: CPL and LR. CPL is the conventional method
involving outright purchase of land for development by public authority.
Land readjustment on the other hand, is a mechanism for land development
practiced mainly in Korea, Taiwan, Japan and Australia, whereby the public
authority develops the land in partnership with the landowners./I KLDC has
been developing fewer sites under LR due to the length of processing time
and extra burden imposed by the process.
4.16 -    The CPL sites would be fully serviced with paved roads, drainage and
water supply. Traditionally, the level of services provided under LR projects
has been significantly lower than that of CPL. The site developed through the
LR method in this project will be provided with the main water supply and
drainage networks but roads will not be paved, except for principal arterial
streets through the site which will initially be paved for 7 m width, though
designed for future widths of 10 m or more. Only the low-income residential
areas in the LR scheme will be fully serviced to levels comparable to CPL.
The cost of this additional infrastructure, termed as second stage develop-
ment, will be recovered through the land sales and will not be borne by the
site as a whole. In most LR projects the water supply mains, and in a few
cases the secondary network, are funded by the city governments and recovered
through user charges. Electric power and telephone service will be provided
by the respective national agencies concerned and will also be recovered
directly through user charges. All project sites will provide space for
commercial areas and community facilities such as schools, homes for the
/1 Under LR, a site with many owners is first declared a readjustment area.
The executive agency then prepares a subdivision plan, obtains the
approval of the participants, installs basic infrastructure and sells a
portion of the site at market prices to recoup all development and
management costs. The remainder of the site is returned as serviced
plots to the owners in proportion to the value of their original
holdings.



- 40 -
elderly, community centers, kindergartens and parks, to be constructed and
operated by private institutions and local government agencies.
E. Housing Mix Determination
4.17      KLDC will sell about 40% of the net residential land on all but the
two sites for housing cooperatives to KNHC, which will construct and market a
mix of three types of low-income dwellings: single storey core houses
(designed for future expansion by the occupants), 2-storey row houses and
5-storey walk-up apartments.
4.18      It has been agreed with the government that the housing provided
under the project will be targeted and distributed to the income group between
the 15th and 50th percentile, and that the mix of housing types will be
determined by market surveys. KNHC conducted demand studies between May
and October 1982 in the first six project cities as the basis for determining
housing mix on these sites (Annex 11, Item 11). The results of the demand
studies were made available to the Korea Research Institute for Human
Settlements (KRIHS) and to the Bank, along with KNHC's housing mix proposals,
for review before preparing layouts and plans for the sites. These results
were used to verify the viability of KNHC's proposals agreed at negotiations.
Public Facilities
4.19      The project sites would require a number of facilities and services
which are not included in the KLDC or KNHC components such as schools,
markets, police stations, post offices and off-site electricity and telephone
services. These facilities will be provided and financed by respective
local/central government agencies or companies such as Korea Electric Power
Company. These services have been provided in a timely manner in other
projects.
F. The Housing Cooperatives' Sites
4.20      KLDC and the local governments of Daijeon and of any other cities
selected will be responsible for coordinating the implementation of the
housing cooperatives component and will use, for the most part, procedures
already established by MOC. KLDC will advertise the criteria, conditions and
restrictions for participation in the project. Criteria include minimum size,
and source of membership of cooperatives, the eligible income range and that
candidates do not already own a house; conditions include the size and terms
of available loans and the repayments required; and, among the restrictions,
the house obtained under the project may not be resold within two years
without the clearance of the local governments. To encourage participation of
the lowest income groups, these advertisements will also indicate the
potential number of units, the cost of land, possible minimum plot size and
the level of affordability achievable. Housing cooperatives must consist of
at least 20 household heads who live in the particular city or work for the



- 41 -
same company in the city and must register with the city governments. Each
cooperative will decide on the size and type of units to be built, the amount
of funds they will need to borrow for housing construction, a plan for
purchasing the land from KLDC and the arrangement for constructing their
units. These points would be covered in the proposals which the cooperatives
would need to submit to the local authorities. Eligible cooperatives would be
encouraged to open an NHF savings account, as the size of savings will
influence the ranking of the groups.
4.21       In selecting cooperatives KLDC will attempt to achieve, as closely
as possible, the income distribution objectives of the project. Priority will
be given first to cooperatives formed from members of the same firm which have
NHF savings accounts; next, to community cooperatives which have NHF accounts.
When cooperatives have otherwise equal priority, additional weight will be
given to the size of the NHF savings deposits, however, comparisons will only
be made between cooperatives at the same levels.
4.22       The local governments will inform the selected cooperatives,
MOC-HB/Policy Division and NHF of the successful applicants. The successful
cooperatives whose notification include a commitment of financial support must
fulfill a number of conditions to stay in the program during implementation.
The land must be acquired promptly from KLDC from their own resources and
architectural approval for their proposed construction must be applied for
within three months. In addition, construction must be completed within an
agreed period and any changes in the membership must be approved. The local
authorities will borrow from the NHF on behalf of the housing cooperatives and
will enter into loan agreements with the cooperatives for passing on the
funds. As security the cities will hold the first mortgage on the land.
Proceeds of the loan would be withdrawn to make progress payments for con-
struction and on completion the loan would be converted to individual mort-
gages held by the local authorities. Payments would be made by the members of
the cooperatives to the city governments who would in turn repay the NHF. All
procedures for the participation of cooperatives in the project were confirmed
at negotiations.
G. Implementation Schedule
4.23       The project would be implemented over a three-year period (late
1982 to end-1985). A project implementation schedule is shown in Chart 24018.
Land acquisition for Phase I sites is scheduled to be completed by the time of
loan effectiveness, estimated to occur in first quarter 1983. Land
development should begin shortly after land acquisition, as detailed
engineering for Phase I sites is complete and the preparation of contract
documents has begun. Housing construction should begin in early 1984.
H. Procurement
4.24       No foreign contractors have expressed interest in prequalifying for
any of the three previous urban sector projects financed by the Bank, and none
are anticipated to do so for this project. However, foreign contractors will



- 42 -
be invited to prequalify for this project for civil works valued at over
US$2 million, and should any prequalify all contracts for such works will be
awarded on the basis of international competitive bidding (ICB) to prequali-
fied contractors in accordance with Bank guidelines. If, as anticipated, no
foreign contractors express interest or prequalify, all contract documents
will be issued in Korean and bidding times reduced in keeping with local
competitive bidding practice. Other Bank guidelines for competitive bidding
will be maintained, however. The Bank will review on a sampling basis
contract documents for works of a value in excess of $2 million and for
materials over $100,000. The formats of procurement documents in use in the
first project have already been approved by the Bank and these formats will be
also be used in this project. KLDC is expected to bid out each site as a
single contract including both land preparation and infrastructure (roads,
sewers, water supply, etc.) with the possible exception of major off-site
infrastructure which could possibly be bid out separately. Essentially,
therefore, KLDC will bid about 15-16 contract packages which may range in
value from US$1-10 million each. KNHC will also draw on their experiences of
procurement for the first project and bid out housing construction at each
project site in phases to limit the size of each housing package to about
300-500 units, i.e. 30-50 housing contracts. The first housing contract at
each site will also include secondary infrastructure. Specialized work on
landscaping at each site will be bid out separately. The typical value of
KNHC contracts is likely to be in the range of US$4-6 million. KNHC is likely
to use OSROK (Office of Supply ROK) as the formal procurement agency for their
contracting. All material supply for both KLDC and KNHC contracts are likely
to be the responsibility of the contractor, although contracts will require
purchase of certain special items like cement, steel and precast concrete
elements like pipe, from nominated suppliers like OSROK, in accordance with
procedures satisfactory to the Bank.
4.25      The housing cooperatives, under the supervision of the local govern-
ments, will contract with Government Registered Builders for the construction
of their housing units using local procedures acceptable to the Bank. The
number of units per contract is estimated to vary between 20-100 for values
ranging between US$200,000 and US$1.2 million.
I. Disbursements
4.26      Disbursements under the proposed loan would be at the rate of 60%
for land development civil works, 75% of NHF disbursements to KNHC, and 100%
for staff training, consultancy services and studies. A separate set of
disbursement categories has been set up for KLDC and NHF in order to facili-
tate use of funds by these agencies. NHF will submit to the Bank statements
of expenditures setting out disbursements to KNHC indicating the equivalent
work progress these represent. The establishment of a project account by
NHF is a condition of disbursement. Supervision missions will carry out
ex-post reviews of work progress. The disbursement procedures were agreed
at negotiations. Disbursement for KLDC would be made against evidence of



- 43 -
payments to contractors. It is expected that disbursements will be
completed by December 1986.
4.27      The estimated quarterly disbursement schedule is shown in Annex 6
along with the country profile. A shorter disbursement period has been
estimated than the country profile, due to the stage of project preparation
and performance under the first housing loan. As stated previously, the
majority of land acquisition and detailed engineering work will be completed
by loan effectiveness, major items which have been attributed to delays in
project start-up experienced in the urban sector in the past. The first urban
project in Korea was effectively disbursed in four years, but due to surpluses
in the loan amount and the addition of other components, full disbursement
took somewhat longer. Further, the agencies involved in the first housing
loan would be better experienced with Bank disbursement documentation and
procedures, and this is expected to expedite the disbursement process.
J. Accounts and Audits
4.28      The same system of accounts and audits as in the first project will
be used in this project. Separate project accounts would be maintained by
KLDC, KNHC and NHF with respect to their project components. In the case of
the NHF where Statements of Expenditure will be used, its system of account-
ing and disbursements, which is considered adequate for purposes envisaged
under this project, will be used. Assurances were obtained at negotiations
that these agencies will: (a) maintain separate accounting records for all
project revenues and expenditures; (b) ensure adequate and timely working
capital is provided to finance the project; and (c) have the project
accounts including NHF's Statements of Expenditures audited by an indepen-
dent auditor acceptable to the Bank and these audit reports submitted to the
Bank no later than six months after the end of each fiscal year. In this
connection, it was agreed during negotiations that performance of the audit
would be carried out by the Board of Audit and Inspection, Republic of
Korea.
K. Supervision
4.29      Overall supervision requirements in this project should be reduced
since review of progress of the first housing loan would be combined with this
project. KLDC and KNHC already prepare relatively complete documentation of
implementation progress and with further refinement, this should reduce Bank
staff inputs. However, requirements for carrying out the sector dialogue,
which is an important part of the development of the housing sector program in
Korea, is expected to consume a major portion of staff time in the early
years. As a result, supervision input is estimated to require approximately
10 staff weeks annually. About one-half of the time indicated would be in
the field.



- 44 -
L. Monitoring and Evaluation
4.30      A monitoring and evaluation program recently begun under the first
project will be continued under this project. Baseline information on the
sites and the affected population would be collected. Project performance
would be monitored regarding the timing and cost of development, and the
impact of the project on the affected population would be evaluated based on
surveys to ascertain the changes which resulted from the project compared to
changes which occurred for a control group who were not a part of the project.
KNHC will be responsible for data collection and analysis for housing; KLDC
will be responsible (probably with consultant assistance) for data and
analysis for land development. The data from these two sources will be made
available to KRIHS to be fed into a sector information and monitoring system,
which they are preparing for government use. The Bank will receive copies of
all relevant studies produced by these three agencies. These arrangements
were confirmed at negotiations.
V. COST RECOVERY AND AFFORDABILITY
A. Cost Recovery Policies and Terms of Purchase
5.01      The acquisition, subdivision, servicing and sales of land will be
carried out by KLDC in coordination with local government agencies. About
40% of the total net residential land provided through the project will be
earmarked for the low-income families and handed over to KNHC and housing
cooperatives for the construction of housing units. The primary target group
for the project will be families in the 15th-50th percentile of the urban
household income distribution. Families below this group will benefit from
rental space which will become available through the project.
5.02      The actual cost of land acquisition/compensation, site preparation,
infrastructure, housing construction, management costs, interest during
construction and design and supervision will be recovered from the benefi-
ciaries through land sales, down payments and mortgage payments to the NHF.
Sale of commercial and upper income residential land at market prices on
mixed-uses sites will generate profits which will be utilized to lower
(cross-subsidize) the sale price of the low-income land. Housing would be
provided only for the target group and would be sold at cost with long-term
mortgages. Land for public facilities will be sold at cost to the respective
agencies. Arrangements regarding the timing and terms of sale of land by KLDC
to KNHC and housing cooperatives for housing construction will be detailed in
agreements between KLDC and the housing construction agencies. Ratification
of the agreement between KLDC and KNHC is a condition of loan effectiveness.
5.03      Mortgages will be issued upon receipt of a 40% down payment from the
target-income house purchasers with the balance to be paid over 20 years at
the prevailing NHF interest rate for low-income house purchasers, which
currently is 10% with a slightly graduated payment method./l The arrangements
for mortgage financing to project beneficiaries were confirmed at negotiations.
/1 The first payment would cover the interest only and would increase each
year by a fixed amount during the life of the mortgage, as in the
first project.



- 45 -
The down payments would be in line with NHF s current national requirements,
which have been revised to 40% on the smaller units which it finances, down
from the 60-80% of recent years required under the public sector housing
program. The down payments are not considered excessively high in the Korean
context, where families typically accumulate their down payments through
savings, key money deposits, occasionally from the sale of property and
contributions from relatives which are generally not repaid. In the past most
home buyers in Korea typically paid cash for the full purchase price. Even
rentors are required to pay large sums of "key money" to acquire a modest
rental space.
5.04      In accordance with prevailing practice, infrastructure, including
roads, drains and water supply will be turned over to the respective cities
for operation and maintenance, the costs of which will be recovered through
taxes, utility and user charges. KNHC will manage the estates in the first
year and will provide or arrange to provide, among other things, for garbage
collection, security, clearance of septic tanks, cleaning of streets and
drains, street lighting and maintenance of playgrounds and other common areas.
A management fee will be levied on the basis of house size to recover the
above costs. It has been the practice for KNdC to turn the estates over to
the occupants after about one year for self-help management and it is expected
that this practice will be followed in this project. The residents will hire
full-time staff to manage the estates who will levy the appropriate fee.
Management of the estates will not require any input by the respective cities.
5.05      The chargeable costs of land and infrastructure development for
four of the Phase I sites as well as estimated sales prices of low-income land
are summarized below:

- 46 -
5.06      As mentioned previously (para. 3.42), on sites developed for
multiple uses KLDC would sell serviced low-income residential sites at a price
less than cost by the process of cross-subsidization. Since the middle-income
residential and commercial areas may not be marketed before the low-income
areas are turned over to the housing construction agencies, KLDC can only
estimate the amount of cross-subsidy in this sale price. Performance under
the first project will be closely monitored to determine the best pricing
formula for the sites developed under this project, allowing a premium for
risk to KLDC for uncertainty associated with future sales of the upper-income
areas.
5.07      The commercial and open market residential plots would be sold
through competitive bidding or direct contract. The middle-income households
are expected to arrange their own financing for house construction. The
marketable areas and sales prices of the residential and commercial parcels
are based on market surveys conducted in early 1982 by land assessors.
5.08      Off-site infrastructure costs would be shared equally by central
and local governments, which is in line with the financing arrangements for
areas promoted for housing estates as designated by MOC. The costs of
off-site infrastructure would be recovered by the cities indirectly through
taxes and other user charges. Details of off-site infrastructure are
available in project files.
B. Affordability
5.09      The affordability calculations are based on the assumption that
families in the target group can afford to spend about 30% of their monthly
income on housing, excluding utilities and taxes./L Management fees, pro-
perty taxes, electricity, heating and water charges and cooking briquettes
are estimated to represent an additional 5-8% of total monthly income./2 A
common practice in Korea is for more than one household to share a house in
order to afford the high housing costs. Extensive housing surveys have
confirmed this practice./3 The units being provided under the project are
being designed to provide a room suitable for renting, which could provide
additional income to the owners. Any additional income generated from
the renting of a room by the target beneficiaries is assumed to be already
accounted for in this 30% monthly allotment for housing.

5.10      The income distribution figures used for the analysis were based on
official data published in 1981 by EPB and projected to first quarter 1982
(Annex 7). Projected incomes for 1982 were then matched with the estimated
construction costs to determine the affordability levels of the various house
types, which is reflected in the following table:

additional secondary infrastructure in secondary cities will not exceed
W 100,000/py.
/b April 1982 cost estimates provided by KNHC based on current contracts,
including all overheads and allied expenses.
/c Assuming a 40% down payment and a graduated mortgage over 20 years with
payments increasing by a fixed amount over the life of the mortgage. The
interest rate is 10% for all units.
Market demand surveys were undertaken to determine the percentage of house
types constructed within each of the four groups above. Based on these
assumptions, all units constructed would be affordable by households below
the 30th percentile. For the case of Suweon, a satellite city to Seoul, where
cross-subsidized land plus secondary infrastructure costs are expected to be
about 30% greater than other secondary cities, the same affordability levels
will be achieved, since income levels are about 34% greater there than the
national average. Annex 8 summarizes unit costs for land and housing
development at Anyang which is a representative site in Phase I.
VI. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION AND RISKS
A. Economic Justification
6.01      As in the first National Land Development and Housing Project, the
principal justification for this project is in terms of its ability to
ameliorate the housing shortage in the project cities, provide employment
opportunities in the construction sector and strengthen institutions in the
housing sector. With the inclusion of development by housing cooperatives
in the project framework, it is hoped that impetus will be generated for



- 48 -
private as well as public sector institutional development.  As indicated
above, the housing shortage in project cities is acute.  The ratio of
dwelling units to households ranges from a low of 56% in Anyang to 75% in
Gimhae with a median among all project cities of approximately 65%. Thus
the proposed project will provide developed land necessary to ameliorate
significant housing shortages in project cities.
6.02       The imputed rental values of the dwellings to be constructed at
the various sites and estimated market values of the serviced commercial
and open market land were used to measure the benefits of the project.
Estimates of rental values were based on current rents charged by KNHC and
the private sector for similar housing units in the project cities. Esti-
mates of land values were based on market surveys conducted in 1981 by land
assessors of adjacent parcels of similar land to the sites to be developed.
Land and development, infrastructure, housing and recurrent (maintenance)
costs were considered in the analysis with all taxes excluded.  Shadow prices,
applicable only to unskilled labor which constitutes a minor fraction of total
construction costs, were judged not to have a major impact on the rates of
return and hence were not considered.  Rates of return were found to be insen-
sitive to standard conversion factors.  The economic rates of return for the
6 sites ranged from 7.4% to 14.6% and are summarized in the following table.
The weighted average rate of return for Phase I, which is about 55% of
the total project (excluding technical assistance) was found to be 12.5%.
The relatively low estimated rate of return for Gimhae, the smallest city
in the project, is due to lower projected rentals and land sales prices,
mostly a reflection of the lower average incomes of residents there.  The
experience gained in developing this site (which accounts for only 7% of
Phase I project costs) will be useful in the longer-teni sector and policy
dialogue on housing (see paras. 1.22 and 2.01) and in the planning of future
programs that address the problems of the smaller urban centers.

6.0 3      Rates of return estimated for Plhase I of this project are generally
lower than those estimated for the first project, which had an overall
estimated rate of return of 16.5%.  This is largely attributable  to a
continuing rise in land development and housing construction costs and virtual
stagnation in sales prices of land and housing.  Should relative prices of
land and housing resume their upward trend of the late 1970s, as appears to be
the case as of late 1982, project rates of return could easily approach those
projected for the first project.
B. Project Impact on Urban Poverty Population
6.04       As of 1980, an estimnated 18% of households in Korean cities had
incomes less than the urban poverty threshold.  The project is expected to
benefit households between the 15th and 50th percentiles of the income
distribution, providing both direct and indirect benefits to households below
the poverty threshold.  Indirect benefits will result in part from subletting
of rooms provided by direct project beneficiaries in accordance with typical
patterns of house sharing in Korea.  For example, it is estimated that about
one-third (4,183) of the households accommodated by the 12,550 housing units
to be provided under th-e project will sublet rooms to low-income individuals
and small households, most of whom will be drawn from the poverty population.
Assuming, for example, that rooms of 3 py (10 sq m) would be rented for
W 20,000 per month (close to the weighted average rent based on project
estimates of rent per pyong), households spending 25% of income for such rooms
could be drawn from well below the 10th percentile of the income distribution.
Other indirect benefits to the poverty population are expected to result from
reduced upward pressure on rents resulting from an increased housing supply.
The project is expected to satisfy a significant proportion of the shortage
of housing and developed land in each project city, thereby creating a
moderating influence on housing prices throughout the housing market.
C.  Project Risks
6.05       Currently domestic interest rates for housing in Korea are lower
than international lending rates, including the interest rate on World Bank
loans. Over time it is expected that domestic interest rates would move
closer to international interest rates.  An upward movement of interest rates
during project implementation would affect affordability targets.  Should NHF
interest rates for low-income housing increase by 2%, for example, 12 py core
units which are currently affordable to households at the 17th percentile of
the urban household income distribution would require household incomes at the
28th percentile.  Thus, the effect of a 2% increase in NHF interest rates
would be to shift the affordable group to whom the units are currently
designed from the 15-50th percentile to the 25-50th percentile of the income
distribution.  As -there is an understanding with the government that the



- 50 -
changes in interest rates and costs relative to incomes would require recon-
sideration of the type and mix of units, this should not seriously affect
project objectives.  See Annex 10 for a summary of housing interest rate
movements since 1977.

SECOND NATIONAL URBAN LAND DEVELOPMENT AND HOUSING PROJECT
Phase I Sites: Description of Project Cities
A. Anyang
Location
1.        Anyang city is located in the central southern part of Gyeonggi-Do
province and 25 km west-southwards from the central part of Seoul. It is
an industrial city developed along with the Gyeongbu Line, Seoul-Suwon
Industrial Road, and electric railway and is characteristic of a sattelite
city of Seoul exposed to the affects of Seoul's politics, economy, social
affairs and cultural activities.
Population and its Forecast
2.        The, population of this city was 253,541 persons as of the end of
1980 and has been growing at an annual average rate of 12.6% since 1973.
This results from the large inflows of population arising from the dispersion
policy of industrial complexes of the capital area in the 1970s. Though its
population has increased at a high rate up to 1980, the rate of increase is
expected to decline and the population up to 1991 is projected to be 350,000
persons because of land development constraints, the promotion of Gwangmyeong
city, and other developments in the metropolitan area.

Housing Status and its Demand
3.        The ratio of houses to households in Anyang city was less than 50%
up to 1977 increasing to 64.2% due to the boom of residential construction in
1978, but there was a severe shortage of houses again in 1979 and 1980
reducing the ratios to 54.9 and 53.7% respectively.
4.        It is not expected that housing supply will be able to completely
erase the housing deficit in the next decade, but if 90% of the housing
supply target in the Anyang Long-term Development Plan is met, there would be
a 28.2% deficiency rate in 1991, as shown in the following table:

Housing Status and its Demand
10.       The housing shortage ratio has gradually decreased since 1975 but
the housing supply has not been able to meet the increasing rate of household
growth. The housing shortage rate as of 1980 was 43%. The main reasons for
this shortage are increased demand for housing due to the inflow of
neighboring rural population to the city, and the increasing tendency toward
nuclear and single person families.
11.       To meet the demand for housing in 1986, the land which is needed
for the housing site development (to construct apartments) totals 270,000 py.

E. Gimhae
Location
15.       Gimhae city located at the south-east region of Kyungsangnamdo
province, adjoins Busan city to the east, and Jangyoo-Myon and Jucheon-Myong
to the west. The city is the collecting center for crops produced at the
Gimhae Plain which is one of the main granaries of Korea. Buma Express
Highway passes through the city and Gimhae International Airport is located
at the city. As a result a major function of the city is that of a
transportation and distribution center. According to the national land
development plan, Gimhae is part of the Busan metropolitan growth area.
Population and its Forecast
16.       The annual average rate of population increase during the past
10 years was 4.5%, and an accelerated rate of increase is anticipated in the
future as its satellite function to Busan city grows. This growth is
forecasted below:

Immigration population is anticipated to increase sharply after 1982, after
elevation of its status to "City" from "Eup" and the planned reduction in
travel time to Busan and Masan cities to about 30 minutes. Particularly
during 1986-1996, population increase will be accelerated by:
(a) construction of the electric railway to Busan;
(b)  industrialization of Masan, and Changweon cities; and
(c) relatively lower land price in the city compared to
those of surrounding cities.

Applying anticipated population increase rates of 4.5% until 1986, and 4%
during 1987-1991, to the 1980 population (70,101), results in population
levels of 91,300 and 111,100 persons in 1986 and 1991 respectively. Number
of households will be 24,670 units in 1991 on the assumption that family size
will be reduced from 5.95 persons in 1980 to 4.50 persons in 1991.
Housing Status and its Demand
17.       Annual average increase rate of households and housing during past
6 years (1974-1980) was 2.9% and 3.4% respectively. The housing shortage
ratio in 1980 was 24.6% and housing demand is anticipated to increase
significantly in the near future.

KOREA
SECOND NATIONAL URBAN LAND DEVELOP14ENT AND HOUSING PROJECT
Site Summaries, Plans and Design Specifications
Project Summary and Specifications for Phase I Sites
A. Anyang Site
1. Site Characteristics
Classification. Phase I site, City Planning Law (CPL) implementa-
tion.
Location. The site is located in the Sanbon area, about 2 km south
of the City Hall in Anyang. The tract is bordered on the east by the main
communter rail line linking Seoul to the industrial cities to the south, and
by national highway No. 1. Transportation linkages to points throughout
the capital region are excellent.
Existing Land Use. The site is predominantly agricultural land,
87% being in paddies or dry fields. The site is contiguous with a large
(500,000-600,000 py) parcel in the initial stages of development by Anyang
City known as Land Readjustment Project No. 8.  The proposed KLDC under-
taking (including a second increment in Phase II of this project) is inte-
grated into the master plan for this broader-scale development.
Topography. Nearly all the site is at slopes of 5% or less, and
is well suited for the mixed residential and commercial development proposed.
2. Design Features
Site Preparation. Although the volume of fill required substan-
tially exceeds cut within the Phase I site limits, borrow is available
immediately adjacent thereto, and average depth of fill over the site is only
about 0.7 m.
Roads. Primary access from the 35 m national highway along the
easterly margin of the site is complemented by a 16 m arterial bisecting the
project and forming a link in the city-s road master plan. Most other project
roads are 6 m and 8 m. Pavement sections for the arterials are fairly deep
(60 cm), dictated by the frost penetration of the area.  Roads in residential
areas will have lesser depth.
Water Supply. The site will be served by a 1.3 km, 250 mm trunk
main extension from the city system. The distribution network on site will
be 50 to 200 mm in size.



- 78 -                           ANNEX 5
APPENDIX B
Page 2
Drainage. The site is traversed by a major watercourse draining
a watershed of about 10 square kilometers. Site design includes realignment
and stabilization of this channel, to which all site drainage will discharge.
Combined storm and sanitary flows will be collected from dwellings and street
inlets and piped to the stream channel. MOC classification of this stream
requires channel improvements (which include one bridge and one 5-barrel box
conduit for road crossings) to be designed for a 50-year storm. However,
the resulting design run-off in the channel is only 9% higher than the flow
from a 20-year event. Channel embankments will be faced with stone masonry.
Electric Power. The project site will be supplied power from KECO
primary transmission facilities about 1 km distant, fed from the major Anyang
Substation. KECO will also install street lighting.
Community Facilities. The project contains 4,200 py designated for
a primary school; other amenities include one park and six neighborhood play-
grounds.
Commercial Areas. One major and two smaller commercial complexes
are included, totalling about 5,100 py. The large commercial district is
sited adjacent to a planned station on the commuter rail line.
Off-site Infrastructure. A cost-sharing scheme has been agreed,
whereby the-trunk water line between the city system and the site, as well
as all the road and drainage work related to the national highway skirting
the site, will be borne by the City government. The total is about 1,150
million won, roughly 12% of overall project cost.

B. Jeongju Site
1. Site Characteristics
Classification. Phase I site, City Planning Law (CPL) implemen-
tation.
Location. The site is located in Hyoja Dong, 5 km south of the
Jeonju industrial complex, traversed by a 25 m arterial road, connecting
with national highway No. 1. Road transport linkage is excellent, as is
convenience to the local railway station, 3.5 km distant.
Existing Land Use. Roughly half the site is in rice and other
agricultrual use, and about one third is forested slopes.
Topography. The site is located in a saddle between two small
hills, but with more than half the net area at slopes less than 5%.
2. Design Features
Site Preparation. Earthwork cut and fill are balanced on site,
with cut slopes stabilized with sod surfacing, supplemented by selective
use of masotiry retaining walls, to help optimize effective use of the
steeper portions of the site while controlling earthwork scale and cost.
Roads. Basic access will be by 25 and 12 m roads; however, 80%
of pavement area on site is devoted to residential streets, of which 85%
are 6 m in width.  Sidewalks will be provided only on the major arterials.
Roads above 10 m will be asphalt concrete; those smaller will be portland
cement concrete.
Water Supply. A 100 mm line from existing City system lies within
the site. However, as the population of the site will increase more than
tenfold upon completion of the project, a new 400 mm trunk main about 4 km
long will be provided to link the area with a principal main in the City.
The project demands will approach 8% of the water presently delivered by the
City system; however, MOC's current Keum River water supply expansion project
(due to be completed by 1984) will alleviate these capacity problems.
Drainage. Due to its basic topography, the site is well drained.
A network of pipes in sizes 300 to 500 mm, supplemented by a small length
of box conduit, will convey combined sanitary and storm flows to existing
natural watercourses off the site. Three watersheds are involved, totalling
about 148 ha.

Electric Power. An existing 22.5 kv KECO primary feeder passes to
the north of the site, sustained by a transformer station in nearby Taepyong
Dong. Extension of service, including street lighting, into the site pre-
sents no difficulties.
Community Facilities. The project site contains six parks and
playgrounds, one primary and two middle schools. Located in close prox-
imity to the site are two existing high schools and one middle school.
Commercial Areas. The development plan includes two areas for
markets and other commercial activities.
Off-site Infrastructure. Off-site works necessary for project
success are limited to the trunk water line, an investment of 400 million
won, which will be paid for by the City government.

C. Suweon Site
1. Site Characteristics
Classification. Phase I site, Land Readjustment (LR) implementa-
tion. An initial stage of land readjustment (217,000 py) of this site was
undertaken in the first land development and housing project (Loan 1980-KO).
In the current project, an additional 218,000 py will be developed.
Location. The Suweon LR site is located 2 km southeast of the
City Hall, in the Gwonseon area at the margin of the urbanized area. The
area of this project includes two parcels adjoining the first project tract,
on the south and west sides, respectively.



-81-                         ANNEX 5
APPENDIX B
Page 5
Existing Land Use. About 83% of the site is rice paddies or dry
field agriculture, and an additional 5% is wooded. Roughly 6% of the site
is in public ownership.
Topography. The site is of gently rolling terrain, with a stream
meandering through the northerly portion. Most of the site lies on slopes
of less than 10%, with the land nearest the stream subject to occassional
flooding.
2. Design Features
Site Preparation. Low areas near the stream channel will be filled,
with a typical maximum fill being about 1.3 m. Reasonable balance of cut
and fill is possible.
Roads.  Access to the city's urban core is excellent, in part due
to infrastructure connected with the first loan project site. Road network
in the site is basically an extension of overall circulation and local
access roads planned in the first project. Widths are 8 to 10 m in resi-
dential areas, and wider for the arterials, with only half the width of the
major streets paved at this stage. Approximately 12.5 km of the total
20.6 km roadways are 6 and 8 m streets.
Water Supply. New treatment and distribution works for the City
are under construction, in part to sustain projected demands of the
Gweonseon LR site(s). All trunk infrastructure off-site was installed in the
first project.
Drainage. The stream meandering through the northerly tract will
be realigned and provided with embankment revetments, these measures being
simply an (upstream) extension of improvements built in the first project
site. Other features include project drains conveying storm runoff and
wastes of domestic sanitary origin, discharging into the improved stream
channel or to other natural watercourses at the periphery of the site.
Electric Power. Power will be extended to project areas from a
KECO 22.9 kv line which presently traverses the western margin of the site,
where necessary to supplement electrical distribution facilities available
to tap in the contiguous first project area.
Community Facilities. There are two existing primary schools, as
well as a middle and high school, within 1 km of the site. When combined
with the three school sites provided in the first project, it is felt reason-
able to limit school site land in the current project to two sites totalling
9,300 py. Three parks are also included. At this site, park landscaping will
be provided by the City.

D. Gangreung Site
1. Site Characteristics
Classification. Phase I site, City Planning Law (CPL) implemen-
tation.
Location. The site is located in the Noam area south of the Namdae
River, 2 km from the city center, and approximately 2.5 km west of the indus-
trial estate at the river mouth.
Existing Land Use. Over 96% of the site is in fields, paddies or
forest lands.
Topography. The site lies in a basin between two small hills,
with most of the area below 10% in slope, and much of it below 5%.
2. Design Features
Site Preparation. Sitework will involve approximately 75,300 py
in cut and fill and regrading operations.
Roads. The site is bordered by a planned 35 m regional road around
the southwestern quadrant of the city. On-site roads are limited entirely
to 6 and 8 m streets, 86% of the length being 6 m residential access roads.



- 83 -                           ANNEX 5
APPENDIX B
Page 7
Water Supply. A 150 mm pipeline 500 m long will link the site
with the existing city distribution system. On-site distribution piping
totals 2.7 km.
Drainage. Piped drainage works, in sizes up to 600 mm will convey
storm run-off and sanitary flows to natural channels at the northerly
edge of the site, from which it will flow to the Namdae River. Basic site
relief favors effective drainage.
Electric Power. KECO power and street lighting services will be
extended from a nearby residential areas. With a substation located only
2.5 km to the northwest, abundant power is available for site needs.
Community Facilities. This site is favored with existing primary,
middle and high schools, all being within 250 m of the tract boundaries, and
thus no new facilities of this type are planned. The project includes one
park and one open green space.
Commercial Areas. A single commercial area of 300 py is planned for
market and similar activities serving project residents.
Off-site Infrastructure. There is no significant off-site infra-
structure necessary for successful development of this site.

SECOND NATIONAL URBAN LAND DEVELOPMENT AND HOUSING PROJECT
Technical Assistance Program
1.        The technical assistance component of the project includes:  (a)
training of MOC, KLDC and KNHC staff; (b) project preparation; (c) monitoring
and evaluation of the project; and (d) studies in the housing sector.  The
estimated costs for the technical assistance program are given in Table 1.
The four elements of the program are briefly described below.
Staff Training
2.         This component is intended to provide primarily overseas training
for MOC staff, particularly those concerned with the NHF, KLDC and KNHC staff.
The programs for KLDC and KNHC staff will essentially be an extension of the
opportunities provided under the first project for training in real estate
planning, financing and management, engineering and construction. MOC staff
will receive training in housing policy, mortgage systems and financing,
capital markets and related areas.
Project Preparation
3.        KLDC will engage local consultants to prepare feasibility studies
and engineering designs for a third project. A similar provision under the
first project was used for the preparation of studies for this project.
Monitoring and Evaluation
4.        Monitoring and evaluation programs have been prepared for land
development and housing by KLDC and KNHC respectively. For housing, KNHC
will carry out surveys using a questionnaire and sampling strategy agreed
with the Bank. In addition to analysis which KNHC will do itself, the
results of the surveys will be made available to KRIHS to be incorporated
in the housing information system being developed as part of the sector
study under the first project. KLDC will carry out the surveys and program
agreed with the Bank. These survey results will also be incorporated in the
housing information system. These monitoring and evaluation programs will be
continued under this project.
Studies
5.        Subsidies in the housing sector, and their allocation, and
requirements for and location of appropriate appraisal capacity for public
development proposals are two topics which the Bank is prepared to support.
Agreement on these topics and the content of the studies will be sought
during negotiations.
