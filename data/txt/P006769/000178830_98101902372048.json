ha of newly equipped land.\n            Maintenance would be improved and obsolete equipment for\n            operation and maintenance would be replaced. Technical\n            assistance would be provided to small farmers and lands in\n            rice districts would be leveled to save water, reduce\n            production costs and increase cropping intensity. The\n            project would also strengthen HIMAT's capacity to\n            appraise and supervise irrigation/drainage projects and\n            train beneficiaries to manage their own irrigation systems.\n            It is expected that the project would benefit about 4,700\n            farm families, including nearly 1,500 land reform\n            beneficiaries. The major risk is that beneficiaries would be\n            reluctant to adopt technological changes including land\n            leveling, thus delaying or reducing project benefits. This\n            risk, however, is relatively small, and training, technical\n            assistance, access to credit and increased water charges are\n            all expected to encourage farmers to adopt improved farming\n            and irrigation practices."}, "docdt": "1981-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
