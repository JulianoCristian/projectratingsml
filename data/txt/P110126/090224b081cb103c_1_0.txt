                         Implementation Status Overview
                         1.     The overall implementation of the Regional and Municipal Infrastructure Development Project (RMIDP) and its Additional Financing (RMIDP-AF) is satisfactory. The project
                         has made good progress during the past year. Major performance indicators reveal continued progress in meeting the project development objectives.

                         2.         Under the original RMIDP, the Georgia Municipal Development Fund (MDF) successfully implemented 53 water, wastewater and road sub-projects throughout Georgia. The

                         MDF has also successfully completed Phase II improvements to housing and infrastructure conditions in 9 settlements where internally displaced people (IDP) live, with co-financing
                         provided by the European Union (EU). The grant was closed on June 30, 2012 after being fully disbursed.

                         3.        Under the RMIDP-AF, MDF has implemented 69 water, wastewater and road subprojects throughout Georgia (13 subprojects are under component 1.1 and 56 subprojects

                         under component 1.2). Although a grant agreement for the Sida cofinancing of the Mtskheta wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) was signed on September 11, 2012, implementation
                         did not start as the Ministry of Culture raised concerns about the proposed location of the wastewater treatment plant, considering that Mtskheta is a world heritage site. It was
                         agreed that alternative analysis will be done under the master plan of the city, which will be prepared by the Agency of the Cultural Heritage and Preservation. An agreement was
                         reached among the Government of Georgia, Sida and the World Bank to cancel the Sida trust fund and allocate unused funds to the new Sida Wastewater Management trust fund.
                         The Government of Georgia has requested use of funds under RMIDP-AF for another subproject in Kobuleti and to extend the project's closing date by eighteen months, from June
                         30, 2013, to December 30, 2014. A reallocation and extension will be required, subject to Management review and approval of a restructuring paper.

                         4.      Disbursement: As of end-May, 2013, the disbursement rate under the original RMIDP was 100% and 94% under the RMIDP-AF. The total uncommitted amount is about
                         USD2.3 million.

                         5. Performance indicators: The RMIDP and RMIDP-AF achieved most of their intermediary results, some of which exceeded planned targets:

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The overall implementation of the Regional and Municipal Infrastructure Development Project (RMIDP) and its Additional Financing (RMIDP-AF) is satisfactory. The project has made
                         a good progress during the past year.

                         Major performance indicators reveal continued progress in meeting project development objectives. Under the original RMIDP, the Georgia Municipal Development Fund (MDF)
                         successfully implemented 53 water, wastewater, and road subprojects throughout Georgia. The MDF has also successfully completed Phase II improvements to housing and
                         infrastructure conditions in 9 settlements where internally displaced people (IDP) live, with co-financing provided by the European Union (EU) and the grant was closed in June 30,
                         2012 after being fully disbursed. Under the RMIDP-AF, MDF has implemented 69 water, wastewater and road subprojects throughout Georgia (13 subprojects are under component
                         1.1 and 56 subprojects under component 1.2).

                         The proposed wastewater treatment plant in Mtsketa will not be implemented under the RMIDP-AF as the Ministry of Culture raised concerns about the proposed location of the plant.
                         A master plan will be prepared by the Agency of Cultural Heritage and Preservation. At the request of the Government, the closing date of RMIDP-AF will be extended by eighteen
                         months until December 30, 2014 to allow implementation of a new subproject in Kobuleti in replacement of the Mtskheta subproject.
