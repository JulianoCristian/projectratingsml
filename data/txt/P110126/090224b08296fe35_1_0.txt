Implementation Status and Key Decisions

 The overall implementation of Regional and Municipal Infrastructure Development Project (RMIDP), including the Additional Financing, is satisfactory.
 This Project has satisfactory ratings on the achievement of the Project Development Objective (PDO) and implementation progress and will be closed
 on December 31, 2014. The MDF has successfully implemented 141water, wastewater, road and other municipal infrastructure subprojects throughout
 Georgia. The Project and the AF have contributed significantly in addressing the backlog of municipal capital investment requirements including
 construction of 245 kms of roads and improving access of approximately 400 000 people to water. The Project has also created approximately 12,000
 temporary jobs. In addition, the operations have also assisted local governments in improving their finances and accounting and have also assisted the
 Government in the preparation of several key documents including a Road Design Guidelines Manual that provides an integrated approach to improving
 overall street, drainage and traffic conditions and a National Wastewater Management Strategy, including feasibility studies for wastewater treatment
 plants in six cities. The MDF has also successfully completed the improvements of housing and infrastructure conditions in 9 settlements where
 internally displaced people (IDP) live, with co-financing provided by the European Commission (EC). The EC grant closed on June 30, 2012 after being
 fully disbursed.
 Performance indicators: The RMIDP and RMIDP-AF achieved most of their expected results, some of which exceeded the planned target
 values:
 The MDF had successfully completed the last institutional development activity under the project- namely, three city development strategies
 for the municipalities of Stepantsminda (formerly Kazbegi), Abastumani and Dusheti.
