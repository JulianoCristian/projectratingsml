                         The overall implementation of the the Regional and Municipal Infrastructure Development Project (RMIDP), including the Additional Financing (RMIDP-AF), is satisfactory. The project
                         has made a good progress during the past year. The Georgia Municipal Development Fund (MDF) has successfully implemented 143 water, wastewater, road and other municipal
                         infrastructure subprojects throughout Georgia. The MDF has also successfully completed the improvements of housing and infrastructure conditions in 9 settlements where internally
                         displaced people (IDP) live, with co-financing provided by the European Commission (EC). The EC grant closed on June 30, 2012 after being fully disbursed.
