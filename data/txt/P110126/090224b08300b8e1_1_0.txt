      I. Disbursement Profile
1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1. The IDA-funded Regional Municipal and Infrastructure Development Project (RMIDP),
with an amount of US$40 million equivalent, was approved by the World Bank’s Board of
Executive Directors on October 2, 2008. An Additional Financing, in the amount of US$45 million
equivalent (US$33.5 million from IBRD funding and US$11.5 million equivalent from IDA
funding), was approved on November 2, 2010. The Project was to be supported by two Trust Funds
in the amount of US$3.67 million equivalent from the EC approved on September 6, 2010, and
US$1.48 million equivalent from SIDA approved on September 18, 2012. This ICR assesses the
performance and contributions of all the above.


1.1 Context at Appraisal

    (i)     Country and Sector Background.

Original Credit (approved on October 2, 2008)

2. RMIDP’s preparation began in 2007, but its objective and design were adjusted during
preparation to respond to the crisis resulting from the 2008 conflict. The Project was processed
as an Emergency Recovery Loan (ERL) under Operational Policy (OP) 8.00.

3. The 2008 conflict followed a period of stability and far-reaching reforms in the
country, started under the 2003 peaceful “Rose Revolution”. In the years following the
revolution, wide-spread anti-corruption measures and deep structural reforms were put in
place, resulting in improved public administration and the establishment of strong
mechanisms of accountability and transparency. Strengthened public financial
performance and prudent macroeconomic policies led to a period of rapid economic
growth, which averaged 10.5 percent between 2005 and 2007, and to increased
expenditures in the social sectors and infrastructure. The 2008 conflict resulted in shocks
to some of the economic developments achieved during the preceding years, most notably
an increased number of Internally Displaced Persons (IDP) by about 30,000 people,
temporary losses in agriculture and tourism industry, and damage to regional and municipal
infrastructure, although this was limited to specific conflict-affected locations.

4. Despite improvements made following the Rose Revolution, key infrastructure across the
country remained in need of substantial rehabilitation. Water and sanitation infrastructure still
suffered from years of decline in quality, coverage, and maintenance, and from Soviet-era
inefficiencies. Similarly, there was a large backlog of rehabilitation and maintenance work on local
roads, whose ownership and management was delegated to the municipalities. These, however,
lacked the financial and technical capacity for sustainable road maintenance.

Additional Financing Loan and Credit (approved on November 2, 2010)

5. At the time of the appraisal of the AF, economic recovery in Georgia was underway, with
growth projected at 4.5 percent in 2010. The Government had responded to the downturn,


                                                 1
following the 2008 conflict, with a countercyclical fiscal stimulus, coupled with a significant
reallocation of public expenditures toward social and infrastructure investments.

6. At the sector level, key municipal services and infrastructure, such as municipal and
local roads, and water and sanitation infrastructure, were still in need of substantial
rehabilitation in much of the country. Tariffs did not yet cover direct operation and
maintenance or depreciation costs, while the low quality of water and sanitation services
in many cities undermined customers’ willingness to pay for services. Similarly, while
many local roads had been rehabilitated, a large backlog stock remained to be addressed
throughout the country.

7. By the time the AF was being finalized, 3,600 IDPs affected by the conflict had been
provided with: (i) durable housing, through the support of the RMIDP IDA credit; (ii)
basic infrastructure, supported by EC funding; and (iii) farmlands. However, beneficiary
feedback on the ground had indicated the need to improve housing quality and conditions,
expand infrastructure, and improve solid-waste collection systems. The US$3.67 million
equivalent co-financing EC Trust Fund, approved in September, 2010, was designed to
respond to this need, and to specifically support infrastructure restoration and improvement
in housing conditions in conflict-affected areas (see Sections 1.6 and 1.7).

(i) Rationale for Bank Involvement.

8. The World Bank’s engagement in Georgia’s municipal services agenda dates back to 1997,
through two operations with combined disbursements of US$31 million. The first, IDA-funded,
Municipal Development and Decentralization Project (MDDPI, 1997-2002)1, aimed to strengthen
local governments and their ability to provide basic infrastructure services. The project’s main
outcomes were: (i) setting up the Municipal Development Fund (MDF), as a financing mechanism
to enable local governments to finance needed infrastructure repairs; and (ii) support to the Georgia
Municipal Development Program, which assisted the devolution of some responsibilities to 67
district Governments and 1,111 lower-level Local Self-Governments (LSG). The follow-up MDDP
II2 (2002-2007) built on MDDP I and had two thrusts: (i) to further support the development of the
legal framework of decentralization and municipal development, and (ii) to increase the availability
of financing for investments in local infrastructure and municipal services. The project financed 40
infrastructure subprojects in five cities and four LSGs. It also provided technical assistance (i) to
inform the New Law on Local Budget, adopted in 2006, which provided, inter alia, an equalization
grant system based on an objective formula; (ii) to support the development of a subnational fiscal
database at MOF; and (iii) to build central and local capacity to implement an integrated system of
monitoring municipal budgeting and financial reporting systems. Throughout the implementation
of these two operations, MDF’s capacity increased significantly, to the point that it became the
focal central institution for external agencies to support local government infrastructure and utility
services improvements

9. The Project was aligned with, and included in the FY10-13 Country Partnership Strategy
(CPS). RMIDP supported the objective of meeting post-conflict and vulnerability needs, and
specifically supported improvements in social services through investments in municipal services
and towards improving IDP housing and welfare. The Project remained aligned with the FY14-17

CPS, and specifically with the CPS areas of focus on strengthening public service delivery to
promote inclusive growth and enabling job creation by the private sector through improving
competitiveness.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

10. The objectives of the Project were to: (a) improve the efficiency and reliability of selected
municipal infrastructure and services; and (b) assist in restoring infrastructure and services, and
improving the housing conditions of conflict-affected people in Georgia. The PDO wording in the
PAD is consistent with that in the Loan and Financing Agreements.

11. The original key performance indicators outlined in the Project Appraisal Document (PAD)3
were:

         Reduction in KWh consumed per annum due to the introduction of energy efficient
          production methods (water yproduction/street lighting);
         Increased number of hours per day of piped water service;
         Reduction in trip time/vehicle operating costs due to improved urban roads;
         Improved quality of water bodies due to reduction in interim wastewater pollution;
         Number of people benefitting from completed emergency rehabilitation/construction.

       
1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
    reasons/justification.

12. The PDO was not revised.

13. The Results Framework was updated as part of the Additional Financing (AF), approved by
the World Bank Board of Executive Directors on November 2, 2010. The revisions reflected the
scaling-up under the AF, as well as co-financing to be provided under an EC Trust Fund, approved
on September 6, 2010.

14. Specific changes included: (i) the addition of two core PDO indicators, to measure the number
of overall as well as female beneficiaries; (ii) the addition of two core intermediate indicators under
Component 1, Infrastructure Investment, to measure access to water sources; (ii) the addition of
seven intermediate indicators under Component 2, Emergency Rehabilitation and Construction, to
reflect the expanded scope of activities to be supported through a EC TF (see Section 1.6 and 1.7),
including access to improved services, such as water supply and solid waste collection, and
improved housing quality; and (iii) the addition of one intermediate indicator under Component 3,
Institutional Development, related to the completion of the Strategic Development Plans in three
cities; a revision of the targets under PDO indicator 1 and 3, whereby the target KWh consumption
and vehicle operating costs were further reduced compared to the appraisal estimates. In addition,
the PDO indicators were also slightly reworded, to reflect average, rather than absolute, results;
(see Annex 8).

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

15. The Project had four primary beneficiaries: (i) populations that would benefit from increased
availability and quality of municipal services in areas targeted under the Project, through
investments under Component 1. Overall, 367,153 people benefitted from increased availability
and quality of municipal services, of which 194,000 were female. Specific benefits through the
Project included access to 247 km of rehabilitated roads, access to improved water sources for
363,535 beneficiaries, access to roads to 200,000 beneficiaries, an increase in the volume of water
supply from 0 m3 to 152 m3, and of daily collected sewerage from 0 m3 to 3,084 m3; (ii) conflict-
affected Internally Displaced Persons (IDP), who benefitted from the availability of good quality
housing, much of which had been destroyed or severely damaged during the 2008 conflict. Overall,
3,600 conflict-affected people benefitted from infrastructure rehabilitation, and 783 durable houses
were built; (iii) MDF, which continued to be supported in its transition towards becoming a
sustainable institution, through increasing its access to financing for infrastructure rehabilitation
and service expansion under Component 1; and (iv) Local Self Governments (LSGs), which
benefitted from increased access to funding to support their priority municipal infrastructure needs,
but also from enhanced institutional capacity by ways of sub-projects prioritization, management
of credit and grant funds in a structured and disciplined way, and exposure to technical aspects
related to financial, physical and environmental sustainability of rehabilitated infrastructure. The
primary beneficiaries remained the same throughout the project’s life.

1.5 Original Components (as approved) 

16. At the time of approval of the original, US$40 million equivalent IDA loan, the Project
consisted of the following components:

Component 1: Infrastructure Investment (US$27 million IDA; US$6.7 million from MDF and
US$7.9 million from LSGs), consisting of two sub-components:

  (i)    Provision of financial resources to creditworthy LSGs to finance Investment Subprojects
         for the rehabilitation and expansion of priority municipal services and infrastructure needs on
         a sustainable basis, through the carrying out of works and provision of goods and consultants’
         services. ($20 million IDA, $6.7 million MDF contribution and $6.7 million LSGs
         contribution).

  (ii)   Provision of financing on a grant basis to carry out Investment Subprojects for municipal
         services and infrastructure projects in non-creditworthy LSGs, through the carrying out of
         works and provision of goods and consultants’ services. ($7.0 million IDA and $1.2 million
         LSGs contribution).

Component 2: Emergency Rehabilitation and Construction (US$10 million IDA; US$10
million from the Borrower). The components was to provide emergency rehabilitation of conflict
damaged regional and municipal infrastructure and services, including public buildings and shelters
and construction of durable housing, through the carrying out of works and provision of goods and
consultants’ services.

Component 3: Institutional Development (US$3 million IDA; US$0.8 million from the
Borrower). The component was to enhance the institutional capacity and performance of the
Ministry of Finance, the Municipal Development Fund, LSGs, and utilities to assist in the carrying


                                                     4
out of programs for the development of capacity to discharge public services functions with
economy and efficiency, through the provision of goods, consultants’ services and training.
      
1.6 Revised Components

17. The components remained, for the most part, unchanged. Their scope and/or amount,
however, were scaled up to reflect the US$45 million equivalent AF approved in November, 2010,
and the EC co-financing Trust Fund (TF), approved in September, 2010, in support of Component
2. Specific changes, reflected in the AF Project Paper4, included:

         Component 1 (Infrastructure Investment): municipal gas was added as an eligible sector
          under Component 1. The Component’s amount was revised (WB: US$43.5million; MDF:
          US$4.2 million; LSGs US$9.3 million)

         Component 2 (Emergency Rehabilitation and Construction): Component 2 benefitted
          from a EC co-financing TF, in the amount of US$2.8 million-equivalent, to support
          infrastructure restoration and improvements in housing conditions in conflict-affected
          areas. The component’s description was expanded accordingly. The type of services to be
          financed under the component were further specified, and included: water supply volume
          and connections; settlements; drainage channels and pedestrian crossings; solid-waste
          containers and trucks; improving the conditions of walls, floors, entrance sheds, and air
          ventilators in 1,263 houses. No World Bank AF was allocated to Component 2.

         Component 3 (Institutional Development): the preparation of Strategic Development
          Plans for a selected number of cities was added as an activity, in support of Georgia’s
          regional development program. The Component’s amount was revised (WB US$1.5
          million; Borrower: US$0.3 million)

 1.7 Other significant changes
(in design, scope and scale, implementation arrangements and schedule, and funding
allocations)

18. The most significant changes, in chronological order, are summarized below:

(i) EC co-financing TF, in the amount of US$3.6 million-equivalent5, approved on September
    6, 2010. The TF was almost entirely disbursed, with a cancellation of US$85,000-equivalent6.



4
    PP dated October 5, 2010

5
  The TF (TF97715) amount was appraised as US$3.8 million equivalent (as indicated in the RMIDP
PAD). The signed amount was US$3.668 million-equivalent and the revised amount was US$3.58 million-
equivalent.
6
  The cancellation was due to the fact that the TF was denominated in Euro, which appreciated. As a result,
by end of the project there were more funds available than was needed.




                                                    5
      The TF supported Component 2, and specifically infrastructure restoration and improvement
      in housing conditions in conflict-affected areas.

(ii) Additional Finance and Restructuring, approved on November 2, 2010. Key changes
     comprised:
    AF, in the amount of US$45 million. The AF (US$11.5 million equivalent from IDA and
       US$33.5 million from IBRD) resulted in an expansion of the project’s scope, and in increased
       funding for Component 1 and 2 (see Section 1.6);
    Reflecting EC TF co-financing as part of the Project, and specifically in support of
       Component 2;
    Results framework update, to reflect new activities to be funded under the AF, as well as
       under the EC Trust Fund;
    Amendment of Component 2’s description, to reflect new activities to be funded under the
       EC Trust Fund;
    Reduction in the percentage of IDA expenditures being financed under Category 1 and 2,
       resulting from the EC Trust Fund co-financing;
    Changing the frequency of interim unaudited financial reports, from a quarterly to a bi-annual
       basis.

(iii) Swedish International Development Agency (SIDA) TF, in the amount of US$1.48
      million-equivalent, approved on September 18, 2012. The TF amount was fully cancelled,
      and the TF formally closed on September 30, 2013 (see below).

(iv) Level II restructuring, approved on June 27, 2013. The restructuring comprised:
   An 18-month closing extension date, from June 30, 2013 to December 31, 2014. This was
      the first and only Project closing date extension. By the time the extension was approved,
      most of the Project funds (US$84.46 million) had already been disbursed and PDO and
      intermediate indicators largely met, but the extension was needed to complete some critical
      activities: (i) the completion of a road sub-project in Zugdidi, which involved a complex
      drainage work; and (ii) completion of the planned three cities’ development strategies and
      related public consultations.
   Cancellation of the SIDA TF7 (US$1.48 million) intended to co-finance a sub-project in
      Mtskheta. The SIDA TF and RMIDP were to co-finance civil works for the construction of
      the Mtskheta Wastewater Treatment Plant. The related contract, however, was never signed,
      due to issues related to the sub-project’s location under UNESCO’s World Heritage Site. The
      Government subsequently asked that the sub-project be cancelled. The master plan is
      currently under preparation, supported by the World Bank under the Third Regional
      Development Project (UNESCO was hired under the Project to provide quality assurance to
      the master plan preparation). In agreement with the donor and the Government, the canceled
      TF amount was added to a newly established Programmatic Sustainable Wastewater
      Management Project TF8, signed on July 25, 2013.
   Reallocation of RMIDP funds, amounting to about US$4.61 million-equivalent (US$1
      million within IBRD Loan No. 79620; US$1.87 million-equivalent within IDA Credit No.
      45160; and US$1.73 million within IDA Credit No. 48240). The Project Paper indicates that
      the reallocated funds comprised funds that became available from the cancellation of the
      Mtskheta sub-project and savings made under other tenders.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry
(including whether lessons of earlier operations were taken into account, risks and their
mitigations identified, and adequacy of participatory processes, as applicable)


(i)    The 2008 conflict, which took place during the preparation phase of RMIDP, resulted in
       the need to promptly adjust project preparation and design. In terms of processing, the
       Bank’s Operational Policy (OP) 8.0, Rapid Response to Crisis and Emergencies, was
       triggered, to expedite the project’s response to the conflict through a faster preparation and
       approval track. Adjustments to the PDO and components were also made, to specifically
       address the needs of housing and infrastructure rehabilitation for conflict-affected IDPs.
       These adjustments were largely based on a Joint Needs Assessment conducted on the ground,
       right after the conflict (see Section 5.1).

(ii)   The Project built on extensive background analysis and earlier successful operations, from
       which key lessons were incorporated. The JNA provided specific inputs on the extent of the
       damages and needs for housing and infrastructure investments in conflict-affected areas, and
       part of the Project’s design was based on this critical assessment. Specific lessons reflected
       in the project’s design include: (i) placing MDF as a financial intermediary, where municipal
       access to finance was limited; (ii) utilizing a mix of lending and grant instruments, to target
       both creditworthy municipalities and those in financial distress or with not enough resources
       due to their size; (iii) putting in place project development agreements between the
       municipalities and MDF, making financial obligations clear, especially with regards to
       remedies in case of a breach in the agreement, such as non-repayment of a loan; and (iv)
       speed, simplicity, and flexibility of project design and implementation.

(iii) In general, risks were adequately identified and mitigated. The overall risk of the operation
      remained Moderate. One of the two risks that were rated Significant at appraisal, namely that
      continuing conflicts may impede project implementation, did not materialize, as the conflict
      did not protract. Nonetheless, RMIDP’s emergency component did provide immediate
      assistance to IDPs, and thus contributed to lowering the impact of the conflict and the
      potential for post-conflict unrest. The risk of speedy implementation of emergency support
      resulting in negative social or environmental impacts was also rated Significant. However,
      as a result of social and environmental safeguards due diligence, including the preparation
      of an Environmental Impact Assessment and of an Environmental Management Plan, and of
      the use of a lottery-based system for the assignment of housing to IDPs, this risk did not
      materialize. The risk of small LSGs with no credit capacity incurring in arrears or default in
      paying back to MDF was mitigated by the provision of grant-based support.

(iv)   Both the Government and the implementing agency were highly committed to RMIDP, as
       reflected in the fast preparation and well-coordinated emergency response. Under the
       Physical Investment component, the Government and MDF took immediate remedial actions
       when the Bank identified quality issues with some road subprojects. Under the Institutional
       Development component, all prepared strategies were based on Government demand. The
       wastewater management strategy was discussed at a cabinet’s meeting and adopted by a
       formal government decree to make its recommendation mandatory to consider during the

                                                  7
       design and construction of all new wastewater treatment plants. The road design guidelines
       have also been adopted by MDF and the Ministry of Regional Development and
       Infrastructure. The guidelines are now used throughout Georgia. The Government also
       provided timely counterpart funding throughout the entire project duration. Finally, the MDF
       Supervisory Board was extremely effective throughout the implementation period of the
       project. They Board convened several times, during which it discussed and approved MDF’s
       business plans, but also addressed issues related to project implementation.


(v)    The identification of priority sub-projects was set-up to ensure community participation at
       the municipal level. All proposed subprojects by LSGs had to be discussed and approved by
       elected local councils before being considered by MDF for financing. In order to further
       strengthen the level and quality of citizen engagement and social accountability under the
       RMIDP series, the World Bank carried out an Assessment of Social Accountability in
       Municipal Services in Georgia in March, 2015. The findings and the recommendations under
       the assessment informed the design of the follow-up operation. As a result, citizen
       engagement and social accountability are now an integral part of RMIDPII, and constitute
       one of four criteria used under its new performance-linked grant system for LSGs.

(vi)    The Project served as a catalyst for a broader, strategic engagement, which effectively
        leveraged funding and interests of other partners. As early as 2006, the Bank and the U.
        S. Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) entered into a new and innovative partnership
        (Service Agreement). The MCC had agreed to provide US$60 million for municipal
        infrastructure development through the MDF (2007-2012) and entered into a Service
        Agreement with the World Bank (fee-based service, now called RAS), under which the
        World Bank task team provide safeguards, procurement and technical support to MDF in
        order to ensure high design and implementation (quality assurance). In this way, the MCC
        has been able to leverage the impact of their funding with the accumulated knowledge and
        expertise of the World Bank. The EBRD and ADB also provided funding through the MDF
        in a coherent and coordinated effort with IDA and MCC programs.

2.2 Implementation
(including any project changes/restructuring, mid-term review, Project at Risk status, and actions
taken, as applicable)

19. The Project was consistently rated Satisfactory with respect to Implementation Progress and
progress towards the PDO, and was never in a Risk status. Issues were adequately flagged in ISRs
and Aide Memoires, and remedial actions taken in a timely manner. Seventeen months into
implementation, disbursements had reached 74 percent of the original IDA credit. Subsequently,
the Additional Financing was approved, and went into full implementation right away. Ninety
seven percent of all funds were disbursed by the closing date, and most of the intermediate
performance indicators were fully met or exceeded.

20. Quick action enabled displaced people to move to new houses before the onset of the bitter
winter season in Georgia. Within four months after the conflict, 783 durable houses for 3,600
internally displaced persons were constructed under the Project in 8 settlements in the Gori, Kaspi,
and Kareli regions. Fast implementation, and at such early stages, was largely facilitated by the
use of retroactive financing. Displaced families were moved from cold tents and collective centers
to individual houses through a transparent and fair house allocation process that kept, to the extent
possible, all families that came from the same village together. The Government provided each


                                                 8
family with full set of furniture, food (with UN agencies’ support), and farmland to support their
new economic livelihood.

21. Partnerships with other donors were sought, to address specific issues, such as the IDP
housing quality, in ways that could maximize complementarity, value-added, and speed of
response. The EC Trust Fund in support of Component 2 was geared specifically at addressing the
issue of IDPs housing quality, which had somewhat suffered, as priority was being given to provide
a fast response to the housing needs, with a focus on the speed of construction.

22. A Mid-term review (MTR) was conducted early on in the implementation period, given the
fast implementation of the IDA credit, and used as an opportunity to highlight and correct
implementation issues. The MTR took place in March, 2010, seventeen months after approval and
more than three years before the scheduled project closing date. This was justified by the fact that,
partially due to the use of retroactive financing, 74 percent of the IDA funds had already been
disbursed by then, 80 percent above the originally projected cumulative amount. The MTR
adequately focused on issues and on developing remedial actions to address them. Specifically: (i)
while overall construction quality was found to be generally satisfactory, quality problems in three
local roads subprojects were identified through construction site visits. The mission agreed with
MDF on a remedial action plan, and these issues were adequately resolve; (ii) the review identified
six subprojects needing design revisions (one road subproject whose design did not include storm
water drainage and culvert; one water subproject with no drawings design; one sewage subproject
whose design did not include household connections under the existing roadways for the purposes
of hooking into the internal systems of houses; and three water/sewage subprojects which could
benefit from modern technology using energy efficient treatment or pumping system). In this case
as well, a remedial action was developed jointly with MDF, and designs were revised accordingly;
(iii) The mission noted weak compliance with the enforcement of the Environment Management
Plan (EMP) in some subprojects and agreed with MDF on the need for intensified construction
supervision. Environmental safeguard compliance was downgraded to Moderately Satisfactory
(MS). Subsequently, as part of the 2010 restructuring and AF, a unit for handling environmental
and social safeguards was established within MDF. As part of the AF, a fine-tuned Environmental
Assessment Guidelines Framework was prepared, and became an integral part of the Operational
Manual of MDF. However, the safeguards compliance rating was not upgraded until December,
20119, as the team waited for the new unit to become functional and to improve its M&E planning,
implementation, and monitoring documentation; (iv) M&E performance was also downgraded to
MS, due to MDF’s delays in hiring a consulting firm to carry out the baseline and results survey.
The rating was restored to Satisfactory in the January, 2011 ISR, which noted that MDF was now
maintaining an effective Management Information System, had hired and M&E consulting firm,
and semi-annual progress reports had been submitted to the Bank on time, and at a satisfactory
quality.

23. The Results Framework was overall well designed, with measurable indicators, although
some aspects could have been strengthened. The RF comprised five outcome indicators.
Efficiency of selected municipal services was measured by: (i) the yearly consumption of KWh,
expected to decline as a result of energy-efficient production methods introduced under the Project,
such as water production or street lighting; and (ii) reduction in trip time/vehicle operating costs as
a result of improved urban roads. Reliability was measured by the number of hours per day of piped

    There was a one-year gap between the two ISRs archived in January 1, 2011 and December 27, 2011.


                                                    9
water service. One indicator, namely the number of people benefitting from completed emergency
rehabilitation/construction, was targeted to measure progress in activities targeted to benefit
conflict-affected beneficiaries. The target values related to the intermediate indicators for water
production, sewerage collection, and road rehabilitation, could not be estimated at the appraisal
stage of RMIDP, as the project was designed as a framework operation whose specific sub-projects
would depend on actual demand from LSGs, which was difficult to estimate up-front.

24. M&E implementation and utilization were overall adequate, especially with regards to
IDPs. One very positive feature was that M&E was embedded into RMIDP since the preparation
stage, through the design and implementation of the JNA. The JNA effectively informed Project
design, and provided the context, baselines, and targets with respect to IDP housing and
infrastructure needs. Once the construction of the ODP houses was underway, an on the ground
assessment revealed issues related to quality, which were promptly addressed through the EC Trust
Fund. The selected PDO and intermediate indicators were utilized by both the Bank and MDF to
monitor progress towards the project’s objectives, and revised at the time of the AF. Mandatory
core indicators, including the gender-disaggregate number of project beneficiaries, were added at
the time of the AF, and targets were revised to reflect the additional funding available. In retrospect,
the team should have cancelled the PDO indicator measuring the quality of water bodies at the time
of the June, 2013 restructuring, when it was already clear that it would not have been met. Instead,
the team opted to keep it, although it should be noted that this was a deliberate choice, dictated by
the concern that dropping an unmet indicator so late in the implementation phase may have been
interpreted as opportunistic.

25. M&E reporting in the ISRs, however, was not always consistent. For example, the June, 2013
ISR indicates that several indicators, as of end-May, 2013, had performed better than at Project
closing, at end-2014. A case in point is the PDO indicator about average Kwh consumption, with
the June, 2013 ISR indicating to be 0.30, vs. 0.37in December, 2014. Similarly, the June, 2013,
ISR indicated the number of hours of piped water to be 17, while the final ISR in December, 2014,
indicated the figure to be 12. Finally, the PDO indicator about improved quality of water bodies
was 28.70 in the June, 2013 ISR, and zero in the final ISR. Similar reporting issues were observed
with respect to some intermediate indicators, such as the one related to the average cubic meters of
collected sewerage, which was 30,053 in the June, 2013, ISR, vs. 3,048 in the final ISR. Similarly,
the number of grey water connections in IDP areas was indicated to be over 1,200 in November,
2012, and 783 as early as May, 2013. The ISR results framework was also not fully aligned with
the one revised as part of the Additional Financing, including the lack of the core indicator about
the number of project beneficiaries, which had been introduced at the time of the AF. The reporting
issue was largely due to the demand-driven nature of the operation, where more than 120
subprojects were being financed on a rolling basis. Intermediary ISRs used aggregate expected
targets as reported in feasibility studies, as well as MDF progress reports. Towards the end of the
project, an international consulting firm specialized on M&E was hired under the loan proceeds,
and carried out a thorough technical audit to measure actual subprojects post-completion results
and calculate the aggregate or weighted average values. It should also be noted that differences
between the intermediate and final reporting did not distort the Project ratings, because progress
towards PDO achievement remained very positive throughout implementation, as reflected in the
M&E analysis conducted at the end of the Project.

2.3 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance
(focusing on issues and their resolution, as applicable)

26. The Project faced some issues of compliance with environmental safeguards, but these were
duly addressed, and the Project closed with no negative environmental impacts. Issues with EMP
compliance in some subprojects, which emerged at the time of the MTR, resulted in a downgrading
of Environmental Safeguards compliance to Moderately Satisfactory from March 2010 to
December, 2011. These were addressed through establishing an environmental and social
safeguards unit within MDF, and though other operational measures. The project triggered OP/BP
4.01 Environmental Assessment and was classified as environmental Category F. Because the
project was designed to finance multiple individual investments on a rolling basis, an
Environmental Assessment and Management Framework (EAMF) was prepared and incorporated
into the Operational Manual to guide environmental screening, assessment, management planning,
and monitoring procedures for the individual sub-projects. No Category A sub-projects were
financed. Because the project triggered OP 8.00 Rapid Response to Crises and Emergencies, the
EAMF carried relevant provisions for a simplified environmental review and approval of activities
aimed at the provision of infrastructure to IDP settlements on emergency basis. The AF did not
trigger any additional safeguard policies and the environmental Category F remained the same. The
EAMF was updated and re-disclosed at the time of the AF. Although no resettlement land
acquisition or physical relocation of beneficiaries was expected, and none materialized, OP/BP.4.12
on Involuntary Resettlement was triggered and a Resettlement Policy Framework prepared, as a
precaution. All subprojects finance under the Project were category B and none involved
resettlement, land acquisition or any other social or environmental issues.

27. Safeguards policy implementation was generally satisfactory, and when issues arose they
were promptly addressed and resolved. As noted above, as soon as issues of compliance with the
EMP were identified in some of the sub-projects, remedial actions were put in place, and project
changes (namely, the 2010 restructuring and AF) were used as opportunities to strengthen
safeguards institutional capacity and implementation. This translated into the creation of a specific
unit, within MDF, dedicated to environmental and social safeguards, and in embedding an updated
Environmental Assessment Guidelines Framework into MDF’s Operational Manual.

28. MDF’s Procurement has been in charge of all procurement related aspects throughout
project implementation. MDF’s Procurement staff gained substantial knowledge through extensive
trainings, as well as actual procurement transactions. The Bank’s Procurement Specialist, based in
Georgia, provided assistance and on-the-job training on a continuous basis. Annual post reviews of
procurement contracts found that procurement procedures were generally in adherence with World
Bank procedures. When issues were identified, they were brought to MDF’s attention and specific
recommendations were jointly agreed upon and implemented.

29. The financial management arrangements at MDF including budgeting, accounting,
internal controls, financial reporting and auditing have been overall satisfactory. MDF’s internal
controls system was assessed on a regular basis by the Bank and found reliable and able to provide
timely information and reporting on the project. In particular, the MDF used to perform regular
formal reconciliation of the WB disbursement data with project’s accounting records via Client
Connection. Proper data back-up arrangements have been followed. While there have been some
delays in the submission of semi-annual IFRs, timeliness of submission gradually improved. The
main reason for IFR inaccuracies, especially in the earlier phases of implementation, was that the
reports were manually prepared by the financial manager, with no other staff assigned to review
the accuracy. MDF’s proactively responded by assigning additional accountants to verify the


                                                 11
accuracy of IFRs prior to them being submitted to the Bank, which resulted in improved quality of
financial reporting. The project and entity’s unmodified auditor’s reports usually have been
submitted on time and found acceptable.

30. Technical assistance delivered through the project included the assessment of rural
sanitation in Georgia and development of the waste water management strategy for several
municipalities of the country. These outputs had a strong indirect positive environmental impact,
because they laid the basis for planning and providing optimal waste water treatment infrastructure
in a number of provinces of Georgia.



2.4 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase
(including transition arrangement to post-completion operation of investments financed by
present operation, Operation & Maintenance arrangements, sustaining reforms and institutional
capacity, and next phase/follow-up operation, if applicable)

31. To ensure the sustainability of sub-projects, it became standard practice, under RMIDP,
for MDF to prepare Sub-project Appraisal Reports (SAR) or Sub-project Summary Reports
(SSR), when the investment amount is less than US$2 million. The SARs and SSRs include sub-
projects feasibility and safeguards issues, and analyze the availability of funds for Operation and
Maintenance of restored assets to ensure sustainability. All SARs were approved by the Bank prior
to the start of the tendering process.

32. The Government of Georgia has requested the World Bank’s continued support in
addressing LSGs reforms and investments needs. The ongoing, follow-up RMIDP II Project,
approved in July, 2014, builds on RMIDP’s design and implementation arrangements, and aims to
further improve the access to and quality of municipal services and infrastructure. The Project
supports the decentralization agenda through financing investment priorities identified under the
regional development strategies. The grants funded under the operation are performance-based, to
build incentives for better LSG performance.

33. At the same time, sustaining operating costs of other donor-funded programs poses a risk
on MDF’s future operations. While the operating cost of managing other donor-funded programs
have been, in the past, covered largely by some of the donors themselves, the donors’ contributions
towards operating costs declined significantly in 2013 and 2014 as MDF accepted to implement
projects financed by some other IFIs and donors without operating cost allocation. The World Bank
advised the government and MDF that unless donors put adequate funding to cover legitimate
operating costs, the MDF’s interest income will have to be tapped, resulting in a negative impact
on the sustainability of the MDF’s future operation, since the MDF is expected to grow and to keep
its retained earnings and increase its capital base, which in turn would provide continuous support
to the local infrastructure development. Projections for 2015-2019, which include loan to be
financed under the ongoing, follow-up RMIDP II, indicate an increasing contribution from other
donors towards operating costs, to address this issue. However, these remain projections and
RMIDP II has begun implementation fairly recently, so this risk remains relevant at the time of this
ICR.

3. Assessment of Outcomes
        
3.1. Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
(to current country and global priorities, and Bank assistance strategy)

34. The relevance of the Project’s Objective, Design and Implementation are all rated High.
The assessment is based on the following:

(i)     Relevance of Objectives
       The need for increased efficiency and reliability of municipal infrastructure and services is
        still a key priority in Georgia. In most cities, towns and villages, the quality, coverage and
        maintenance of basic municipal and infrastructure services have declined since the break-up
        of the Soviet Union due to inadequate resources for capital investment and maintenance. This
        was exacerbated by the age of the infrastructure, and the fact that technology was over-
        designed and thus was expensive to maintain, inefficient in its energy-use, and lacked routine
        maintenance. Today, only slightly more than half of Georgian households have indoor
        bathroom facilities, only 78% of urban households are connected to a piped water and
        sewerage system, and only 5 out of 29 wastewater treatment plants have marginal
        functionality. Under the Social Accountability in Municipal Services in Georgia, residents of
        selected municipalities, including women and vulnerable groups10, confirmed that the highest
        priority problems remain water supply, local roads, and sanitation systems.11 The follow-up,
        and ongoing RMIDP II, approved in July, 2014, further builds on RMIDP, and aims “to
        improve the efficiency and reliability of targeted municipal services and infrastructure.”

      Addressing IDPs housing and infrastructure needs was a highly relevant priority at the time
       of appraisal, and remained so throughout project implementation. By design, including this
       as part of the Project responded to an immediate emergency, posed by the consequences of
       the 2008 conflict. This is a positive development, deriving from the end of the conflict and
       from the housing needs of IDPs having been satisfactorily addressed.

      The Project is aligned with the FY14-17 Country Partnership Strategy (CPS). More
       specifically, the Project’s objective, together with the follow-up RMIDP II Project, supports
       CPS Focus Area 1 “Strengthening public service delivery to promote inclusion and equity”,
       and Objective 4 “Improving identification, prioritization and implementation of public
       investments”.


(ii) Relevance of Design

       The Project’s components adequately addressed the more systemic issue of quality and
        access to municipal services in target areas, as well as the immediate need to address IDPs
        housing and infrastructure needs, following the 2008 conflict. The infrastructure and
        housing components were complemented by an institutional development component, whose

  World Bank, Social Accountability in Municipal Services in Georgia, February 2015. The surveys and
Focus Group Discussions were held in municipalities connected to RMIDP II (Khashuri, Kvareli, and
Samtredia, in addition to pilot activities in Sagarejo).

                                                   13
     main focus was to contribute to the institutional and financial sustainability of project
     outcomes. The component focused on supporting MDF’s transition from a project
     implementing agency into a sustainable financial intermediary, able to contribute with its
     own funds to new operations (for example, MDF currently contributes US$12.93 million to
     the US$30.0 million IBRD loan for RMIDPII). MDF has also become a provider of technical
     assistance to LSGs for sustainable municipal development.

  MDF’s turnover has grown multifold, from its initial GEL3.9 million loan portfolio in 2001
   to about GEL 39.9 million loan outstanding as of December 31, 2013. The loan portfolio is
   supported by eight credits, financed by several donors, including the World Bank, ADB, the
   Government of Japan and KFW. MDF also manages 13 projects which have been providing
   much-needed financing for municipal infrastructure on a grant basis, with an active portfolio
   in 2014 of about GEL225 million. At the end of 2013, cash and bank balance for MDF was
   GEL84 million, the net income was GEL 9.5 million (Audited account). There is no liquidity
   risk in the foreseeable future. Credit risk has been low with good repayment rate from the
   LSGs in the past. The current loan portfolio quality is extremely high.

  The Project was aligned with, and contributed towards the goals of eliminating poverty and
   strengthening shared prosperity. At the Government’s request, and in response to the twin
   shocks of the August conflict, RMIDP became part of the Government’s fiscal stimulus
   package, by funding sub-projects that would improve beneficiaries’ standards of living, and
   by generating temporary jobs to individuals. Most of the sub-projects were carried out in the
   poorest regions of Georgia, with incidences of poverty higher than the national average (see
   Figures 2 and 3). In addition, conflict-affected people, key beneficiaries of RMIDP, are among
   the most vulnerable and poor in Georgia, and account for a disproportionate amount of the
   poor. They depend on subsistence agriculture and on social assistance, with generally limited
   recourse to adequate housing, sustainable livelihoods and jobs. The project’s focus on IDPs
   helped address, at least in part, the housing issue, at a critical time of emergency needs
   following the conflict.

  The combination of credit and grant financing was designed to create an inclusive model
   for both creditworthy and small LSGs with no credit capacity, , while exposing
   municipalities to an approach that resembled private-led municipal financing. Under
   Component 1, the Project made financing available to creditworthy LSGs on a combined loan
   and grant basis, while it exclusively provided grants to small municipalities with no credit
   capacity. Loan portions were provided under an 11 percent interest rate, which was the
   prevalent borrowing market rate at the time of appraisal, with a 10-year maturity and one year
   grace period. One of the ideas behind this approach was to develop a market for municipal
   finance, through the creation of a culture of sustainable sub-national borrowing, including
   improved fiscal discipline.



(iii) Relevance of Implementation

  Adjustments to project design ensure continued relevance and responsiveness to
   beneficiaries’ needs. The first ensured that the issue of housing quality, and need for expanded
   infrastructure investments, was met, and that it complemented the efforts made during the first
   two years of Project implementation. While the Project did provide access to housing to 3,600
   IDPs, a survey had raised concerns that their quality was not adequate. Similarly, the AF

                                               14
     expanded the scope and size of infrastructure investments under Component 1, and of the
     institutional development support under Component 3.

   Higher than anticipated use of municipalities’ grants, rather than loans under RMIDP, was
    a relevant response to the impact of the 2008 financial crisis and resulting credit crunch.
    Ultimately, 71 percent of funding under Component 1 took the form of grants, while the
    remaining 29 percent were loans (see Figure 1). This was a higher use of grants, compared to
    the initial projections at the time of appraisal, because more municipalities, while
    creditworthy, became affected by the financial crisis and the limited availability of funds from
    market sources.

3.2. Achievement of Project Development Objectives
(Including brief discussion of causal linkages between outputs and outcomes, with details on
outputs in Annex 2)

35. Four out of five PDO indicators and 17 out of 18 intermediate indicators were exceeded or
fully achieved. The target for average improved quality of water bodies was not achieved because
the proposed contract to co-finance civil works for the construction of the Mtskheta Wastewater
Treatment Plant was never signed, due to issues related to the sub-project’s location under
UNESCO’s World Heritage Site and delays in preparing and adopting the city’s Master Plan, as
per UNESCO requirements. However, the wastewater management strategy prepared under the
project enabled the Government and World Bank team to leverage a much larger trust fund
resources from SIDA, and implementation of two wastewater treatment plants will start soon in
Telavi and Tskaltubo. Once the Mtskheta Master Plan completed (funded now by the World Bank
under the Third Regional Development Project along with a TA contract with UNESCO World
Heritage Center to provide quality assurance and capacity building), the city's wastewater treatment
plant could be financed under RMIDPII or other programs.

36. The first portion of the PDO related to improving “the efficiency and reliability of selected
municipal infrastructure and services” was achieved. Energy efficiency was achieved through the
introduction of more energy-efficient production methods, which replaced the old Soviet system of
pumping water into a gravity-fed system, resulting in a decline of KWh consumed per m3, from
0.63 to o.37, against a target of 0.40. Road rehabilitation contributed to a reduction in vehicle
operating costs of 30 percent, against a target of 25 percent. Reliability of piped water service
increased, as reflected in an increased number of hours of available service from 7 to 12. The
indicator on improved quality of water bodies saw no progress, as two sub-projects related to
wastewater treatment were moved to another SIDA TF, supporting RMIDP II. The indicator,
however, was kept, in case of any demand from LSGs for rehabilitation of wastewater treatment
plants.

37. The second portion of the PDO related to assisting “in restoring infrastructure and services
and improving the housing conditions of conflict-affected people in Georgia” was achieved.
Overall, 783 durable houses were constructed under the Project, and 3,600 people benefitted from
emergency rehabilitation. All the constructed houses were provided with grey water connections.
The volume of water supply in IDP settlements increased from zero to 152m3, against a very modest
target of 20m3, resulting in providing IDPs with a more reliable water supply system. IDP
settlements benefitted from 272 improved water standpipes, against a baseline of zero and a target
of 60, resulting in reduction in the coping cost to fetch water from long distance. Three hundred
pedestrian crossings were constructed, against a baseline of zero and a target of 150, resulting in
improved pedestrians’ safety. Ten IDP settlements were served with solid waste collection systems,
against a baseline of zero, resulting in improved hygiene and reduction of health hazard due to
uncollected trash. 1,263 houses had their physical conditions improved. This included improved
physical conditions of walls and floors, and provision of entrance sheds and air ventilators, and
installation of hydro/thermal insulation.

                                                16
38. The institutional development component, although not a part of the PDO, contributed to
strengthened capacity in a number of areas, including (see Annex 2): (i) a more efficient budget
and financial management system, comprising both revenues and expenditures, on which staff in
all the 69 municipalities was trained in 2009; (ii) preparation of Georgia’s Wastewater Management
Strategy and Feasibility Studies for six cities, which has provided LSGs and the water utility
company with cost-effective modern technology design options of wastewater treatment plant; (iii)
preparation of an “Urban and Inter-Village Roads Design Guidelines Manual”, which provided an
integrated approach to improving overall streets, sidewalks, drainage, and traffic conditions. It also
provided guidelines on pavement thickness based on traffic count to avoid several cases of over-
design; thus waste of scarce financial resources; (iv) preparation of “Tbilisi Bridge Feasibility
Study and Design” to connect two growing districts in Tbilisi over the river. The bridge also intends
to resolve a major traffic bottle neck in Tbilisi; (v) collection and analysis of baseline data and
outcome indicators of roads, water supply and wastewater subprojects; (vi) preparation of strategic
development plans for sustainable cities in 3 municipalities, to enable citizen in these cities to come
up with a shared vision for their cities development priorities. This activity is currently being scaled
up to all cities in Georgia under the RMIDPII.

39. A weighted outcome assessment, against disbursements made under the original vs. the
revised outcome indicators, confirms the overall PDO Satisfactory rating (see Table 2). As part
of the November, 2010 Additional Financing (AF), the targets of two PDO indicators were revised,
to take into account the scale-up effect of the AF. Specifically, the target for KWh consumption
per m3 decreased from .56 (corresponding to 80 percent of the baseline) to 0.4, while the target for
vehicle operating costs decreased from 80 percent to 75 percent of the baseline. In addition, the
wording of some of the indicators was slightly refined, to refer to “average” increases or reductions,
rather than absolute ones. Both before and after these revisions took place, relevance of PDO,
design, and implementation remained Satisfactory. Implementation was progressing fast, with 81
percent of the original US$40 million IDA funding disbursed by the time the AF was approved. As
of November, 2010, progress towards the PDO was progressing well, as indicated in the January,
2011 ISR. By the closing date, the Project met or exceeded all but one outcome indicator, and met
or exceeded 17 out of 18 intermediate indicators.

3.3. Efficiency
(Net Present Value/Economic Rate of Return, cost effectiveness, e.g., unit rate norms, least cost,
and comparisons; and Financial Rate of Return)

40. The Economic and Financial Analysis indicates high efficiency, as reflected in the positive
rate of return under all analyzed sub-projects (see Annex 3). More specifically: (i) Roads projects
yielded an economic internal rate of return (EIRR) above 12 percent, even under the assumption of
significant traffic level reductions, while investment costs of rehabilitated roads compare favorably
with international standards; (ii) water supply and sewerage system rehabilitation sub-projects
yielded an overall EIRR of 13.7 percent; tourism development sub-projects yielded an EIRR
between 15.07 percent and 13.37 percent, with the letter assuming a 20 percent decrease in tourism.

3.4. Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
(Combining relevance, achievement of PDOs, and efficiency)

The overall outcome rating is assessed to be Satisfactory. This is based on: (i) High relevance of
the PDO; (ii) Project efficacy, reflected by the achievement of all but one PDO indicators; and (iii)
Project efficiency, as reflected in the positive rate of returns of selected sub-projects (see Annex 3).

3.5. Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(if any, where not previously covered or to amplify discussion above)

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

41. Although the Project’s direct impact on poverty could not be measured, and attribution
might have proven difficult, implementation focused on the more vulnerable regions of Georgia.
Half of the sub-projects (see Figure 1) were implemented in the regions of Imereti (14 percent of
the total), Samegrelo and Zemo Svaneti (12 percent), Kvemo Kartli (13 percent), and Kakheti (11
percent). These sub-regions all have poverty rates above the national average of 36 percent12 (see
Figure 2), at 40.3 percent, 44 percent, 41.9 percent, and 40.4 percent, respectively.

42. Gender aspects, including gender data disaggregation, were not embedded in the project’s
design. The Beneficiary Assessment carried out under the ICR did not indicate any significant tor
systematic gender differences with respect to sub-project impact, as perceived by the respondents.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
(particularly with reference to impacts on longer-term capacity and institutional development)

43. One of the components of RMIDP supported the enhancement of the institutional
development and performance of the Ministry of Finance, MDF, LSGs, and utilities in carrying out
programs for the development of capacity to discharge public services functions with economy and
efficiency.

44. The Project informed important key policy and sector reforms through technical assistance
and studies that were conducted in close cooperation with MDF (see Annex 2), and thus
contributed to increasing its capacity but also to strengthen the basis, and thus the sustainability, of
investments. Specific technical and analytical contributions under RMIDP include: (i) preparation
of a National Wastewater Management Strategy; (ii) preparation of strategic development plans for
sustainable cities in 3 municipalities; (iii) design of a Road Design Guidelines Manual; (iv)
development and installation of Budgetary and Financial Management System (BFMS) for the
Municipalities and Ministry of Finance, with staff trained in all the 69 municipalities in 2009; (v)
preparation of Georgia Wastewater Management Strategy (WWMS) & Feasibility Studies for Six
Selected Cities and Towns. Adoption of such a strategy enabled the World Bank to leverage a
Programmatic SIDA grant in the amount of US$10 million, signed in December, 2012; (vi)
preparation of an Urban and Inter-Village Roads Design Guidelines Manual; (vii) preparation of
Tbilisi Bridge Feasibility Study and Design, to connect two growing districts in Tbilisi over the
river; and (vii) collection and analysis of Baseline Data and Outcome Indicators of Roads, Water
Supply and Wastewater Subprojects.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

45. The Project had additional, positive impacts that were not explicitly spelled out in the PDO or
project design, but nonetheless closely linked to its activities. These include:

(i)    Jobs creation. As a result of the works related to infrastructure and housing rehabilitation
       under the Project, approximately 12,000 temporary jobs were created in the targeted regions.

(ii)   SME creation. The Beneficiary Survey conducted as part of the ICR, indicates that improved
       access to services and better infrastructure provided through the sub-projects, in some cases
       may have facilitated the start-up of small and micro enterprises (SMEs) (see Section 3.6).
       The business interviews conducted in the sample project cities indicate that 19% to 25% of
       businesses in the sample neighborhoods opened in the location where no business operated
       previous to the sub-project implementation. The extent to which businesses saw
       infrastructure projects as contributing to the growth of their enterprise varied by the city.
       While in some cases the rehabilitation projects took place in central areas where businesses
       would have likely been set up regardless, of the infrastructure improvements, even in such
       cases the interviewed owners noted the importance of infrastructure for the continued
       successful operation of their business. In other cases, such as the road rehabilitation in
       Kobuleti, a popular Black Sea resort area in Ajara, over 60% of respondents said that the
       project road helped them to expand (or start) their business.

3.6. Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops
(optional for Core ICR, required for ILI, details in annexes)

46. A Beneficiary Survey was conducted as part of the ICR, to assess how infrastructure
rehabilitation projects financed under RMIDP improved the lives of project beneficiaries
(households and businesses) along several dimensions (see Annex 5):

  Households report significant improvements in the state of the project roads across all the
   cities in the sample. Beneficiaries reported significant time savings to reach key destinations,
   such as work, schools, and hospitals, a decrease in vehicle operating costs, reduction in storm
   water floods. Perceptions related to road safety accessibility for the disabled are less positive.

  Business interviews conducted in the project cities found that in most cases more than half of
   the businesses were new in the area. Although precise data is not available for all cities, it is
   estimated that 19-25% of businesses in the beneficiary neighborhoods were completely new (i.e.
   they opened in the location where no business operated previously). The extent to which
   businesses saw infrastructure projects as contributing to the growth of their enterprise varied by
   the city.

  The level of satisfaction with the water services is mixed. Satisfaction with the water pressure,
   for example, is the lowest in Gori, while the residents of Khashuri are most unsatisfied with
   water service hours. The main problem in most cities is that while the municipal water system
   has been rehabilitated, the water pipes leading to private houses and apartments are in very bad
   condition. Therefore, the residents cannot fully reap the benefits of the water system
   rehabilitation.




4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
          
47. The risk to development outcome is rated as Moderate.

48. The development outcome of RMIDP was achieved and maintained, both with respect to
efficiency and effectiveness of selected municipal services, as well as with respect to providing
IDPs with key infrastructure and housing. The latter was achieved in the aftermath of the 2008
conflict, with subsequent adjustments to housing quality, and sustained to date, as most IDPs
continue to live in RMIDP-financed housing. Operation and maintenance of the sub-projects
remains the responsibility of municipalities. Sufficient funding has been, and continues to be
allocated for these purposes.

49. Improved income and fiscal discipline of LSGs. LSGs’ income increased from GEL 400
million in 2003 to GEL 900 million in 2008, and is expected to reach GEL 1.6 billion in 2015.
Improved measures of intergovernmental fiscal relations and oversight improved fiscal discipline.
LSGs defaults and arrears to MDF declined from 22% in 2003 to zero by Project closing, indicating
strong fiscal discipline by LSGs and good loan portfolio management by MDF.

   5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
   (Relating to design, implementation and outcome issues)

   5.1. Bank Performance

          (a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
              (i.e., performance through lending phase)

   50. Bank Performance in ensuring quality at entry is rated Satisfactory. The assessment is based
   on the following:

   (i)     The Bank took the lead in coordinating the design and preparation of a Joint World Bank-
           UN Needs Assessment (JNA) of damage, including to municipal services and
           infrastructure, which was critical in informing Project design and priorities. The
           Assessment was presented at a Donors Conference in Brussels in October, 2009 during which
           some US$4 billion was pledged for Georgia’s support. Based on the JNA, the Government
           requested an increase in IDA funding allocation for the RMIDP by US$10 million, to fund
           the Emergency component for IDP housing construction. The full- pledged amounts were
           provided by IFIs and donors and were fully disbursed by the end of 2012.

   (ii)    Project was ready to be appraised right before the 2008 conflict arose. The Bank exercised
           flexibility in project preparation and provided a fast response to the post-conflict
           emergency. The Bank quickly adjusted the concept and design of the Project, in response to
           the post- 2008 conflict and Government request for support. The original PDO proposed at
           the Project Concept stage, in December, 2007, envisaged the improvement in the efficiency
           and reliability of selected municipal services, and building the capacity of local governments
           to provide sustainable services. Although overall preparation took 10 months, it was adjusted
           and finalized quickly, following the August 2008 conflict. The Bank’s Operational Policy
           (OP) 8.0, Rapid Response to Crisis and Emergencies was triggered, to expedite the project’s

                                                     22
         response through a faster preparation and approval track. A component to address the IDP
         housing and infrastructure rehabilitation emergency was added, and the PDO was adjusted
         accordingly.

(iii) The Bank proactively engaged with other partners, thus maximizing the respective value-
      added and funding capacities. The Project was designed in close cooperation with other
      donors active in Georgia, including the US-funded MCC, the ADB, EBRD, USAID, GTZ,
      KfW, UNHCR, and the Cities Alliance Program. These donors provided parallel technical
      assistance and capacity building or financing of municipal infrastructure investment projects.

(iv)     The Project Development Objective (PDO) was clear and measurable. The PDO consisted
         of two parts. The first, related to the improvement in the efficiency and reliability of selected
         municipal infrastructure and services, and the second, targeted to restoring the infrastructure,
         services, and housing conditions of conflict-affected people. The PDO, in hindsight, could
         have included a portion on institutional capacity, which remained an important aspect of the
         project. While this was not the case, this dimension of the Project was adequately monitored,
         also through specific indicators in the Results Framework.

(v)      In retrospect, gender aspects should have been better captured at the design stage.
         Although at the time of Project design there was no corporate mandate requiring operations
         to be fully gender-informed, this was an operation that would have benefitted from more
         gender informedness, starting with an assessment of gender-specific issues in the area of
         municipal services and infrastructure access and quality, as well as within the conflict-
         affected IDPs. Gender data disaggregation was also not part of the Project design and, while
         a core indicator about the number of female beneficiaries was added at the time of the 2010
         AF and restructuring, no further gender-disaggregated data or analysis was provided at the
         sub-project level or as part of the emergency response component.




       (b) Quality of Supervision
           (including of fiduciary and safeguards policies)

51. Quality of supervision is rated Satisfactory.

(i)      The Bank promptly identified and addressed IDP housing quality issues, resulting in part
         from the fast preparation and implementation of the emergency response nature of the
         Project. IDPs moved into the new housing units through an organized and transparent
         process, which kept to the extent possible families coming from the same home origin
         together in the same settlement, while houses were distributed through a public lottery were
         managed by Ministry of Refugees. This was an outstanding achievement by the Government
         and MDF in a very short period of time.

(ii)     The Bank identified and proactively addressed issues related to sub-projects quality and
         supervision, resulting in the adoption of road and infrastructure guidelines by MDF.
         MDF’s interventions in the road rehabilitation sub-projects were initially limited to paving,
         and did not include other important aspects, such as sidewalks and water drainage. The Bank
         highlighted this issue, and asked that all road sub-project designs be reviewed by a Road

                                                    23
      Specialist, so as to ensure a more holistic approach. This ultimately resulted in the
      development, by the Bank, of road and infrastructure guidelines, which are still applied by
      MDF.

(iii) Environmental performance was rated fully Satisfactory for most of the project life. It
      slipped to Moderately Satisfactory only during 2010. At this relatively early stage of project
      implementation, the quality of environmental supervision of works and record keeping on
      the undertaken monitoring work carried deficiencies: field presence of MDF staff was not
      sufficient at higher risk work sites due to lack of differentiated approach to various risk
      categories; and monitoring records lacked information on what corrective actions had been
      prescribed to address identified issues and if and how these issues were address later on.
      Also, all environmental work was being performed by engineers, who had no professional
      education and/or training in environmental management. However due to small to medium
      scale of works and generally low risk of the financed activities, no tangible environmental
      damage resulted from the project implementation neither during 2010, not later on when
      environmental performance rebound to Satisfactory rating.

 (iv) The frequency of progress reporting was generally regular, with few exceptions, and
      adequately addressed key issues and planned actions. Implementation Status and Results
      Reports (ISR) were generally filed on a regular basis, every 6-7 months. However, the first
      ISR was not filed until eight months after approval, and a one-year gap in reporting took
      place between January 2011 and December 2011. Issues related to M&E reporting in the
      ISRs were highlighted in Section 2.3.

(v) Close engagement with beneficiaries used to improve responsiveness and quality of sub-
    projects. Visits to construction sites and interaction with beneficiaries in mid-2010 revealed
    some delays or low quality in some sub-projects, which were subsequently remedied. In some
    cases. Similarly, the first Implementation Status and Results Report (ISR) from June, 2009,
    noted issues related to housing quality.

(vi) The team, almost entirely based in Georgia, was well-rounded and included relevant
     expertise. Specifically, the TTL, Safeguards Specialist, Procurement Specialist and Financial
     Management Specialist were based in Tbilisi or Armenia. In addition, the Project TTL, the
     same one as for MDDPII and MCC, never changed, resulting in deep knowledge of the
     Georgian context, operation subtleties in Georgia and the client.


(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

52. Based on the satisfactory ratings for Quality at Entry and Supervision, overall Bank
performance is rated Satisfactory.

5.2. Borrower Performance

    (a) Government Performance

53. The Ministry of Finance (MOF) performance is rated Satisfactory. This assessment is based
on the fact that, while the overall, aggregate allocation of funds to municipalities has increased
significantly over the years (from an average of GEL107K between 2001 and 2007, to an average
of GEL1.005 million since 2008), these allocations are the result of decisions that run counter to


                                                24
the decentralization and fiscally responsible model advocated under RMIDP. While, prior to 2008,
LSGs kept 50 percent of their municipalities’ personal income and corporate income tax at the local
level, MOF’s decision, in 2008, to centralize all revenues was, de facto, a significant setback for
decentralization and for a sustainable, fiscally responsible model, such as the one being supported
under RMIDP. As a result, the aggregate amount of funds available to municipalities increased,
whereby all municipalities were required to return 100 percent of their tax revenues to the central
Government. These were returned, in the form of transfers, resulting in increased equalization, with
increased contributions from best-performing municipalities in terms of tax revenues.

54. The Government, through the MDF, MOF and the United Water Supply Company, put in
place a very effective donor coordination, which has allowed the Bank to maximize its value-
added under the RMIDP engagement vis-à-vis other donors, and to make good use of TF resources.
Specifically, all municipal infrastructure projects have been and continue to be well coordinated,
with no duplication.

    (b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

55. The Performance of the Implementing Agency is rated Satisfactory. The assessment is based
on: (i) MDF’s completion, in four months and under very difficult circumstances, the construction
of eight IDP settlements under the Project and provided them with basic infrastructure (financed
by the EC under budget support). IDPs moved into the new housing units through an organized and
transparent process, which kept to the extent possible families coming from the same home origin
together in the same settlement, while houses were distributed through a public lottery managed by
Ministry of Refugees. Displaced families moved from cold tents and collective centers to individual
houses through a transparent and fair house allocation process that kept, to the extent possible, all
families that came from the same village together. Specifically, for each of the new IDP
settlements, all names of eligible families were put in a pot and a public lottery managed by the
Ministry of Refugees was attended by all families to see which house in the settlements they would
be assigned to. IDPs appreciated such a transparent house allocation process and there were no
complaints, unlike many other emergency response operations, where this is a common issue.

56. MDF’s leading role in the preparation and implementation of all sub-projects under
Component 1, and IDP infrastructure reconstruction efforts under Component 2. all Project
components were carried out satisfactorily and on a timely basis; (iii) MDF’s institutional
reorganization, aimed at ensuring that the MDF is financially sustainable and that it is strategic in
the activities it undertakes (see Annex 10). MDF underwent an institutional reorganization at the
end of 2010. A credit management officer and a risk management officer, were created to
strengthen MDF’s credit management responsibility as a non-bank financial intermediary. To
support the latter, a new unit was created to develop stronger partnership with municipalities; (iv)
MDF’s role in assessing municipal creditworthiness of municipalities, providing financing through
grant or credit mechanisms, depending on the LSGs creditworthiness, and increasing municipal
capacity in the identification and implementation of municipal services.


    (c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

Based on the evidence and ratings provided above, overall Borrower performance is rated
Satisfactory.




                                                 25
6. Lessons Learned
(both project-specific and of wide general application)

General Lessons:

(i) Emergency response operations require balancing and trading off between speed in
response, cost of interventions, and quality of interventions. RMIDP had a record setting on speed
and costs. Some quality issues, related to walls insulation and drainage, appeared later. These were
promptly and proactively addressed through the EC TF.

(ii) The use of retroactive financing can make a significant difference in ensuring readiness
for implementation. For both the original IDA credit and the Additional Financing, the use of
retroactive financing proved critical in ensuring a fast implementation start. The use of this
approach can be especially beneficial for, but not limited to, operations needing to respond quickly
to needs on the ground.

(iii) The integration of Citizen Engagement mechanisms at the sector and project levels can
strengthen the effectiveness of key municipal services by: (i) improving information flows
between service providers and citizens; (ii) introducing communication channels that would
facilitate citizen feedback. The follow-up RMIDP II could serve as a pilot for the integration of CE
mechanisms into key municipal services, notably water and sanitation, and local roads.14

(iv) M&E reporting needs to remain a key feature of project implementation. In the case of
RMIDP, M&E was being monitored in a timely basis, but data reporting through ISRs presented
weaknesses related to data, but also consistency of the results framework with the latest
restructuring. While in this specific case these misalignments and aspects related to data did not
have an impact on the realism of performance rating, because the actual data were equally positive,
in other instances the impact could be significant, leading to a potential discrepancy between
performance perception and reality, and thus to a missed opportunity to implement remedial actions
on a timely basis.

(v) Project series, such as MDDP and RMIDP, should be used to support longer-term agendas,
with a view to also strengthening institutional capacity. Given the number of operations in the
series, and their interconnection and building on each other’s achievements and lessons, these
approaches provide a unique opportunity to advance longer-term agendas, and to strengthen
institutional capacity through phased approaches. RMIDP is a strong example of this, having
benefitted largely from its predecessors MDDP I and II, and having provided important lessons that
fed directly into the design of RMIDP II.

Project-specific Lessons:


(i) Providing credits to creditworthy LSGs with reasonable credit capacity and grants (with
20% local contribution) to small municipalities with no credit capacity proved to be the right
approach. The project succeeded in enhancing the credit culture in Georgia, by instituting market-

                                                    26
like borrowing practices for large municipalities, while ensuring that smaller ones were also
included. Both MDF and LSGs were successful in managing the credit portfolio. When there was
one case of long arrears by a city (Telavi), the Ministry of Finance did not intervene through a bail-
out, to reinforce the point that municipalities need to learn how to function in a market borrowing
environment. Instead, the city had to restore its arrears to MDF and pay the penalty amount as per
the Operational Manual guidelines and signed Subproject Loan Agreement between the city and
MDF. Taking serious actions against defaulters or municipalities with arrears promoted the
principle that fiscal indiscipline is not tolerated. As for smaller municipalities, they only receive
grants from MDF under the follow-up RMIDP II if they pass certain reforms under the
performance-linked grant system.

(ii) Importance of ensuring that investments take place within a strategic vision that is in place.
While it is common practice to construct WWTPs in several countries without having first a
wastewater management strategy design and adopted, the case of Georgia showed the benefits of
having a strategy in place first. The strategy not only introduced more cost-effective technology
options, but also encouraged donor organizations, such as SIDA, to commit resources and invest in
the sector.

(iii) Importance of setting up a transparent and fair system for housing allocation of affected
beneficiaries. IDPs are highly vulnerable. It was a very considerate step by the Government to
keep families coming from the same home origin together in order to maintain their social
networking and solidarity. Distribution of houses among IDPs during a lottery attended by all
benefices was a critical aspect of this process, which strengthened beneficiaries’ trust in the system,
and allowed a smooth process, with no complaints related to lack of transparency in housing
allocations.

Annex 2. Outputs by Component
Component 1: Infrastructure Investment

1. Under Component 1, the MDF has implemented 141 water, wastewater, road and other
municipal infrastructure sub-projects throughout Georgia (see Figure A). The Project and the AF
have contributed significantly in addressing the backlog of municipal capital investment
requirements including construction of 245 kms of roads and improving access of approximately
400,000 people to water. The Project has also created approximately 12,000 temporary jobs

Component 3: Institutional Development

3. The Component assisted the Government in the following:

 Development and Installation of Budgetary and Financial Management System (BFMS)
  for the Municipalities and Ministry of Finance, with staff trained in all the 69 municipalities
  in 2009. The budget SW implemented in 2007 was only an extremely simple “expenditure”
  reporting tool. The new BFMS implemented in May 2009 onward was a step to a good direction.
  It covered the full budget (revenues and expenditures), it complies with the GFS2001 budget
  classification; and it was a customer’s friendly software (SW).

 Preparation and adoption, by a Cabinet decree in 2014, of Georgia Wastewater
  Management Strategy (WWMS) & Feasibility Studies for Six Selected Cities and Towns”.
  Such a national strategy provided LSGs and Unite Water Company with cost-effective modern

                                                    30
   technology design options of wastewater treatment plants based on population, type of receiving
   water body and required affluent standards. Adoption of such a strategy enabled the World
   Bank to leverage a Programmatic SIDA grant in the amount of US$10 million (the Grant
   Agreement was signed by end of December 2012). The objective of this Trust Fund is to
   promote sustainable wastewater management in Georgia and pilot implementation of
   wastewater treatment plants, aligned with World Bank safeguards policies and in harmonization
   with the EU legislation. The Trust Fund encompasses environmental, social and economic
   components and will focus on an integrated approach to improved wastewater management.
   The Trust Fund will, together with interventions by the Government of Georgia, municipalities
   in Georgia, bilateral donors and international financing institutions, contribute to an overall
   improvement of the efficiency of the Water and Wastewater Sector.

 Preparation of an Urban and Inter-Village Roads Design Guidelines Manual, to be used by
  the Ministry of Regional Development, the Roads Department, and road design companies,
  contractors and municipalities. Typical problems with local roads designs prior to preparing and
  adopting this manual included the following deficiencies: Lack of holistic approach to
  improving overall street conditions within the street right of way; Deficient sidewalk designs,
  especially a lack of ramps at street crossing and driveways; Poor drainage solutions; Costly and
  deficient curb and gutter solutions; and Street widths not appropriate for traffic conditions (either
  two wide or too narrow). The Road Design Guidelines Manual provided an integrated approach
  to improving overall streets, sidewalks, drainage, and traffic conditions. It also provided
  guidelines on pavement thickness based on traffic count to avoid several cases of over-design,
  and thus waste of scarce financial resources.

 Preparation of Tbilisi Bridge Feasibility Study and Design, to connect two growing districts
  in Tbilisi over the river. The bridge also intends to resolve a major traffic bottle neck in Tbilisi.
  The design of the bridge is currently under ADB consideration for financing as part of a large
  urban transport and traffic management project for the city.

 Collection and analysis of Baseline Data and Outcome Indicators of Roads, Water Supply
  and Wastewater Subprojects by an international consulting. A report was prepared, consisting
  of three volumes. The first volume contains the main discussion with five parts: i) Project
  Background; ii) Methodology; iii) Profile of Subprojects; iv) Presentation and Analysis of
  Baseline and Outcome Indicators; v) Some Conclusions and Recommendations. The second
  volume refers to Annexes with 2 parts which present all relevant tabulations, figures and
  references supporting the Main Report. The third volume presents the photographs taken before,
  during and after project implementation. An Executive Summary Report was also produced for
  readers to rapidly become acquainted with the voluminous final document presenting all the
  data and analysis of subprojects, without having to read it all. It contains a brief background
  information and statement of issues/findings; concise analysis, conclusion and proposed
  recommendations presented the major document(s).

 Preparation of strategic development plans for sustainable cities in 3 municipalities, to
  enable citizen in these cities to come up with a shared vision for their cities development
  priorities. The Cities Alliance has also provided a grant to prepare Tbilisi’s strategic
  development plan, which was implemented by MDF and administered by the World Bank.
  These four cases provided good showcases to all other large and small cities in Georgia. This
  activity is currently being scaled up to all cities in Georgia under the RMIDPII.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis
(including assumptions in the analysis)

1. This Economic and Financial Analysis reviews the assessment study results for the road, water,
sewage and complex infrastructure rehabilitation sub-projects completed in several Georgian cities
and municipalities financed by the World Bank Regional and Municipal Infrastructure
Development Project (RMIDP) and Additional Financing Regional and Municipal Infrastructure
Development Project (RMIDP-AF). The type and size of the subprojects financed under the
Regional and Municipal Infrastructure Development Project (RMIDP) and Additional Financing
Regional and Municipal Infrastructure Development Project (RMIDP-AF) were not known a priori
based on the demand driven nature of the whole investment pipeline. The Operation Manual
required a financial and economic analysis to be performed as part of the process for each
subproject’s preparation and appraisal. Since 141 projects have been completed under RMIDP and
RMIDP-AF, a representative sample of the most important subprojects in terms of investment costs
covering all sectors has been selected for a detailed post economic analysis. All the projects
reviewed in this ICR were implemented from 2009-2011. Wherever feasible, the results of the
economic analysis carried out in the pre-project’s feasibility study has been compared to the post
project’s economic analysis results for the purpose of this Implementation Completion Report
(ICR) analysis.

        A. Road Subprojects

2. Road rehabilitation subprojects were implemented under the Regional and Municipal
Infrastructure Development Project (RMIDP) and Additional Financing Regional and Municipal
Infrastructure Development Project (RMIDP-AF) in the municipalities and cities of Georgia.
Economic analysis was conducted as a part of the feasibility study for each sub-project based on
the requirements of the Operation Manual for the RMIDP and RMIDP-AF. During project appraisal
for the road subprojects, the savings in vehicle operating cost (VOC) and reduction in travel time
were used as the main economic benefits. Operation and maintenance costs of the roads were
counted as the sum of capital cost and recurrent maintenance costs.

3. The economic analysis in this ICR was done on eight projects based on their initial investment
costs and outcomes. Among eight road rehabilitation subprojects, four of them were implemented
in City Rustavi (4), one in City Zestaphoni (1), one in city Khashuri (1), one in city Gori (1) and
one in the municipality of Kobuleti (1). Since some benefits were not counted in the pre-project
economic analysis, some of the key assumptions of this economic analysis, as well as modifications
to the original feasibility studies, include:

       The Economic Internal Rate of Return (EIRR) and NPV of subprojects are assessed over a
        15 year period, at the discount rate of 7 % (Instead of the 12 % discount rate that was used
        in the initial economic analysis. A 7% discount rate was used according to the WB
        guidelines and available data for Georgian financial markets (Average deposit rate of
        Georgian commercial banks, National Bank of Georgia, Monetary and Financial Statistics,
        Bulletin, 2015);
       Feasibility studies assumed a “do-nothing” scenario as the baseline. In the ICR, a “do
        minimum” scenario, including the testing robustness of initially expected benefits was
        done;



                                                33
       Since an ex-ante traffic survey was done in some cases, ex-post traffic survey results were
        compared in the case of only several projects. Traffic growth, however is assumed at 2 %
        per year, given the rate of economic growth for 2015 year, although higher traffic growth
        rates were used in earlier feasibility studies. Such an approach makes benefit calculations
        more realistic;
       Benefit streams comprise estimated savings in motor vehicle operating costs, travel time
        and maintenance cost at the price of earlier and post feasibility studies. Survey data
        collected in 2015 enabled a realistic approach to calculating the following benefits: VOC
        Reduction, O&M Cost Reduction, Time Saved and Value of Saved Time.

4. For the calculation of Net Present Value (NPV) of the project, alternative capital costs are based
on current market prices and are expressed in GEL/USD. Operations and Maintenance costs are
expressed in GEL/USD as well. The Current USD/GEL exchange rate of 2.27 is used for this
analysis.

5. Payments of taxes were excluded from the financial costs as tax payments represent just
transfer of funds from the point of view of the country. Following tax rates has been used: National
income tax rate of 20% and VAT of 18%. Economic costs were converted from financial costs
based on: (i) shadow exchange rate factor (SERF) of 1.0 as all inputs are acquired from the local
market. (ii) Shadow wage rate conversion factor (SWRF) of 0.8 for unskilled labor.

6. The calculation of benefits from these subprojects is rather conservative, since benefits such
as increased public health and productivity costs, communication improvements, reduced traffic
nuisance, and positive social impact, specifically the increased income due to the employment of
workers during the project implementation, and the decreased risk of accidents and /or injury of
pedestrians and of vehicles and other kind of benefits were not considered.

7. The subprojects in Kobuleti and in Gori generated reasonable NPVs, with EIRRs above 22%.
All subprojects have a cost benefit ratio (CBR) of more than 4. The Subproject in Gori yielded an
EIRR of 29.43 % and the CBR is 6.4. As for Kobuleti, the NPV is 3,352,160 USD, with a CBR
equal to 5 and an EIRR equal to 2226 %. Should Georgia continue to enjoy a higher rate of
economic growth and increased rates of car ownership compared to the rate that is used in this
analysis, the cost effectiveness figures would be higher and more beneficiaries will directly benefit
from improved road conditions.

8. A risk-sensitivity analysis was conducted to test the impact of variations in key parameters for
the entire road network. The economic viability was tested, modifying by -20% and +20% the
value of the traffic volume.

9. A sensitivity analysis shows that all subprojects yielded EIRRs above 12 % even when twenty
percent lower traffic levels are assumed. Investment costs per cubic meter of the rehabilitated roads
compare favourably against international standards.

       B. Water Supply and Sewerage System Rehabilitation Subprojects

10. Number of regional infrastructure service rehabilitation subprojects were financed by
RMIDP and RMIDP AF. The following water supply rehabilitation subprojects were
chosen to be included in this ICR and were carried out in the following municipalities:
    1. Khashuri City (Shida Kartli Region) Water Supply System Rehabilitation Sub-
       Project – July 2009;
    2. Khashuri City Water Supply System Rehabilitation Sub-Project (Shida Kartli
       Region)- April 2010;
    3. Kvaliti District Water and Sewerage System Rehabilitation in Zestaphoni –
       August 2009;
    4. Gori City Combinat Community Water Supply System Rehabilitation - June
       2009.

11. These municipalities are small and medium size towns, with varying levels of infrastructure
development before the RMIDP project started. The subprojects have been chosen according to the
size of the initial investment costs and their importance from a social perspective. No ex ante cost-
benefit analysis was done to allow for any comparison to the actual outcomes related to project
completion.

12. The Investment costs are distributed in the following way:

13. Subprojects have been evaluated according to different contexts. The financial and economic
analysis was carried out for each sub-project individually for the respective municipalities, while
all these subprojects have been evaluated jointly in the context of the overall RMIDP/RMIDP AF
framework. This allows for review of of not only the individual performance of the subprojects,
but also review of the overall effectiveness of the whole project in a W&WW context.


    (i) Khashuri City Water Supply System Rehabilitation Subprojects
14. Two different water supply rehabilitation systems were completed in Khashuri during 200910,
in different areas of the municipality. The targeted population was16, 500 people including Osiauri
village. The distinctive feature of this region is that 58% of the targeted households still do not have
piped water. For those having water service, water supply does not exceed 6 hours a day.
Alternative water sources like fetching water from the wells and water tanks are still very common
in Khashuri municipality.

                                                  36
15. In the Khashuri municipality subproject, 58% of the population does not currently have piped
water, which automatically is excluded from the analysis. Accordingly, the baseline indicator is not
having piped water at all while the sub-project introduced the limited water supply service in the
municipality. It should be noted that no water meters are used in Khashuri municipality, so it is not
possible to develop a precise financial revenue projection.

Economic and Financial Analysis

16. The economic analysis is based in the survey undertaken in Khashuri municipality. In-depth
interviews and observations of local communities and LSG made it possible to assess how local
households have benefited from the water supply system rehabilitation. Project investment cost was
approximately 2,560,000 GEL with a lifetime of 25 years. The following benefits were identified:
     Reduction in coping costs from fetching water from wells and water tanks;

       Time savings, and the value of the saved time;
       Reduction in health care costs from diarrheal disease.
       Reduction in DALYs –Disability Adjusted Life Years
17. Baseline and data projections on benefits make use of the survey results, the data from the
World Bank projections on the Georgian population, the World Health organization country profile
data statistics, and data from the National Statistics office of Georgia.
    Projections in financial and economic analysis have been done for a 25 year period.

       Tariffs are projected to grow by 2% which is based on the extrapolation method from the
        previous 5 years.

       It should be noted that the price elasticity of demand on the water service is assumed to be
        inelastic as water service functioned in a limited manner. Therefore, water demand will
        increase over time with the projected growth rate of water tariffs.

       The main performance indicators are EIRR, and NPV evaluated over a 25 year period, at
        the discount rate of 7%.

18. A Sensitivity Analysis shows how the variation in critical variables impacts the performance
of the water supply project in Khashuri. Variations based on the benefit factor, key critical variables
and discount rates for NPV and IRR are shown below:

    (ii) Kvaliti District Water and Sewerage System Rehabilitation in Zestaphoni

19. The Kvaliti district water and sewerage system rehabilitation subproject was carried out in
2010. The district is connected with Zestaphoni municipal center with a population of 3000. This
SP was financed under the RMIDP w1. Framework and the investment cost was approximately
357 810 GEL.

20. Prior to this subproject completion, 100 % of the Kvaliti population had piped water less than
6 hours per day. Following subproject completion, about 55 % of the targeted population now has
an improved water supply system with up to 12 hours daily access to water. It should be noted that
almost the whole population of Kvaliti and it building units are equipped with water meters.
The difference in baseline scenarios between Khashuri and Zestaphoni SPs means that the Kvaliti
population is in a relatively advantageous situation compare to the Khashuri population.
Furthermore, introducing water meters makes the Kvaliti SP more financially sustainable than the
Khashuri municipality. However, the same overall benefits have been identified in the Kvaliti SP
as in Khashuri SP:

       Reduction in coping costs from fetching water from wells and water tanks;


                                               38
       Time savings, and the value of the saved time;
       Reduction in health care costs from diarrheal disease.
       Reduction in DALYs –Disability Adjusted Life Years
21. In the baseline scenario, the Kvaliti population had piped water with a 6 hour water supply each
day. By the subproject completion, the average local household had an average of 31 % increase in
its water supply service in the targeted region.

Economic and Financial Analysis

22. Baseline and data projections on benefits rely on the survey results, the data from the World
Bank projections on the Georgian population, and the National Statistics Office. The following
table shows the performance rate of the SP in Kvaliti district.

23. The methodological assumptions in this data analysis are as follows:
     For the analysis of the Kvaliti population, the projection is based on the population
       growth projection provided by the World Bank.
       Water tanks widely adopted in Kvaliti district, are the main complementary water source
        for the local communities during the hours of water supply shortages.
       Service tariffs will grow at a stable rate over the project lifetime.
       The tariff and GDP growth rates are calculated based on the extrapolation method.
       The health hazard and risk of Diarrhea as the main water borne disease is controlled. .
        According to data from the Ministry of Health in Georgia in 2015, the treatment cost of
        diarrhea is 200 GEL.

   (iii) Gori City Combinat Community Water Supply System Rehabilitation SP
25. The water supply subproject in the Gori municipality was carried out in 2009 and financed by
the RMIDP. The initial capital cost was approximately 1,255,600 GEL with a targeted population
of 11,754. Before the project started, the entire community had piped water with limited access.
The rehabilitation project of the water supply system increased their access to water and water
supply to 24 hours a day.

    (iv) General Performance of Water Supply and Sewerage Rehabilitation Projects

26. The total capital cost of the recently analyzed water supply and sewerage system rehabilitation
projects in the various municipalities of Georgia supported by RMIDP and RMIDP AF amounted
to 4 573 327 GEL in 2009 prices and the overall performance of the project is given in the table
below.

          C. Tourism Development Subprojects

27. Under the framework of the World Bank Regional and Municipal Infrastructure Development
Project (RMIDP) and Additional Financing Regional and Municipal Infrastructure Development
Project (RMIDP-AF) 117 sub-projects (road, water/sanitation) were financed which improved local
infrastructure and conditions for tourism in local municipalities countrywide. The most significant
subproject was the Sairme infrastructure rehabilitation and it is included in this ICR based on the
initial investment costs and the final outcomes. The following benefits were assumed in the pre-
project economic analysis for the Sairme infrastructure rehabilitation:
      Improvement of communication infrastructure
      Improvement of traffic conditions and creation of safe traffic flow
      Reduction of noise and vibration from road traffic
      Decreased air pollution through reduced emissions

28. Due to lack of pre project economic analysis, it was not possible to compare pre economic and
post-economic analysis for the purpose of ICR, therefore new benefits were identified for post CBA
analysis, and these tend to be more closely related to Tourism used for pre economic analysis.




    (i)       Sairme Project


                                                 41
29. The Sairme infrastructure rehabilitation subproject was carried out in 2011, to improve the
standards of living of locals and the conditions for visiting tourists. The total project cost was
5,011,509.77 GEL. The health spa resort “Sairme” is located in Imereti, and administratively
belongs to the Bagdati municipality. This health spa resort has a unique location and healing
springs, located in a beautiful natural setting with an ecologically clean environment. After the
subproject completion, a solid foundation for a local tourism sector was created.

30. The project envisaged rehabilitation of the “Sairme” resort under the RMIDP project. In
particular, the following infrastructure rehabilitation projects were completed:

 1. Rehabilitation of the park
2. Water supply improvement project (water purification station, chlorination and reservoir)
3. Sewage project – A separate sewage system was constructed with sewage pipes which go along
the river and do not touch the ground thereby minimizing the risk of sewage leakage.
4. Road project – which was built to by-pass the road, up to 8km, next to the hotel, so that the
environmental damage to the hotel was minimized. Before the road was built local shepherds were
used the hotel’s property to move their animals up to higher pastures.
Private investment was attracted as a result of these infrastructure improvements and a new hotel
“Sairme” was built. The hotel has 150 rooms to accommodate as many as 390 guests.

Economic and Financial Analysis

31. Post economic and financial analysis was conducted for this subproject and the. The following
benefits were identified:

1. Increased employment and the value of increased wages received by the “Sairme” hotel staff;
2. Increased sales by local business and its additional income.

32. Wherever possible, the original assumptions and data used in the feasibility studies were
employed. However, since some key assumptions were not included in the feasibility studies,
default values were employed from other similar bank funded projects. Some of the key
assumptions, as well as modifications made to the original feasibility studies, include:
     EIRR and NPV are assessed over a 20 year period, at the discount rate of 7%
     In order to calculate benefit N1 (Increased employment and the value of wages received),
        an estimated job creation and average salary paid by the hotel “Sairme” were used.
        Furthermore, average daily spending with businesses and locals and the number of tourist
        arrivals per month (based on yearly average) were calculated in order to determine the
        second benefit of increased sales by local business and additional income generated.
     A GDP growth rate of 2% for the coming years was used in the analysis, (IMF and National
        Statistics Office of Georgia5 projections).
     The average of 5% (based on the information provided by the Georgian National Tourism
        Administration) yearly increase in the number of tourist arrivals has been used in order to
        conduct economic analysis.
     Risk-Sensitivity Analysis was conducted to analyze the impact of variation of the key
        parameters on the results of the analysis for this subproject. The economic viability was
        tested, modifying by -20% and +20% the value of number of tourist arrivals in the country.

Annex 5. Beneficiary Survey Results

1. A Beneficiary Assessment study was conducted as part of the ICR. The study is based on
beneficiary surveys administered by ISET-PI in the RMIDP project cities. The surveys consist of
three parts: the quantitative household survey; in-depth interviews with local businesses; as well as
the in-depth interviews with municipal government representatives.

Sample coverage and methodology

2. The sub-projects selected for the assessment were carried out in 6 municipal towns: Zestaponi,
Sairme (Imereti region), Khashuri, Gori (Shida Kartli), Rustavi (Kvemo Kartli) and Kobuleti
(Adjara). In all of these towns at least two of the three types of infrastructure interventions were
performed under RMIDP. These are small and medium size towns, with varying levels of
infrastructure development before the RMIDP started.

3. The methodology focused on two main instruments: quantitative surveys (via in-person
interviews with residents of the impacted areas), as well as structured, in-depth interviews with
local businesses and LSG officials15. The aim of this approach was to assess the economic and
social impact of interventions in a way that is both rigorous (e.g. quantifying the reduction in travel
time, vehicle operating costs, coping costs, number of new businesses created etc.), and informative
(e.g. assessing the sustainability of investment in infrastructure; various aspects of business and job
creation in the impacted areas – best practices as well as bottlenecks; satisfaction with access to
and quality of services, etc).

4. Since the baseline did not exist for many of the indicators in the analysis, the surveys/interviews
asked respondents to compare their current status with the baseline (their situation at the time the
sub-projects started). Since many sub-projects were completed 4-7 years ago, the degree of
recollection could have been a challenge. However, the pilot survey showed that the respondents
were generally able to recall well the state of the infrastructure before and after the implementation.
Thus, no additional data collection (e.g. comparing impacted vs. non-impacted areas) was needed.

   In designing the questionnaire, we were referring specifically to the beneficiary survey questionnaire
used for the MDDP (Municipal Development and Decentralization) II ICR and to Annex 8.3 of the ICR for
the list of relevant indicators and questions. Additional questions were added to reflect the specifics of the
RMIDP sub-projects.

2. Findings

Summary (all cities)

6. The survey questionnaires and structured interviews were designed to assess how infrastructure
rehabilitation projects improved the lives of project beneficiaries (households and businesses)
along several dimensions. The graphs below illustrate some of the findings.

Household surveys road projects

7. The largest perceived improvements were generated by road rehabilitation projects.

The overall condition of the road. Improvements and satisfaction with the quality of the
results.

8. The households overwhelmingly report significant improvements in the state of the project
roads across all the cities in the sample. The enthusiasm for the road projects is most palpable in
Rustavi, which, incidentally, is the city with the highest percentage car ownership in our sample,
and in Kobuleti, where the project road contributed significantly to the development of tourism
infrastructure.

Reduction in travel time to key destinations – time savings that are due to project road
rehabilitation.

10. Moreover, the new roads generated significant time savings for the households using the road
to reach key destinations: work, center city, school, hospital, etc.
On the graph below we can see the time saved per trip as reported by households. If we consider
that the cities in question are medium size, the time savings represent a significant share of the
overall time it takes people to get to key destinations.

12. The reasons for the decrease in travel time to key destinations varied by city, but the
overwhelming majority of the households are crediting smoother roads for the decrease in travel
time to key destinations. Wider roads and new traffic routes are also cited as some of the reasons.

14. Vehicle operations costs have either declined or remained the same in most of the cities in the
sample. On average, the household savings on the cost of tires are the highest (Graph 7).

15. One must note that the overall cost savings reported by households could be underestimated.
Given that several years have passed since the rehabilitation projects were completed, the decrease
in costs could be obscured by the inflation effect.

Road safety and reduction in accidents.

16. It must be noted that good roads and rehabilitated sidewalk could be instrumental in increasing
road safety. For example, on a smooth road the cars do not have to twist and turn to avoid potholes.
With rehabilitated sidewalks pedestrians are also safer – they do not need to walk on the street to
avoid water and mud. In both cases dangerous traffic situations are avoided.

17. In the same time, as indicated previously, better roads do increase car speeds quite significantly,
which could lead to an increase in accidents. The overall effect of better roads on traffic safety is
therefore ambiguous.

Chart 8. Change in the number of traffic accidents since road rehabilitation. Household
responses, % of interviewed households, by city.

18. Indeed, as we can see from the graph above, in household interviews most people tend to report
an overall increase in accidents (excepting Kobuleti). However, in the official data on accidents,
injuries and fatalities from all five cities we do not see a dramatic increase in accidents or fatalities.
In fact, we see a slight declining trend for the overall number of accidents; a decline in the number
of fatalities per accidents, and a very minor increase in the number of injuries per accident since
2008. Overall we see that the rehabilitated roads did not contribute to a perceptible increase in
traffic accidents in our sample of cities.

Reduction in storm water floods

19. The road rehabilitation clearly led to the reduction in storm water floods in most of cities in the
sample. Particularly this concerns residents of Kobuleti, where storm water pumping station was
rehabilitated under the RMIDP project.

Increased accessibility

20. Accessibility of the project roads for disabled and parents with strollers has reportedly
increased in Kobuleti, but not in the other cities. This could be attributed to the particular layout of
residential dwellings along the project roads. In most cities the entrances to the multi-story
residential blocks of flats are not facing the main street, but the back yard. The entrances are
accessible via the side alleys, which are not rehabilitated in most cities. This hampers the road
accessibility for the disabled, elderly, and parents with strollers. By contrast, in Kobuleti the houses
along the project street are mainly one or two story private cottages, with entrances facing the
rehabilitated main road.

Pollution

21. In terms of environmental impact, the new roads are definitely a very positive development for
the residents of the surveyed cities. A good road surface creates less dust, making it more pleasant
for the residents to use the road. In the same time, the area becomes a more attractive location for
small businesses.

Household survey water projects

Households’ general water situation, water pressure and hours

22. In the three project cities where water system was rehabilitated, the residents report a fairly
high level of satisfaction with the water services. However, the level of satisfaction with particular
water services (such as water pressure, hours, etc.) varies greatly by city.

23. Satisfaction with the water pressure, for example, is the lowest in Gori, while the residents of
Khashuri are most unsatisfied with water service hours. The particular circumstances surrounding
each city’s water services situation is described in detail in Section 2.8 of the report. The main
problem in most cities is that while the municipal water system has been rehabilitated, the water
pipes leading to private houses and apartments are in very bad condition. Therefore, the residents
cannot fully reap the benefits of the water system rehabilitation.

24. Still, comparing the data presented on Graphs 15 and 16 we can see that there have been some
sizeable and some marginal improvements in water services situation after the project in all three
cities. Especially this concerns water service hours and water service reliability.

Graph 16. Perception of water services quality BEFORE the project, by city

Reduction in coping costs

25. The costs of copying with insufficient water supply vary greatly by city.
For example, in Zestaponi the reduction of coping costs was evident in the decrease of the number
of water tanks installed in the houses and apartments (see Section 2.5.2 for details).

26. In the city of Gori, the households did not use the water tanks, but they have been using the
electric pumps to bring sufficient water pressure to the middle and top floors of the multi-story
buildings. Most of these households are still coping in the same way, however the pressure
reportedly improved on mid-level floors of the apartment buildings.

27. In the city of Khashuri the majority of surveyed households (71%) indicated that the state of
the water supply did not change. The lack of perceived benefit from rehabilitation has to do with
the poor state of water network the leads directly to the private houses. Also, some of the
households do not have the means to connect to the municipal pipe water network.

Reduction in waterborne disease

In most cities residents had access to municipal piped water even before the project, and waterborne
diseases were not reported.

Installation of water meters

28. In most cities water meters are not installed in residential building. This creates certain
problems which are described in greater detail in Section 2.8 of the report. In Gori and Khashuri in
particular the lack of mandatory water metering implies that residents would have little incentive
to fix the leaking water pipes even if they had the means to do so.

                                                                                                                           57
29. The water projects did not change the water metering situation, except in the city of Zestaponi.
Here, the majority of the households, around 93%, reported having water meter in the house. By
contrast, only 6 households, or 20% reported having a water meter in the house before the projects
were completed.

Business interview analysis

30. The business interviews conducted in the project cities found that in most cases more than half
of the businesses were new in the area. Although the precise data is not available for all cities, we
can estimate that 19-25% of businesses in those neighborhoods were completely new (i.e. they
opened in the location where no business operated previously).

Graph 17. New businesses operating in the project area, % of the total interviewed, by city.

31. The extent to which businesses saw infrastructure projects as contributing to the growth of their
enterprise varied by the city. Some of the rehabilitation projects were done in central areas, where
businesses would have been set up no matter what. However, even in those cases the owners noted
the importance of infrastructure for the continued successful operation of their business.

32. Perhaps the greatest advantage from the project road rehabilitation accrued to the entrepreneurs
of Kobuleti, a popular Black Sea resort area in Ajara. Here over 60% of respondents said that the
project road helped them to expand (or start) their business. This result is not surprising, since good
infrastructure likely attracts the tourists who would have otherwise chosen to stay in the nearby
Batumi.

Business interviews analysis (road and water projects)

33. As far as the water projects, businesses do report that the rehabilitation work increased their
access to water in general, or good quality water in particular.

34. In the city of Gori 80% of businesses that responded to the question “Did the water project
increase your access to better quality water supply?” indicated significantly or slightly better
access. The same answer was given to this question by 71% of business respondents in Zestaponi.

35. However, most of the businesses do not report significant cost savings or profit increases
directly associated with the water projects.

Perception of project benefits – gender perspective

36. In most cases, men and women reported quite similar levels of satisfaction (or dissatisfaction)
with project results. No systematic differences were detected in the survey answers when we
segregate the respondents by gender.

before the anticipated period defined in the loan agreement. The GOG rates the outcome and
achievements of the projects and components as satisfactory. The project produced a number of
concrete and visible results on the ground. Most of these results had a positive impact on the
livelihood of the beneficiary population in the participating municipalities. The RMIDP and
RMIDP-AF also created a financing mechanism for municipal investments which, to date, operates
efficiently and has reasonable prospects of sustainability. The credit was fully disbursed. The
Institutional Development Component of the project was completed by the closing date of the

   (iii) improving the physical conditions of the walls and floors, and provision of entrance sheds
    and air ventilators in about 1263 houses in nine (9) settlements has been completed on
    December 2010;
   (iv) constructing a bridge at the Mtkvari River leading to Akhalsopeli settlement has been
    completed on June 22, 2011;
    (v) providing 265 solid-waste containers and eleven (11) trucks in twelve (12) settlements -
    the provision of goods has been completed on July, 2011;
    On the II stage (2012) were been planned the improvement the water supply in 9 settlements;
    rehab drainage channels and arrangement the main collectors in 7 settlements, and arranging
    the hydro and heat insulation blocks for the outer walls in 9 settlements.
    Based on the design produced by the Holinger, the MDF prepared three bidding packages:
   Rehabilitation of Drainage and Storm Water Channels in 7 Villages of IDPs (Khurvaleti, Skra,
    Karaleti, Akhalsopeli, Teliani, Tsilkani, Frezeti);
   Improvement of potable Water Supply in 9 villages of IDPs (Berbuki, Khurvaleti, Skra,
    Shavshvebi, Karaleti, Akhalsopeli, Mokhisi, Metekhi, Tsilkani);
   Hydro/Thermal Insulation of Walls in 9 villages of IDPs (in 1099 houses instead of the total of
    1263 houses).

USAID was requested to perform drainage works in 7 villages and water supply improvement
works in 9 villages. Contracts for Civil Works of II Stage (Hydro/Thermal Insulation of Walls in 9
villages -1099 Houses) were concluded into three lots, in particular:
 I Lot, Contract # IDA/RMIDP-EU/CW/NCB/61-L1, (Villages Khurvaleti, Shavshvebi, Skra,
     Berbuki), total 536 Houses;
 II Lot, Contract #IDA/RMIDP-EU/CW/NCB/61-L2 (Village Karaleti), total 480 Houses;
 III Lot, Contract # IDA/RMIDP-EU/CW/NCB/61-L3 (Villages Mokhisi, Akhalsopeli, Teliani,
     Metekhi), total 83 Houses.

Saving of the sum that was caused by conducted bidding made possible making of the amendment
to the Contracts and conducting of hydro/thermal insulation works not in selected 1099 houses that
was connected with severe disagreement among the population, but in all 1263 houses. On the basis
of No Objections of the World Bank dated 15.05.2012 and 16.05.2012, the amendments were made
to all three Contracts, in particular works for 164 houses were added that increased the total contract
price.

Civil works are completed and arrangement of polystyrene panels for1263 houses is done
(including the plastering and armoring works and painting works). Supervision at the facility was
being conducted by three supervisors of the MDF together with the village heads (Mamasakhlisi)
and local offices of Ministry of Internally Displaced Persons from the Occupied Territories,
Accommodation and Refugees of Georgia.

Component Part C: Institutional Development

MDF selected and contracted the company “GIS and RS Consulting center Geographic Ltd” for
preparing the "Kazbegi, Dusheti and Abastumani development strategy for sustainable
development". According to the consultant contract inception, midterm and final (December, 2014)
reports were been submitted. Consulting services are completed.

    2. Government Ownership and Stakeholder Involvement:

In its principles, the RMIDP and RMIDP-AF responded to the Government's development
priorities. It coincided with the aims of the State Program for Municipal Development and its
concept was fully supported by the Government. Government involvement with the World Bank
in the design of specific features of the project and implementation arrangements was significant.
An additional assurance for quality was achieved through very active participation in project
identification and formulation and monitoring of works by LSGs. In line with recent changes in the
country, LSGs showed more ownership to the projects which they were co-financing.

    3. Project Administrative Structure & Implementing Agency:

The MDF – which was in charge of part of RMIDP and RMIDP-AF – is a legal entity of public
law, the objective of which is to support strengthening institutional and financial capacity of local
government units, investing financial resources in local infrastructure and services, improving on
sustainable basis the primary economic and social services for the local population (communities),
developing renewable energy (midget power plants and geothermal) sources, creating sustainable
economic basis for refugees, rehabilitating irrigation and drainage systems. For this purpose, the
MDF cooperates with the local self-government units and population, mobilizes financial resources
from the international organizations, donor agencies and foreign countries, central and local
governments and other organizations. In its work, the MDF acts according to the Legislation of
Georgia, Agreements signed by Georgia with international financial organizations and other
donors. Coordination and management of the MDF activities is conducted by the Supervisory
Board appointed by the Decree of the Government of Georgia. The Fund is accountable to the
Government of Georgia, Supervisory Board of the Fund and Ministry of Finance of Georgia. With
the purpose of better coordination and improvement of social investments implementation, the
Government decided in 2005 to integrate Georgia Social Investment Fund and Irrigation and
Drainage Community Development Fund in 2006 into the MDF. The MDF itself is managed by an
Executive Director. Such kind of changes had positive and effective impact on the projects
implementation. The MDF increased its range of responsibilities, including the management of
other projects financed not only by the World Bank, but by the EBRD, MCG, ADB, KfW, EU, etc.
Its institutional capacity is very successful, so GOG determined the strategic future and role of
MDF as a semiautonomous financial intermediary project implementing agency under the
oversight of the Supervisory Board, which will continue to lend to creditworthy LSGs as well as
pay for its own operational coast.

Annex 10. MDF (Municipal Development Fund of Georgia) structural changes
and reforms

        The (Municipal Development Fund of Georgia) MDF undertook a structural reorganization
during the last several years in consultation with the donor community. MDF has gone through
such structural reorganization and changes of the management team before too. In 2015, the Prime
Minister of Georgia appointed Mr. Ilia Darchiashvili as the Executive Director of MDF.

        A new position of a Project Management Advisor to Executive Director has been
introduced. The internal audit unit has been abolished which will be performed centrally from
Ministry of Regional Development. The Project Coordination Unit and the Strategic Development
Unit were merged to become Donors Relations and Project Management Unit. New position of
Deputy Executive Director has been added, with oversight over Public Relations, Legal and
Administrative Units. One credit management officer with commercial bank experience has joined
in MDF to strengthen the creditworthiness analysis and risk management of working with the
municipalities. This officer is closely monitoring and analyzing the bid participants, in order to
evaluate and mitigate financial risks. MDF has overall adequate internal control system in place for
the projects implementation. In the long run there is a strong control environment in place at MDF.
The reorganization included also rationalization of units and appointment of new staff with relevant
background and experience to reinforce the pre-existing teams. In addition, the individual
consultants recruited by MDF contributed to a gradual increase in MDF’s responsiveness and the
quality of the submissions to donors. Over the last years, the Government of Georgia noticed very
positively an improvement in MDF performance and pro-activeness in terms of procurement,
project monitoring, financial management and safeguards-related activities.

         As agreed with donors, MDF assigned a new relevant staff (Social Development Specialist)
for Social Accountability measures including safeguards implementation and reporting under the
current projects. The same approach is implemented by MDF Environmental Protection and
Resettlement Unit for assigning the dedicated staff members for the issues related to the
resettlement issues in the current and ongoing projects. Considering large number of contracts, for
the project risk mitigation measures, MDF is working on to assign specifically contract
management responsibilities to dedicated Procurement Consultant (or establish unit/sub-unit), in
order to mitigate the risk of slippage of deadlines, expiry of intended completion dates and overall
more effective contract monitoring. All milestones shall be closely monitored in order to avoid
contract mismanagement cases. In addition MDF hired full time Procurement Consultant, engaged
in WB financed Public Sector Financial Management Reforms Support Project – (PFSMRSP)
implemented by MOF and possesses adequate experience in procurement of goods and consulting
services. The procurement staff has experience carrying out procurement under donor guidelines,
and attended training courses in Georgia and abroad. Proposed arrangement is another positive
trend towards building sustainable, in house capacity of MDF.

         Currently MDF is also very intensively working for the development it’s Management
Information System (MIS) and working with the Consultant for upgrading the modernizing MIS
soft for better analyzing and control of the project implementation cycle and minimize the errors.
The MDF is very actively working closely with the foreign diplomatic entities working in country,
for increasing the number and the qualification of the MDF bidding process participants in the
current and upcoming MDF implemented projects.

      These improvements are visible in all MDF’s International donor (WB, ADB, KFW,
EBRD, EIB, USAID, SIDA, etc.) funded projects. Various donor Missions (WB, ADB, KfW, etc.)


                                                70
are noticing this positive changes at MDF. However, and given the complexity and number of
subprojects under the various projects, the implementation of the investment programs remains
challenging and continued efforts and actions from MDF Management and teams are necessary to
ensure smooth project implementation. During the regular meetings/missions with various donors,
MDF Management committing to implement all actions agreed in donors’ Aid Memoirs, i.e., to
closely monitor the progress against action plan, and to inform the donor project teams of any
difficulties or complications.

        The recent changes in the MDF management resulted in a strong ownership from and
commitment of the management to transform the MDF into a sustainable and competitive
organization. Presently MDF is implementing the various projects (for ex. under the WB funded:
RDP, RDP2, RDP3, RMIDP2, etc.) and also preparing the new projects (for ex.: EIB4, WIMP3,
SUTIP tranche 4; etc.) for the current 2015 year and upcoming next years too.

        The MDF is always happy and ready to discuss with the donors any issues regarding the
Fund, its performance and projects for the further improvement of the results and objectives for the
mutual benefits from the projects for the beneficiaries of Georgia.
