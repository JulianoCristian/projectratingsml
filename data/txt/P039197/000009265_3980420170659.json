and increase efficiency in the delivery of urban\n            transport and utility services.  During preparation, the aim\n            has been to improve the quality of the design of the\n            state's privatization and concession program and assist\n            in its initial phase of implementation.  The project itself\n            will ensure that implementation is completed as planned.\n            The components of the project are the following: 1)\n            privatization of BANERJ SA and of BANERJ Insurance SA as\n            well as liquidation of Banco do Estado do Rio de Janeiro SA\n            and of its pension fund; 2) establishment of a new\n            regulatory framework for the private provision of public\n            services; 3) concession of the services of Rio's main\n            urban transport agencies and divestiture of their\n            non-operational assets; 4) privatization of the energy\n            companies--the electricity company CERJ and the gas company\n            CEG; 5) concession of water and sanitation services; and 6)\n            satisfactory review of the 1997 fiscal performance."}, "docdt": "1997-06-06T00:00:00Z"}
