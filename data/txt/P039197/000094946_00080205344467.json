"abstracts": {"cdata!": "The outcome of the Rio Je Janeiro State\n            Reform Privatization Project was satisfactory - it achieved\n            most of its major privatization objective and has\n            established a supportive regulatory framework. The main\n            lessons include the following: 1) Privatizing or liquidating\n            a state bank requires sustained political commitment at the\n            highest level of state government. 2) Unless necessary,\n            splitting should be avoided, as dealing with the\n            \"remnants\" to be liquidated carry a large\n            administrative and legal burden for the state after\n            privatization. 3) It is essential to identify and deal\n            up-front with the problem of hidden liabilities,\n            particularly unfunded pension liabilities. 4) Private\n            management contracts are useful to prepare a bank for\n            privatization when years of bad management and poor records\n            make valuation and the identification of hidden liabilities\n            difficult. Remuneration of the private manager based on\n            incremental operational results is an effective incentive to\n            good management. 5) Success fees expressed as a percentage\n            of privatization proceeds are a good incentive to proper\n            valuation of the minimum price and active sale promotion. 6)\n            Governments should avoid as much as possible granting\n            exclusivity rights to the management of state accounts to\n            former public banks."}, "docdt": "2000-06-16T00:00:00Z"}
