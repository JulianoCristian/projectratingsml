Some\n            lessons learned included: the key lessons from this project\n            are that genuine Water Resource Management (WRM) reforms\n            will be successfully delivered if: (i) there is a strong\n            enabling policy, regulatory and legal framework; (ii) strong\n            political commitment to the reform process and the will to\n            overcome the resistance to reforms that will emerge; (iii)\n            any reform package should include a combination of\n            government institutional reforms or top down measures and\n            bottom up reform measures involving water users. This\n            combined approach should be focused on participatory\n            irrigation management by creating and strengthening the\n            relationship between the water service providers and the\n            water users through Water User Association (WUAs).\n            Professional leadership and management by Project Management\n            Offices (PMOs) at all levels is a key success factor, as is\n            the careful selection and continuity of appointment of PMO\n            staff at all levels. The Bank's supervision strategy\n            was built around using this capacity within the\n            borrower's project management organizations and\n            institutions and effectively using the monitoring and\n            evaluation system established through an independent third\n            party, thus developing trust and credibility between the\n            Bank and the borrower."}, "docdt": "2007-01-31T00:00:00Z"}
