PREFA CE
Among Irrigation District Upgrading Project in Guanzhong, Shaanxi Province, there
are two sub-projects involving land acquisition and resettlement. In which, (1) the
reservoir induced by constructing dam and floodgate at the entrance to Linjia Village
Irrigation Ditch of Baoji Gorge will inundate the land of 1500mu, and affect 841
persons, and the total of RMB24,447,900 will by required; and (2) two sub-projects of
Baoji Gorge Irrigation District Upgrading and Luohui Ditch Irrigation District
Upgrading will acquired 1,739mu land (including permanent acquired land 1,435mu
and temporary occupied land 304mu), and compensation cost for land acquisition and
resettlement for the two sub-projects is RMB131,815,000.
In accordance with the requirements of the World Bank, Shaanxi Design & Research
Institute of Water Resources and Hydropower (SDRI) provided a draft resettlement
plan for reservoir project in April 1998. Together with the investigation mission of the
World Bank, Mrs. Zhou Youlan, the expert in resettlement, gave some valuable advice
to the draft resettlement action plan (RAP) after carefully investigating the two
reservoir areas on the spot from 12* to 166 April 1998. And she made a lecture on
"World Bank Operational Directive 4.30" (OD4.30) and how to develop RAP according
to the requirements of the World Bank. According to the outline of RAP provided by
Mrs. Zhou and "Investigation Mission Auxiliary Memorandum (April, 1998)",
organized by the Shaanxi Resettlement Office (SRO) and SDRI, more than 10 officials
from the resettlement offices of the two reservoirs areas took part in developing the
document of "Shaanxi Guanzhong Irrigation District Upgrading Project Resettlement
Action Plan." Mrs. Zhou, the expert in resettlement, gave good suggestions on the
RAP again at the end of June 1998. Therefore, the section II - Resettlement Action
Plan for Baoji Gorge Irrigation District Upgrading and Luohui Ditch Irrigation District
Upgrading was added according to Mrs. Zhou's suggestions.
As it is the first time of compiling RAP in accordance with the requirements of the
World Bank, please oblige us with your valuable comments.

I INTRODUCTION
1.1 Geographic and Economic Conditions of Project Site
1. 1.I Geographic Conditions
Located at the most western end of Guanzhong Plain and in the Wei River Gorge
1 lkm away west from Baoji Municipality, HDFP at Linjia Village of Baojixia is a key
project of Yuanshang Irrigation District of Baojixia. 400m to 600m above sea level,
the entire irrigation district is in the loess area, covered by loess from about 500m to
1,000m high. Under the control of a semi-tropic monsoon climate of being semi-arid
and semi-humid, the irrigation district has an average temperature of 14°C, an annual
average precipitation of 581.4mm, a frost-free period of 220 days, and an annual
evaporation of 1,000mm.
As the joint of Longshan Mountain Chain and Qinglin Mountain Chain, the key
project lies in the gorge area at the middle reaches of the Wei River with a
complicated a V-type or U-type terrain.
1.1.2 Economic Conditions
HDFP of Linjia Village undertakes the task of irrigating 1,913,000mu of cultivated
land of Baojixia with 1,678 administrative hamlets of 97 twonships (towns) of 14
counties in Baoji, Xianyang and Xi'an, and with a population of 2,500,000 people
including 1,850,000 agricultural and 65,000 non-agricultural. Meanwhile the district
is a drinking water resource for middle and small-sized cities and the countryside. Its
industrial and agricultural economy is well developed with about 1/8 of the total grain
yield of the whole province, as one of the important grain bases of Shaanxi province.
It has transportation extending in all directions with Longhai Railway, Xi'an-Baoji
Expressway, No.3 10 National Road and Xi'an-Baoji Road, etc.
1.2 Brief lntroduction of Project Involving Land Acquisition and Resettlement
In 1958, Section I Project at Linjia Village of Baojixia began to be constructed, which
comprised a dam and a water diversion tunnel, etc. The dam is 27m high, and 615m
high above sea level. 138m high, on the left bank of the river, the water diversion
l



tunnel was designed to be able to draw a water flow at a speed of 70m3/second. In
this Section, the planned height was 637.6m above sea level. When shutting the gate
to dam up water, the normal water storage level was 636m. From an irregulative key
position to a regulative one, the project need submerge acquired land and resettle
PAPs.
HDFP at Linjia Village is a middle-sized Level III project, made up of sub-projects of
non-spillway section, scour outlets, flood-way outlets, power stations and irrigation
water-drawing outlets, etc. The biggest dam is 49.6m high and 180.8m long with
three sand escape outlets of 8m x 6.5m, a water-drawing outlet for generating
electricity of 4.6m x 4.6m, an irrigation water-drawing outlet of 4m x 5m, and a
flood-way outlet of lOm x 6.73m.
When the construction is finished, the project can regulate and storage irrigation
water of 80,000,000m3. The analysis shows that the rate of intemal economic
benefits is 20.74%, and the rate of benefits compared with cost is 1.66, which is
obviously remarkable in economic results.

2 PRINCIPLES OF RESETTLEMENT PLANNING
There are 217 households with 841PAPs affected by the reservoir of HDFP. The
living standards of these PAPs will go down because of water storage of the reservoir
and land submergence in May 2002. It is estimated that the grain yield per capita will
decrease from 350kg to 312kg and net income per capita from RMB803 to RMB650.
2.1 Objective
Our ultimate aim is to make PAPs get rich. By drawing up a practical and feasible
RAP and meanwhile meticulously designing, implementing and managing by the
local governnents and ROs at all levels in reservoir and resettlement areas, we will
create a good living environment to help PAPs develop production and economy, to
increase their incomes and make them resume or surpass their living standards before
resettlement.
2.2 Principles
2.2.1 Adhere to the principle of resettling PAPs with land
PAPs from rural areas will be resettled in rural rehabilitation areas with good
conditions. They will be allocated with non-gratuitous foundation sites, private plots,
and contracted lands and other lands, with same quality as the local villagers.
Therefore, they can go rich by developing a diversified economy on the land.
2.2.2 Adhere to the principle of helping PAPs in both reservoir areas and rehabilitation
areas.
That means to plan as whole, implement separately, and offer prior help to
impoverished PAPs.
2.2.3 Adhere to the principle of providing a good living environment for PAPs.
The infrastructures, production and public utilities, cultural and hygienic facilities at
villages and towns will be built and operated according to the plan.
2.2.4 Adhere to the principle of promoting PAP's economic development by taking the
3



advantage of natural resources at reservoir areas.
Planting and breeding will be given priority while village enterprises and labor force
exportation will be developed vigorously.  The incomes of PAPs should keep
increasing to resume or surpass the living standards before resettlement.
2.2.5 Adhere to the principle of continuous technical training on PAPs
PAPs' training institutions in counties and villages will be improved, training network
at all levels set up and training funds increased to devote major efforts to giving
technical training.
2.2.6 Adhere to the principle of helping vulnerable groups.
In rehabilitation, production development, and employment, special consideration
will be given to the vulnerable groups.

3 LEGAL FRAMEWORK
Since 1950, there has been over 10,000,000 PAPs resettled in hydroelectric projects
in China. The country has paid much attention to resettlement work and promulgated
a quite complete system of policies and regulations on resettlement. Especially since
1957 in our province, the Sanren Gorge Reservoir on the Yellow River, the Shiquan
Reservoir and Ankang Reservoir on the Han River have been constructed in
succession with 500,OOOPAPs resettled. In order to solve the remaining resettlement
of the constructed reservoir problems and resettle new reservoir PAPs, Shaanxi
Provincial Government (SPG) has promulgated a series of policies, measurements
and rules on resettlement so as to provide policy basis for further resettlement.
3.1 Laws Concerning PAPs'Resettlement
3.1.1 Land Management Law of the P.R.C. (1987)
Land Management Law involves land ownership and right of land use, usage and
protection of the land, management of national and village construction land, and
legal responsibilities of law implementation.
The calculation of land acquisition and PAPs' resettlement costs is based on this law
when submergence is unavoidable for constructing reservoir.
3.1.2 Water Law of the P.R.C. (1988)
Water Law stipulates the principles of the development, usage, protection,
management of water resources, and the developing plan of water resources.
Article 23 stipulates: If the people have to be resettled in the construction of the
national hydroelectric project, the local governments are responsible for making
adequate arrangements for PAPs' production and living. The resettlement costs
should be included in the investment plan of the project. The resettlement work
should be finished by the plan during construction.
3.1.3 Environmental Protection Law of the P.R.C. (1979)
It stipulates: In large and medium-sized hydroelectric construction projects, the
5



research on the environmental influence should be considered as a component of the
feasibility research of the project, including the evaluation of social and economic
influence caused by reservoir submergence and PAPs' resettlement.
3.2 Regulations Concerning PAPs 'Resettlement
3.2.1 Regulations of Land Acquisition Compensation and Resettlement of Large and
Medium Hydroelectric Projects (Order No.74 of the State Council of the P.R.C. on 1't
May 1991) is the resettlement directive for the Ministry of Water Resources and the
Ministry of Power Industry.
The regulations stipulate:
* Properly deal with the relations between the nation, the collective and the
individual; the interests of resettlement and rehabilitation areas should be
subordinate to those of the nation.
*  Combine rehabilitation with reservoir construction, resources development,
water and soil conservation, and economic development, in order to make
the PAPs' resume or surpass their old living standards.
-  Inspected and approved by the provincial and county governments, transfer
the agricultural residence to non-agricultural residence for those whose
entire lands are acquired.
* Calculate the land acquisition compensation and resettlement allowance on
the basis of Clause 5 of the Regulation. For those who still have financial
difficulties, a certain compensation increase can be made.
.  The country takes measures to provide PAPs with compensation and
allowance in the earlier stage, help their production in the later stage,
advocate and support resettlements with development.

It requires:
* The determination of the range of the reservoir submergence
* The design stage and content, work division and cooperation
* The handling of special cases in resettlement and submergence
* The comprehensive development plan of the reservoir and the cleaning of
the bottom of the reservoir
* The calculation of compensation and investment for reservoir submergence

4.1.1 Contents of the survey
. Family characters of PAPs: nationality, characteristics of family composition (age,
education and social relations), property rights or ownership, etc.
. Resettlement scale: households, people and facilities that need resettling in
submerged areas and affected areas.
. Total income of PAPs: agricultural income, sideline income, collective distribution
income and labor service income, etc.
. The loss quantity of whole or partial property of PAPs.
* Affected infrastructures and social service facilities.  Water, electricity, roads,
enterprises, clinics, schools and kindergartens, etc.
4.1.2 Principles of the survey
- Adhere to the principle of being practical and realistic according to the policies.
. Adhere to the principle of being responsible for PAPs; on no account should the
interests of the PAPs be infringed upon.
* Adhere to the principle of relying on the real statistics.
. Adhere to the principle of relying on the people.
4.1.3 Methods of the survey
The Social and Economic Survey Group, made up of construction units, design units,
local governments in reservoir areas at all levels, and related departnents, has taken
the following methods to carry out the survey.
8



. Surveyed, measured and counted on the spot.
. Consulted the annual statistics reports of the counties and villages, analyzed and
calculated the economic incomes.
* Held forums to survey among the people.
* Examined the documents (files) of the units in charge of infrastructures in order to
obtain the scale, quantity of social and service facilities.
4.2 Summary of the Survey Results
Located in low mountain areas in the west of Shaanxi province, much of the land of
the submerged areas are terraced fields, hillside fields, river and creek fields. Except
for river and creek fields with quite good irrigating conditions, the others are all dry
land with a lower temperature and more precipitation than that of Guanzhong Area.
Cereal crops are mainly wheal and corn. Influenced by the climate and irrigating
conditions, crops at river and creek fields ripen twice a year, while those at terraced
and hillside fields only once a year. The grain yield is 185kg/mu, 77% of the county
average grain yield of 240kg/mu. Grain per capita is 350kg, 93% of the grain yield
per capita of the county. This area is over the living standards of just having enough
food and clothing.
Economic incomes of the local people mainly rely on the output of cereal crops and
economic plants. Most cereal crops are wheal and corn. Economic plants are apple,
Chinese cabbage, vegetable and strawberry, etc. Breeding refers to chicken, duck,
fish, cow, sheep and pig, etc. Others are incomes from small enterprises and labor
services. The people's incomes per capita are: cereal crops RMB556, economic
plants RMB39, breeding and small enterprises RMBB127, and labor services
RMB143. Their annual income per capita is RMB865. (See Table 4-1)
Investigation shows that there are 11 harnlets, 7 administrative villages and 4 towns

affected at Baoji County, with 841 PAPs of 217 households. 1,048.35mu cultivated
land will be submerged; 13,527.1m2 of houses, 5,581.5m2 of storage rooms and
1,289. 1m2 of cave dwellings will be demolished. Other utilities such as roads, power
transmission lines and water conservancy are affected as well. Based on the reality,
the data are actual and reliable.
All 841 PAPs of 217 households are agricultural with Han Nationality. Among them,
there are 50 illiterates, 214 at primary school level, 448 at middle school level and 2
above middle school level, 380 females, 67 aged people and 19 PAPs from 12
impoverished households. (See Table 4-2)
4.3  Resettlement in Completed Projects
Yuanshang Project at Baojixia was started in 1958 and stopped in 1962, resumed in
February 1969 and finished in 1971. At that time, projects involving resettlement
were the Reservoir Project of Wang Jiaya on the Qian River, the Reservoir Project of
Xin Yigou, the Reservoir Project of Da Beigou and the Reservoir Project of the Gan
River. In the earlier period of the construction, No. 4, 8, 9 and 10 Command Posts,
subsidiaries of the Wei River Project Bureau of Shaanxi province, were responsible
for resettling PAPs in their production teams. At that time the communes planned and
distributed the cultivated lands and construction sites to PAPs. The production tearns
were responsible for building houses for PAPs. The way that dealt with the
resettlement was satisfactory. PAPs have sued no serious case for 40 years.

5.1.1 Reservoir Inundation Survey
Design Standards on Handling of Inundation
The handling of reservoir submergence will be carried out according to Designing Standards of
Handling Reservoir Submergence in Water Conservancy & Hydroelectric Projects. Normally,
the water level is 636m (plus Im of stormy wave), land acquisition is designed for 2 to 5 years
meeting one flood, PAPs' resettlement is 10 to 20 years meeting one flood. In this project, land
acquisition is designed for 5 years meeting one flood (4=2460m3/s), and PAPs' resettlement 20
years meeting one flood (4=3600mN3s). (See Table 5-1)

Inundation Scope
It includes the submerged areas and those affected by immersion and sinking caused by
submergence. The regular submerged areas refer to those generally below the normal water
level and the temporiry submerged areas refer to those above the norrnal water level but
13



submerged by backwater and stormy waves.
5.2 Statistcs of Inundation, Landsliding and Avalanche Survey
The reservoir submergence, immersion and sinking in HDFP at Baojixia will affect and make a
loss of 1048.35mu of all kinds of land and 451.3mu of woods and fruit trees. 20,697.5m2 of
houses are demolished, as well as every kind of special and attached facilities, etc. (See Table 5-
2)
5.3 Compensation Rates
On the basis of the national regulations and survey reports on reservoir economy, the
compensation standards for reservoir submergence are as follows:
5.3.1 Standards of Land Compensation and Allowance
On the basis of the Land Law, calculate the grain yield per mu according to the annual grain
yield per mu of the previous three years and the market price in 1997, then multiply by 8
times. (See Table 5-3)
5.3.2 Standards of House Compensation
Compensate on the basis of the reconstruction cost for all kinds of houses.  The
reconstruction cost is based on the construction quota made by the construction department
of Baoji County and the investigation on the construction cost among the people in the
reservoir areas. (See Table 5-4)
5.3.3 Standards of Compensation for Attached Facilities
Calculate on the basis of the compensation standards of other reservoirs in our province and
the reality. (See Table 5-5)
5.3.4 Standards of Compensation for Special Facilities
Calculate on the basis of the construction quota of the national professional standards, and
the compensation rate of special facilities for other reservoirs in our province. (See Table
5-6)

6 REHABILITATION
817 PAPs of 217 households affected by reservoir submergence and immersion have
to be resettled and rehabilitated. On the basis of the principle of developing
production to provide people with a better and satisfactory life, the local governments
and ROs at all levels will take effective measures to build houses and infrastructures,
adjust cultivated land for PAPs. In this way can PAPs resume and surpass their old
living standards when a better living environment is created.
6.1 Reconstruction Plan of Production Facilities (See Table 6-2)
6.1.1 Farming Land Adjustment (See Table 6- 1)
1) Principles of Land Adjustment
- Adjust with compensation on the basis of voluntary participation and mutual
benefit
* Solicit public opinions so as to satisfy everyone
* Adjust land with the same quantity and quality as that of the local people
2) Adjustment with Compensation
The county ROs should compensate the hamlets and groups for land acquisition
on the basis of the national compensation standards.
3) There are 9 hamlets and groups at reservoir area involving land adjustment.
783.2mu and 1.83mu per capita of cultivated land is adjusted including 273.91 mu
of irrigated land, 258.61mu of dry plain land and 250.68mu of hillside land. The
resettlement area is in Zhouyuan Town, Baoji County, which is about 40km away
from the reservoir area. Near the county, the resettlement area has a plain land
and belongs to the gravity irrigation area of Fengjiashan Reservoir. There are 22
administrative villages with a population of 42,300, with 50,800mu and 1.34mu
per capita of cultivated land, 538.4kg of grain yield per capita, and RMB 1600 of
the annual income per capita. With convenient transportation and complete
19



infrastructures, the town has good economic conditions. Every resettled PAP can
get 1.34mu of adjusted land or 343.04mu altogether.
6.1.2 Build Embankment to Protect the Land.
Group No. 1 & No.2 of Chengli Hamlet will be affected by reservoir immersion. As a
result of re-plan with the designing departmnent, an embankment of 2m high and 1 km
long will be built along the reservoir with a water level line of 636m long to protect
136.26mu of cultivated land in Chengli Hamlet.
6.1.3 Open up 60mu of Wasteland.
60mu of wasteland in reservoir area, such as Luichuandian, Hujiashan and Zuluo, will
be opened up to make up for the loss caused by immersion.
6.1.4 Transform 150mu of Hillside Fields to Plain Terraced Fields.
The hillside fields in the hamlets such as Fangtang, Lijiahe and Fangtangwu, will be
transformed to plain terraced field to conserve water and manure in the soil to
improve the yield per mu.
6.1.5 Transform 21Omu of Dry Land to Irrigated land.
Three pumping stations will be built in Fangtang Hamlet and Lijiahe Hamlet, so that
the dry land will be transformed to land with stable yields in spite of drought or
excessive rain.
6.1.6 Form a Complete System of Facilities in Irrigated Areas and Level the Land.
The land adjusted to PAPs at Nanwang Hamlet and Pozi Hamlet will be leveled and a
complete system of facilities will be formed in the irrigated areas.
6.2 Residence Sites Preparation and Housing
6.2.1 Plan of the Residential Places
On the basis of full consultations between PAPs and governments at all levels in
reservoir and resettlement areas, 7 residential resettlement places for PAPs have been
selected, i.e., 6 in reservoir area (Fangtang, Lijiahe, Group No.3 of Chengli,
Hujiashan, Zuluo and Liuchuandian) and I in resettlement area (Zhouyuan Town).
20



Plan Principle. Residential places will be planned according to the principle of
"Wholly Decentralized, Partially Centralized". PAPs of less than 10 households
will be settled in a decentralized way into one village or one hamlet and in a
centralized way if more than 10 households. Furthermore, PAP's living style in
groups and whole clans will be kept as much as possible.
*  All facilities should be complete at residential places. Incomplete facilities have
to be rebuilt.
*  Plans of residential places should be included in the long-terin development plan
of the village.
6.3 House Reconstruction
6.3.1 Construction Standards
On the basis of the principle of "Unified Plan, Unified Standard, Unified
Implementation" and the Plan, the hamlets and groups in the resettlement areas are
responsible for delimiting the boundary lines of the foundation sites (200m2 per
household, I Om wide and 20m long), as large as those of the local people.
6.3.2 House Structure
The house structure has the traditional type in countryside of Guangzhong in the west
of Shanxi province. (See the graph below.)
For a two-story brick-concrete house with three gates, the construction area is 1 20m2.
If there are less people or money, the house can be built into one-story brick-concrete
one, or three brick-timber plain one with a construction area of 60m2 and a kitchen of
12m2.
6.3.3 Construction Methods
Mostly PAPs build their houses by themselves. Dependent on the compensation
given by the country and their own capital, PAPs can decide how large the house is,
21



what type and structure the house has. If the money is over used because of larger
construction area and higher structural standard, PAPs have to pay the difference by
themselves.
Toilet            Bedroom                    Store Room     l        I
Bedroom                         Gate        Street
Pigsty/Cowshed              Bedroom            Stairs   Kitchen
6.3.4 As the construction for PAPs is a complicated task, ROs at all levels should assign
someone fixed responsible for designing, constructing and checking to ensure the
quality of the new buildings.
6.4 Infrastructures and Public Service Facilities Reconstruction
6.4.1 Water Supply Project
In 11 water supply projects, 3 of them are in reservoir area, and the rest 8 are in
resettlement area. New motor-pumped wells will be dug in resettlement places with
comparatively more PAPs, such as Dafangtang, Lijiahe, Zhouyuan Town, and hamlets
lack of water, such as Nanwang and Pozi.  Water supply facilities in other
resettlement places will be added and completed on the basis of their old facilities.
* Water Resources
Water resources for human and livestock in 4 hamlets are all from deep
groundwater drawn from motor-pumped wells. Around the center of the hamlets,
the wells are about 80m to 120m deep. In addition, the water tower is 30m3 in
22



volume and 15m in height. The total water supply lines are 100mm in diameter,
and 2000m in length. The main water supply line is 800m long at Fangtang,
300m at Lijiahe, 500m at Nanwang and 400m at Linjiahe. The branch water
supply line is 12000m in length and 50mm in diameter. There are 4 water pumps
of type 150JC 10-9.
* Water Supply Standards and Demands
According to the water usage in China and water supply standards for human and
livestock in Guangzhong countryside, the water supply standards are 50L for per
peasant and 1 5L for per livestock.
There will be enough water supplies to meet the greatest demands of 2,000
people and livestock (including non-PAPs in resettlement areas) i.e., 90,000kg per
day.
6.4.2 Transportation Scheme
The transportation in the reservoir area is convenient because its left bank is close to
Longhai Railway with Fangtang Railway Station, and its right is No.310 State Road.
The station-owned No.310 Warehouse has been built in Fangtang Hamlet with a 3km
cement road connected to No.3 10 State Road leading to Baoji City (County). In the
transportation plan, a cobbled road 4m wide and 5km long will be built. When the
water level reaches 637m, a highway bridge and suspension bridge will be
submerged. Therefore, the highway bridge will be raised to 2m higher, 50m longer
and 3.5m wider; the suspension bridge will be raised to 8m higher and 2m wider. A
tractor-ploughing road of 12km long, 1.5m to 2.Om wide will be built from Fangtang
Hamlet to Guchuang Town.
At resettlement area in Zhouyuan Town, a village road 15km long will be
consolidated and widened, including 2km in Nanwang Hamlet, 3km in Pozi Hamlet,
and  Okm in other hamlets.
6.4.3 Plan of Transmission Lines
Transmission and transformer lines of 24km will be built in reservoir and resettlement
23



areas, including 14km in reservoir area and 1Okm in resettlement area. A transformer
of 3OKeV Ampere (kilo-electron-volt ampere) will be built at Fangtang Hamlet. As
more PAPs are resettled in Nanwang Hamlet and Pozi Hamlet, the old transformers
are overloaded. Therefore, new transformers of 5OKev Ampere will be installed
respectively.
6.4.4 Plans for Post and Telecommunications
Except for one long distance telecommunication line at Guchuan Village
Govermment, there is no other telecommunication facilities. The village post and
telecommunications office will install a line of 4km to the village government with a
switch box of 30 extension lines so as to connect the Village Administration
Committee (VAC), middle and primary schools and hospitals. The post office in
Guchuan Village can deal with businesses of letters, telegrams, telephones,
newspapers, magazines, and remittances, etc. A mailing box will be installed at VAC
of Fangtang and the gate of the primary school, so the postman can take out and mail
the letters. As in the branch post office can telegrams be sent, newspapers and
magazines be subscribed, no more these facilities will be built in resettlement areas
(places) for PAPs.
6.5 Plansfor Service Facilities
In reservoir areas and resettlement areas, the following service facilities will be built:
I middle school (Zhouyuan Middle School will be completed), 13 primary schools, 2
hospitals, 12 health centers, 15 stores, 2 TV Relay Stations.

7 REL OCA TEES'PROD UCTIONARRANGEMENT
7.1 Ways of Employment
In this project, 841 people relocated to new resettlement area are all peasants and therefore will
be arranged as peasants after relocation. PAPs will be relocated by on-the-spot resettlement and
outward resettlement.
*  152 PAPs from Group No. 2 and No. 5 at Fangtang, Zuluo Hamlet, Xunlin Group and
Hujiashan Group at Linchuandian Hamlet will be resettled on the spot in the same groups or
hamlets.
*  Group No. 1 and No. 3 at Chengli Hamlet will be affected by immersion. Measures will be
taken to solve the problem (Along the reservoir bank, an embankment 2m high and 1000m
long will be built to protect 138.26mu of cultivated land. 157 PAPs affected by immersion will
not be relocated).
* As Fangtang Hamlet and Lijia Hamlet will be greatly affected by immersion, 276 PAPs will be
resettled on-the-spot, while 256 PAPs outward resettled in Group No. 14 at Zhouyuan Town.
On the basis of the principle of giving first place to agricultural resettlement, resettlement with
land and resettlement in the local place, agricultural PAPs will be resettled in countryside.
Firstly, the hamlets at resettlement areas will distribute the samne land to PAPs (contracted land,
private plot, foundation site and other land) as that of the local people according to the Plan, help
PAPs build their new houses to settle down, and solve practical problems in relocation. Secondly,
the hamlets will help PAPs take the advantage of the reservoir and local natural resources to
promote the construction of production facilities and economic development. From this year,
water conservancy works will be constructed including pumping station construction, well
digging, and transforming 210mu of dry land to irrigated land. In order to increase grain yield,
60mu of wasteland will be opened up and the land will be leveled. PAPs will be encouraged to
develop planting (apple, pear, jujube, and strawberry, etc.) breeding (pig, sheep, chicken, and
fish, etc.) and agricultural by-products processing.  Near Baoji City with convenient
transportation, PAPs can provide labor service to Baoji Brewery and other enterprises.
Combining agriculture with sideline properly, the economic income of PAPs will resume or
27



surpass their living standards before resettlement.
7.2 PAPs' Training
Resettlement is beyond just building new houses for PAPs. In order to obtain good results in
resettlement, training plans have be drawn up, and expenditure has to be increased to develop
PAPs' intellectual resources and promote their cultural level and technical skills on the basis of
the experience from resettlements at home and abroad. (See Table 7-1)
7.2.1 Training of Resettlement Knowledge, Laws, Regulations and Policies
For all the administrative officials at reservoir areas, resettlement is very unfamiliar.  As
resettlement is based on economy, policy and the people, it is very important for those officials
engaged in resettlement to get trained in resettlement knowledge, laws, regulations and policies.
In 1997, the headquarters of "One Floodgate, Two Power Plants" project at Baojixia held three
training classes: forty-five people took part in the classes including those leaders from the
headquarters, technicians, resettlement officials and officials from SDRI, the county and village.
Experts on resettlement were invited to teach the classes about resettlement laws, regulations and
policies. After discussion and survey on the spot with the designing department, the officials got
professional knowledge. In fact, this kind of training is very effective.
7.2.2 Training of Practical Technology
According to the reality, short-term training courses of practical technology will be held.
Agronomists from agricultural scientific research institutions at all levels and technology colleges
will be invited to teach at reservoir areas on the spot. It is planned that one to two training will be
held within three years in order to enable PAPs' to get rich.
7.2.3 Training of Technical Backbone and Specialized Household in PAPs
Key training should be carried out among the technical backbones and specialized households in
agricultural economic development. If they can promote their items of production, this part of
PAPs will be a mainstay in PAPs. Three to five PAPs selected annually will be sent to
agriculture, forest, breeding units at city and county levels, and enterprises at village to receive
special training. As technical backbones, they can be responsible for spreading advanced
technology, preventing plant diseases and eliminating pests, demonstrating planting technology
28



etc. (See Table 7-2)
7.2.4 Technical Support
* The County Agriculture Bureau will provide PAPs with technical support on planting.
* The County Water Conservancy Bureau will provide PAPs with technical support on
aquaculture.
* The County Livestock Bureau will provide PAPs with technical support on breeding.
7.3 Preferential Policies
* According to the national regulations, agricultural tax and grain purchased by the government
will be reduced in submerged and acquired places.
* According to the regulation promulgated by the Financial Bureau of Shaanxi province in 1984,
the foundation sites of PAPs will be distributed by villages in resettlement areas without paying
the tax for occupying cultivated land.
* The Tax Bureau will offer two to three-year tax-free service to for new enterprises of PAPs
because of submergence. Nevertheless, the application procedures should be gone through
according to regulations.
* PAPs have the priority of getting contracts of reconstruction projects at reservoir and
resettlement areas, such as roads, tractor-ploughing roads, breakwater and schools, etc.
* For those who are subordinated to the national construction and move out of reservoir areas on
time, they will be awarded RMB 1, 500 for each person.
* Loans with low interest rate will be provided to PAPs.
7.4 Environmental Protection
The reservoir has a total capacity of 500,000,000m3 with a useful capacity of 38,000,000m3,
29



providing enough water for 1,793,000mu's irrigation and generating electricity of
-           35,000,000kw/h per annum. After the reservoir is constructed, fish culture and tourism can be
developed, which will result in remarkable comprehensive economic benefits.
However, the economy and PAPs at reservoir areas will suffer certain loss caused by
submergence. In order to minimize and reduce this kind of loss, construction units and the
governments at all levels in reservoir areas will take the following protective measures:
* Land Protection
The submergence will inevitably reduce offerings of the environment to local people at
reservoir areas. Besides outward resettlement, the government will plan to protect and make
full use of the available land by taking measures to open up the wasteland, transform hillside
fields to terraced fields, transform dry land to rice field, and construct water conservancy
facilities.
* Infrastructure Reconstruction
According to the Plan, the infrastructures under submergence will be dealt with properly.
Water and power supply, roads, post and telecommunication services, TV and radio services
will be working before storing water.
- Water Quality Protection
Measures will be taken to clean pollutants and sterilize pollution resources in the reservoir
areas. Any establishment of new paper mills and chemical plants are not allowed in order to
prevent polluted water from being emitted into the reservoir. Any unplanned.cultivation of
the wasteland is strictly forbidden to conserve water and soil to prevent increasing the sand
quantity in the reservoir.
* Woods Protection
PAPs will be informed not to fell woods by seizing the chance of resettlement.
7.5 PAPs Income Forecasting (See Table 7-3)
Estimated preliminarily, PAPs' income will decrease in some degree by the submergence.
When the reservoir stores water in May 2002, it will submerge land of 1500mu with an
30



annual grain yield of 306,000kg. Therefore, the grain yield per capita will be reduced by
58kg. However, after land adjustment and development, the grain yield per PAP can reach
380kg in 2004, surpassing the old level.
When the reservoir stores water in May 2002, the annual economic income per capita will be
reduced by RMB 153. However, many development measures will be taken to increase PAP's
income. It is estimated that PAPs' income per capita can be the same with that of local people
in 2002, and can reach RMB890 in 2004, surpassing the old level before resettlement.
With good quality cultivated land and irrigation conditions, 256 PAPs relocated to Zhouyuan in
2001 can surpass the living standards of reservoir areas in the same year (grain yield per capita
400kg, annual income per capita RMB920).
7.6 Relocatees Integration with the Host People
The on-the-spot resettlement is all in the original hamlets or villages administered by the original
village government. PAPs and non-PAPs have lived together for a long time with the same
dialects and living habits, therefore they can live in harmony with the others.
The outward resettled PAPs will leave for new living environments but in the same county. The
living habits and dialects. are almost the same. If well arranged and prepared by ROs, PAPs can
get used to new living environments in a short period and live in harmony with the local people.

8 IMPLEMENTATION
8.1 Relocation Schedule
8. 1.1 Schedule:
According to the requirement of the project construction, the relocation will start in the second
half of 1998, and finish at the end of 2001.
8.1.2 Preparations
* Check survey data of submerged objects.
* Develop resettlements plan, and identify resettlement sites.
* Distribute funds in accordance with the budget breakdown approved by high authorities.
- Enact Resettlement Implementation Scheme.
* Hold mobilization meetings for PAPs, publicize and explain laws, regulations, and policies.
8.1.3 Transitional Houses
Generally, on-the-spot resettled PAPs need no transitional houses, as they have enough time and
building materials in one move to build new houses. For outward resettled PAPs, as it will take
them a long time to build new houses and they need transitional houses to live in and store
building materials, they can live in transitional houses temporarily rent in resettlement areas with
RMB 100 rental subsidy for per capita.
8.1.4 Relocation Subsidy (See the following table)
8.2 Special Considerations to Vulnerable Groups
According to the general survey, the vulnerable groups affected in the project are 12
impoverished households, 67 aged people over 60 years old, and 380 women. There is no
household enjoying Five Guarantees (childless and infirm old people who are guaranteed food,
clothing, medical care, housing and burial expenses) and minority nationality.  Special
considerations will be given to the vulnerable groups as follows:
35



* Impoverished Households. Each household can get relocation subsidy of RMB3000. Their
belongs will be transported free of charge.
* Aged people above 60 years old. Each person can get relocation subsidy of RMB1000 and
medical subsidy of RMB50. Their children will be responsible for relocating and taking care
of them.

8.4  Grievance Mechanisms
As citizens of the country, PAPs enjoy civil rights and undertake responsibilities entrusted by the
Constitution and Laws. PAPs' legal rights are inviolable under the protection of the laws. If their
legal rights have been violated, PAPs have rights to drop lawsuits in accordance with the laws to
obtain their interests and rights.
8.4.1 Channel of Grievance
* Letters and Calls Offices in governments at all levels can investigate and handle common
lawsuits for PAPs.
* ROs at all levels can hear grievances from relocatees.
* Headquarters of HDFP at Baojixia has the responsibility of supervising and inspecting
resettlement arranged by the local authorities. It can handle PAPs' lawsuits by auditing,
planning, inspecting and coordinating.
* The National Research Center of Resettlement (NRCR) at Hohai University, Nanjing, (the
monitoring unit of the project) is an independent monitoring and evaluating institute for
resettlement and social economy. It monitors resettlement work in accordance with national
regulations and has the responsibility of protect the legal rights and interests of PAPs. It can
accept and hear appeals of PAPs and submit to relevant authorities.
i Departments of administrative monitoring, auditing, inspecting, procuratorial work, and legal
affairs can accept and hear claims of PAPs.
37



8.4.2 Grievance Process
Clause 11 in Regulations of Land Acquisition Compensation and Resettlement in Large and
Medium-sized Water Conservancy & Hydroelectric Projects of the State Council stipulates:
Governments above county (city) level are responsible for implementing the approved RAP,
arranging and resettling PAPs according to the construction schedule. HDFP at Baojixia is a
large water conservancy & hydroelectric project of Shaanxi. Therefore, Baoji County
Government will be responsible for PAPs' resettlement.
For their legal rights and interests, PAPs can take legal proceedings against units at county and
city levels on the basis of the Administrative Procedural Law of the P. R. C. Clause 37 stipulates:
for administrative cases within the acceptance range of the People's Court, citizens, legal persons
or other organizations can first apply to higher administrative authorities for re-judgement. If the
re-judgement is not acceptable, legal proceedings then can be taken to the People's Court.
Alternatively, any administrative legal proceedings can be directly taken to the People's Court.
Therefore, the PAPs' lawsuit procedures are first appealing to PAP administrative channels at all
levels one by one, then taking legal proceedings to legal sections for unsolved lawsuit, or
alternatively directly taking legal proceedings to legal sections.

9.3  Compensation Budget
9.3.1 Land acquisition compensation and resettlement allowance
Compensation Basis and Times
Clause 5 and 6 of Regulations of Land Acquisition Compensation and Resettlement in Large
and Medium-sized Water Conservancy & Hydroelectric Projects stipulate: "Land acquisition
compensation is 3 to 4 times the average annual grain yield of the previous three years before
acquisition. Resettlement allowance for each agricultural PAP is 2 to 3 times the average
annual grain yield per mu of the previous three years before acquisition-" "If having more
than 1 mu of cultivated land at reservoir (including dam areas) areas, PAPs can only be given
allowance less than 8 times." According to the annual statistic report of the groups and
hamlets that will be submerged, the cultivated land per capita is 1.5m before submergence.
As 79% of submerged land is high quality cultivated land, it is not so easy to resettle the
people. Therefore, the land compensation and resettlement allowance will be 8 times of the
average annual grain yield of the previous three years before acquisition (resettlement
allowance is 3 times).
Compensation standards for non-cultivated land are: on the basis of the Regulations,
compensation for economic forest is 3 times of the annual output of the plain land, while
compensation for foundation site is 5 times.
* Calculation of the grain yield per mu on cultivated land
> On the basis of the 3-year (1994-1996) statistics, the average annual grain yield per mu
of every cultivated land is: 766kg on irrigated land, 410kg on dry plain land, 250kg on
hill side fields, 720kg on river banks.
> Each grain unit price is calculated according to the market price in 1996 at Baoji County
(See Table 9-1)
> Considering vegetables, economic plants and by-products, 10% of the value of the main
products will be added.
* Calculation of cultivated land compensation and resettlement allowance
41



Formula: Cultivated Land Compensation + Resettlement Allowance = Cultivated Land
Quantity x Annual Grain Yield per mu x By-product (10%) x Compensation Times
> Calculation of the annual main product yield per mu (See Table 9-1)
> Cultivated land compensation and resettlement allowance (See Table 5-3)
Irrigated land of 421.65mu x RMB999.00/mu yearx 1.1 x 8 years = RMB3,706,800
Dry plain land of 140.38mu x RMB693.55/ mu year x 1.1 x 8 years =RMB1,008,400
Flood land of 268.71mu x RMB6190500/ mu year x 1.1 x 8 years = RMB1,463,800
Foundation site of 37.58mu x RMB693.55/ mu year x 1.1 x 4 years = RMB 143,400
9.3.2 House Compensation of RMB2,541,800 (See Table 5-3)
9.3.3 Attached Facilities Compensation of RMB531,600 (See Table 5-4)
9.3.4 Special Facilities Compensation of RMB6,438,800 (See Table 5-5)

42



9.5 Fund Balance
Resettlement allowance is RMB316,522,200 and reconstruction cost is RMBI16,522,200. It is
basically balanced. (See Table 9-3)
9.6  Fund Distribution
9.6.1 Distribution Structure (See Table 94)
9.6.2 Fund Usage
* Each hamlet will have its budget of collective compensation for land development, PAPs'
production and rehabilitation. County RO controls all these budgets. Only approved by the
higher authorities can the funds be used.
*  Compensation for individual PAP will be calculated according to each household. After signing
a contract, PAPs can get compensation by installments on the basis of the resettlement schedule.
-  Special funds will be appropriated to County RO. After signing contracts with RO, relocation
and construction units for constructing special facilities can get installments from County RO.
*  Unpredictable funds and other funds will be under the control of County RO. Only approved by
the higher authorities can the funds be used.
*  Group No.1 and No.3 of Chengli Hamlet, affected by immersion, will be resettled by project
measures. The land acquisition compensation, resettlement allowance, and other individual
compensation will be appropriated to County RO, used to construct embankrnents, pumping
stations, farmland and develop economy for PAP, etc.
9.7 Fund Management
Efficient management and usage of resettlement fund is the key of resettlement. Governments at
all levels must make sure that resettlement fund is the compensation for PAPs. The fund should
be managed as basic construction fund on the basis of the construction items, procedures, plans
and budgets. As for compensation for individual PAP, county ROs and local banks will monitor
4a;



and control the appropriation and practical usage. After signing the contracts, PAPs can be
compensated according to the schedule.
9.8  Fund Utilization
9.8.1 Principle
The usage principle is: centralized management, classified responsibility, special fund on special
purpose, contracted units for contracted projects.
9.8.2 Monitoring on Fund Use
Resettlement fund must be spent on resettlement only. Regulations in Accounting Law and
financing management stipulated by provincial and municipal governments have to be strictly
carried out. Professional accountants should be disposed to manage the fund. The monitoring
system must be strengthened to put an end to unlawful practice, such as corruption, back-hold,
extravagance and waste. All limited funds must be used to resettle PAPs.
* Internal Monitoring: establish management of plan, project, finance, public letters and calls,
and statistic reports, etc., in the banks and ROs at all levels. Responsible resettlement
departments must organize financial inspections annually. Any problem must be solved in
time.
* External Monitoring: National Research Center of Resettlement of Hohai University mainly
takes the task that meanwhile monitored by departments of finance, bank, discipline
inspecting, auditing, planning, statistics, letters and calls of Baoji County. Those who
misappropriate, hold back and waste resettlement fund will be severely prosecuted whatever
positions they hold.
* Fund Auditing
Auditing departments in county, city and province at all levels are responsible for auditing
once a year. After using up the funds, an auditing department in China, entrusted by the
World Bank, will audit all funds usage. The final auditing is up to the National Auditing
Office and relevant ROs.

Shaanxi province has already stipulated that land occupancy tax and agricultural tax are
exempted.

12 ANALYSIS
12.1 Risk Analysis
Object statistics will be registered household by household. Roughly counted, the data may
not be accurate. Furthermore, changes such as social economy, population increase, house
increase and other object increase may happen during the long period of construction.
* Transportation accident and hidden danger of vulnerable groups during relocation period may
appear during relocation with a long distance.
* Main risks of infrastructures and service facilities refer to technical problems and quality risk
in construction.
* Risks of fund management refer to inefficient and messy management, misappropriation and
back-hold.
- Risks of rehabilitation refer to blind development, especially those economic development
items greatly influenced by market, which may cause fund loss and low benefits.
12.2 Environmental CapacityAnalysis
Reservoir area: reservoir submergence, immersion and cave-in will affect 11 groups (hamlets)
and land of 12025mu including cultivated land of 1500mu (occupies 12.5% of total cultivated
land), i.e., the cultivated land loss per capita is 0.31mu. Measures will be taken in accordance
with RAP to protect cultivated land of 443mu at Group No. 1 at Chengli, Guchuan and
Xin'an. However, the net loss of cultivated land is 957mu, i.e., land loss per capita is
0.28mu. In order to reduce the pressure of environmental capacity, 256 PAPs will be outward
resettled. There are 1462.5mu calculated on the basis of 2.5mu per PAP in the reservoir areas.
Cultivated land of 993.27mu has to be adjusted for 428 on-the-spot resettled PAPs.
Cultivated land of 0. 12mu per capita will be adjusted at 11 submerged hamlets. At Fangtang
and Lijiahe with more on-the-spot PAPs, the government plans to build 3 pumping stations to
transform dry land of 210mu to irrigated land, transform hillside fields of 150mu to plain
terraced land. Land quality and grain yield can be improved to lessen the environmental
pressure. It is estimated that on-the-spot PAPs will resume and surpass their old living
62



standards two years after water storage if the plan is implemented fully.
* Resettlement area: resettlement area at Zhouyuan Town has 20 administrative hamlets with a
population of 42,307 and cultivated land of 56850mu (1.34mu per capita). 256 PAPs will be
resettled there. As there are only 0.016mu of cultivated land per capita adjusted to PAPs,
with measures of leveling land, completing irrigation system, and digging motor-pumping
wells, the environmental capacity of resettlement area will not be affected.

13 RESETTLEMENT ACTION PLAN FOR GAN RIVER RESERVOIR
DAM-ADDING PROJECT & LUOHUI DITCH HEADWORK DAM-
ADDING AND FLOODGATE-ADDING PROJECT AT BAOJIXIA
IRRIGATION DISTRICT
13.1 Introduction
13.1.1 Gan River Reservoir Dam-adding Project (GRRDP) is a remoulding project of water
storage to increase the water supply at irrigated area of Baojixia. The normal water
storage level used to be 541m with a capacity of 54,400,000m3, and the beneficial
reservoir capacity is 43,800,000m3. The length of backwater is 14km. After the
project of dam-adding, the normal storage level of the reservoir will increase by 3.7m
to 544.78m, the reservoir capacity 59,500,000m3, and the beneficial reservoir capacity
24, 420,000m3. There are 857mu of land and 164 PAPs affected by submergence and
cave-in.
The submerged land of 857mu is located oddly in 7 hamlets of 3 villages in 2
counties. Generally, 20 to 50mu of land will be acquired in each hamlet, i.e., the land
loss per capita is only 0.0lmu. Furthermore, 89% of land acquired are those beside
cliffs and the hillside fields seldom cultivated with poor quality and low grain yield.
The living standards of PAPs will not be greatly affected after adjusting the land loss.
13.1.2 Louhui Ditch Headwork Dam-adding & Floodgate-adding Project (LDHDFP) is a
water storage regulation project. The water level will increase by 2m to 410m with a
capacity of 7,000,000m3, and its beneficial reservoir capacity is 4,400,000m3.
The submerged land of 486mu with 128PAPs is located in 6 hamlets of 2 villages in
Pucheng and Dali counties. Floods affect 53% of the submerged land every five years.
Because of poor land quality, there is only one grain yield per year. The land per PAP
of about 3mu after land acquisition is close to the land per capita of 3.24mu before
land acquisition. Moreover, adequate measures will be taken to minimize the
influence on PAPs' living standards.
64



13.2 Social and Economic Survey
13.2.1 Survey has been made at 5 hamlets of 4 villages in Gan County and LiQuan affected
by GRRDP. The survey involved 5,727 people and 10,704mu of cultivated land
(1.87mu per capita). Mainly living on agricultural production, this part of PAPs has
an income of RMB1749.11 per capita, which is comparatively high in the irrigated
area.
According to the survey on population, educational level and vulnerable groups in
five hamlets, the population is 4,820, including 2,377 male and 2,443 female, 2,647
people at primary school level occupying 56%, 1,512 people at middle school level
occupying 31%, 374 people from 108 impoverished households, 603 aged people
above 60 years old, 11 handicapped and 8 retarded.
13.2.2 According to the survey at 6 hamlets of 2 villages in Pucheng and Chengcheng County
affected by LDHDFP, the population is 4,392. The total cultivated land is 12,650mu
(including irrigated land of 6,025mu, day plain land of 6,625mu) and cultivated land
per capita is 2.88mu. The grain yield per capita is 789kg and economic income per
capita is RMB913. The submerged area is a place where people mainly rely on grain
production with no other resources of economic income.
According to the survey of 4,392 people in the 6 submerged hamlets on educational
level and vulnerable groups, there are 350 illiterates, 2,550 people at primary school
level occupying 58% of the total population, 1,492 people at middle school level
occupying 25%, 486 people from impoverished households occupying 0.1%, 1,088
aged people above 60 years old occupying 25%.
13. 3 Loss Estimation and Compensation
The main loss in both projects is land. There is altogether 1,343mu of land acquired
because of submergence and cave-in, including 857mu of land acquired in GRRDP,
486mu in LDHDFP. A total amount of RMB10,394,500 will be compensated to
PAPs, in which the land acquisition compensation and resettlement allowance at
LDHDFP is RMB6,700 to RMB7,600 per mu, and those at GRRDP is RM7,600 per
mu. In accordance with regulations stipulated in the Land Law, the compensation is
65



multiplying the average grain yield per mu of three years before land acquisition by
the annual output (comprehensive market price in 1997 plus 10% of by-product
price), then by 8 times. Stipulated by Land Law, land acquisition compensation is 3 to
4 times of the average annual grain yield of the land three years before acquisition,
resettlement allowance for agricultural PAPs is 2 to 3 times of the average grain yield
per mu of the land three years before acquisition.
13.4 Rehabilitation and Resettlement
The both projects will cause to submerge the lands but no houses. Therefore, without
relocation, only land adjustment and other construction measures can be taken to resume the
PAPs' production and make up for their loss, so as not to affect their living because of
constructing the reservoirs.
13.4.1 Acquire land with compensation and re-adjust the hamlets. In accordance with the
Land Law of the P.R.C., construction units will provide adequate compensation and
resettlement subsidy for acquired land. The funds will be used on land development
(e.g. cultivating wasteland, undertaking new water conservancy projects and scientific
farming, etc.). In order not to affect the PAPs' living, the hamlets will be responsible
for adjusting land for them with the same quantity and quality as that of other
villagers.
Adjusting the land is the only way to resettle the PAPs' living because the submerged
land is scattered. The survey shows in one hamlet there is very little acquired land
with O.Olmu of land decreased per capita. Moreover, the quality of the land is very
poor, most of which are waste hillside fields and flooded land.
The responsibility of the towns, villages and hamlets at all levels.
1) The governments of the towns are responsible for planning the land adjustment and
monitoring the usage of land compensation and resettlement subsidy.
2) The committees of the villages are responsible for coordinating the land adjustment
between the hamlets, monitoring the quality and quantity of the land adjustment,
implementing the land development plans.
3) The hamlets are responsible for implementing the land adjustment and organizing
their people to undertake water conservancy projects, etc.
66



* Procedures of paying land compensation and resettlement subsidy.
1) The governments at all levels of the reservoir area must make clear that this land
compensation for a special purpose owned by PAPs is used to compensate for
PAPs' loss. The violators will be sternly penalized.
2) Monitored by the county land sections, the construction units deposit the land
compensation into the banks for the hamlets with acquired land.
3) When the hamlets want to use the land compensation, they need apply and explain
the usage to get approved by the county resettlement sections.
4) Monitored by the county auditing sections and the people, the land compensation
must be used on items to develop the land, lift PAPs out of poverty, and build up a
fortune.
13.4.2 Build small-size pumping stations to make up for the loss. The both reservoirs will
submerge 1,343mu of land with 292 PAPs. Adjusting 876mu of land for PAPs in the
affected hamlets (3.Omu per capita) will certainly affect the rest of the people. The
survey shows building pumping stations to change the dry land into irrigated land can
make up for the loss so as not to affect the people's living. It is planned to build
pumping stations in the 8 hamlets respectively including 4 in Gan River Reservoir
(Luojia Hamlet, Suxing Hamlet, Xixu Hamlet, Yanhe Hamlet) and 4 in LDHDFP
reservoir (Sujiahe Hamlet, Mayu Hamlet, Suo Hamlet, Zhuangtou Hamlet) with
1,200mu of increased valid irrigated land and 120,000kg of increased grain output.
13.4.3 Build embankmnent to protect land. In LDHDFP, construction units plan to build a
breakwater of 3m high and 500m long along the right bank to protect over 300mu of
cultivated land of high quality.
13.4.4 Governments stipulate that it is tax-free for submerged hamlets in order to help
develop the production.
13.4.5 The young and robust peasants of affected hamlets will be organized by construction
units to take part in project labor service to increase their income.
67



13.5 Budget
* For 857mu of land acquired in GRRDP, the compensation rate is RMB7,640 per
mu, and the total compensation is RMB6,547,500.
* For 486mu of land acquired in LDHDFP, the compensation rate is RMB6,700 per
mu, and the total compensation is RMB3,256,000.
13.6 Implementation Schedule
* It is planned that land acquisition of both projects will be finished by the end of
1999.
*  Consulted with the local governments by construction units, the land adjustment
with compensation and development of cultivated land will be finished at the first
half of 2000.
e  The construction units will design 8 pumping stations and finish building at the end
of 2000. Therefore, those hamlets can use it after testing.
13.7 Organization
The Irrigation Management Bureau of Baojixia, Shaanxi province is responsible for
land acquisition due to reservoir submergence and cave-in, and resettlement in GRRDP.
Luohui Ditch Management Bureau of Shaanxi province is responsible for land
acquisition due to reservoir submergence, and resettlement in LDHDFP.
As land acquisition and resettlement is a complex network, construction units should
pay high attention to it, assign responsible and capable people to be in charge,
implement RAP in accordance with national policies and the two reservoirs' reality.

WORKING OUTLINE OF INDEPENDENT
MONITORING & EVALUATION FOR PAPS'RESETTLEMENT OF
REMOLDING PROJECT OFIRRIGA TION DISTRICT IN
GUANGZHONG, SHAANXI PROVINCE
1.  Brief Description of the Project
The project includes the dam-adding & floodgate-adding project of water conservancy
headwork at Baoji Irrigation Ditch, the dam-adding project at Gan River Reservoir, and
the dam-adding & floodgate-adding project of water conservancy headwork at Luohiu
Irrigation Ditch. The RAP is drawn up by Shaanxi Provincial Resettlement Office
(SPRO). It is carried out by headquarters of "One Floodgate, Two Power Plants" Major
Project of Baoji Irrigation Ditch, the dam-adding project at Gan River Reservoir, and
the dam-adding & floodgate-adding project of water conservancy headword at Luohui
Irrigation Ditch. The work of independent monitoring and evaluation is up to the
National Research Center of Resettlement (NRCR).
2.  Goal of Resettlement Monitoring and Evaluation
Research Center of Resettlement will carry out the independent monitoring and
evaluation on the basis of "Involuntary Resettlement" -Word Bank Operational
Directive 4.30, and Appendix 3 - "Technical Regulations of Monitoring & Evaluation
in Involuntary Resettlement" - Technical Document No. 80- "Involuntary Resettlement
in Development Project- Policy of World Bank Loaned Project". The evaluating
follow-up will be done according to the inspection on the progress, capital and
management of land acquisition and resettlement, and comparison of production and
living conditions before and after resettlement. While reporting to the World Band and
responsible institutions, Research Center must provide information and advice for
responsible institution for reference.  By means of Independent Monitoring &
Evaluation Report, the World Bank and responsible institutions can find out problems
of whether land acquisition and resettlement have been carried out by schedule with
high quality, and then give advice to improve the work.

4. Working Flow
The frame listed below shows the working flow of independent monitoring and
evaluation.
5. Organization and Division of Resettlement Monitoring & Evaluation
5.1 Shaanxi Provincial Water Conservancy Department (SPWCD) has entrusted NRCR with
the work of concrete research, data collection, calculation analysis, and result checking.
5.2 NRCR will set up the Resettlement Monitoring & Evaluation Group of the Remolding
74



Project of Irrigated Area in Guangzhong, Shaanxi province. The Group will do the
monitoring and evaluation work guided by project officers of the World Bank.
Furthermore, it will draw up the outline of monitoring and evaluation, set up the research
spots, investigate on the spot, analyze calculation work, and write the report of
Resettlement Monitoring & Evaluation.
5.3 All resettlement administrative institutions should play a supporting role when the Group
investigates on the spot.
6. Methods of Resettlement Monitoring & Evaluation
6.1 The monitoring and evaluation will be carried out by combining investigation on the spot,
calculation analysis and experts' comprehensive evaluation.
6.2 The research work will be carried out by combining sampling and all-round research.
All-round investigation will be made on aspects of working process, capital, organization
and administration, etc. Moreover, sampling survey will be made on aspects of housing
demolition and resettlement, and living standards of PAPs.
6.3 The sampling survey will not be made by classifying and random sampling. Typical
resettled households and enterprises will be followed and surveyed. The sampling
proportion is 5% of the PAPs.
6.4 The survey will be made by means of visiting, negotiating, checking documents, files and
data, etc.
6.5 Besides written materials, materials as photographs, tape records, videotapes will be
collected. Moreover, the Information Management System of Remolding Project of
Irrigated Area in Guanzhong, Shaanxi province will be set up.
7. Schedule of Independent Resettlement Monitoring and Evaluation
September 1998: set up independent resettlement monitoring and evaluation group to
draw up working outline.
75



Before October 1999: finish the preparation work, i.e. compilation of survey outline and
forms, establishment of monitoring system, clarification of tasks, selection of survey
samples.
The period of monitoring and evaluation lasts from 1999 to 2002.
November 1999: 1st monitoring; submit Monitoring & Evaluation Report No. 1.
July 2000: 2nd monitoring; submit Monitoring and Evaluation Report No. 2.
November 2000: 3rd monitoring; submit Monitoring and Evaluation Report No. 3.
November 2001: 4 monitoring; submit Monitoring and Evaluation Report No. 4.
November 2002: 5 monitoring; submit Monitoring and Evaluation Report No. 4.
Most PAPs are involved in the dam-adding & floodgate-adding project of water
conservancy headwork at Baoji Irrigation Ditch. There is only land acquisition but no
PAPs involved in the dam-adding & floodgate-adding project of water conservancy
headwork at Luohui Irrigation Ditch. So the first four monitoring only involves Baojixia,
while the 5h monitoring involves all projects with PAPs.
