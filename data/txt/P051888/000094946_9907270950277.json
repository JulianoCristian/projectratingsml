The favorable impact\n            upon the environment from this project is in agriculture\n            with the improvement in irrigation efficiency and multiple\n            croping indexes. The major unfavorable impacts and\n            mitigation measures follow. The construction of resource\n            engineering will inundate a part of cultivated farmland and\n            necessitate the removal of some local inhabitants -\n            mitigated by a careful resettlement plan. An increase in\n            dust, waste water, debris, and noise will occur during the\n            construction phase. An increase in the amount of water\n            diversion in the irrigation districts will slightly\n            encourage the occurrence frequency of thermophicic\n            agro-diseases and pests.
