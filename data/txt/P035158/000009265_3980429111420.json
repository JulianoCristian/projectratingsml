This\n            detailed socio-economic survey of the affected households is\n            written to prepare for drawing up a comprehensive and viable\n            resettlement and rehabilitation plan. It studies the impact\n            of land acquisition, a pre-requisite for formulating an\n            economic rehabilitation plan. It finds a substantial number\n            of land holdings reduced to lower levels and many people\n            becoming landless after project-related land acquisition.\n            The study shows a slight decrease in the overall irrigated\n            area under dug wells but an increase of irrigated area under\n            bore/tube wells. Total household production loss appears\n            high, and calls for reasonable rehabilitation support to\n            \"project-affected persons\"--persons or households\n            who lost 25 percent or more of their land and the landless\n            attached to affected households. The report relies on\n            household surveys to reveal the qualitative and quantitative\n            changes in housing, livestock ownership, the displacement of\n            cultivators into wage labor, agricultural implements and\n            equipment, total annual household income and expenditures,\n            and poverty levels."}, "docdt": "1995-12-31T00:00:00Z"}
