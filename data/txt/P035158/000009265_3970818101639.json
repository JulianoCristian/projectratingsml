development and scheme rehabilitation works begun\n            under the Second Andhra Pradesh Irrigation Project (APII),\n            and thus realize the potential for increasing agricultural\n            productivity and rural incomes in two economically backward\n            regions of Andhra Pradesh. The other objectives are: (1)\n            pilot implementation of management reforms to improve public\n            irrigation performance and to upgrade the government s\n            capacity to improve irrigation services and command area\n            management; (2) retrospectively mitigating the adverse\n            impacts of land acquisition under the APII, and proactively\n            provide economic rehabilitation for those families still to\n            be affected by completing the Srisailam Right Branch Canal\n            Project (SRBC) works; (3) ensuring the safety and\n            sustainability of three dams supplying water to the project\n            areas; (4) implementing a mandated regional program of\n            environmental improvements, safeguards, and natural resource\n            conservation; and (5) improving government monitoring and\n            evaluation capacity for large irrigation projects. Six\n            components are needed to achieve project objectives: (1)\n            Irrigation Development and Rehabilitation Works-supporting\n            completion of all SRBC civil works begun under   APII; and\n            selected civil works under the Sriramasagar Project (SRSP);\n            (2) Agricultural Services Programs-applying research and\n            demonstrating irrigation practices and agronomy,\n            establishing water users association, and providing training\n            to staff and farmers;  (3) Resettlement and Rehabilitation\n            Program-economically rehabilitating families adversely\n            affected by acquiring past and proposed land for SRBC and\n            SRSP works; (4) Environmental Management Plan-supporting\n            India s mandated regional program of environmental\n            safeguards and nature conservation in command area\n            districts; (5) Dam Safety Assurance Works-supporting\n            investments to maintain the structural and mechanical\n            integrity of dams, and preventing failure of the Srisailam\n            dam spillway; and (6) Project Monitoring and Evaluation."}, "docdt": "1997-04-25T00:00:00Z"}
