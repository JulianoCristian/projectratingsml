objective of the Yemen Private\n            Sector Growth and Social Protection Development Policy Grant\n            is to foster private sector growth in the non-hydrocarbon\n            part of the economy, to improve key aspects of the public\n            financial management system, and to mitigate the impact of\n            the ongoing fuel subsidy reduction on the poor by creating a\n            more inclusive and more equitable cash transfer system. The\n            Project has four components. Component one comprises of\n            private sector growth and employment which includes\n            streamlining of investment incentives and the simplification\n            of business entry procedures. Component two consists of\n            enhancing financial intermediation and improving access to\n            finance by the effective launch of a credit registry and the\n            completion of the framework for micro finance. Component\n            three involves public financial management and governance\n            which consists of the introduction of a medium term\n            expenditure framework (MTEF) and of expenditure Commitment\n            Control Systems (CCS) as well as the automation of the\n            government financial accounts (AFMIS). Component four\n            includes the creation of efficiency and equity of the social\n            protection system by the establishment of a targeting method\n            to operationalize the Law on Social Welfare of 2008 (Law no.\n            39), and by the approval of the by-laws to the Social\n            Welfare Law."}, "docdt": "2010-11-12T00:00:00Z"}
