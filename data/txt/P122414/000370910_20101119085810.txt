                               interest for financial service companies.

                               policies;
                               Introduction of expenditure Commitment Control Systems (CCS): The
                               Commitment Control System is operational, and potential arrears are captured,

                               Automation of the government financial accounts (AFMIS): Transparent
                               and timely reporting of budget outcomes has been enhanced.

Objective(s) and Contribution   The main objective of the proposed Development Policy Grant is to foster private
to CAS                          sector growth in the non-hydrocarbon part of the economy, to improve key aspects
                                of the public financial management system, and to mitigate the impact of the
                                ongoing fuel subsidy reduction on the poor by creating a more inclusive and more
                                equitable cash transfer system.

                                This DPG is fully consistent with the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) FY10-13
                                presented to the Board of Executive Directors in May 2009, and will help implement
                                and achieve CAS objectives. The four DPG pillars are linked as follows to the CAS
                                themes: (i) creating conditions for private sector growth and diversification is clearly
                                supporting the first CAS theme; (ii) improving budget management is a key part of
                                the second theme; and (iii) strengthening the social safety net is helping implement
                                the third CAS theme. In all three areas of the CAS themes the DPG contributes also
                                to ongoing Bank-supported investment and technical assistance operations being
                                implemented in Yemen as well as past, current or planned AAA work.

Risks and Risk Mitigation       The Program faces significant risks, which include:

                                Political and economic performance risks. The ability of the Bank Group to engage
                                with Yemen would be affected by a reversal of recently negotiated truce and on-
                                going dialogue with rebels in the north, and a widening of political unrest in parts of
                                southern governorates as well as a widening of the activities of Al-Qaeda in Arabian
                                Peninsula (AQAP). A deteriorating political environment in Yemen would affect the
                                Bank's ability to implement its assistance program. The DPG could also be affected
                                by risks related to the Government's commitment to an ambitious reform program in
                                an electoral year. Given these political uncertainties, the operation has been
                                designed as a single tranche DPG, as a first comprehensive step towards supporting
                                the government's reform program. A mitigating factor is also that this DPG supports
                                a reform agenda that has been adopted by the current Government, and is receiving
                                support through ongoing technical and financial assistance programs by the Bank,
                                IMF and other donors.

                                Risk of underperforming investment response. Even if Yemen brings its security
                                situation under control, and even if fundamental reforms advance, investor
                                perceptions may only change with a lag. In this case, PSD reforms might bring little
                                private investment response. To some extent, building the strategic capacity of the
                                General Investment Authority with its new focus on image building and strategic
                                targeting of investors may help to mitigate this perceptual lag.

                                Oil revenue volatility risks: Yemen has been subject to significant changes in its oil
                                revenues, reflecting its dependence on crude oil exports. This makes it challenging
                                to conduct fiscal policy with a medium-term orientation, while maintaining adequate
                                levels of public spending. To help mitigate this risk, this operation aims to support
                                reforms that would help reduce Yemen's fiscal and socio-economic exposure to
                                abrupt changes in oil prices and revenues, as explained elsewhere in this document.

                                Security risks: As in many conflict-affected countries, a deterioration of the security
                                situation constitutes a large source of risk for the operation. The capacity of the


                                                         vii
               Yemeni Government to maintain security will be a determinant of the extent of risk
               that persists. However, the financing from this DPG, and the fact that it is part of a
               wider effort that includes substantial IMF resources, would provide the external
               financing needed to shore up macroeconomic weaknesses. This would help the
               Government maintain its recurrent and investment spending while still providing
               essential services to the population in a fragile and volatile environment, which may
               help to mitigate some domestic security risks.

               Fiduciary risks: The fiduciary risk is rated high on the basis of the analytical work
               conducted in the area of public financial management. The 2005 CFAA rated the
               fiduciary risk as high; the 2008 PEFA report pointed to continuous weaknesses but
               noted positive improvements and reforms, including the issuance of new legislation's
               and laws supporting the enhancement of the Bank is, however, supporting the
               Yemeni Government in strengthening its public financial management system
               through a comprehensive PFM Reform Project, which will help to improve the
               Government's fiduciary environment by supporting budget preparation, execution,
               transparency and accountability. The Bank continues to strengthening the Supreme
               Audit Institution's independence and building its auditing capacity to ensure a
               broadened accountability and transparency in the use of public funds as key
               elements for mitigating the fiduciary risk.

               Technical capacity risk: Limited technical capacity of the civil service to implement
               the reform program. Recent reforms and the companion technical assistance projects
               in each of the three pillars of this DPG are designed to help build the requisite
               capacity.

                 INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT AGENCY
         PROGRAM DOCUMENT FOR A PROPOSED PRIVATE SECTOR
    GROWTH AND SOCIAL PROTECTION DEVELOPMENT POLICY GRANT TO THE
                         REPUBLIC OF YEMEN

                                        I.    INTRODUCTION
1. This program document proposes a Development Policy Grant (DPG) in the amount of SDR 45
million (US$70 million equivalent) to support the Government of Yemen promoting non-
hydrocarbon private sector growth and employment, strengthening public financial management,
and improving the targeting of the social protection system in light of the oil subsidy reform
affecting especially the poor. The objective of the proposed DPG is to assist the Government's
economic reform program, jointly with the support from the IMF under the Extended Credit Facility
(ECF), and foster private sector growth to create news sources of revenues and employment while oil
revenues are declining, and aim to mitigate the impact of the ongoing fuel subsidy reduction on the poor
by creating a more inclusive and more equitable cash transfer system. The supported reform program is
medium- and longer term in nature and requires sustained assistance, including through a more
programmatic approach towards which this operation could bridge.

2. As a result of the international financial crisis and subsequent declining oil prices, Yemen lost 8
percent of GDP in revenues since 2008 because of decreasing production and lower international oil
prices. The fiscal revenues from oil peaked in 2008 when the international price for petroleum peaked.
The revenue loss incurred since then amounts to 8 percent of GDP, or about 50 percent of 2008 oil
revenues. Hence, after running a balanced budget (cash basis) in 2008, the country suffered a fiscal
deficit (cash basis) of 8 percent of GDP in 2009. The authorities have adopted and are implementing a
fiscal adjustment package that will reduce the fiscal deficit down to 5.6 percent of GDP in 2010.

3. An important component of the adjustment is the reduction in the subsidies for domestic energy
prices, which required over the past 5 years on average 20 to 25 percent of public expenditure. By
contrast, in 2009 expenditure for education were 6.4 percent of GDP and expenditure for health reached
2.1 percent of GDP. Apart of the fiscal angle, this measure is also welcome because the experience with
energy subsidies in Yemen suggests that they induce bad governance, are a main source for corruption,
and encourage an unsustainable use of resources, for energy as much as for water.1 However, the removal
of the subsidies will require a reform of the current social assistance system to target and help those most
in need during the adjustment period.

4. The Government program sets the basis for diversification and growth of the non-hydrocarbon
economy (see also Annex 1). Although Yemen will continue to rely on the oil and gas sector, Yemen is
forecast to become a net-importer of petroleum product in 4 to 5 years, if no new oil is found and current
policies, including subsidizing domestic energy consumption, are maintained. Therefore, the government
is accompanying its efforts at fiscal consolidation with measures that improve the business environment,
especially targeting the non-oil sector. These measures include the reform of the investment code, the
overhaul of the investment related tax incentive systems, the restructuring of the special economic zones
regime, and measures to improve the availability of credit. Such reform policies are complemented by
investments in infrastructure. It is expected that the continued growth of the non-oil economy will
generate income and employment opportunities as well revenue for the public sector.

 The impact on water resources is leveraged through cheap diesel which runs pumps going down more than 1000m
below the surface, with energy being the main production costs.

5. The proposed operation focuses on reforms critical to setting the conditions for non-
hydrocarbon growth in Yemen, while protecting the poor (see also Annex 2). Strengthening non-
hydrocarbon growth and governance provides the common goal for the operation that focuses on: (i)
improving the investment climate for non-hydrocarbon growth; (ii) widening access to credit; (iii)
strengthening of public financial management; and (iv) making the social protection system more
efficient. First, private sector reforms will generate non-hydrocarbon growth, broader employment
opportunities, and will eventually offer fiscal revenue alternatives. A functioning banking system will
facilitate economic diversification and non-oil growth. Second, strengthening budget management and
governance is critical to ensure aggregate fiscal discipline and reduce waste and unproductive
expenditures and favoring public investment. Third, a social protection system can only be truly efficient,
if it is fiscally sustainable and equitable, which can be achieved through a retargeting of the beneficiary
base of the Social Welfare Fund and a strengthening of its operations.

6. The four reform areas are supported by ongoing technical assistance by the Bank, the IMF, and
other donors. Companion Bank Group projects are under implementation in the areas of public financial
management, private sector reform (IFC led), and social protection. These projects have been closely
coordinated with the IMF and donors, including DFID, the European Commission, USAID, the UN,
GTZ/KfW, and CSOs/NGOs (e.g., OXFAM). In addition, the proposed operation is closely coordinated
with the IMF arrangement under the ECF.

7. This DPG provides a timely response to Yemen's financing needs and opens the door for a
comprehensive dialogue and partnership with the country. This one tranche DPG offers the Bank the
opportunity to launch a well-conceptualized dialogue for the medium term with the Government in
support of continuous policy reforms based on Yemen's upcoming new Development Strategy for
Poverty Reduction, 2011 to 2015. The actions taken under this program and the complementary IMF
operation contain important legislative initiatives and confirm the commitment of the authorities for a
fiscal and structural reform program that moves to reduce the oil-dependency of the economy.
Commitments made to international financing institutions will help lock in the appropriate reform
measures, especially as the country faces legislative and presidential elections.

8. This World Bank operation complements the IMF ECF arrangement approved on July 30th
2010.2 The government is currently financing the fiscal deficit primarily with domestic resources. As one
of the consequences of this constraint, international reserves have fallen considerably since 2008. The
Board of the IMF approved on July 30, 2010, an arrangement under the Extended Credit Facility (ECF)
for Yemen in support of its reform program which aims at regaining fiscal sustainability and accelerating
non-hydrocarbon growth. Together with the ECF arrangement, building on lessons learned in fragile
states, the Bank's intervention aims to ensure that critical and poverty relieving public spending is
maintained, contributing to stability in the country. This operation would offer external budget support
amounting to 0.2 percent of GDP.

9. This DPG would add value to the portfolio of existing Bank operations in Yemen and help
achieve the objectives laid out in the Bank's strategy to support Yemen. In particular, it brings
together different elements of Bank assistance under a consolidated, coherent reform package; lays out
prior actions in areas not directly addressed in previous operations, such as the links between the Yemen's
Poverty Reduction Strategy and the state budget as well as the rationalization of the social protection
system; and helps accelerate policy decisions in a number of reform areas, thereby energizing the reform
agenda and providing synergy with the implementation of the investment and technical assistance project
portfolio (e.g., PFM modernization, social protection projects, and private sector reforms). This selection

is consistent with the thematic areas of the Bank's Country Assistance Strategy 2010-2013 for Yemen.
The prior actions focus largely on institutions and processes. This is because many of Yemen's
institutions are weak and have limited capacity.

                                         II. COUNTRY CONTEXT

A.       Recent Economic and Political Developments
10. Since 2000, income growth has been low and the needed reform have been stymied by weak
governance and unresolved conflicts in the country. During the 1990s, Yemen had achieved annual
GDP growth rates allowing for an acceptable 2 percent per-capita growth. GDP growth declined as
security concerns gained prominence after September 11, 2001, and the conflict in the Sa'ada governorate
led to a series of six domestic wars since 2004, with the last ending by a truce agreement in February
2010.3 The quality of governance has remained weak over this period and important structural reform
initiatives like the privatization process, civil service reform and judicial reforms stalled. An increasing
concentration of economic and political power alienated citizens, lowered the state's legitimacy, and
weakened the traditional systems of social cohesion, governance and accountability, while "modern" rules
to guarantee good governance and accountability are not yet fully operational.

11. Until 2008 oil revenues rose steadily, blocking incentives to reform. Despite the decline in oil
production since 2001, pressures for fiscal prudence were not strong as oil revenues increased due to the
steady increases of international oil prices from 2000 to 2008.

12. Despite decreasing production, Yemen's oil sector remains the main source for foreign reserves
and is key for the fiscal balance. The production peaked in 2001 and has since been declining at a rate
of about 3 to 4 percent per annum On average, 85 percent of exports and 65 percent of fiscal revenues
were derived from oil exports and domestic oil trade since 2000. Hydrocarbon export constitutes about
85 percent of exports and generates about 60 to 70 percent of the government revenues, including
domestic trade in oil products. Oil production accounts for 10 percent of the country's GDP. The non-
hydrocarbon revenues run at about 8 to 9 percent of GDP. This is unusually low for a country like
Yemen.4

13. While oil production was declining, non-hydrocarbon sector growth averaged 5 percent per
year during 2001-09. However, this non-hydrocarbon growth rate is not sufficient to provide economic
opportunities for a young and rapidly growing population, increasing currently at the rate of 3.6 percent
per annum since 2001, with more than 50 percent of the population under 25 years. Most importantly, in
rural areas where most of the population resides, agriculture is constrained by limited rainfalls.5
Agricultural production contributes about 10 percent to GDP. Rural population earns on average 50
percent of monetary income from Qat cultivation. While government services stand for a large share of
GDP (19 percent), non-hydrocarbon growth has been largely driven in recent years by transport, retailing
and some manufacturing.

  Tribal affiliation is an important basis for social organization in some parts of the Northern Highlands and Eastern
Plains where tribes continue to wield significant power in the economy, politics and society. Tribes are territorially-
based groups with shared values formalized through customary law. Some rural areas in the highlands and Eastern
plains are controlled by tribal leaders with limited Government intervention.
4
  Typically the tax rate of country at the development level of Yemen could be around 14 percent of GDP.
5
  Yemen is one of the most water scarce countries in the world, with only about 135 m3 per annum compared to the
1,000m3/c/a water scarcity threshold (WHO), and compared to 2,500m3/c/a in the MENA region.

                                                          3
14. Public expenditures grew rapidly after 2000, reaching a peak of 41 percent of GDP in 2008,
largely because of energy subsidies. The largest single cost item of public expenditure is the subsidy for
domestic energy consumption, which required over the past 5 years on average 20 to 25 percent of public
expenditures. Even if subsidies for energy products are higher or lower depending on higher or lower
international prices for oil, subsidies in 2009, when the price dropped, amounted to 8 percent of GDP, or
22 percent of public expenditures (2008: 14 percent of GDP, and 34 percent of expenditures). In
comparison, expenditures in 2009 for education reached 6.4 per cent of GDP and expenditures for health
2.1 percent.

15. The most pronounced impact of the global slowdown in 2009 and 2010 has been through lower
oil prices and was compounded by the emerging decline in oil production. A sharp drop in average
prices since the peak in mid 2008 and lower government share of output oil production resulted in a
significant decline of government oil revenues by about 50 percent since 2008. Fiscal revenues went from
16 percent of GDP in 2008 to 7.4 percent of GDP in 2009. Although the average export price per barrel of
oil Yemen is projected to obtain in 2010 is 20 percent higher than in 2009, oil production declined since
2008 by 18 percent. As a consequence, after running a balanced budget (cash basis) in 2008, the country
suffered a fiscal deficit (cash basis) of 8 percent of GDP in 2009. Yemen is expected to run an overall
fiscal deficit of about 5.6 percent of GDP in 2010 on commitment basis, taking into account the measures
agreed upon under the ECF arrangement with the Fund.

16. Besides the impact through oil, Yemen has suffered from the global crisis only indirectly.6 The
financial sector is isolated from international markets and was not affected by the global financial crisis.
The slowdown in world growth, however, contributed to a slowdown in non-hydrocarbon economic
growth that weakened to an estimated 4.1 percent in 2009, mainly because of a reduction in investment.
Due largely to the sharp decline in international food prices, inflation hit a record low in 2009 reaching an
average of 3.7 percent. Also remittances, on which Yemen depends, declined by 23 percent in 2009 and
have not yet reached the level of 2008.

17. Declining export volumes and values are driving down reserves. Gross foreign exchange reserves
of the Central Bank climbed from US$3.6 billion in 2001 to US$7.3 billion in 2008, amounting to an
average reserve cover of over 9-months of imports. However, reserves have been declining since 2008
and stood at US$6.2 billion at end 2009. They are projected to reach US$4.6 billion at end 2010, due to
the combination of declining oil prices, declining oil production, and an increasing dollarization. In 2010,
the combination of a political uncertainty, security concerns, the fading relevance of the oil sector and the
large fiscal deficit have brought pressure on the exchange rate, whose depreciation path has become more
volatile. Given Yemen's dependence on food imports, a rapid and sudden depreciation of the Riyal,
would accelerate inflation, adversely affecting the 60 percent of the population who are poor.

B.         Macroeconomic Outlook
18. Yemen faces significant economic challenges. Although the immediate crisis is primarily a fiscal
problem due to the sudden decline in oil revenues, the reduced oil production, and the difficulty to adjust
the expenditure level at a time of crisis, addressing the fiscal challenge requires a comprehensive reform
program to generate economic growth, employment opportunities, and fiscal resources beyond the
hydrocarbon part of the economy.

19. Against this background, the IMF Board approved an arrangement with Yemen under the
Extended Credit Facility (ECF) on July 30th, 2010. Implementation of the ECF supported reform
program aims to restore fiscal sustainability over the medium term through primarily strengthening the

revenue base (application of the General Sales tax, elimination of tax exemptions) and reducing energy
subsidies. The program is expected to maintain price inflation and help to stabilize the depreciation path
of the Yemeni Riyal to adjust to the gradual reduction in oil exports. This DPG complements the program
under the ECF through its focus on private sector development and improved coverage by the social
protection net in Yemen.

2010 Fiscal Adjustment Program

20. The Government is addressing the fiscal challenges from the dwindling oil revenues through a
reform program supported by the IMF that includes the gradual reduction of energy subsidies.
The government program reduces the fiscal deficit in fiscal year 2010 (calendar year) from about 8
percent of GDP (budget 2010) to 5.6 percent of GDP and targets for the medium-term a budget deficit of
around 4 percent of GDP. The main components of the government's fiscal adjustment are (i) a gradual
reduction in the energy subsidy on diesel, kerosene, and gasoil, amounting to savings equivalent to about
1.4 percent of GDP in 2010, and successive reductions from 2011 to 2013; (ii) full implementation of the
General Sales Tax (a value­added tax), which had so far only applied at imports through the custom
administration but not along the value adding chain up to the consumer; (iii) application of a new income
tax law which will bring lower corporate and personal tax rates (from 35 percent to 20 percent, and from
20 to 15 percent) but will also eliminate numerous tax exemptions (except for capital investment) and
rationalize the regime for tax exemptions; (iv) improved customs administration procedures, also to align
better with WTO adherence; and (v) creating fiscal space through a more efficient use of energy by
substituting diesel with natural gas in electricity generation. The reform program will be complemented
by reforms supported through this operation in the areas of private sector and financial market
development, public financial management system, and social protection.

21. The fiscal adjustment program of the government, however, protects investment and priority
spending (Table 1). A sharp fiscal adjustment has reduced total public spending from 41 percent of
GDP in 2008 to a projected 33 percent of GDP in 2010, aided by cuts in almost all expenditure categories,
but mostly due to a reduction in energy subsidies (minus 6 percent of GDP, partly aided by a drop in
international oil prices). The Government aims to contain other current spending by refraining from
public sector wage increases in 2010, exercise constraint thereafter, by limiting public sector hiring.
However, capital spending and social transfers are projected to increase in 2010 compared with 2009.
Larger social spending will compensate the poor and vulnerable for the increase in domestic energy prices
as a result of reducing energy subsidies.

22. IMF projections indicate a fiscal deficit for 2010 in the order of US$1.6 billion for Yemen after
taking into account the above referred to fiscal adjustment measures for 2010. The financing of the
deficit relies almost exclusively on domestic sources, except for about $200 million, including this
operation, which makes a small contribution to meet the financing need and relieving the small domestic
financial market. As a result, domestic public debt has increased substantially since 2008. The measures
now taken by the government to contain the fiscal deficit will help to drive down the domestic debt build
up over the medium term.

Medium Term Prospects

23. Yemen's medium-term prospects depend on the hydrocarbon sector for the short­term and on
the identification of new sources of economic growth over the medium­term. Oil production is
expected to continue to decline, with exploitable reserves running out perhaps as early as 2021, in the
absence of new oil finds and developments. The production and export of liquefied natural gas (LNG) via
the Yemen LNG project (YLNG) will offer some cushion, but cannot compensate for the loss of oil given
the government's relatively small share in the LNG project. The start of a $4.5 billion green field

investment project to extract and export Yemen's natural gas reserves (YLNG project) late October 2009
and indications of additional gas reserves may prolong the life of the hydrocarbon sector, and could
possibly be used for power generation (reducing the need to import refined fuel products and for
subsidies). The predominant trend, however, indicates that Yemen will shift from being a net fuel
exporter to a net fuel importer within just a few years (2014/2015).

                             Box 1: Petroleum Sector Overview and Petroleum Revenues

    The Ministry of Oil and Minerals (MOM) manages and regulates the hydrocarbon sector in Yemen through its
    various public subsidiaries. The Ministry of Finance (MOF), assisted by the Central Bank, has the responsibility
    of handling and overseeing all financial transactions between the government and the state-owned operating
    subsidiaries. The management of the sector is administered through three public subsidiaries: Yemen Company
    for Investment in Oil and Mineral (YICOM), Yemen Oil and Gas Cooperation (YOGC), and the Petroleum
    Exploration and Production Authority (PEPA), which negotiates petroleum exploration contracts and administers
    them. YOGC is the key vehicle for managing Yemen's petroleum downstream activities, composed of mainly the
    Yemen Petroleum Company (YPC), which supplies the domestic market, the Yemen Gas Company (YGC), and
    the Aden Refinery Company (ARC), which also oversees the crude exports operations.

    Yemen depends heavily on oil; on average, 85 percent of exports and 65 percent of fiscal revenues were derived
    from oil exports and domestic oil trade since 2000. Oil production peaked in 2001 reaching 440,000 bbl/d, and
    has since been declining at a rate of about 3 to 4 percent, annually. Daily production is expected to drop by 6
    percent over the period of 2010-13, ending at around 256,5 thousands bbl per day compared with about 274
    thousands bbl in 2009. As a result, the government's share in revenues is expected to decline due to the decline in
    net production, price forecasts, and the relative increase of so called cost oil, the quantity of oil needed by the
    companies to recover their investment costs - past and on-going investment costs ­ whose share increase with
    declining production. While the annual production is forecasted to decline during the period 2010-13, the
    government's share is estimated to decline by 2.3 percentage points, reaching an average of 53.3 million bbl/year
    compared to 59.2 million bbl/year in 2009.


24. Given the current structural constraints, non-hydrocarbon growth is estimated to hover around
5 percent annually over the medium term. Factor costs for any industrial operation in Yemen are high,
partly because basic services, including electricity supplies, are unreliable, governance is weak, and
human capacity is low while the formal labor market is subject to significant constraints. While the
government is addressing these issues, it will take time to show an impact.

25. As oil production declines, the government is establishing the basis for alternative sources of
economic growth. The government has rightly focused on improving the investment climate and aims to
diversify private sector growth. The overhaul of the income tax and investment regime, (applying GST,
streamlining the tax exemptions and establishing the General Investment Authority as an investment
promotion agency, in accordance with best international practices) is a first step in this direction. Yemen
is very advanced in its negotiations to become a member of the World Trade organization. It is expected
that the country's adhesion to the WTO, coupled with its traditionally open trade regime, would provide
for added private sector and investment incentives.7 Future growth is expected to be derived from
manufacturing, fishery, tourism, improved infrastructure. Productivity gains and access to technology
shall be for the immediate future mainly leveraged through foreign direct investment. The significant
gains made in education on all levels need to be sustained to underpin growth with improved technical
capacity.

    It is possible that Yemen would become a member of the WTO later in 2011.

26. Fiscal consolidation is a key step toward allowing more space for the private sector. At present,
the fiscal deficit has driven up interest rates to 23 percent, an obstacle to investment. Reducing the
fiscal deficit and therefore reducing the pressure on the domestic financial market is a prerequisite for
improving the conditions for private sector development. The Fund's program includes measures to
strengthen financial sector development and widen financing options over the medium: (i) developing of
Islamic financial instruments (Sukuk), which would also offer a new financing options and source to the
government beyond the traditional T-Bills; (ii) enforcing prudential regulations on concentration of credit;
(iii) improving the functioning of commercial courts and judicial processes for recovery of bank and other
debts; and (iv) further encouraging microfinance.

27. Monetary policy will focus primarily on price stability and ensuring a sufficient level of private
sector credit to support non-hydrocarbon economic growth. The Central Bank of Yemen (CBY) will
continue to target reserve money growth in line with non-hydrocarbon sector economic activity, while
keeping a close watch on excess liquidity in the banking system or signs of upward pressure on prices
from domestic sources. To enhance the efficacy of monetary policy, the CBY will move to enhance both
liquidity forecasting in conjunction with the Ministry of Finance. Furthermore, greater use of indirect
instruments of monetary policy will made to minimize central bank financing of the budget and avoid
inflationary pressure.

28. Yemen's heavy reliance on food imports makes domestic prices sensitive to movements in the
exchange rate. With regard to exchange rate policy, the CBY seeks to strike a balance between
enhancing external competitiveness and limiting inflation. At the same time, the expected decline in oil
exports makes exchange rate flexibility necessary to ensure external competitiveness and a sustainable
external position. However, CBY will continue ­ as in the past ­ to auction foreign exchange in order to
meet market needs and smooth out short-term volatility, while maintaining a sufficient cushion of foreign
exchange reserves, which recently increased partly due to well implemented liquidity management by the
CBY.

29. The balance of payments will remain under stress unless alternative sources of external
financing are found (Table 2). The reforms implemented in 2010 to improve the investment climate and
other reforms in this area under preparation are crucial to attract non-hydrocarbon investments, which are
key in financing the current account deficit. However, more is needed in a sustained way, to compensate
for the loss of investment in the oil sector. While recovery of regional economic activity would improve
the outlook for employment of Yemeni migrant workers, and increase the remittance flow, remittances
alone are unlikely to expand significantly unless regional integration is furthered. The tools available to
the government in the short term beyond import demand management are limited, also given the high
dependence on food imports. Reducing domestic oil consumption through the initiated reforms could
prolong Yemen's oil exports and provide some additional relief. However, given the very fragile outlook
for the Balance of Payments, the country needs to work on sustained efforts to implement structural
reforms conducive to non-hydrocarbon growth and employment. But Yemen also needs sustained
assistance, including through programmatic approaches, which can mobilize the financing required and
provides for the momentum to the policy dialogue (see also Annex 4)

C.      External Financing Needs and Debt Sustainability
30. Meeting Yemen's external financing needs requires more sustained efforts by external partners
and enhancing non-concessional flows. The medium term financing need continues to be substantial
(Table 2). Most of the need is currently financed through reductions in reserves, which are estimated to
amount to s about 3 month in 2012, even assuming strengthened aid and remittances, substantial non-
concessional inflows are required while the disinvestment of the oil sector bears heavily on the capital
balance.

31. The updated debt sustainability analysis undertaken in December 2009 shows that Yemen's
risk of debt distress remains high (Annex 5). Although all indicators remain below their policy-
dependent thresholds in the medium term, the PV of debt-to-exports ratio is projected to breach its
threshold substantially over the long term (by over 30 percentage points annually during 2022­29) due to
declining oil production. While the other indicators remain below their respective thresholds, the outlook
is expected to worsen as debt accumulates and resources to service it are projected to decline due to the
loss of oil exports. The high risk of debt distress underscores the importance of limiting external
borrowing to concessional loans, implementing a prudent fiscal policy, and making continued efforts to
diversify and increase exports. Sensitivity tests revealed that the debt outlook was vulnerable to export
growth and persisting large fiscal deficits.

32. Although the Government is making efforts to lower the risk of debt distress by continuing to
seek grants or highly concessionary financing, the need to promote private sector growth is likely to
add to the pressures on the Balance of Payments in the short- and medium term. Although the
increase in domestic and external financing to cope with the impact of exogenous shocks in 2008 did not
lead to a significant deterioration of the debt indicator, debt sustainability continues to guide the
authorities' expenditure policy, particularly its public investment program. The Government is committed
to continuing its conservative borrowing policy, with the aim of maintaining external debt on a
sustainable footing. Moreover, the Government intends to remain selective regarding its investment
projects, focusing on their impact on economic growth while seeking to provide basic services,
particularly to the most vulnerable segments of the population, and select investment projects based on
clear positive economic rate of return. This will ensure that higher domestic indebtedness in the medium-
term would translate into faster growth and declining debt ratios over the long-term. The larger role
sought for the non-hydrocarbon private sector is to add to demand on reserves and debt instruments in the
short and medium term, however. In the longer term, a larger private sector and the value added attached
with it will help is projected to sustain the external balance.

33. While macroeconomic risks are significant, the macroeconomic policy framework is satisfactory
for the purposes of this proposed operation. A key macroeconomic risk is the dependence on declining
and volatile oil revenues compounded by the little diversification of the Yemen economy. The fiscal
program agreed with the IMF provides, however, for some reassurances and indicates the commitment by
the authorities to address the adjustment needs. It is of utmost importance to improve the non-
hydrocarbon economy and revenue base and give more space to the private sector initiative, a policy
direction supported by this operation. But, sustainability requires further engagement, including through
programmatic instruments and preferably on a broad base.

D.      Poverty and Social Development
34. Poverty is relatively high and primarily a rural phenomenon. Yemen is predominantly a rural8
country and poverty is by and large a rural phenomenon: 73 percent of the population, and 84 percent of
the poor, live in rural areas.9 Between 1998 and 2005, the percentage of poor in urban areas declined by
11.6 percentage points (from 32.2 percent to 20.7 percent); rural poverty remained at approximately 40
percent.10 Poverty is estimated to have worsened since 2005. Estimates put the increase of the number of
Yemenis who fell below the poverty line as a result of the food crisis, followed by the financial crisis and
its impact on the real economy, at some 10 percentage points, with the poverty incidence rising again to
about 32 percent of the population. It is estimated, that now half of the rural population lives below the
poverty line.11 In urban areas, almost one fifth of Yemen's 6.7 million urban dwellers live below the
poverty line, with over half of them living in informal settlements without access to basic urban
         12
services. Almost three quarters of the urban poor are concentrated in the five cities of Sana'a, Aden,

Taiz, Hodeidah and Mukalla. Increasing inequality and socio-spatial exclusion of the rural and urban
poor add to the fragile cohesion of Yemen's society. Many poor people depend on social safety nets
supplementing their income, either in the form of labor intensive public works program, or in the form of
cash transfers (estimated to be about 23 percent of the population).

35. Though improving, Yemen's social indicators rank low. The country ranks 140 out of 182
countries in the 2009 Human Development Index. Average life expectancy rose from 41.6 years in 1970
to 62 in 2006 with women's life expectancy mirroring the overall trend.14 Although there has been a
significant increase in enrollment rates in basic education (up from 3 million in 1996 to 4.1 million in
2004), yet female literacy rates stood at only 28.5 percent in 2002. Food insecurity and malnutrition levels
in the country have reached alarming levels. Yemen is among the 10 countries in the world with the
highest rates of food insecurity, with the country ranked third for the highest malnutrition in the world: 58
percent of children under 5 are stunted, and more than 1 in 10 children is acutely malnourished. A recent
Comprehensive Food Security Survey (2009) conducted by the World Food Program's (WFP) concluded
that 7.5 million persons are caught in a chronic poverty trap. The situation is further compounded by
climate change, increasing influx of refugees from the Horn of Africa, high population growth, and low
literacy. Vulnerable groups, suffering from limited access to services, information, political and economic
participation and voice, mainly include women, the physically and mentally challenged, street children,
and a small group of landless people who often face extreme poverty and social exclusion. With only 5-10
percent of all urban land and properties registered with the General Authority for Land, Survey and Urban
Planning (GALSUP), insecurity of land tenure in rural and urban areas is pervasive throughout the
country, as the institutional and legal framework for land and real estate management remains fragmented
and incomplete. Private appropriation of communal land, especially in northern governorates, is
becoming an increasing problem both regarding access to land and access to increasingly scarce water
resources. Insecure land tenure is an obstacle to economic development and social cohesion.

36. Health services have trouble reaching many Yemenis. Despite achievements over the last three
decades, major challenges remain. Those most prominent are: (i) high and stagnated maternal, infant, and
child mortality; (ii) high prevalence of malnutrition particularly for children under 5; (iii) high prevalence
of malaria and Schistosomiasis. Given these challenges, it is unlikely that Yemen will achieve the 4th
(reduce child mortality) and 5th (improve maternal health) Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) by
2015. The lower social status of women and girls, and their restricted mobility have negative effects on
their health status and ability to get care when ill. Moreover, there is evidence that HIV/AIDS prevalence
is rising, more than 3.0 million are infected with Schistosomiasis (Bilharziasis), 1.2 million Yemenis are
suffering from malaria, and about 20,000 people are infected by tuberculosis. The health situation might
be compounded by the perverse effects of Qat chewing.

37. The government's efforts in education have been generally positive. The most remarkable
achievement in the past three decades is the expansion of the education system at all levels and the
halving of the illiteracy rate from 90 percent to 45 percent. Yet, many challenges remain. Between
1977/78 and 2007/08, gross enrollment in basic education grew 6-fold, reaching an enrollment rate of
74.3 percent. During the same period enrollment in secondary education grew 22-fold; and university
enrollment grew 35-fold. Between 1998/99 and 2007/08 alone, the gross enrollment for girls improved
from 49 percent to 76 percent, whereas those for boys improved from 85.6 percent to 94.5 percent;
secondary enrollment (schools only) grew by 2.5 percent only; and university enrollment grew by 40

   According to the Yemen Census (2004), Sana'a has 1.8 million inhabitants or about 30 percent of the urban
population, Aden has an urban population of 0.59 million people, Taiz has 0.46 million people, Hodeidah has 0.41
million people, and Mukalla has 0.23 million urban inhabitants. In fifteen years, by 2025, these five cities together
are expected to have a combined population of about 10 million.

percent. Since 2000, technical education and vocational training (TEVT) expanded the fastest, increasing
enrollment in post-secondary TEVT 15-fold, despite 3 percent annual population growth during the last
decade. However, low quality and inadequate availability of teachers undermine the success of expansion.
Forty percent of the current pool of basic and secondary school teachers do not have adequate
qualifications. Most of these teachers are found in rural schools (76 percent) and are teaching in basic
education (91 percent). Absenteeism among teachers is high, averaging 19 percent, and is even higher in
rural areas.

38. Youth unemployment in Yemen is rising. About 50 percent of the population is younger than 15
years. Yemen's estimated unemployment rate increased by 5 percentage points within five years, to a rate
of 16 percent in 2004. More recent estimates vary but consistently put this number much higher.
Unemployment is higher in urban areas, affecting 19 percent of the urban population, compared with 10
percent of the rural population.15 In addition, many more are underemployed. Most of the young Yemenis
have to emigrate to make a living, a phenomenon, which for centuries was more limited to the
Hadhramout but became now a necessity for young Yemenis in all regions of Yemen.

39. Furthermore, the number of refugees, predominantly from Somalia and internally displaced
person from the conflict affected Sa'ada continue rising and affect the coastal zones. The United
Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) estimates that more than 155,000 refugees, 95 per
cent of which are Somalis have been granted prima facie refugee status by the Government. Other
refugees in the country include Iraqis, Ethiopians and Eritreans, most of them living in Sana'a and Aden.
It is estimated that a comparable amount of refugees lives illegally in Yemen. In addition, the five-year-
old conflict between the authorities and the Al-Houthi tribe escalated in August 2009 for the 6th time to an
open war, leading to the displacement of some 150,000 people.

40. Yemen aims to give greater voice to regions, traditional structures and citizen through
decentralization. While decentralization would be a way to bridge the tension between the old and the
new political structures as well as between the regions and the center, the process of decentralization has
just begun. Fiscal decentralization in Yemen still needs to be largely defined, and weak human capacity of
local governments limits the ability of regional and local entities to provide public services to meet the
need of the citizens and fulfill their expectations about decentralization.

41. While the modern state is emerging, its weaknesses in the delivery of services and
accountability are evident. Although Yemen has not a fledgling civil society, there is a large number of
civil society and non-governmental organizations (CSO/NGO) that addresses needs not satisfied by the
state.16 There is substantial need for capacity building of civil society organizations, and for the building
of partnerships with CSOs/NGOs for the development of and demand for good governance.17

42. Energy subsidies cause a considerable waste of resources. The 2008 Yemen Social Protection
Strategy highlights that energy subsidies are inefficient. First, they are costly and divert significant
resources from alternative investments, including social programs and infrastructure. Second, large
subsidies distort the use of subsidized commodities, encouraging underproduction for domestic markets
and overconsumption. Third, critical from a safety net perspective, they are very inefficient in terms of
delivering benefits to the poor. It is estimated that more than 77 percent of the direct subsidies on

petroleum products accrues to the non-poor, while only 23 percent goes to the poor, since wealthier
individuals and households consume more of these goods. A conservative estimate of the economic waste
incurred because of energy subsidies for the year 2008 concludes losses amounting to about YR110
billion, equal to three-quarters of all social transfers. This arises mostly from budgetary costs exceeding
the gain to consumers.18

43. While removal of fuel subsidies will increase poverty in Yemen in the short term, more
sustainable use of resources will benefit all Yemenis in the medium to long term. Despite its poor
targeting, petroleum subsidies have protected, according to estimates, 3 percent of the population from
falling into poverty, through the direct and indirect effects of keeping prices lower than they otherwise
would have been. This document offers below in Box 2 a Poverty and Social Impact Analysis19 on the oil
subsidy reduction (related data are shown in Annex 3).


                     Box 2: Poverty Impact Analysis of the Reduction of Energy Subsidies

 The oil subsidy reform is estimated to raise poverty levels by up to 3 percentage points. An accelerated
 reform scenario (scenario 1: reduction of subsidies within one year) raises the poverty level up to 3.0 percentage
 points, and a gradual scenario (scenario 2: reduction of subsidies within 3 years) raises poverty by about 2.6
 percentage points above baseline values during the reform process. Rural households, particularly farm
 households, are most affected, especially those that rely on irrigation intensive crops for their incomes. However,
 it is important to keep in mind that the second most affected group - rural nonfarm households - are higher in
 number and have higher initial poverty levels (Annex 3, Table A5). Urban households, which represent about 30
 percent of the population, are most affected in terms of real income change due to their higher consumption levels
 of fuel/energy, but least affected in terms of poverty impact due to their relatively high initial incomes. Although,
 the poverty impact will decline for all households after reform sets in, yet higher than initial poverty levels are
 likely to persist after reform, if no additional action is taken.

 The impact of the energy subsidies reforms on poverty is, however, mitigated through better targeted
 social assistance, while the trade-off between fast and phased removal of subsidies are being considered
 carefully. Timing and design of the reform matter: rapid subsidy reduction leads to a sharper spike in poverty and
 faster return to pre-reform income levels, while gradual reduction smoothens the poverty effect. Slow phasing out
 is preferable from a growth enhancing and poverty reduction perspective. A gradual approach inflicts a less
 pronounced growth shock on agriculture and total household incomes losses are about one fifth less than with in
 the case of a rapid subsidy reduction. However, slow reform comes at a higher fiscal cost since subsidies
 effectively need to be financed for two more years compared to the 1 year phase-out, amounting to additional
 costs. Thus, the faster the subsidy reduction is implemented the more fiscal space exists for the government to
 compensate households and to invest.

 Both approaches towards fuel subsidy reform provide the Yemeni government with the leeway to reduce
 the budget deficit and to invest in generating new growth, employment and income opportunities. Both
 basic reform scenarios are analyzed in a sub Scenario (see annex 3, table A5, Scenario 1 A/B/C and Scenario 2
 A/B/C) which combines budget deficit reductions, transfers and investments and assesses how investing in
 economic and social infrastructure can accelerate growth and reduces poverty.20 The results show that using all
 savings for direct transfers strongly smoothens the negative impacts on households, yet growth impulses for

   Conducted by the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI).
20
   Under the accelerated reform scenario 1B, we assume that only 50 percent of the oil subsidy savings are used for
the fiscal deficit reduction, which would leave a YR215 billion to spend. Under the gradual reform scenario 2B, the
deficit is reduced over 3 years due to continued expenditure for subsidies. Note that scenarios 1B/C and 2B/C
compare fast versus slow compensation/investment effects on growth and poverty given the same amount of
resources available. However, they are not fully comparable from a fiscal point of view as the overall deficit will be
higher under 2B/C due to the fact that subsidies continue to be paid during the reform process.

 sustainable development are likely to be limited.

 Therefore, the preferred scenario is one where only the poor are compensated consistent with annual
 requirements, calculated for the period 2011-2015. If after fiscal consolidation, the remaining subsidy savings
 are invested in utilities, transport, trade and construction,21 improved infrastructure and basic services are likely to
 lower transaction costs for economic operators, offer the opportunity to integrate economic spaces in Yemen, and
 create the platform for a restructuring of productive, industrial and service along the value chains, which could be
 exploited by enabling domestic and foreign private investment. Results from model simulations show that this
 type of generated growth has strong poverty reducing effects and in addition to its long term growth effect can
 more than mitigate the negative short-term income effects of subsidy reform.




                         III. THE GOVERNMENT'S REFORM PROGRAM
44. The Government is in the process of mapping out an ambitious vision for the country's
development. While the 5 year development plan for the period 2006-2010 is coming to end,
preparations for a new plan covering the period 2011 to 2015 have advanced. The new plan sets a greater
emphasis on diversifying the economy (through private sector-led activities), enhancing governance,
improving social conditions, and managing natural resources in a more sustainable way. The deterioration
in the global environment has further heightened both the need to implement this ambitious agenda and
the difficulties in doing so.

45. Attaining fiscal sustainability is the foremost macroeconomic concern of the government in the
short term. The sudden and sharp decline of oil prices since 2008, compounded by a gradual decrease in
production led the government to abandon the policy status quo of the past decade. Supported by a reform
program agreed with the IMF, the Government aims to widen the non-hydrocarbon revenues. A big step
forward in implementing this strategy was achieved when the Parliament approved the income tax and
investment law reform package (prepared in 2008) in the Parliament in early August 2010, following the
earlier commitment to begin full implementation of the General Sales Tax on July 1, 2010. In addition,
the authorities have begun on February 2, 2010, to gradually reduce energy subsidies.

46. The Yemen Government's growth strategy aims to reduce oil dependency through the
promotion of economic diversification and by fostering private sector-led growth and investment.
The approval in early August 2010 by Parliament of the income tax and investment law reforms and the
amendments to the customs code offer a largely improved enabling framework for private domestic and
foreign investment, in accordance with international best practices. The reforms in the financial sector
which target widening access to credit, including through developing a micro credit market, complement
the improvements for private investment. Such are moves in the right direction, however, they are likely
to be constrained by the fragile security situation in the country. However, there are long standing
impediments to private sector development, chief among which are electric power supply and governance
challenges. A coherent growth strategy, using Yemen's potential, can only fully unfold, if the security
situation stabilizes and governance can be improved. The Government has therefore renewed its efforts to
form a national dialogue.




21
  It would be imported that this gained fiscal space is accompanied by an appropriate development strategy to
ensure a maximum scaling up of these public investments. We assume investment-growth elasticity of 0.5, i.e. a 1
percent increase in investment leads to 0.5 percent growth in these sectors.

                                                          14
47. To support the needed redeployment of public resources, the Government has initiated
improving the efficiency of the pubic financial management system. Assisted by the World Bank and
others (GTZ, French Cooperation, USAID, Dutch Development Assistance, and UNDP), the government
aims to implement the priority reforms identified in the National Reforms Agenda, which essentially
focuses on improving three sets of issues: improving (1) transparency, (2) public financial management
(PFM), and (3) administrative capacity. It is anticipated that the new 5 year Development Plan for 2011-
2015 will continue to highlight the criticality to steadily improve the public financial management system
through financial and technical support.

48. The Government is conscious that given the widespread poverty in the country the impact of
the energy subsidy reform on the poor and vulnerable requires special mitigating measures. The
Social Protection Strategy (SPS) for Yemen seeks to assist the country in achieving its poverty reduction
goals as well as supporting avenues out of poverty. The three major pillars of Yemen's safety net system
include the Social Welfare Fund (entirely funded out of Government budget), the Social Fund for
Development (largely donor funded), and the Public Works Project (funded by the World Bank and other
donors). While all Funds will contribute to mitigating the impact of the energy subsidy reform on the
poor, a major burden will be put on the Social Welfare Fund (cash transfers) whose efficiency need to be
improved to combine safety net demands, equity, and fiscal sustainability.

A.      Achieving Fiscal Sustainability
49. Following the rapid decline of international oil price in mid 2008, Yemen suffered a revenue
shock, losing about 8 percent of GDP in hydrocarbon revenues within 2 years. Faced with a rising
deficit and an erosion of a key revenue pillar, the Government adopted a 4-pronge approach in line with
the National Reform Agenda of 2006: (1) reviewing public expenditure, especially expenditure of energy
subsidies and (2) containing current expenditures, especially wages and salaries, (3) protecting investment
expenditures to facilitate non-hydrocarbon growth, and (4) widening the revenue base. The government's
urgency to act was underlined by the 10 Points Priority Plan issued in mid 2009 and which focused on
immediate fiscal gains. The structural component of both plans, the NRA and the 10 Point Priority Plan,
have in common (1) using Yemen's natural gas reserves for energy generation and substitute diesel and
diesel subsidies, (2) accelerating non-hydrocarbon growth, and (3) improving the attractiveness of Yemen
as a location for investment, including in the mineral sector.

50. The gradual reduction of energy subsidies has begun in early 2010. The reduction in subsidies is
expected to bring 1.4 of GDP in 2010. Petroleum product prices have been increased twice since February
2010 (see also Table 3). A reform of the electricity tariffs, a sector which continues to consume
significant amount of diesel (mazout) at subsidized prices, is also envisaged but requires further
consultations.

51. Additional measures to reduce and contain current expenditures were decided upon in late
2008. While salaries were protected in nominal terms, budgets for bonuses, over-time payments, financial
assistance package including for medical treatment, embassy costs and staff, and for goods & services
were at various degrees reduced, in some cases to nil. The effective execution of the saving program was
delayed by the outbreak of armed conflict in the Sa'ada governorate.

52. Despite the fiscal pressure the government protected investment spending and social transfers.
Investment spending rose since 2008 in terms of GDP, indicating the government's preference is not to
jeopardize important infrastructure and poverty reduction expenditures, including for the education and
health sector. Recognizing the need to compensate the poor for the income loss of energy price increases

                                                    15
due to the reduction in subsidies, the government increased transfers to the Social Welfare Fund in 2010
by 0.3 percent of GDP.

53. Revenue measures touched upon the whole tax and customs administrative system and stricter
enforcement of existing laws. This policy emphasized especially reducing the backlog of tax claims,
strengthening of the role of controls and audits, and applying the law on the General Sales Tax (GST),
whose full application was finally publicly announced in mid-June 2010, implemented beginning July 1.
In addition, Parliament finally approved the revised income tax law and investment law. This reform
package, jointly with the GST, will eliminate many discreet exemptions, widen the non-hydro tax revenue
potential, and bring investment and tax laws in line with international best practices.

B.     Enhancing the Private Sector Framework
54. Both the National Agenda for Reform (NAR) of 2006 and the 10-Points Priority Plan of 2009
recognize the need to attract private investment and spur private sector development (PSD). PSD is
considered the pivotal means for employment generation, economic diversification and growth, and long-
term fiscal sustainability. The government has been working on various levels to implement reforms
reducing the cost of doing business and improving the regulatory framework:

      Reforms of business registration to reduce time and cost (supported by an IFC PEP-MENA
      project) resulted in a massive improvement in Yemen's rating for the time and cost of business
      start up in Sana'a in Doing Business 2009, thought it still needs to be institutionalized and
      implemented nationwide. Licensing reform and streamlining of building permits are been part of
      this ongoing effort to streamline regulations.

      Harmonization of the tax code with international standards, rationalization of incentives in the tax,
      investment and customs laws, combined with improved tax administration practice (supported by
      the World Bank Group through the Institutional Reform Development Policy Credit (IRDPG), and
      ongoing FIAS/DFID/WB technical assistance. Following Parliament's approval of the investment
      law and the income tax law reforms, the marginal tax rate on corporate income has been reduced
      by 15 percentage points to 20 percent, and modern, fair, general incentives for investment were
      introduced. A major technical assistance program is designed to help Yemen implement a modern
      VAT and income tax through self-assessment and risk-based auditing, with a simplified regime for
      smaller enterprises.

      Revision of the land registration law and related institutions to make land title and transfer of tile
      legally conclusive (supported by the IRDPG).

      Preparing for accession to the Extractive Industries Initiative to enhance revenue transparency
      (supported by the IRDPG).

      Reduction by 50 percent of the time it takes for customs processing, including through the
      application of the ASYCUDA system, allowing electronic submission of documents and moving
      to risk-based physical inspection of shipments in place of universal inspection.

Ongoing reforms include:
      Establishment of a modern legal framework for PPPs, mining and mineral exploration, lease
      finance, and other areas of private investment and finance, supported technically by the IFC
      advisory service.

      Development of a policy framework, including a special law for special economic zones and
      modernization of the Aden Free Zone (supported by the World Bank Group).

      Establishment of an appropriate and capable regulatory framework for the financial sector,
      comprising the development of bank and nonbank financial services, under the auspices of the
      Central Bank of Yemen (supported by the IMF, World Bank Group, GTZ, and others).

      Implementation of legal and institutional reforms to enhance access of micro and small enterprises
      to financial services (supported by the World Bank Group, GTZ, EC, and others).

         Enhancing investment promotion through the General Investment Authority by moving it from
         being a mixed regulatory and promotional agency to a modern investment promotion agency
         focused on image-building, targeted investment promotion, investment facilitation, investor
         services and advocacy. (supported by the World Bank Group, the Netherlands, GTZ, and others).

         Development of an adequate institutional framework and process for business-government

                           Box 3: Investment Climate in Yemen: Challenges and Progress

   A New Role for the Private Sector. Between the late 1990s and 2005, the Yemeni Government was able to rely
   on oil wealth to drive the economy and to bring in a rising stream of revenues. Hence structural policy reforms as
   encouraged by the World Bank and other multilateral and bilateral donors to strengthen the investment climate
   were not seen as a priority. The public sector grew, and little attention was given to removing impediments to
   private investors, particularly in the non-oil sector. By the mid-2000s, the projected decline in oil production
   loomed more imminently. As the 2005 ICA revealed, the non-hydrocarbon sector had difficulties taking off due
   to a variety of constraints, including weak property rights, barriers to entry, arbitrary regulation and taxation,
   inexperience of local entrepreneurs in exporting, and institutional weaknesses in key public and private supportive
   institutions. In sector after sector (for example, tourism, agro-processing, mining and fisheries) growth was found
   to be constrained by weaknesses in the legal and regulatory framework underpinning markets; weak infrastructure
   (especially power supply failures), poor governance and institutional capacity, and weak business services.

   Since 2006, Yemen's development strategy has been guided by the understanding that its future prosperity largely
   depends on private sector-led growth to generate employment and diversify the economy. The Third Socio-
   Economic Development Plan for Poverty Reduction (DPPR, 2006-2010) identified "improving the investment
   climate" and "boosting the private sector" as priorities for achieving poverty reduction and growth. The
   Government's "National Agenda for Reform" and "Good Governance Measures" adopted in January 2006
   explicitly recognized that sustained economic growth "hinges on Yemen's ability to stimulate domestic private
   investment as well as foreign direct investment by improving its overall business environment." The Government
   agreed to technical support programs with the World Bank, the IFC and other donors aimed to sharply improve the
   investment climate. The Government developed the 2007 Institutional Reform Development Policy Grant
   (IRDPG), its first development policy operation since the 1990s and supported by the World Bank. Along with
   PFM reforms, it contained two key components to encourage non-hydrocarbon growth:

       Income tax reform, to rationalize the incentives facing private investors through standard treatment of income,
       investment and expenses, and to reduce discretionary administration.
       Reform of land titling and land registration, by creating a system of secure and enforceable property rights
       with unambiguous title.

   Results

   In recent years, a number of important, concrete reforms have been realized, as demonstrated by several metrics.
   The Doing Business Indicators show the following recent reforms:

   DB2007: Paying Taxes indicator improved sharply due to a sharp reduction in the calculated tax on profits from
   195 percent to 48 percent.

   DB2009: Starting a business indicator improved 125 ranks due to a sharp drop in the time, cost and number of
   procedures involved and an elimination of the minimum capital requirement. The Doing Business 2009 report
   stated:




                                                          19
 "Yemen reformed the business start-up procedures the most. In 2007, it had the second largest minimum capital
 requirement in the world at $15,225 (2,003 percent of per capita income). This is now reduced to zero. Yemen also
 activated a one-stop shop in Sana'a for starting a business, making it possible to complete all steps--from
 reserving the company name to obtaining a license for incorporation to announcing the company's formation--in
 a single location. It made it easier to obtain a license from the municipality and to register with the chamber of
 commerce and the tax office. And it publicized the fact that a company seal is not mandatory. The reforms reduced
 the number of procedures to start a business by 5, and the time by 50 days."

 Overall Yemen jumped from 123rd in "Ease of Doing Business to 98th.

 DB2010: Indicators advanced for "getting credit" due to an improvement in credit information and in trading and
 for "trading across borders" due to a reduction in time for importing and exporting goods.

 The Bank's 2010 investment climate enterprise survey indicates some persistent problems (such as corruption and
 electric power supply), but also points to progress since 2004. Tax rates and tax administration, which had been
 identified in the 2004 survey by 71 percent and 54 percent of firms as serious constraints to their operation and
 growth, were now identified by only 44 percent and 38 percent of firms, respectively, as serious. Customs and
 trade regulations were identified as constraining by 18 percent of firms in 2010 as opposed to 40 percent in 2005.
 Concern about business licensing and operating permits edged downward. SMEs reported a reduction in the
 average number of days to obtain an operating license. The incidence of land-related disputes reportedly fell
 sharply. Firms were using a higher percentage of workers with more than a high school education.

 Private investment has generally responded positively to reforms in recent years, with the exception of 2009, when
 the international financial crisis led to a dramatic fall in private investment globally, compensated in part by a
 sharp increase in public sector investment. The share of private investment in gross fixed capital formation rose
 steadily 2006 to 2008.

 2010 has been a banner year for investment climate reform with the legislative approval and enactment of a critical
 package of laws fundamentally reforming the incentive framework for investment. The new income tax law,
 investment law and amendments to the customs code bring the legislative basis for tax incentives and
 administrative enforcement of taxes and customs in line with international best practices. In addition to
 harmonizing treatment of corporate income, expenses and investments with international norms of good practice,
 the tax law formalizes self-declaration and risk-based auditing. The new investment law eliminates a host of tax
 holidays and exemptions in favor of general investment incentives built into the income tax law. It modernizes the
 General Investment Authority, which focuses now on investment promotion, investor facilitation and services, and
 investment advocacy. Amendments to the customs act modernize valuation and shift inspections to a risk-based
 approach. While upgrading administration will be challenging, the underlying basis for discretion has been sharply
 reduced.



C.         Enhancing Financial Intermediation and Improving Access to Finance
55. The Government has developed an Action Plan for implementing financial sector reforms in
2008, in line with recommendations from the Bank.22 The key development challenge is widening
access to financial services for the population. While the banking sector remains small, comprising assets

of about 32 percent of GDP in 2009, the government is implementing reforms since 2008 which support
widening access to financial services and improving the conditions for credit transactions for all income
levels, covering traditional banking services and the market for micro credit services.

       The opening of the Islamic banking services market in Yemen in 2009 facilitated a broadening
       of financial service options to banks and customers alike. The reform liberalized all ownership
       restrictions that existed before, allowing foreign banks to enter freely this market, which before
       required also a domestic investor to establish Islamic banking services. Furthermore, Government
       allowed traditional banks to open an Islamic banking window in their given branches and
       organization. The reform led to new entries into the market and a more competitive situation,
       which is expected, jointly with the reforms mentioned below, including on the Microfinance
       Banking Law, to offer gradually a wider range of banking services to a growing client base.

       The establishment of a credit registry in 2009 promises to improve credit risk management
       for banks, and in turn is expected to lower eventually the cost of credit (information costs), as
       well as improve the quality of the loan portfolio. As a medium term result, this reform is projected
       to contribute to an increase of the lending volume and an extension of the typical length of credit
       offered to the private sector. By July 2010, the registry covered 79,000 loan contracts, and new
       information is added daily. About 95 percent of relevant credit contacts are already included in the
       registry.

       The adoption of a Microfinance Banking Law in April 2009 and the preparation of the
       corresponding by-laws are meant to widen credit and savings options for smaller enterprises
       as well as lower income households, in urban as well as in rural areas, and in general, widen the
       market for financial services in Yemen. Recently, two banks have entered the market, Al-Amal
       Bank in 2009, and Al-Kuraimi Bank in June 2010. The latter's license was approved in line with
       the spirit and principles of the new Microfinance Banking by-laws. The law and the by-laws allow
       also for the traditional Banks to enter this segment of the financial market and offer microfinance
       services. The microfinance market has today about 51,000 clients and is believed to be growing
       rapidly. Apart from credit arrangements the law also allows for deposit taking, laying the base for
       a rise in saving accounts in the country.

       The Establishment of a Deposit Insurance Company in 2009 (DIC), based on the Law of 2009
       about deposit insurance, complements the above referred reforms, as it makes insurance of
       deposits of up to 2 million Riyal (currently about $8,300) mandatory. This reform adds therefore
       to the security of smaller deposits. At this early stage the DIC is partly government owned, but all
       currently registered banks in Yemen own also a share. The DIC is open for insurance services to
       all banks, including to the licensed microcredit institutions.

56. In addition, the government is initiating the issuance of Sukuk in later 2010, with technical
assistance offered by the IMF. This Islamic form of government financing offers the government new
financing source, instead of relying on treasury bills only. However, the issuance of Sukuk offers also an
additional investment option to investors preferring compliance with Islamic banking principles. Given
that about a third of the banking assets in Yemen are intermediated by Islamic banks, Sukuk are expected
to stimulate financial deepening in Yemen and broadening financing options for the government.

57. In line with the recommendations provided by the Financial Action Task Force of the Basel
Committee for Central Banks and adhering to international best practices, Yemen has adopted an
Anti-Money Laundering Law in early 2010. The corresponding by-laws are expected to be approved by
end 2010. In the meantime, the Central Bank of Yemen has restructured its Financial Intelligence Unit,
which exists since 2003, and nominated the members for the accompanying steering and action

                                                    21
committee from across the government, in line with the new law and with support from the Bank.

D.      Improving Public Financial Management
58. Sound public financial management (PFM) is critical to ensuring efficiency and accountability
in the management of public resources. Yemen's oil revenues are limited but still sizeable. However,
for many Yemenis the benefit derived from the national asset is unclear. Many perceive the energy
subsidy is untargeted and biased towards the richer segment of society, encouraging corruption.
Weaknesses in the PFM system not only have high costs in terms of allocative and operational efficiency
but also create high levels of fiduciary risk. The government has therefore renewed its commitment to
improve the PFM system through fundamental reform supported by the Bank and other development
partners. Yemen's commitment to implement the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) is a
positive step and signal of political will to fight corruption, improve good governance and promote
transparency in the oil and gas sector. Yemen is about to conclude the process towards full EITI
membership, expected for February 2011. The first full reconciliation report for the years 2005 to 2007
has been finalized, publication of the results are planned for November, and validation of this first should
EITI round should be completed by December 2010.

59. The Government is implementing ambitious PFM reforms. The Government approved its
National PFM Reform Strategy by a cabinet resolution in August 2005. The Strategy comprises the
following components: (1) General Budget Reform ­ Preparation, Execution and Information systems; (2)
Enhancing Control and Financial Accountability; (3) Reforming the system of bidding and procurement;
and (4) Improving competence and skills. A PFM Reform Action Plan was formulated on the basis of this
Strategy, which was divided into two phases. A first phase was implemented in 2006, 2007 and 2008
with assistance from DFID, UNDP and The Netherlands. A second phase has begun and is being
supported by the World Bank.

60. The second phase of the PFM reform project aims to achieve the following: improving the
performance of the public finance management along its six critical dimensions of: (1) budget credibility;
(2) comprehensiveness and transparency; (3) policy-based budgeting; (4) predictability and control in
budget execution; (5) accounting, recording and reporting; and (6) external scrutiny and audit.
Strengthened PFM performance would contribute to improved aggregate fiscal discipline, an allocation of
budgetary resources that is better aligned to the country's strategic priorities, and would allow for more
efficient service delivery, including at the local level.

61. The ongoing PFM reform would offer a holistic modernization and strengthen the fiduciary
environment in various dimensions. The reform has the following main pillars:

        Strengthening of the link of policies and resource, the planning and the budget process, during the
        budget preparation and implementation phase.

        Improving budget controls and execution of the Ministry of Finance by expanding the scope and
        coverage of the Accounting-based Financial Management Information System (AFMIS) and the
        Loans and Grants Management Information System (LGMIS).

        Enhancing the public procurement control systems by providing support for capacity building of
        Government staff and High Authority on Tender Control (HATC), including for the
        implementation of the Procurement Management Information System (PMIS).

        Improving the Supreme Audit Institution responsible for external audit, the Central Organization
        for Control and Auditing (COCA).

                                                    22
62. The Government has made important reforms steps in the area of procurement. A new
Procurement Law - considered best practice and prepared with Bank and USAID support - was
promulgated in July 2007. The law improves enforcement mechanisms and the institutional check and
balance. As a result the High Authority for Tender Control (HATC) and the High Tender Board (HTB), a
supervisory institution, were established with the new law and made operational in August 2009. Highly
qualified individuals from both, the public sector and civil society, could be gained to serve in these two
institutions, in line with the requirements of the law.

63. Furthermore, the government has taken action to fight corruption. An Anti-Corruption Law was
adopted in 2006, preceding the procurement law. The law established the Supreme National Authority
for Combating Corruption (SNACC), a new institution which operates under the auspices of the President
and has the authority to investigate and transfer cases to the judiciary.

                     Box 4: Reform in Public Financial Management in Yemen since 1995

 In 1995, the Government adopted a broad economic reform program, which was supported by the Bank, the Fund
 and other development partners, and including also reforms in the public finance management area: (i) applying
 with the 2000 budget the budget economic budget classification in accordance with the IMF Government
 Financial Statistics (GFS); taking into account the budget classification implication of the Local Authority Law
 4/2000 2002; (ii) Amendment of the budget preparation guidelines and the accounting procedure, as well as the
 samples and registers and books of account to take account of the changes mentioned above; and (iii) establish the
 Accounting and Financial Management Information System (AFMIS) to computerize budgeting and accounting,
 helping to improve budget control and transparency. Results were mixed.

 In 2005, the Cabinet (Resolution No. 253 of August 9, 2005) approved a Public Finance Management Reform
 Strategy. The first phase of this PFM reform strategy was implemented over the years 2006 to 2008 and aimed to
 (i) deepen and ascertain the earlier initiated PFM reforms in the area of budget preparation, execution and
 information systems; adoption of modern government budgeting principles; (ii) enhance budget control
 mechanism, financial accountability; reporting integrity as well as timeliness, and transparency; and (iii) address
 the weaknesses of the public procurement system. While AFMIS implementation during this phase could not be
 advanced, GFS-compliant economic reporting of revenues and expenditures was introduced; functional reporting
 of expenditures requires further work; off-budget transactions could be reduced; an MTEF was elaborated for the
 first time for the years 2010 to 2012, and a major reform could be advanced by adopting the new procurement law
 of 2007 (Law No. 23), which introduces international best standards in Yemen, and provides for an improved
 institutional set-up, including the High Authority for Tender Control (HATC) and the High Tender Board (HTB)
 as the regulating authority.

 Improving the effectiveness of the external PFM control mechanism, key being the Central Organization for
 Controls and Audit (COCA), would be desirable. Although COCA could improve its technical capacity
 considerably over last 2 decades, it requires further institutional strengthening to meet adequately its mandate. In
 particular, COCA would need to be granted more time to assess the annual final public accounts. Establishment of
 the Supreme National Authority for Combating Corruption (SNACC) in July 2007 could strengthen the still
 nascent demand side for better governance. Although, some improvements in civil service modernization could be
 achieved since 2004, foremost by introducing the biometric card, but strengthening the control mechanism,
 payroll mechanism, recruitment and career policies, would require continuous attention.

E.      Improving Equity and Efficiency of the Social Protection System
64. The Government of Yemen seeks to create a more inclusive society, including through the
provision of sustainable protection of people living in a situation of extreme poverty and
vulnerability. The Social Protection Strategy (SPS) aims to offer an appropriate and effective recourse
against an array of risks and shocks that affect the poor and those who are at risk of becoming poor.
Yemen faces a big challenge in reducing vulnerability due to a poor growth results and a rapidly growing
population. To meet the challenge, Yemen is implementing a series of social protection programs and
social security policies.

65. Social protection policies in Yemen are carried out through a variety of programs and
institutions. These include the Social Welfare Fund (SWF), Social Fund for Development (SFD), Public
Works Projects (PWP) as well as programs for Social and Family Development, the Disabled and the
Handicapped, Rural Development, Children and Youth or more broadly the Agriculture and Fisheries
Production Promotion Fund (AFPPF). The objectives and funding details are provided in the table below.

                      community participation in the development
                      process.

66. The Social Protection (SP) programs offer a broad range of assistance. While the SFD and PWP
activities provide medium to long-term benefits to poor communities through supporting access to social
services and economic opportunities, the SWF program is the only national program that is mandated to
reach chronically poor households with immediate safety net support through the provision of cash
assistance. More recently, the SFD has also initiated large-scale labor-intensive public works programs
through the Labor Intensive Works (LIW) component to simultaneously provide wages/cash transfers to
chronically poor households as well build essential community infrastructure, including soil and water
conservation.

67. The existing cash transfer program offered through the Social Welfare Fund (SWF) will need to
become more efficient through better targeting to respond effectively to the need arising from the
energy subsidy reduction. The SWF is the largest public cash-transfer mechanism in Yemen. Its

                                                      24
coverage expanded from 100,000 beneficiaries at its start in 1996 to over 1 million Yemeni households in
2009. The Fund's budget has grown from US$4 million at the outset to US$200 million in 2008/2009. In
response to the food crisis, in 2009, the government doubled the maximum SWF benefits to YR 4,000
(US$20) per case per month. One reason for the rapid increase in the number of beneficiaries, prior to the
Law No.39 on Social Welfare, approved in 2008, beneficiaries were defined by social categories (i.e.
widows, single females with no male support, elderly, etc.) without reference to economic circumstances.
A survey conducted in 2008 established poverty household groups according to predefined income
categories, from A to F, from the poorest households to F, with E to F being household categories above
the established poverty line. The survey concluded that 272,811 households (E to F category) should have
their benefits terminated as their inclusion is not in line with economic and/or poverty conditions, and that
504,451 eligible poor households, by contrast, should receive assistance.

68. The Government has initiated efforts to reform the cash-transfer program under the SWF to
make it more effective (targeted). The European Commission (EC) and the Bank are jointly engaged in
ongoing support to the SWF to assist in improving its targeting and encouraging the development of an
effective monitoring and evaluation system, in line with the revised Law on Social Welfare of 2008.

69. The government is planning to graduate the households of the income category E and F. While
graduation is politically sensitive because of the former inclusion of households according to social
considerations rather than to economic consideration, the Government has resolved to apply the
conclusion of the 2008 survey and use its definition of income groups (A to F) as a key eligible criterion
for an inclusive cash transfer system for the poor which meets also the equity criterion as the way
forward. It is expected that through application of the SWF law and the supporting by-laws, the non-
eligible cases are terminated in due course, in line with the survey conducted and as prescribed by the
law. Government commitment to the application of by-laws to the Social Welfare Law is manifested in
the approval of such by-laws by the Council of Ministers.

                     IV. BANK SUPPORT TO THE GOVERNMENT PROGRAM

A.      Objectives and Rationale
     i. Objectives

70. The main objective of the proposed Development Policy Grant is to foster private sector growth
in the non-hydrocarbon part of the economy, to improve key aspects of the public financial management
system, and to mitigate the impact of the ongoing fuel subsidy reduction on the poor by creating a more
inclusive and more equitable cash transfer system.

71. The common theme of improving Yemen's growth prospects in combination with improved
governance brings these specific goals together. First, setting the conditions for inclusive private sector
growth and investment is critical to ensure non-hydrocarbon growth, fiscal sustainability and
employment. Second, strengthening budget management is critical to ensure aggregate fiscal discipline
and reduce waste and unproductive expenditures. Third, a social protection system can only be truly
efficient and protect, if it is fiscally sustainable, which can be achieved through a focus on the identified
poor in Yemen and graduating others.

     ii. Rationale

72. This DPG provides a timely response to Yemen's financing needs and opens the door for a
comprehensive dialogue and partnership with the country. This one tranche DPG offers the Bank the
opportunity to launch a well-conceptualized dialogue for the medium term with the Government in
support of continuous policy reforms based on Yemen's upcoming new Development Strategy for
Poverty Reduction, 2011 to 2015. The ongoing Bank assistance and policy engagement to Yemen creates
the opportunity to seek commitment in well-defined areas for reform.

73. Success in mitigating the impact of the fiscal crisis on Yemen's economy will involve a
combination of fiscal adjustment and additional complementary financing. Together with the IMF's
proposed arrangement under the Extended Credit Facility (ECF), this DPG would help focus energies in
key complementary reform for the adjustment process, and provide relief for some immediate financing
pressures on the budget. The Bank is supporting the Government in the adjustment process, both directly
and through its participation in the design of the new ECF with the IMF. Further Bank support to the
adjustment process is however, critical for adjusting successfully to an economy with a largely reduced
oil sector and for sustaining the reform process.

74. The importance of a medium-to-long term focus, however, cannot be overstated. Yemen's fiscal
and structural adjustment to a period with a reduced oil sector is unlikely to be achieved through this
operation only. The structural reforms required to build up a vibrant private sector that could substitute
the oil sector will take time and are medium- and long-term in nature. Therefore, a reform program is
needed that can accompany for the medium- and longer-term in support of Yemen's development goals s
and to overcome the country's vulnerability. Figure 1 illustrates the short and medium term aspects of the
DPG Supporting and sustaining the medium term aspects would require additional programmatic
operations. Foremost, private sector development and budget management would from the core of future
operations, building on this DPG.

         and revenue opportunities;           Yemen make more efficient         Welfare Fund, in
         and (ii) create alternatives         and effective use of its own      accordance with SWF
         sources for growth.                  resources.                        developed poverty criteria.




B.       Link to the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS)
75. Although this DPG was not originally included in the CAS 2010-13 presented to the Board of
Executive Directors in May 2009, it is fully consistent with the CAS thematic areas. The CAS aims
to:

     (i) Help accelerate and diversify economic growth (macroeconomic stability; private sector);
     (ii) Help enhance governance (transparency; public finance management; civil service);
     (iii) Help foster human and social development (cross sectoral issues such as gender, youth; and Qat;
           education and health; community development and social protection);
     (iv) Help manage natural resource scarcity and natural risks (water resources; natural development;
           infrastructure; support to non-oil drivers of growth).

76. The three DPG pillars are linked as follows to the CAS themes: private and financial sector
reforms are key components of the first theme of the CAS; budget management and prioritization is at the
core of the second CAS theme; and building an effective social safety net is reflected in all four themes.
In all three areas there are ongoing Bank-supported operations being implemented in Yemen and current
or planned AAA work. These links are summarized in Figure 2.

77. Furthermore, by energizing the reform efforts in three out of four CAS policy areas, the DPG
will help implement the CAS and achieve its objectives. First, the DPG brings together in a single
operation different strands of the reform program supported by the CAS. Second, by bundling support to
Yemen's reform agenda, the DPG can help meet key CAS goals more quickly than through investment
projects. Third, by providing resources to Yemen at a time of critical need, the DPG opens the door for
engagement with Yemen on its medium-term development agenda as envisaged by the CAS.

                                                               and natural risks (water resources;

C.      Collaboration with the IMF and Other Donors
This operation and the Extended Credit Facility (ECF) arrangement approved by the IMF Board
on July 31st, 2010 are mutually reinforcing and complementary to each other. In designing the Bank
support to the Government's reform program, account was taken of the fact that the IMF supported
program by an ECF focuses primarily on macroeconomic stabilization and fiscal adjustment, whereas the
Bank focuses more on complementary issues to fiscal adjustment: private sector development, financial
sector development, public financial management reforms, and a reforms of the social protection system.
The coordination between the two teams was strong and ensured that the DPG reform program and the
Fund's structural benchmarks are complementary and mutually reinforcing. Further collaboration and
complementarily is expected in the areas of oil revenue management. Both the Fund and the Bank have
benefited from the work done by the IFC in the area of private sector development, supported by DFID,
which helped Yemen to advance on the key private sector reform as the new investment law, establishing
higher standards for tax exemptions, and creating the framework for Special Economic Zones in Yemen.
In addition, the IMF and the Bank teams benefited from on-going Fund technical assistance in the area of
the National Accounts whereas the Bank is providing assistance to the National Statistical System and to
the new Household Budget Survey, jointly with DFID, the Netherlands and the Kreditanstalt für
Wiederaufbau from Germany.

78. In all four policy areas of the proposed DPG, the technical assistance projects funded by the
World Bank Group, the IMF, and donors underpin the reform efforts. DFID is collaborating with
the IFC to assist in important regulatory reforms for the private sector and initiate reforms, which initiate
deepening financial sector development. GTZ, EC and USAID support private sector development from
an institutional angle. All are engaged at different entry points and at various degrees in the areas of
public financial management and governance reforms. In the area of social protection most development
partners concentrate on the programs developed by the Social Fund for Development and its community

                                                      28
development focus, whereas the World Bank and the EC extend their assistance also to the Social Welfare
Fund. Coordination among donors is close and frequent, as Yemen is a pilot country for implementation
of the OECD Principles for Good International Engagement in Fragile States.

79. The preparation of the 4th Economic Development Plan for Poverty Reduction, 2011 to 2015, is
being supported by the Bank and other partners including UNDP. While the actual new plan is still
at an early stage, preparatory work has begun some time ago and fed also in the Friends of Yemen
process. More recently, the Bank has offered the government a series of policy notes to inform the new
planning process. Other development partners, including the UN system, have also advised the process to
help the government to prioritize and assess the required actions to meet the Millennium Development
Goals (MDGs).

D.      Relationship to Other World Bank Group Operations
80. The proposed DPG is underpinned by six companion projects designed to build capacity and
provide technical assistance in each of the three pillars, namely:

        Institutional Reform Development Policy Grant (IRDPG) (US$51 million; FY09, see also Box
        5), First, the operation supports non-oil growth through investment climate reforms by
        rationalizing the incentive framework (harmonizing treatment of income, expenses and
        investment) in accordance with international standards. Second, property rights (land registration)
        are strengthened by improving land titling. Third, governance and public financial management is
        improved by (i) supporting procurement reforms; (ii) by rationalizing civil service management;
        and (iii) by increasing natural resource revenue transparency through supporting Yemen's
        adhesion to the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI). The focus of the IRDPG is
        on improving the conditions for private sector growth, improving the tax base, and strengthening
        public financial management. This new operation builds on the IRDPG.

        The World Bank Group, especially IFC with financial support from DFID, supports the
        government in a broad private and financial sector development technical assistance project to
        improve the enabling environment for investment. The focus is the Investment Climate.
        Progress has been made on the Business Start-Up Simplification Program, expanding the program
        into governorates. Progress has also been made on the Tax Simplification and Investment Laws
        which have been approved by Parliament on August 7th and August 1st, 2010, respectively. WBG
        support on the credit registry has been critical. Completing the Microfinance Banking legislation
        was greatly assisted by the German Technical Cooperation (GTZ) joined by the WBG. Building
        on such a success, the development of a Special Economic Zone framework has had been
        advanced.

        Technical assistance for reforming the legal framework for investment in the Petroleum sector.
        In the attempt to improve investment conditions in Yemen's oil sector, the government has
        recently taken the decision to develop a comprehensive development strategy for the oil, gas and
        minerals and review the legal, fiscal and regulatory frameworks as well as the structure of the
        petroleum licensing rounds to improve sector management and attract investment. This technical
        assistance builds on earlier technical assistance delivered to the sector.

        Proposed Public Financial Management (PFM) Reform Project (US$12 million; FY11). This
        proposed project aims to improve budget preparation, allocation, execution, transparency and
        accountability in the mobilization and use of all public resources. Cross-cutting PFM reforms
        will improve budget preparation and linkages to medium term development policy plan (DPPR),
        strengthening budget formulation, execution and control, improving public financial reporting,

                                                   29
        strengthening public procurement and developing capacity in PFM, both at the central and the
        governorate levels.

        Social Welfare Fund Institutional Support Project (ISP), (US$10 million, FY10), which aims to
        improve the institutional capacity and efficiency of the Social Welfare Fund (SWF). The project
        will support and implement the SWF reform as outlined in the revised 2008 SWF law (No. 39)
        with a focus on poverty-based targeting, reduction of the inclusion and exclusion errors, and
        define the SWF's role in beneficiary access to social and economic opportunities. The Project
        Development Objectives are to: (i) increase the share of poor households among the beneficiaries
        of the cash transfer program; and (ii) contribute in building the human capital of SWF
        beneficiaries in selected districts.

E.      Analytical Underpinnings
81. The proposed DPG is underpinned by a series of recently completed and ongoing analytical
and advisory tasks, programmatic technical assistance, and projects. The proposed policy actions
and outcomes are founded on a continuous engagement of the Bank in the areas covered under the
proposed DPG.

82. The IFC prepared various policy notes for designing the Private Sector Reform Project,
underpinned by the Bank's Investment Climate Assessment of 2006 and its update of 2010. The
advisory branch of the IFC prepared for each reform project detailed policy notes that identified the
priority areas for the private sector reform components. The notes were intensively discussed with
stakeholders from government and the private sector in workshops. The key recommendation from these
workshops informed and guided the reform approach and as a result the components covered through this
DPG.

83. The ongoing assistance in public financial management (initiated in 2005) underlined the need
for more efficient public spending in Yemen. The Bank has gained insight in this area through both
formal Economic and Sector Work (ESW) as well as through its technical assistance program. In 2008,
the Bank finalized a Financial Sector Review for the Yemeni Government, which gave a detailed
overview of the constraints in the sector and how to address these. A Public Expenditure and Financial
Accountability Assessment (PEFA) (2008) provides an integrated assessment of PFM performance,
highlighting the main impediments for efficient public resource management, the impact of PFM
weaknesses and prospects for reform planning and implementation. Two prior actions for this operation
are focused on improving the budget allocation process. The PEFA highlighted the importance of
rationalizing levels of public expenditure and prioritizing sector resource allocations in order to reflect
better the Government's policy priorities. To this end, the Bank has been supporting the Ministry of
Finance in preparing a framework for a medium-term budget strategy reflecting Government policy
priorities and medium-term macroeconomic and fiscal projections. The National Poverty Reduction
Strategy (DPPR) is currently being prepared for the years 2011 to 2015, and it is expected that the
alignment of budgetary allocations, particularly in the social sectors, will be improved. The PEFA also
refers to the importance of exercising oversight of fiscal risk by ensuring that the national budget and
financial statements cover all the major revenue and expenditure programs of government and that full
reporting of the central government's financial relationships with sub-national government is essential to
maintaining fiscal discipline and accountability. A Public Expenditure Review is planned for FY11/12 to
examine public expenditure policy issues.

84. The social protection reform underpinnings are supported by a number of Bank-supported
activities. They include the technical assistance delivered to the Ministry of Plan and International
Cooperation (MOPIC) and the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs on a policy note covering a social

                                                    30
protection strategy that includes safety net, labor market and pension issues. The note was discussed in a
series of policy workshops. Furthermore the efficiency of the safety net was supported by a note and
technical assistance work on the targeting policies of the SWF. The results of a survey had shown that the
SWF cash based safety net program is not well-targeted to the poorest.

85. The Household Budget Survey of 2005 and the corresponding Poverty Assessment has been the
key analytical base for additional analytical reports helping to understand the poverty implication
of the policy choices underlying the DPG. The last household budget survey was the base for a poverty
impact and incidence analysis of energy subsidy elimination, complemented by the study Coping
Strategies in Rural Yemen.23 Relevant poverty insights were also gained from work done by the
International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) on Food Security and Policy Implication in Yemen.

F.         Lessons Learned
86. The recently concluded CAS of the Bank Group's engagement in Yemen was rated moderately
satisfactorily. In a context of limited institutional capacity, implementation remains challenging. Bank
Group assistance has proven, however, effective in supporting specific reforms. The quality of the
dialogue established with both the authorities and stakeholders has made it possible to promote and
advice on the design of important reforms, although with significant variations.

87. Despite the mixed results obtained thus far in terms of institution building in Yemen, the
Bank's engagement in this area continues to be an imperative for Yemen, and its delivery should be
customized to Yemen's needs and the Bank's own ability to meet those needs. Yemen's policy and
institutional environment has not been conducive to a smooth implementation of the Bank Group's
assistance program. Main bottlenecks include: (i) weak capacity of ministries and implementing
agencies; (ii) similar, private sector capacity is weak due to a lack of skilled professionals; (iii) lack of
familiarity with World Bank procedures; (iv) a complex decision-making process; and (v) lengthy
procedures and inability or unwillingness to delegate functions within ministries. As such the
underpinning technical assistance projects in each of the three DPG pillars are key.

88. Synergies within the Bank Group have proven effective to provide enhanced support. CAS
results have been underpinned in large part by the close cooperation and synergies developed within the
Bank Group. One of the strengths of the Bank Group's program in Yemen has been to conceive, design
and implement activities as complementary parts of an overall effort. The Government has expressed its
satisfaction with the efforts made to further maximize these synergies through integrated packages of
knowledge, advisory services, technical assistance and financing.

89. Interest and engagement on the part of ministries and implementing agencies needs to be the
primary criterion for Bank support. Counterpart engagement has been uneven across ministries and
implementing agencies. In addition, lack of qualified human resources has led often to slow
implementation and little progress. Government commitment exists in each of the three DPG pillars as
demonstrated by the active engagement in each of these areas.

90. Simplifying design and streamlining implementation arrangements is a prerequisite to success
in Yemen. A realistic assessment of capacity constraints should guide design and implementation.
Implementation success is higher, if due regard is paid to using national systems to the extent possible
and complex arrangements are avoided. This is also a lesson derived from the work on the IRDPG (see
also Box 5).

     Coping Strategies in Rural Yemen and Policy Implications, June 2010 (World Bank).

                                                        31
91. Priority and selectivity is needed in the design and programming of Bank assistance, which is a
key lesson from the Institutional Reform Development Policy Grant (IRDPG) experience. The
scope for experimentation with alternative implementation modes and arrangements needs to be used
rigorously. Building success cases, in the complex conditions offered in Yemen is more important than
having a comprehensive approach.

92. In addition to the Bank's project and program review in Yemen, the 2009 Development Policy
Lending Retrospective24 indicates that programmatic DPLs allow the Bank to stay aligned with
country processes and respond more flexibly to changing country circumstances and government
priorities. Flexibility has been essential in many cases to strengthen ownership of reforms supported by
the Bank. Although the current DPG is not a programmatic DPG, it is suitable for Yemen's changing
circumstances which require flexibility, particularly given upcoming elections and therefore ownership of
and commitment to the reform agenda.

93. Monitoring and evaluation (M&E) is weak. In an environment where reliable statistical data are
often lacking, further efforts are needed to enhance the design of outcome indicators and the
corresponding collection methods. This will require providing technical and financial assistance in
support of statistical systems as well as improving the choice of outcome indicators for upcoming
operations.

     Box 5: Institutional Reform Development Policy Grant: Progress, Challenges and Lessons Learned

 Goals: The Institutional Reform Development Policy Grant (IRDPG) aims to support the Government's reform
 strategy as elaborated in the 3rd Development Plan for Poverty Reduction (DPPR) of 2006, consistent with the
 Bank's Country Assistance Strategy. The IRDPG, emphasizes two key elements: (i) supporting non-oil growth
 through investment climate reforms and (ii) strengthening governance and financial management. With regard to
 the first goal, the focus was (i) rationalizing the incentive framework through reform of the income tax law and
 (ii) strengthening property rights by improving land titling and public management of land registration. With
 regard to the second goal, the focus was (i) public procurement reform, (ii) civil service reforms, and (iii)
 improved revenue transparency, in particular through Yemen's accession to EITI.
 Progress: The first tranche of the IRDPG, approved by the Board of Directors in December 2007, was released
 in April 2008. This involved five prior actions, including the drafting of a new corporate income tax law, and
 submission of a new land registration law, the submission of a new public procurement law, and the declaration
 by Yemen of its commitment to the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative. Subsequent to this, four
 triggers were met by early 2010:

      1.   the issuance by the Council of Ministers of Yemen of a decree defining the mandate of the General
           Authority for Lands, Survey and Urban Planning.
      2.   The implementation of the civil service fund program from June 2007 to May 2008.
      3.   The application of the provisions of the 2005 Wage Law.
      4.   The establishment of a computerized, biometric database of all state employees (non-military/security).

 In addition, the Government had established a procurement policy monitoring body, the Higher Authority on
 Tender Control (HATC), under the provisions of the new public procurement law, and had launched the first
 stage tender for a Procurement Monitoring Information System (PMIS). It had submitted a best-practice income
 tax law to Parliament accompanied by a new investment law and revisions to the Customs Code that together
 modernized the incentive framework for private investment and enterprise. However, due to delays in completing
 the tender for the PMIS and establishing a functional interim PMIS system; delays in Parliamentary
 consideration of the new tax law, and delays in the work of the EITI Council to commission and publish a
 reconciliation audit ( an issue whose details were hotly contested between civil society and the operating
 companies), the Government requested a six month extension of the second tranche release and agreed to an

24
   2009 Development Policy Lending Retrospective, "Flexibility, Customization, and Results", OPCS, The World Bank, August
5, 2009.

                                                          32
action plan for completion of the three outstanding actions. Subsequent to this, the Parliament adopted the new
income tax law, as part of a package that included a new Investment Law and amendments to the Customs Code,
in early August, 2010, after lengthy formal and informal deliberations. The Government then enacted the new
Income Tax Law, as well as the new Investment Law, and related elements of the "package". It completed
procurement of the PMIS, established the interim PMIS. With regard to EITI, under a Government mediated
agreement between petroleum companies and civil society representatives, a reconciliation audit was prepared
and delivered to the EITI Council in preparation for its publication.

Impact: While legislation was needed to establish a framework for reforms, much additional work on
implementation is required to have impact. Although the second tranche of IRDPG focused also on
implementation, ultimately, the impact of IRDPG will depend on actions taken to carry through implementation
well beyond the lifespan of the project. Among the benefits anticipated are:

    1.   The income tax reform will have a major beneficial impact for the country by establishing a more
         predictable, equitable and credible incentive framework, as well as a more reliable revenue source for
         Government. The coordinated reforms of income tax, investment and customs laws created a far more
         coherent and internationally-standard incentive framework. With its simpler regime for SMEs and
         generalized incentives for investment, the tax law should encourage new entry and employment creation,
         while reducing corruption and evasion. Administratively, the self-assessment and risk-based audit
         system that will be applied under the new income tax system (should reduce bureaucratic burden on
         businesses and increase predictability of tax obligations. Ongoing technical assistance for tax
         administrative reform (IFC Advisory Services/DFID) will enhance the impact of legal and regulatory
         changes on practice.
    2.   Land registration problems are not yet fully addressed, although the new land registration law is since
         October 2010subject to priority consideration by the Parliament. Access to land and obtaining proper
         title to remains a key challenge for businesses (2010 ICA Update). Disputes about landownership are
         also a prime source of conflict in Yemen, and the risk of challenges to land title increase uncertainty for
         investors. It will be critical to mobilize technical support for Government once the land registration law
         is approved.
    3.   The HATC is active and engaged, under direct mandate from the President. It is currently training
         procurement officers in multiple agencies and has initiated its regulatory functions. It is anticipated that
         the PMIS will enhance its ability to standardize and regulate procurement practices, consistent with the
         good practices embodied in the public procurement law. Substantial technical support for HATC is
         programmed into the upcoming Public Financial Management operation of the World Bank, which
         should magnify the benefit of the legal, institutional and technical reforms achieved to date.
    4.   Publication of the first EITI reconciliation audit, covering the years 2005 to 2007, is a major first step in
         improving revenue transparency in Yemen's extractive industry. Civil society has shown an
         encouraging engagement in the process. Continued Government support as well as follow-up by the
         EITI Council will be needed to continue to foster a constructive dialogue between companies and civil
         society organizations in the EITI decision-making process. Both stakeholders have contributed to
         substantial delays. But support from many sides, including from senior Government leadership and the
         Bank, helped to overcome deadlock finding compromise decisions. Support will continue under the
         multi-donor EITI trust fund administered by the World Bank, but deepening local ownership by all
         participants is vital to sustaining the EITI process and maintaining Yemen's standing as an EITI member
         state.
    5.   Civil Service Reforms supported under the IRDPG activated systems and introduced clearer procedures
         for handling basic public employment issues. Thus legal and consistent criteria were applied under the
         wage strategy to agency requests for wage increases, a functional system was operated to provide orderly
         and socially acceptable exit options for public employees, and a comprehensive computerized biometric
         database was achieved covering all civilian and most military and security employees of Government.
         This laid the foundation for further reforms to rationalize public employment, if the political will can be
         mobilized to pursue them. However, in terms of actual removal of double-dippers and ghost workers;
         rationalization of staffing in accordance with agency needs, and containment of the wage bill, the effect
         of these measures to date has been marginal.

Based on the progress observed since March 2010, all of the IRDPG second tranche conditions are expected to be

                                                         33
 met by end of November 2010. The final trigger is the issuance of executive regulations for the new income tax
 law. The regulations are being carefully prepared by the government team with an intense technical assistance
 input from WBG advisors. The work on these regulations, a legally complex undertaking, is expected to be
 concluded during November 2010.

 Challenges and Lessons Learned: The second tranche of the IRDPG focuses on implementing measures that
 are linked to policy actions taken under the first tranche and, as such, are subject to greater risk. Full
 implementation requires also consent by the Parliament, whose privilege for deliberations adds to delays but also
 adds a vital political endorsement of the reforms. However, several lessons can be learned from where the project
 encountered delays or where its impact, so far, appears to be limited:

         In the context of complex domestic civil and political conditions, implementation of many reforms were
         delayed, including much of the Government's legislative agenda. The underlying lack of political
         consensus on several issues ­ tax reform, land registration reform, and EITI audits, for example ­ help
         explain important delays. To the extent that the progress of actual reform steps are unpredictable, the
         Bank may choose one-tranche operations in the future. However, it must be noted that, the incentive of
         second tranche release and intense support from the Bank was instrumental in advancing action on the
         income tax reform and the resolution of the impasse in EITI.
         On the World Bank side, staff transitions in some cases added to delays of some reform measures. For
         example, lack of continuous engagement on procurement of the PMIS allowed a multi-month delay in
         the process to persist, until project supervision activities uncovered a misunderstanding about
         responsibilities between two agencies. When the Bank's expert on land reform rotated to another region,
         advisory expertise and momentum for achieving the land registration reform temporarily diminished.
         Staff transition interrupted supervision of the biometric database as well.
         Lack of a single parallel project for technical assistance made the project supervision more complex, as
         technical assistance instead came from a variety of complementary activities of the Bank, IFC and other
         donors, which required extensive coordinative effort.
         Capacity limitations in the Yemeni Government evidenced themselves at several points in the project,
         argue for limiting the number of components and counterpart agencies involved. This argues for a more
         cautious sequencing and a prioritized approach.




     V. THE PROPOSED PRIVATE SECTOR GROWTH AND SOCIAL PROTECTION
                      DEVELOPMENT POLICY GRANT

A.      Operation Description
94. The choice of reform areas follows clear selection criteria. The reform package concentrates on
areas which are priority for the Yemen Government as well as for Bank support under the Country
Assistance strategy (CAS); where the Bank has a comparative advantage; and which could help mitigate
Yemen's fiscal and socio-economic vulnerabilities. The supported reforms serve economic
diversification, financial deepening, improved use of public resources and a more equitable social
protection. All reform areas contribute indirectly to regain a sustainable fiscal path in Yemen. They build
on past and on-going back work in these areas. These reforms were seen as critical in supporting the
reform thrust.

95. The proposed pillars of this DPG meet the selection criteria outlined above. The proposed
pillars are: (i) generating private sector growth and employment; (ii) improving public financial
management and governance; and (iii) improving the efficiency and equity of the social protection
system. All three areas are clearly consistent with the CAS themes (see Figure 2), support key aspects of
the Government's reform program and reflect the Bank's comparative advantage. They are underpinned

                                                        34
by ongoing Bank-supported investment operations as well as past, current or planned AAA work. In
addition, and as discussed further below, reforms in these areas can help mitigate some of the more
extreme effects of oil dependence and revenue volatility.

96. Strengthening non-hydrocarbon growth provides a common thread for the four selected reform
areas. First, private sector reforms will directly generate non-hydrocarbon growth, broader employment
opportunities, and as a result will strengthen the fiscal accounts through greater fiscal revenues. Second, a
functioning banking system is a necessary component of private sector development needed to diversify
the economy for non-oil growth. Third, strengthening budget management and governance is critical to
ensure aggregate fiscal discipline and reduce waste and unproductive expenditures, favoring public
investment and the reducing the pressure that large fiscal deficits place on interest rates and on the
availability of credit to the domestic private sector. Fourth , a retargeting of the beneficiary base of the
Social Welfare Fund and a strengthening of the exit rules will contribute to a truly efficient social
protection system can only be truly efficient that is fiscally sustainable and equitable

97. Nine prior actions are identified for this DPG supporting a robust reform program for Yemen
along four critical areas. The program is adequate for Yemen's situation, and complements the
structural reform agenda agreed upon with the IMF under the ECF arrangement, which was approved on
July 30th, 2010 by the IMF Board. The actions under the program are crucial to paving the way for deeper
reforms and institution building. The proposed program will therefore prepare the ground for even
stronger policy reform actions as part of the Government's reform program. The full development impact
of the operation will take more than one year to materialize and will be stronger, if followed with
continued programmatic support. The prior actions are described in Box 6.

       and the strengthening of its operation. .


B.        Policy Areas
B.1. Private Sector Growth and Employment 

98. Yemen has made significant progress towards improving the investment climate. Progress in
various fronts include: the revision of the tax and investment laws, improvements in the business
environment and the design of a new regime for Special Economic Zones. In early August Parliament
approved the Tax Simplification and Investment Laws, which introduced an institutional set-up for
investment in accordance with international bets practices. The new investment law not only eliminates
inefficient tax holidays under the old investment law (in favor of investment incentives built into the
income tax law), but set the basis for the General Investment Authority to shed regulatory functions and
focus on core activities of investment promotion, investment facilitation, investor services (aftercare), and
investment advocacy. This complements and advances the aims of the IRDPG (see also box 4) to create a
rational, best practice investment framework and to promote non-oil growth by expanding private
investment. It complements also on-going technical assistance work provided by the IFC. Major progress
has also been made in simplifying the business environment, where Yemen has made a jump in the
ranking of Doing Business Report of 2009 which could be maintained in report for 2010. Progress could
also be made in building upon previous successes of the Business Start-Up Simplification Program,
expanding the program into a number of governorates, however there were interests, which sought to
amend or at least delay the resultant legislation in Parliament. The development of a Special Economic
Zone framework, to provide for an effective tool for streamlined investment in line with bets practices,
has well advanced and is expected to be finalized towards end 2010. Anticipating the reform, the
restructuring of the Aden Free Zone set-up has already begun with the abolishment of its Central
Authority.

99. Prior Action 1: Streamlining of investment incentives: a new law on investment has been
enacted, which provides, inter alia, for the elimination of firm-specific tax holidays by moving them
to the tax code, and supports investment promotion, facilitation and advocacy. In the past, effective
use of investment incentives have been impeded by inconsistent, discretionary and distortive use of
incentives allowed for in the income tax, investment and customs laws and by a lack of modern
investment promotion practices. Foreign and domestic private investment is clearly critical for Yemen to
upgrade productivity, support diversification and employment growth, and stimulate innovation. A new
investment law, approved by the Parliament on August 1st, 2010, is coordinated with a package of parallel
reforms in the income tax law and of the Customs Code, will rationalize the incentive framework,
eliminate the large number of firm-specific tax holidays, and offer investment incentives (such as
accelerated depreciation and loss carry-forward) through the tax code. Furthermore, it provides a
framework for modernizing investment promotion under the General Investment Authority (GIA) to focus
on investment promotion, investment facilitation, investor services (aftercare), and investment advocacy
activities. World Bank Group technical support and careful Government shepherding has assured that the
provisions of the new framework are in line with international best practice.

100.      Expected results. The investment incentive system has been rationalized and is rule or law

                                                         36
based. The General Investment Authority has been reorganized around the core functions of investment
promotion, investor facilitation, investor services and advocacy, in line with the stipulations of the new
investment law.

101.    Prior Action 2: Simplification of business entry procedures, including the launch of a one-
stop shop for business entry procedures, and the introduction of registration and building
permitting, has been introduced in the governorates of Aden, Taiz, Al-Hodeidah, Hadhramout and
Ibb. Regulatory simplification and transparency is critical to strengthening Yemen's investment climate.
Currently, obscure and discretionary administrative procedures deter investors and delay new projects.
Following technical support through the business process simplification project of the World Bank Group
(financed by DFID), the Doing Business Report 2009 recorded an extraordinary improvement in business
entry procedures in Sana'a, reducing the days required to open a business from 63 to 13 and a decline in
cost equivalent to 85 percent of per capital national income, and a reduction in the number of procedures
from 12 to 7. Since then, further improvements were recorded in Sana'a, and simplifications were
introduced in 5 governorates (Aden, Taiz, Al-Hodeidah, Hadhramout and Ibb) through a decree from the
Ministry of Trade and industry. The IFC is currently supporting the build-up and the capacity of these
new one-stop shops. In the first line of support is Aden, Taiz, Al-Hodeidah. It is expected that these
business regulatory simplification will yield measurable benefits eventually in all five locations by
reducing barriers to entry. Parallel reforms are expected to streamline building permitting, whose cost has
already markedly declined between 2008 and 2010.

102.   Expected results. The improved business climate in the governorates of Aden, Taiz, and Al-
Hodeidah led to an increased registration of companies.

B.2. Enhancing Financial Intermediation and Improving Access to Finance  

103.    There are 16 banks operating in Yemen, having 241 branches which provide currently for
mainly urban coverage. Of the 16 banks, 3 are majority owned by the state, in two the state holds a
minority share. The remaining 11 banks are privately owned and have at various degrees a foreign
investor or owner. Of the 16 Banks 4 are Islamic banks, holding about 32 percent of total banking assets.
In addition, there are now since June 2010 2 microfinance banks. Bank's combined assets amounted at
end 2009 to about 32 percent of GDP. Financial deepening is limited, although the loan to deposit ratio
has increased since 2008 from 55 percent to 68 percent. About 30 percent of the assets are held in
treasury bills. Lending is mainly trade financing (70 to 80 percent of total lending), and short term, up to
one year. Credit periods run typically not longer than 3 to 6 months. A serious obstacle for credit market
development is the management of risk, respectively the availability of collateral.

104.    Households and enterprises with modest income or turn-over volume rarely have access to
financial services, partly also because a large share of the population lives in rural areas that are difficult
or costly to access. There is no tradition of credit arrangements in Yemen, also because Islamic practice
discourages interest rates. Microfinance institutions (MFIs) in Yemen are therefore a fairly recent
phenomenon. The first were introduced in 1996. Until 2009, microfinance was exclusively operated and
extended through regional non-governmental organization, with a technical support through the Social
Fund for Development (SFD). The success of these operations paved the way for the Microfinance
Banking Law of 2009, which aims to put the industry on a sound legal footing to ensure a stable
development path of microfinance.

105.    Prior Action 3: Effective launch of a credit registry in line with a Central Bank of Yemen
circular specifying scope and periodicity of credit reporting to a central credit registry as well as
access to such pooled credit information. The financial market in Yemen, as in many developing
countries, suffers from the lack of instruments that can lower the lending risk for banks as the prime

                                                      37
obstacle for expansion of credit to the private sector. The pooling of borrower information in a credit
registry would enable Banks in Yemen to better assess their lending risks, lower the credit transaction
costs, and improve the quality of the loan portfolio, thereby enabling banks to consider credit expansion
and offer eventually extended credit terms. The efforts of the government have already led to an improved
ranking in the category "getting credit" in the Doing Business Report of 2010, moving 24 positions
upwards to 150.

106.    Expected results: The credit registry is fully operational as indicated by the at least 85,000 credit
contracts registered, and by the volume of regular requests from the main financial institutions in the
country.

107.     Prior Action 4: Completion of the regulatory framework for microfinance with the approval
of the by-laws concerning the law for microfinance banking that was adopted by the Parliament in
April 2009. The concept of micro-finance was introduced in Yemen only in 1996. Although the `label'
microfinance is nowadays widely used in Yemen, in practice the provision of microfinance services
remains confined to the provision of credit. The main providers are NGOs, which by law are not allowed
to take deposits, or to offer insurance or payment services. The passage of the Microfinance Banking Law
has changed this, as deposit-taking is now also allowed for MFIs. The new law has already an impact.
One MFI bank, Al-Amal Bank, was newly established in 2009 under special decree, anticipating passage
of the Law. Al-Amal Bank has reached now over 10,000 clients in less than one year. This bank is in the
process of changing its charter to comply with the new law and anticipated by-law. The largest money
exchange/transfer company in Yemen ­ Al-Kuraimi ­ obtained in June 2010 a full license as
microfinance bank. The Yemeni Bank with the largest share in private sector financing an also largest
Islamic bank, Tadhamon International Islamic Bank (TIIB), has established its own in-house micro-credit
program. The micro credit sector as a whole has today about 51,000 active clients with an outstanding
loan portfolio of the equivalent of almost US$ 10 million and extends an average credit of $200. While
the sector is still small, it is growing fast. The Al-Kuraimi Bank, an operator with a large and
geographically spread network and client base has entered this segment, offering to exploit synergies
between payment transfers services (current business line) and microfinance (business line under
development), which, if successful, would bring banking services to areas in Yemen that never had any.

108.   Expected results. The volume of microfinance segment has grown fast in 2011, and begun to
widen access to credit as well as to saving services.

B.3. Public Financial Management and Governance  

109.    This policy area aims to ensure that budgetary management and prioritization helps
improve fiscal sustainability while serving Yemen's long-term development needs. The country has
shown improvement in budget credibility, reflected in better budget execution, and enhanced budget
transparency, shown through broader public access to the annual budget data. There is a lack of linkages
between the National Development Plan and the Budget with the former being need-based, rather than
being resource-based, leading to significant differences between the Plan and Budget.

110.     The PEFA Assessment in 2008 revealed that payment arrears occurred frequently. Causes
for the arrears accrued, were typically weak links between the budget formulation processes and budget
execution; the absence of a budget preparation process characterized by the reconciliation of top-down
resource discipline and bottom-up inputs, and the lack of effective commitment control systems. There
are no controls over commitments and no systematic way of monitoring the stock of arrears.

111. Prior to the implementation of AFMIS, the line ministries prepared their budget manually.
AFMIS allows for built-in consistency checks of data input which prevents errors, and allows for

                                                     38
immediate review of expenditure and revenue status. AFMIS also assists in orderly budget execution in
the sense, that spending above budget credits is not possible AFMIS is also assisting in preparation of
final accounts. The system can thus prepare accurate in-year budget execution reports based on actual
logged-in vouchers and warrants, in a timely manner. Thus, AFMIS helps the Government to
strengthen its Budget Planning, Budget Execution Controls.

112.    Prior Action 5: Introduction of a Medium Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF),
underpinning the Budget for 2010 for the next 3 years. Expenditure policy decisions have multi-year
implications, and should be aligned with the resources available. Therefore, multi-year fiscal forecasts of
revenues, medium term expenditure aggregates for mandatory expenditure and potential deficit financing
should be the foundation for any policy planning. Also, a multi-year expenditure framework could help to
cushions some of the fluctuations in oil revenues. Past experience with oil revenue volatility would
suggest ad-hoc expenditure cuts, especially of the investment budget. Improving medium term forecasting
of revenues and expenditures requires, however, strengthening the coordination among key Ministries,
under the lead role of the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Planning and International Cooperation.

113.    Expected results. The country continues to improve its allocation of public resources as shown by
the updating in 2010 of the Medium Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF), underpinning the budget for
2011 over a 3-year time-frame.

114.    Prior Action 6: Introduction of expenditure Commitment Control Systems (CCS) on a pilot
basis in the Ministries of Public Works, Education, Health and Finance. The commitment control
system aims primarily to prevent payment arrears for delivery of services. The size and age of the
accumulated arrears in Government of Yemen remains largely unknown as there were no systems in
operation to capture record and monitor arrears. There are however indications, including through
COCA's audit activities, that suggest that the arrears may be substantial. An introduction of Commitment
Control System will allow the Government to measure the extent of the stock of arrears, and to bring the
problem under control. The strategy is that after successful introduction of the commitment control
system on a pilot basis in the Ministries of Public Works, Education, Health and Finance is to extend the
system to other ministries.

115.    Expected results. The Commitment Control System is operational, and potential arrears are
captured, recorded and monitored in pilot ministries (Public Works, Education, Health and Finance).

116.     Prior Action 7: Automation of the government financial accounts with the preparation of
Final Accounts 2009 and quarterly In-Year Budget Execution Reports for 2010 in the Ministries of
Public Works, Education, Health and Finance using the Accounting-based Financial Management
Information System (AFMIS). This prior action will demonstrate that the AFMIS has been successfully
piloted for the roll out in the remaining Ministries, Departments and Government Agencies. In addition
and in a drive to make budget information also more available to the public, the Minister of Finance has
established an information center at the Ministry of Finance providing access to key fiscal data for the
public.

117.    Expected results. Transparent and timely reporting of budget outcomes has been enhanced.

B.4. Improving the Efficiency and Equity of the Social protection system

118.    The recent Cabinet decision regarding the gradual elimination of energy subsidies reflects a
key shift from subsidizing consumption towards enabling the population to earn higher incomes
from their productive labor, in the context of a private sector-led, diversified economy. At the same
time, the Government of Yemen recognizes that the poor and vulnerable segments of the population are

                                                    39
unable to earn even a minimal income from their labor ­ due to disability, temporary unemployment, old
age or other reasons. Acknowledging this reality means that a system of social protection is an essential
part of the expenditure strategy.

119.     Prior Action 8: Establishment of a New Targeting Method for Beneficiaries of the Social
Welfare Fund: the Recipient's Council of Ministers has approved a proposal to operationalize a
new targeting methodology for beneficiaries of the Social Welfare Fund, based on the survey
conducted by the Social Welfare Fund in 2008. Following the results of a survey conducted by the
Social Welfare Fund (SWF) in 2008, the Council of Ministers approved on October 26th, 2010, a proposal
from the SWF that categorizes poor households that benefit from a SWF income supplement, and
households that should benefit from a SWF income supplement but currently do not, on a meritorious
basis (household categories A-F). These meritorious categories are then grouped as either a social case for
support or an economic case for support as defined in the law. The implementation of this method is
expected to result in households in categories E to F being phased out over a period of about three years,
and phasing in households currently waitlisted. While the 2008 Social Welfare Law has provided legal
authority to SWF to assess the eligibility of its applicants and recertify households with defined
regularity, the technical by-laws which are needed to implement the law are still missing. Equity
objectives demand that the waitlisted households who were new applicants surveyed in 2008 and found to
fall within the A-D categories should be included on the SWF cash transfer roll. Unfortunately, the cost of
including these households has become prohibitive.

120.     Expected results. By the end of 2011, about 100,000 of the better-off households (category E-F
estimated at 272,000) have been graduated from the SWF program. By the end of 2011, at least the
waitlisted household categories A and B have been admitted to the SWF program.

121.    Prior action 9: Approval of the by-laws to the Social Welfare Law, No. 39, of 2009, by a
decision of the Council of Ministers. Such approval provides the necessary Government
commitment to completion of the legal framework of the SWF and the strengthening of its
operation. Following the approval and enactment in 2008 of the law about the Social Welfare Fund Law,
the by-laws were discussed but not approved. This undermined the functioning and effectiveness of the
SWF and the application of the stipulations made in the law, including application of regular due
diligence towards its beneficiaries to ensure that only those in need receive cash assistance. On October
26th, 2010, the Council of Ministers approved the said by-laws for transmission to the President for
signature to gain legal efficacy. This represents a great step forward toward making the SWF an effective
and more efficient institution in the area of social protection in Yemen. Specifically, approval of the by-
laws by the Council of Ministers is a significant sign of commitment in ensuring that there is a legally
relevant definition of household categories in use for the eligibility test and recertification of
beneficiaries.

122.    Expected results. The recertification has been applied to 30 percent of the beneficiaries that
qualified under the economic category and belong to the household poverty category A to D, and to 20
percent of the beneficiaries that qualified under the social category and belong to household poverty
category A to D.

C       Program Features
123.    This proposed DPG is a one-tranche DPG of SDR45 million (US$70 million equivalent). The
grant will be disbursed upon effectiveness of the Financing Agreement.




                                                    40
                            Box 7: Good Practice Principles for Conditionality

 Principle 1: Reinforce ownership
 Unlike previous reform plans, this Development Policy Grant (DPG) was developed through wide
 consultations both within the Government and with civil society, and is therefore fully owned by the Government.
 The policy actions supported by the operation focus on key measures that the Government believes are necessary
 and politically possible.
 Principle 2: Agree up front with the government and other financial partners on a coordinated and accountability
 framework
 The policy matrix attached to this document was carefully discussed and coordinated between the Government,
 the IMF and Bank. The matrix reflects the Government's priorities, progress made in the last year, and lesson
 learned from the IRDPG. Progress will be monitored through bi-annually reviews of the IMF ECF arrangement,
 Bank supervision, and Government monitoring.
 Principle 3: Customize the accountability framework and modalities of Bank support to country circumstances
 The reform program supported by this DPG focuses on strengthening non-hydrocarbon private sector growth, and
 as a result, improving the fiscal position of the Government. However, achieving sustainable private sector
 growth and obtaining fiscal sustainability will require continued support from Yemen's Development Partners
 and continued political commitment on the part of the authorities. The Bank is supporting these efforts, including
 through a public financial management reform project.
 Principle 4: Choose only actions that are critical for achieving results as conditions for disbursement
 This DPG is very selective in line with government priorities. However, the GoY has asked the Bank to maintain
 its focus on four critical areas: (i) support in diversifying the economy, (ii) improving public financial
 management, (iv) protecting the poor, and (iv) contribute to regaining fiscal sustainability. This focus allows the
 Bank's efforts to be more effective and to determine specific conditions that are both critical to the success and
 can be effectively monitored.
 Principle 5: Conduct transparent progress reviews conducive to predictable and performance-based financial
 support
 The Government has committed to providing progress reviews that will be reviewed by the Bank in consultation
 with the IMF. An important component of the DPG II is its support to the on-going PFM reforms that will
 improve the Government's budget process and establish a monitoring framework linked to the budget.




                                VI. OPERATION IMPLEMENTATION

A.      Poverty and Social Impact
124.     The set of prior actions is expected to have a positive impact on the livelihood of the poor.
The thrust of this operation sets out for improving the conditions for private sector investment and
growth, and supports better public financial management and governance. All the suggested measures and
related policies should directly or indirectly help alleviate poverty, either by (i) enhancing non-
hydrocarbon growth, (ii) widening the access to credit or financial services, (iii) through better budget
prioritization and targeted budget allocation, or (iv) helping directly the poor by supporting the SWF
becoming a more efficient institution in the area of social protection and meeting the need of the poor
population. Although the government's policy to reduce the energy subsidies is not subject of this
operation, it sets the stage for this operation



                                                         41
125.     The Household Budget Survey of 2005 and the corresponding Poverty Assessment has been
the key analytical base that helped to understand the poverty implication of the policy choices
underlying the DPG. The 2005 and last household budget survey served as a base for a poverty impact
and incidence analysis of energy subsidy elimination, complemented by the Bank's study on Coping
Strategies in Rural Yemen. Relevant poverty insights were also gained from work done by the
International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) on Food Security and Policy Implication in Yemen.
In addition, the Bank conducted a specific impact analyses for the preparation of this DPG, highlighting
the poverty incidence with regard to the speed of the oil subsidy elimination which is referred to below.

126.     There is a substantive body of research showing that employment growth is the primary
pathway out of poverty, and that the private sector is the major source for sustainable employment
growth. Yemen's economy has depended heavily on oil for exports and public revenues in recent years,
but this dependence cannot be sustained. Furthermore, it has not generated sufficient employment for a
growing and youthful population. Only by creating conditions for private investment in the non-oil
economy can Yemen's economy diversity and generate jobs. This will require addressing a number of
leading constraints, ranging from governance challenges to unreliable infrastructure. Rationalizing the
incentive framework for investment; creating a framework for privately-developed Special Economic
Zones (SEZs) to address, in limited areas a constellation of investment climate challenges; and
streamlining regulations each contribute importantly to creating conditions for sustainable private-led
growth.

127.    While Yemen's reserves of natural resources are declining, the Government is working on
better prioritization of its spending through improving budget execution and accountability. As
mentioned the government, while engaged in a public expenditure consolidation program, is protecting
public expenditure. Moreover, improving procurement, cash management and control and accounting
systems will reduce waste, theft and corruption adding to the Government's ability to deliver services to
the population. Improved effectiveness of public expenditures in line with the new Development Plan for
Poverty Reduction, and improved management and transparency will help that more public resources get
to benefit the people.

128.     Yemen plans not only to spend a significant portion of its budget on social protection but to
improve its impact and effectiveness. The targeting and coverage of the Social Welfare Fund's (SWF)
cash-based safety net needs to become more effective in reaching poor Yemenis households. The
rationalization of the SWF and the enhancement of its safety net offer are essential both, fiscally and in
order to protect the poor and vulnerable from a wide array of shocks.

B.      Consultations
129.    In line with OP 8.60, the Bank advised the Yemeni authorities on the need to undertake
consultations on the reform program with the various stakeholders. The Bank has highlighted to the
Yemeni authorities the importance of the consultations with civil societies, affected communities and
vulnerable groups, and of the participatory process, which are key to a sustainable reform process, and to
enhancing the program's development outcomes. The Government has conducted many consultations
with key stakeholders of the reform program underlying this DPG, and intends to continue such
consultation as the new 5 year Development Plan emerges and underlying medium term reform program.

130.    The new investment law saw substantial consultations after the Ministries of Finance,
Tourism, Transport, the Customs Authority, and the Chamber of Commerce, attended a workshop
on the law held in 2009. The draft law, prepared solely by GIA and the Foreign Investment Advisory
Service (FIAS), benefited from strong and broad stakeholders input, especially from the private sector.
Consultation outcomes include the creation of private sector committees, the launch of a nation-wide

                                                   42
consultation process from March 2010 onwards, with representatives of the private sector and Parliament.
After incorporating substantial changes to the draft law, and broad deliberations, the Parliament adopted
the law on August 1st, 2010.

131.    Several consultations were held since 2007 on the question how best to simplify business
entry procedures. The General Investment Authority (GIA), MOIT and the Tax Authority held a first
awareness raising workshops in 2007, on the obstacles for business entry, attended by the private sector.
The outcome was a broad agreement to work on the removal of such obstacles. For building permit
reforms, five workshops were held by GIA and MOIT for government and private sector representatives ­
two in 2009, and three in 2010 ­ to discuss a new system for the issuing of construction permits. Drawing
on international best practice and stakeholder recommendations, the July 2010 workshop led to the reform
of the current system, while the March, April and May 2010 training workshops showed engineers and
technicians in 11 districts of Sana'a municipality on how to issue permits. A business women and
Businesses Registration workshop was held in May 2010, attended by formally and informally operating
business women to overcome obstacles to business registration with the outcome that inclusion of
informal businesswomen into the formal economy was facilitated and business registration was simplified
for those already operating in the formal economy.

132.     The Central Bank of Yemen (CBY) consulted widely with stakeholders and actors in the
private banking sector about the design and operational details of the credit registry. Following the
initiating workshop for the credit registry in February 2009, organized jointly by the IFC and the CBY,
and attended by the Ministries of Justice, Planning, and Finance, donors, banks, private firms, including
the Yemen businessmen club and the Federation of Chamber of Commerce. A close dialogue with
stakeholders was developed. This led to the set up of the credit registry since mid 2009 in a series of CBY
circulars, with each step well coordinated with the views of stakeholders.

133.    Similarly, the finalization of the Microfinance Banking by-laws are a result of a broad
consultation process with the parties interested in and concerned by microfinance, including the
banking sector, SFD, some microfinance offering NGOs, and the government. A workshop in
November 2009 on expanding access to finance was attended by representatives of the Ministry of
Finance, General Authority for Land, Survey and Urban Planning (GALSUP), banks, Shibam Holding,
and others. This workshop has been key in also consolidating ideas for the Microfinance Banking by-
laws. Consultations on the PFM reform agenda included two consultative meetings in December 2009,
which were organized by the Supreme National Authority for Combating Corruption (SNACC) and
supported by the Bank to discuss the results of the national household survey on corruption and consult
on establishing a legal CSOs coalition to fight corruption. Participants included representatives of
government, civil society, Parliament and academia. A key recommendation was the need to improve the
demand for good governance by establishing a civil society coalition that focuses on anti-corruption and
service delivery improvements. Consultation outcomes include the launch of the CSO Coalition against
Corruption in January 2010, and of the National Strategy against Corruption.

134.    A workshop on MTEF guidelines and sector issues was held by the Budget Department and
the public financial management project, supported by UNDP, in April 2009. The outcome of the
seminar informed the elaboration of the first MTEF in Yemen. Further consultations were held thereafter
to improve the MTEF process.

135.    The Ministry of Finance consulted with several line ministries and agencies as part of the
preparation of the planned Public Financial Management Project. This was in the form of bilateral
meetings from February 2010 onwards, with the outcome of designing the PFM project. This also
included a July 2010 workshop, organized by MoF, on the Commitment Control System and attended by
lines ministries and agencies. The workshop helped to finalize the related government wide action plan,

                                                    43
and to define the implementation time frame, including the sequencing for the respective roll-out of the
reforms.

136.     Consultations regarding the reform in the area of social safety net efficiency and equity
began in October and December 2009, when the Social Welfare Fund held two consultative
meetings on its Institutional Support Project, jointly with the World Bank. The meetings were
attended by over 65 representatives of civil society organizations, academia, Parliament, the media, and
some donor organizations. The meetings consulted on the project, informed CSOs of the SWF mandate
and approach to social protection, and on the Bank's support to Government on improving its social
safety net. Outcomes include the launch of the Institutional Support Project in May 2010 and the
identification of the two DPG actions in the area of social protection.

137.    In July 2010, the SWF and SFD held a workshop with NGOs to introduce the final
Emergency Project to representatives of the Ministries of Planning, Finance, Health and Education,
members of Parliament, the media and the donor community. Outcomes are the further consolidation
of the NGO Network (following its creation in April 2010), the implementation of the Emergency Project,
where about 30 percent of NGOs are envisaged to assist with project implementation, and a further
firming up of the two DPG triggers in this policy areas.

138.     Consultations with the donor community on the DPG-supported policies were conducted in
accordance with donor interest in respective policy areas. The meetings reached out to representatives
from the United States, Japan, France, Germany, Italy, United Kingdom, The Netherlands, United
Nations, and European Commission. Overall, there was general support for budget support to Yemen
through the proposed DPG. The donors stressed the need for improving the fiduciary environment in
Yemen and own budget constraints for not being able to join in budget support. They welcomed the
proposed prior-action reforms of the DPG, particularly in the area of public finance management (PFM),
private sector, and social protection.

C.      Environmental Aspects
139.     This operation is a development policy grant in support of a program of reforms for which
the environmental requirements of OP/BP8.60 apply. The proposed DPG is not expected to have
significant effects on the country's environment, forests and other natural resources. The environmental
and natural resource implications are driven to a large extent by the nature of an operation. In the
proposed operation, none of the prior actions as listed in the policy matrix is expected to have
environmental impacts or risks. None of the Bank's safeguard policies are triggered by the proposed
DPG.

D.      Implementation, Monitoring and Evaluation
140.    The responsibility for implementing and monitoring this program rests with the Ministry of
Plan and International Coorpation (MoPIC). The MoPIC is responsible for the implementation of the
DPG as well as for coordinating the actions among the concerned institutions (including Ministry of
Finance, Central Bank of Yemen, and the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs). Together with the
MoPIC, these institutions will collect the necessary data for the identified monitoring indicators (Annex
2). To ensure appropriate coordination accross the concerned Ministries and implementation status
reporting by MoPIC on a bi-annual basis (2 reports, one in July 2011, a 2nd in January 2012) a steering
committee is formed for the implementation period of this DPG (up to end 2011). The committee will
draw on the national M&E system and its reporting.

141.    MoPIC and the Bank are looking forward to the lessons learned from this operation to

                                                   44
inform future operations of this nature. The monitoring of the program supported by the DPG and its
evaluation will serve to inform preparation of similar or other Bank operations as well the mid-term
review of the Bank's assistance strategy for Yemen.

E.      Fiduciary Aspects
142.     The Bank has reviewed the fiduciary arrangements in the context of the preparation of this
grant proposal. As reported and outlined in the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) of 2009, poor
governance remains a critical issue faced in Yemen. Following the PEFA (Public Expenditure and
Financial Accountability) assessment of 2008 and earlier reports (PER, CFAA and CPAR), there are
several shortcomings as well as strengths in the country's public expenditure management: (i) budget
credibility, comprehensiveness and transparency; (ii) budget formulation and execution; (iii) accounting
and financial reporting; and (iv) internal and external oversight (audit). The budget formulation and
execution is based on administrative, economic and functional classification using GFS/COFOG
standards that can produce consistent documentation according to those standards. There is no cash
planning based on revenue forecasts and no in-year adjustment of expenditure based on actual revenue
receipts. There is thus no link between patterns of revenue and expenditure. There is absence of a modern
accounting framework. The cash-based accounting system does not meet the international standards.
There are no controls over commitments and no systematic way of monitoring stock of arrears, which are
reportedly very high. There is a lack of coherent reporting of budgetary transactions and also a lack of
modern treasury functions. Lastly, accountability is reduced by the limited coverage of internal audits
external oversight by the Central Organization for Control and Auditing (COCA) and the Parliament.

143.      The Yemen authorities are working on strengthening the PFM system to address the
governance weaknesses in public financial management. The Finance Law 1990 (amended 1999)
provides the basis for the establishment of rules and regulations to govern the public financial
management in the country including payments and withdrawals from the consolidated fund, the
management of contingencies and also the administration of Government accounts and loans. It stipulates
that all revenues must be deposited into the Central Bank. It lays down financial management procedures
covering the budget process, cash and debt management, accounting, reporting, internal controls and the
audit and legislative oversight to be exercised over these functions. The Yemen Budget Implementation
Guidelines governs budget classification and the control of virement across budget sub chapters, items or
sub items. It addresses the rate at which budget releases shall be made for personnel emoluments as well
as other recurrent costs. Each administrative unit shall have its own accounting unit, which shall be
responsible for executing all financial and accounting operations, and, preparing the monthly, periodical,
and final account statements. The weaknesses of the system are noted in many aspects of public sector
financial management. These range from the budgeting processes to the Treasury and flow of funds,
accounting, reporting, internal controls and auditing processes. Fiduciary risks at each of these areas are
considered significant. However, the authorities are addressing the weaknesses, including through a PFM
reform project supported by the Bank.

144.     The Government has made efforts over the past few years to address problems in budget
management, such as the introduction of GFS-based economic classification in 2001 and functional
classifications in 2009. The budget formulation and execution is based on administrative, economic and
functional classification using GFS/COFOG standards that can produce consistent documentation
according to those standards. The budget still lacks credibility. The poor matching of aggregate
expenditure out-turn figures to the budget estimates reflect a lack of strict fiscal discipline exercised in
budget execution. The lack of predictability in budget releases; the weak cash management in spite of
many requisite elements for sound cash management being present; the non uniformly implemented
commitment controls; the less than fully effective salary expenditure controls; and the non-achievement
of value-for-money in procurement; the practice of ex-post approval of the supplementary budget by

                                                    45
parliament; along with the accumulation of arrears without proper and complete tracking upon which to
base their effective management and reduction all contribute to undermining the PFM capacity for
achieving aggregate fiscal discipline, and consequently improving the credibility of the budget. Yemen
has evolved a fairly comprehensive budgetary process with budget documentation amounting to 38
separate volumes presented to parliament. There are certain extra-budgetary operations emanating out of
internally generated funds held in special accounts by some of the Line Ministries which constitute 12
percent of the total expenditure. While the majority of donor funds operate under a mechanism which
includes the deposit of funds in the CBY, there are a number of major Donors who do not adhere to this
arrangement. The issue of extra budgetary funds is being addressed through a PFM reform project
supported by the Bank, contingent liabilities and other quasi-fiscal activities.

145.   Various initiatives to reform the PFM system, increase transparency and accountability are
underway though encountering difficulties. As noted earlier, the Government is aware of the above
weaknesses and the risks entailed. The authorities have been working with various donor partners to
make progress in these areas and address the deficiencies. Key PFM initiatives include:

   The reform of taxation with the implementation of the self assessment basis.

   The adoption of ASYCUDA ++ for customs processing and the move to ASYCUDA World being
   supported by USAID.

   The adoption of the GFS/COFOG budget classification standard which includes functional
   budget classification in the 2009 budget submission.

   Promulgation of Law No. 23 of 2007 - A new reform oriented procurement law, promulgated in July
   2007, is considered best practice for countries in the Middle East and North Africa region.

   Promulgation of New Executive Regulations or By-laws ­ Approved most recently by Cabinet
   Decree in February 2009.

   Establishment of High Authority for Tender Control­ Legally established as a new policy and
   monitoring oversight Board nominated by the Shoora Council, and appointed by the President of the
   Republic, was set up for the very first time in Yemen as well as the region.

   Restructuring of the former High Tender Board - Under Law No. 23, the High Tender Board was
   restructured legally separating its mandate to be the apex and autonomous agency responsible for
   decision making on Government financed contracts and devolving the policy oversight function to
   High Authority on Tender Control as the regulator for Yemen's public procurement system.

   The cleaning up of the personnel rolls and the introduction of a biometric identification system
   under the Civil Service Modernization Project managed by the Civil Service Ministry and supported
   by the World Bank.

   The testing and piloting of an Accounting-based Financial Management Information system
   (AFMIS) in four ministries, namely the Ministries of Finance, Education, Health and Public Works.

   Preparation of the Medium Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF) 2010-2012 for a 3 years
   budget includes a detailed budget for 2010 and estimates for the years 2011-2012.




                                                  46
     A Survey of Extra Budgetary Funds completed and the funds to be transferred to the Budget in the
     first phase identified.

     A Technical Design of Commitment Control System prepared.

     The Government published the 2008 Budget on the Ministry's of Finance website for public
     dissemination after Parliament's approval. In 2009, however, the Government published its budget
     in Ministry of Finance's website at the time of submission to the Parliament to allow civil society,
     academia and citizens to participate in the budget discussions through their representatives in the
     Parliament. This practice has continued in 2010 as well.

146.     These reforms represent work in progress, requiring long-term efforts to yield the expected
results and eventually lessen the level of fiduciary risks associated with the use of public funds.
Some of the reforms are more advanced than others. Some have experienced difficulties in earlier periods,
such as the AFMIS. Such a situation calls for a continuous dialogue between donors and the authorities
and a renewed commitment on the part of the Government. This was the case during the discussions of
this operation between the Government and the Bank, with participation of IMF team. The agreed prior
actions in the policy matrix translate such a commitment. With regard to advancing the reforms in the
PFM area, a prior action has been discussed and agreed to further the implementation of AFMIS. The
prior action aims at getting the AFMIS process started in 2010 in key Ministries.

147.     Going forward, the external auditing through the Central Organization for Control and
Auditing (COCA) needs to be strengthened. Efforts are needed to provide COCA with the
Government's final accounts in a timely manner to allow COCA sufficient time to conduct quality audits
and issue the reporting on the audits of the Government accounts in a timely manner. While COCA has to
submit its audit to the Parliament within 9 months from year-end, the Government tends to submit the
final accounts to COCA by end August, early September, leaving COCA little time to review and prepare
its audit report to Parliament by September 30, 2010.25 Despite these shortcomings, audits up to 2008
have been submitted on time. Progress on the Automated Financial Management Information System
(AFMIS) is important to ensure timely reporting and transparency of public accounts. These and other
areas impacting the control mechanism will need to be followed up as part of the continuing dialogue
between the Bank and the Yemeni Government for which the Bank supported Public Financial
Management project provides an umbrella.

148.     The IMF has undertaken the latest safeguard assessment of the Central Bank of Yemen
(CBY) in 2001. The assessment confirmed the existence of critical weaknesses. The main problems
identified concerned foreign exchange management, the quality of the internal control, the audit
environment and a lack of independence of the CBY. The authorities have committed to implementing
the 2001 safeguards recommendations. In this respect, the recent approval of an ECF supported program
with Yemen will lead to a new safeguard assessment prior to the first review of the program, expected for
February 2011. However, the Bank mitigates this risk, including by disbursing the grant proceeds into a
designated account to ensure exclusive use for the intended operation, and by requiring the designated
account to be audited. In addition, the Bank reviewed the CBY's audited financial statements for the last
two years noting unqualified audit reports.

149.    The fiduciary risks for this DPG are high. The Bank, however, will require the opening of a
designated account in US Dollars for the proceeds of the Grant at CBY and the requirement of the audit

25
   The requirement under the law would submission of the final accounts to COCA by end of June. While the
application of AFMIS would be significant to meet the legal reporting requirements, it is likely that the reporting by
the local authorities, which is needed to close the accounts, remains delayed without coverage through AFMIS.

                                                         47
of the designated account according to Terms of Reference and auditors acceptable to the Bank to ensure
that the funds are adequately included in the budget financial records (see also paragraph 152, below, for
details on the audit).

F.      Disbursements and Auditing
150.     The proposed grant follows the Bank's disbursement procedures for development policy
grants. The untied finances will be disbursed against satisfactory implementation of the development
policy program and not tied to any specific purchases. Once the Grant is approved by the Board and
becomes effective, the proceeds of the grant will be deposited in one tranche by IDA into a deposit
account at the Central Bank of Yemen at the request of the Recipient. The Recipient shall ensure that
upon the deposit of the Grant into said account, an equivalent amount is credited in the Recipient's
budget, in a manner acceptable to the Bank. The Recipient will report to the Bank the amounts deposited
in the foreign currency account and credited to the budget no later than 30 days after the deposit of the
grant proceeds was made by the Bank to the CBY deposit account. If the proceeds of the Grant are used
for ineligible purposes as defined in the Financing Agreement, IDA will require the Recipient, upon
notice from IDA, to promptly refund an amount equal to the amount of said payment by IDA. Amounts
refunded to the Bank upon such request shall be cancelled. The administration of this Grant will be the
responsibility of the Ministry of Planning and International Cooperation.

151.    Flow of Funds. The proceeds of the grant will flow from IDA into an US Dollar Deposit
Account to be opened by the Recipient at the CBY, which will be used solely for the grant proceeds. The
CBY, acting on the Recipient's instructions, will then credit an equivalent amount, in Yemeni Riyals, to
the Government's general budget account at the CBY. The Recipient will furnish to the Bank a
confirmation of this transfer not later than 30 days after the receipt date: advising that the total sum of the
grant has been received. The total amount of time between disbursement by the World Bank of the grant
proceeds in US Dollars, and the credit into the Government's general budget account in Yemeni Riyals
should not exceed 15 days.

152.    Audit of the Grant proceeds. In view of the fiduciary risks associated with this operation, and in
order to mitigate such risks including the risks of the control environment surrounding the use of foreign
exchange, the Government will appoint an independent auditor, acceptable to the Bank to conduct a
special purpose audit of the Deposit Account opened at the CBY for the grant proceeds. The terms of
reference should include the validation of the accuracy of the transactions of the Deposit Account,
accuracy of exchange rate conversions; confirmation that the designated account was used exclusively for
the purposes of the operation. Also the auditor will have to obtain confirmation from corresponding
bank(s), involved in the funds flow, regarding the transaction. The auditor's report should be submitted to


                                                      48
the Bank no later than 4 months after the Association requests it.


G.      Value-Added and Benefits
153.    The value-added of the proposed DPG vis-à-vis existing operations being implemented in Yemen
include: (i) bringing together different strands of Bank assistance under a consolidated, coherent reform
package; (ii) proposing prior actions not directly addressed in previous or on-going operations, such as the
strengthening of the linkages between Yemen's Development Plan for Poverty Reduction Strategy and
the Government budget as well as the rationalization of the cash transfer system administered by the
Social Welfare Fund (SWF); and (iii) accelerating the policy decisions on a number of reform areas,
thereby energizing the reform agenda and providing synergies with the implementation of the investment
project portfolio.

154.    In addition, the proposed program includes the following main benefits:

            Providing urgent financial resources. The first benefit would be the provision of urgent
            resources at a time of need. It is also an important operation for the Bank's partnership with
            the Government, to support Yemen at as time of need, while providing a window of
            opportunity for a longer-term engagement.

            Strengthening institutional capacity and governance. The DPG supports a significant
            strengthening of policy planning and public resource management. It supports the
            implementation of reforms leading to a stronger institutional capacity in Government and a
            more efficient allocation of fiscal resources. By raising fiduciary standards, it reduces the
            implementation risk of other projects.

            Supporting the environment for private sector development. The DPG, in conjunction with
            the IMF ECF arrangement, reinforces and steps up the improvements in the currently weak
            investment climate, which is necessary for building up the private sector and diversification
            from the oil industry.

            Paving the way for a possible medium and longer term engagement on key policy reforms.
            The Bank as well as the rest of the international community, has largely focused on assistance
            through projects. This operation offers to move toward a policy dialogue on key reform steps
            to be taken over the e medium- and long-term.

            Signaling to other donors. The Bank's support to the Government in the form of this DPG
            complements the IMF ECF arrangement, and serves a possible catalyst for other development
            partners of Yemen to accelerate their support. The DPG and the IMF ECF are mutually
            reinforcing, reflecting complementarily of assistance, and the operation as a whole as well as
            each of its pillars supports harmonization of donor assistance by the Government to improve
            overall aid effectiveness.

H.      Risks and Risk Mitigation
155.    This DPG program, its impact and sustainability are subject to significant country
(security, political and macroeconomic) and fiduciary risks. General risks affecting the Bank's
program in Yemen would also impact the operation. They include:

156.    Political risks. A deteriorating political environment in Yemen could affect the impact of the

                                                    49
DPG program.26 While the Government is committed to an ambitious reform program at this time, the
sustainability of the program could be challenging in an electoral year, when oil prices have started to
rise. Given these political uncertainties, the operation has been designed as a single tranche DPG with the
option to offer a programmatic series to the new administration. To further enhance sustainability, this
DPG is underpinned by a reform agenda already adopted by the current Government and under
implementation with support through ongoing technical assistance programs by the Bank, IMF and other
donors. The program has also been designed to be realistic, yet consists of important reforms and
milestones, complementing existing Government reforms supported by ongoing TA activities, each with
their own risk mitigation measures, and opening the door for the Bank to engage with the Government in
the medium to long term on critical issues to improve Yemen's fiscal sustainability. The programmatic-
type approach that underlines the design of this DPG will also help mitigate the risk of relevance and
ownership across Governments. Special attention is being provided to socially important areas such as the
reform of the social assistance programs.

157.     Risk of underperforming investment response. Even if Yemen brings its security situation
under control, and even if fundamental reforms advance, investor perceptions may only change with a lag.
In this case, PSD reforms might bring little private investment response. To some extent, building the
strategic capacity of the General Investment Authority with its new focus on image building and strategic
targeting of investors may help to mitigate this perceptual lag.

158.     Oil revenue volatility risks. Yemen has been subject to significant changes in its oil revenues,
reflecting its dependence on crude oil exports. This makes it challenging to conduct fiscal policy with a
medium-term orientation, while maintaining adequate levels of public spending. The emphasis of the
program on medium term public expenditure programming will help to dampen strong pro-cyclical
expenditure policies like it was the case during the 2000s, as oil revenues increased. The emphasis on
transparent targeted of social assistance and reduction of sources of corruption through the elimination of
energy subsidies should also help to strengthen the case for counter-cyclical fiscal policy.

159.    Security risks. The main security risk would be a reversal of the recently negotiated truce and
dialogue with rebels in the north and a widening of the political unrest in parts of southern governorates
as well as a widening of the activities of Al-Qaeda in Arabian Peninsula (AQAP). The capacity of the
Yemeni Government to support security will be a determinant of the extent that such risks persist. This
DPG helps mitigate this risk by contributing financial resources as part of an international effort that
includes substantial IMF resources, to help the Government maintain its recurrent and investment
spending while still providing essential services to the population in a fragile and volatile environment,
which may help to mitigate some domestic security risks. In addition to financial supports, this DPG
supports a strategic vision for Yemen continuing its economic and institutional transition from an oil
producing country to a non-oil producing one, and thereby reduce destabilizing factors and foster a more
secure environment.

160.     Fiduciary Risks. As indicated in the section on fiduciary assessment, financial controls in
Yemen are weak and the operation's fiduciary risk is high. Weaknesses in Yemen's institutional
environment increase the exposure of the Bank's resources to fiduciary problems. The fiduciary risks in
this operation are high. However, the Bank is supporting the Yemeni Government in strengthening its
public financial management system through a comprehensive PFM Reform Project, which is expected to
strengthen the Government's fiduciary environment for budget support by supporting improved
allocation, execution, transparency and accountability in the mobilization and use of all public resources.
The Bank will support strengthening the Supreme Audit Institution's (SAI) independence and building its
capacity in auditing Government Accounts. And ensuring accountability and transparency in using public

     The CAS adopted an adaptive approach to political and security issue to deal with these risks.

funds as key elements of fiduciary risk mitigation.

161.    Technical Capacity Risks. The limited technical capability of the civil service to implement the
reform program presents another source of risk. Recent reforms and the companion technical assistance
projects in each of the three pillars of the DPG are designed to help build the requisite capacity.

162.     While this operation is risky, the risks of not providing this support would be even greater.
For Yemen's Government and economic stability it is important to have external support for crucial
reforms and maintain public expenditure for service delivery at a time of political fragility and economic
transition. It is also an important operation for the Bank to remain a partner in Yemen at this time of
need, while providing a window of opportunity for a longer term engagement in Yemen.

                             INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

         Republic of Yemen--Staff Assessment Letter for the World Bank
                               October 15, 2010

This note provides the IMF staff's assessment of recent macroeconomic developments and challenges
facing Yemen and updates the information in the Press Release of August 2, 2010.

Key Challenges and Policy Priorities

Yemen is confronted with a range of difficulties related to its heavy dependence on declining oil
revenues, widespread poverty, water shortages, and threats to security. The global financial crisis has
aggravated these problems, through a reduction in world oil prices in 2008/2009, resulting in mounting
fiscal and external imbalances. The challenge will be to move from an oil to a non-oil economy. In
addition, structural reforms will need to be advanced to maintain macroeconomic stability through private
sector led growth and alleviate poverty.

Fiscal sustainability over the medium-term, while preserving capital and social expenditures, will
be crucial in order to promote pro-poor growth. The authorities introduced a number of measures
in 2010, in the context of a program supported by the IMF, including full implementation of GST,
elimination of the most of the tax and custom exemptions through a set of new laws, gradual reduction in
fuel subsidies, and containment of non-essential current expenditures. The authorities recognize that the
fiscal adjustment started in 2010 will need to continue in the medium-term through further reducing the
fuel subsidies, increasing tax revenues by improvement in tax administration, containing non-essential
expenditures, and improving public financial management. However, increasing much needed social
transfers after fuel price increases and capital expenditures to maintain infrastructure will require external
budgetary support through grants and concessional loans.

On the monetary front, it will be important to control inflation while ensuring sufficient credit to
private sector and orderly adjustment of rial. Monetary policy was tightened in 2010 to control
inflation and smooth exchange rate fluctuations. This was achieved through increase in benchmark
deposit rate, limit on government overdraft, and strict implementation of prudential regulations of
banking sector. Issuance of Sukuk, expected before end-year, will provide an additional monetary policy
instrument to the CBY and enable better control of liquidity. It is necessary that the CBY maintains the
exchange rate flexibility in order to boost confidence in rial and safeguard foreign exchange reserves.

Recent Economic Developments and Outlook

After registering record high fiscal and external imbalances in 2009, the economic policy
performance in the first half of the 2010 was generally favorable. Economic growth is on track to
meet the 8 percent target for 2010, mainly due to robust hydrocarbon sector growth. Real hydrocarbon
GDP is expected to grow by about 50 percent due to the start of LNG production, while non-hydrocarbon
growth is expected to be around 4½ percent. Twelve month inflation registered 12 percent in August, and

                                                     70
is expected to hover around that rate through the end of the year. Inflation is mainly driven by fuel price
increases and exchange rate depreciation in the first seven months of 2010.

The budget deficit for the first six months is about 0.8 percent lower than the program target--total
revenues are lower by 1.0 percent of GDP while expenditures are lower by 1.8 percent. Tax revenue
collection is in line with program, but other nontax revenues are lower. On the expenditure side, most of
the adjustment has been in the capital outlays, partly due to lower-than-expected foreign grants. Capital
expenditures are likely to increase, as some projects are back-loaded and expected to be financed by
domestic Sukuk issue. Financing conditions continue to be difficult due to slow recovery of domestic T-
bill market.

The rial has stabilized after a continuous depreciation during the first seven months of 2010. After
depreciating by 16 percent against the dollar in the first seven months, rial appreciated about 10 percent in
August. The recent appreciation seems to be associated with a tightening of monetary and fiscal policies,
and stiffer enforcement of foreign exchange regulations. Foreign exchange reserves increased by US$ 200
million during the corresponding period to US$ 4.4 billion at end August 2010.

Financial sector soundness indicators suggest that risks are contained. This reflects the risk aversion
of Yemeni banks, who mostly invest in government securities. Non-performing loans have been on a
declining trend and are at 14 percent of total loans and provisioning are at 70 percent of problem loans at
end-June.

Going forward, the challenge will be to continue implementing difficult reforms under fragile
security and social situation. However, it seems that authorities are committed to move forward the
reforms in the areas of revenue collection and reprioritizing expenditures to meet the social and
infrastructure needs.

Status of IMF-Yemen Relations

A three-year Fund- supported Extended Credit Facility Arrangement (ECF) in the amount of SDR 243.5
million (about US$ 369.8 million) was approved by the IMF Board on July 30, 2010. Progress on the
implementation of important structural measures and other developments is encouraging. The first review
under the ECF is scheduled for March 2011.

This joint Bank-Fund debt sustainability analysis for low-income countries (LIC DSA) finds that
Yemen remains at high risk of debt distress. Although debt ratios are currently below most of the
indicative policy-dependent thresholds, dwindling oil production presents significant risks over the
medium and long term. Even assuming the authorities implement comprehensive macroeconomic and
structural reforms, the present value (PV) of debt-to-exports threshold is breached over the long
term. Standard DSA stress tests indicate that debt sustainability is also vulnerable to a range of
potential adverse shocks--including lower export growth, less favorable financing terms, and weaker
fiscal performance. The high risk of debt distress underscores the importance of implementing
measures to improve the debt outlook in the medium and long term, as well as the need for continued
external assistance on concessional terms.

Introduction

1.    This DSA is based on the debt sustainability framework for low-income countries. Debt
sustainability is assessed in relation to policy-dependent debt burden thresholds. According to the
2006­08 average Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA) index, Yemen is classified as a
weak performer in terms of policies and institutions.27

2.    This DSA updates the 2009 DSA (SM/09/18 Supp. 1; 1/22/09). It incorporates more recent
macroeconomic data including on the liquefied natural gas (LNG) production and export, domestic
oil production, actual 2008 debt data, new SDR allocations in the amount of $281.6 million at end-
August and $36.3 million at end-September 2009, and recent WEO projections of key economic
variables, including international oil and gas prices.

3.    The Yemeni authorities' largely agreed with the staff appraisal of potential risks, but
expressed reservations about the "high risk" assessment given the relatively low current levels of
debt ratios. The staff emphasized the forward-looking nature of the DSA (including the path of debt
indicators over the medium and long term), the recent sharp decline in oil revenues and attendant

27
   The recent three-year backward-looking average was 3.22. For a weak performer, the following indicative
thresholds for external debt sustainability apply: a PV of debt-to-exports ratio of 100 percent, a PV of
debt-to-GDP ratio of 30 percent, a PV of debt-to-revenue ratio of 200 percent, a debt service-to-exports ratio of
15 percent, and a debt service-to-revenue ratio of 25 percent.
                                                      73
deterioration in the fiscal and external accounts, as well as other risks to the macroeconomic outlook.
In addition to the high vulnerability to adverse economic developments highlighted by the stress tests,
the staff also underscored that the baseline macroeconomic framework assumes an ambitious level of
reform and policy adjustment--achievement of which would require a sustained political
commitment and continued external support.

Background

4.     Yemen's public debt dynamics centered around external debt during most of the
country's early history. In 1995 external debt was roughly 184 percent of GDP and external debt
service was equivalent to about 42 percent of export receipts. As part of an adjustment and
stabilization program, Yemen sought to reduce its debt burden through a series of Paris Club
operations and some debt-forgiveness. The authorities have also pursued since that time a careful
policy on contracting of non-concessional debt. Domestic debt (until recently all in the form of
Treasury-bills) has predominantly been used as an instrument for monetary control (a means of
mopping up excess liquidity created through spending of oil revenues), and has been relatively small
as a ratio to GDP.

5.    The nominal stock of public debt increased slightly in 2008 but fell as a share of GDP.
According to data from the Central Bank of Yemen (CBY) and Ministry of Finance (MOF), total net
public debt (domestic and external) decreased from 35.2 percent of GDP in 2007 to 31.4 percent in
2008. The decrease relative to GDP was due mainly to high nominal GDP growth fueled by record oil
prices and a surge in inflation. The 2008 fiscal deficit (3.4 percent of GDP, cash basis) was financed
mainly by domestic sources (2.8 percent of GDP). As a result, net domestic debt increased from 8.3
percent of GDP in 2007 to 9.5 percent of GDP in 2008. The non-bank sector (predominantly public
pension funds) accounted for the lion's share of new domestic financing. On the external side, the
current account deficit improved in 2008 to 4.1 percent, compared to 7.0 percent in 2007, reflecting
an increase in hydrocarbon export receipts fueled by record high oil prices. In nominal terms, external
debt rose slightly from $5.8 billion to $5.9 billion, but declined from 26.9 percent of GDP to
21.9 percent of GDP.

External debt composition

6.    External debt is owed mostly to official creditors and is on concessional terms. Slightly
over half of $6 billion of external debt28 was owed to multilateral creditors ($2.2 billion to the World
Bank, $0.6 billion to the Arab Fund for Social and Economic Development (AFESD), and $64
million outstanding to the IMF). The other half was owed to bilateral creditors, with the largest
creditors being Russia ($1.2 billion), Saudi Arabia ($0.4 billion), and Japan ($0.3 billion). Yemen has
benefitted from a series of rescheduling agreements under the Paris Club in 1996, 1997, and 2001.

7.    Yemen does not have access to international capital markets. Private external debt is
believed to be relatively small compared with public debt and linked mainly to trade finance and
selected projects.29 Official donor support in the form of grants and concessional loans is expected to
continue in the medium and long term. Donors pledged concessional loans of about $2 billion (and
grants of about $3 billion) at the Consultative Group meeting in London in 2006. There have been

28
     Data as of September 2009.
29
     The current external DSA does not incorporate estimates of private debt.
                                                         74
some reported delays in translating these pledges into actual commitments. New loan agreements of
about $70 million were signed in 2008 and for about $100 million in 2009 (as of September).

Domestic debt composition

8.       Domestic debt at the end of 2008 consisted almost entirely of Treasury bills (T-bills),
held by domestic bank and non-bank investors. Non-securitized debt as a share of total domestic
debt increased from 21.1 percent in 2007 to 35.5 percent in 2008. The volume of T-bills outstanding
also increased, reaching 11.1 percent of GDP at the end of 2008. Virtually all domestic debt at end-
2008 was short term--T-bills having a maximum maturity of 1 year. Within the overall stock of T-
bills, the share of 3 month T-bills was significantly higher than the 6 and 12 month maturities. The
weighted interest rate on T-bills was about 14 percent in 2008, but has subsequently declined to about
13 percent as of September 2009, reflecting a central bank decision to lower the benchmark interest
rate from 13 percent to 10 percent during January­May. New issues of T-bills in 2008 were mostly
acquired by non-bank investors, bringing the share of gross domestic debt held by non-bank investors
above 50 percent in 2008.

Macroeconomic Assumptions

9.      The DSA is based on the macroeconomic framework discussed with the authorities
during the 2009 Article IV Consultations (SM/09/xx, 12/xx/09). It assumes a sustained, front-
loaded fiscal adjustment based on expenditure and revenue reforms in response to falling oil
production. Beyond the medium term, it is assumed that the reform process would continue in the
long term to facilitate adjustment to the expected exhaustion of oil reserves (projected to occur around
2021). The debt dynamics under this scenario are subjected to stress tests to assess vulnerability to
less favorable developments in key economic variables, including the consequences of maintaining
current macroeconomic policies (a "non adjustment" scenario).

10.     The macroeconomic framework underlying the DSA assumes that the authorities
respond to falling oil production by reform of public finances and structural adjustment. 30
Specific elements of this reform effort are discussed in Box 1.

11.     In terms of growth prospects, the framework assumes 4.4 percent real GDP growth over the
long term. While generally in line with historical averages, specific elements underlying this
projection include:

        Implementation of the Third Socio-Economic Development Plan for Poverty Reduction
        (DPPR) for acceleration of economic growth. The plan focuses on, among other elements:
        good governance; development of productive and promising sectors (agriculture, fisheries,
        and tourism); water, environment, and basic infrastructure; human development; government
        services; social protection and social security; and women's empowerment.
        Implementation of reforms outlined in National Reform Agenda and the Public Investment
        Program, which focus on the following issues: (i) judicial reform; (ii) administrative reforms



30
   The adjustment scenario is based at policy discussions during the Article IV mission. Measures are
illustrative without precise agreement on the sequencing of reforms.

           and civil service modernization; (iii) investment and business climate; (iv) anticorruption,
           transparency, and accountability; and (iv) political reforms.
Debt Analysis

Public Debt Sustainability

Baseline

12. Even assuming a sustained reform effort, public debt indicators raise concerns about
long-term sustainability. Net public debt at end-2008 stood at 31.4 percent of GDP--about 4
percent lower than its end-2007 level. Nevertheless, this ratio is still relatively large in view of
potential vulnerabilities inherent in the shift to a non-oil economy and the government's low revenue
mobilization capacity31. Despite the slight decrease in 2008, the debt-to-GDP ratio is expected to rise
close to 50 percent level in the long term due to expected decline in oil revenues. The PV of public
debt stood at 27 percent of GDP and 73 percent of revenue (excluding grants) in 2008. These
indicators are expected to increase to 45.5 percent of GDP and over 230 percent of revenue by 2029.

Stress tests and alternative scenarios

13. Standard stress tests highlight Yemen's vulnerability to adverse economic developments,
including weaker fiscal adjustment, lower economic growth, and less favorable financing terms.

           If the primary deficit remained unchanged from the estimated 2009 level (i.e., -6.6 percent of
           GDP), by 2029 the debt-GDP ratio would approach 150 percent, the debt-revenue ratio would
           exceed 735 percent, and the debt service would be equivalent to 271 percent of fiscal revenue
           (against 16 percent in the baseline). This highlights the need to reduce the primary deficit to
           avoid spiraling debt.
           If real GDP grew by 3.1 percent in 2010­11 (below the baseline projections of 7.8 and 3.8
           percent, respectively), the PV of debt-to-GDP ratio would rise to about 72 percent (against 45
           percent in the baseline) and the PV of debt-to-revenue ratio would approach 356 percent by
           2029 (against 225 percent in the baseline). This highlights the sensitivity of the sustainability
           projections to near-term growth rates, which rest heavily on the coming on-stream of the
           Yemen LNG project.
           Permanently lower growth over the entire projection period by 0.25 percentage point of GDP
           would result in debt-to-GDP and debt-to-revenue ratio close to 58 percent and 285 percent,
           respectively, by 2029.
           Under less favorable financing terms (defined as an interest rate on external borrowing some
           2 percentage points higher than the baseline scenario during 2009­29), the PV of debt-to-
           exports and debt-to-revenue would reach 108 and 87 percent, respectively, by 2019;
           An oil price $20 below baseline projections in 2009­14 would have a relatively modest
           impact on debt sustainability indicators, reflecting the decline in domestic oil production and
           the gradual shift to being a net fuel importer.



31
     Non-hydrocarbon revenue was only 8.7 percent of GDP in 2008, of which tax revenue was only 6.8 percent.
                                                      76
                        Box 1. Assumptions for the Macroeconomic Framework

The macroeconomic framework underlying the DSA encompasses a range of policy and structural
reforms to adjust to the expected steady decline of oil production over the medium and long term. As
crude oil production declines and reserves are eventually depleted, government hydrocarbon revenues are
projected to drop from about 75 percent of total revenues and 88 percent of total exports in 2008 to 17 percent
(from LNG exports and domestic gas sales) and to 20 percent of total merchandise exports. GDP growth is
expected to accelerate in 2010 with the start of LNG production and subsequent increase in hydrocarbon sector
growth.

In the medium term (2009-14), annual real GDP growth is projected to average 4.8 percent, reflecting the
consequences of the financial crisis and gradual global recovery. Reforms will center on a significant fiscal
adjustment and reduction of primary deficit from 6.6 percent of GDP in 2009 to 0.9 percent of GDP in 2014.
Key spending reforms include elimination of fuel subsidies, reducing the overall size of the civil service wage
bill, better expenditure management, and increased, but better targeted social spending, to protect the poor from
the adverse effects of removing fuel subsidies. Development spending would gradually increase to create pillars
for stronger non-oil sector. On the revenue side, tax revenues would be enhanced by around 0.5 percentage point
of GDP per year by: implementing fully the General Sales Tax (GST); improving customs and tax
administration; eliminating exemptions in the customs, income tax, and investment laws; and introducing
possibly introduction of excise taxes over the long term. Fiscal consolidation, together with structural reforms to
enhance competitiveness is expected to help narrow the current account deficit and boost the non-oil sector
growth.

The long-term projections are based on the following policy assumptions:

    Moderate real GDP growth, averaging 4.4 percent from 2015 to 2029, with non hydrocarbon growth
    close to 4.8 percent offsetting the decline in oil output. These assumptions are in line with the historical
    experience: the non-oil sector grew at an average rate of 5.2 percent during 1991­2007. Continued non
    hydrocarbon growth will depend on sustained fiscal, financial sector, and structural reforms to improve the
    investment environment, more flexible exchange rate arrangement, and sizeable donor-funded public
    investment.
    Continued non-hydrocarbon revenue mobilization efforts, notably through full implementation of the
    GST and strengthening of tax and customs administration to improve the efficiency of both direct and
    indirect tax collection (GST, customs duties, excises on petroleum products, and income tax).
    Additional expenditure restraint--including a concerted effort to reduce the public wage bill to around
    6 percent of GDP by 2029--would also provide the fiscal space for the social welfare expenditures required
    to smooth the transition to a predominantly non-oil economy.
    Continued flexibility in the Yemeni Riyal would facilitate adjustment in the current account and allow for
    some accumulation of external reserves in outer years to smooth the impact of the end of oil production in
    2021.
    Official creditors are expected to continue to provide external financing on concessional terms. Domestic
    financing, driven by the evolution of the fiscal balance, is projected to be provided from the bank and non-
    bank sector at positive real interest rates.
Under these assumptions, the overall fiscal balance would move sharply into deficit with the loss of oil
revenues (about 6.7 percent of GDP in 2022), but would improve thereafter as reforms take hold. The non-
interest current account deficit would be financed by a combination of FDI, remittances, and external
borrowing.




                                                        77
14. To highlight the critical need for adjustment, debt dynamics were also evaluated under
unchanged policies (a non-adjustment scenario). In the absence of the structural and fiscal reforms
outlined in Box 1, the PV of public debt would exceed 140 percent of GDP and debt service would
absorb slightly more than half of fiscal revenues by 2029.

External Debt Sustainability

Baseline

15. Under the baseline scenario, Yemen's external debt dynamics signal a high risk of debt
distress. Although all indicators remain below their policy-dependent thresholds in the medium term,
the PV of debt-to-exports ratio is projected to breach its threshold substantially over the long term (by
over 30 percentage points annually during 2022­29). While the other indicators remain below their
respective thresholds, the outlook is expected to worsen as debt accumulates and resources to service
it decline due to the loss of oil exports.

Stress tests and alternative scenarios

16. The baseline outcome is highly vulnerable to adverse shocks. The outlook is particularly
vulnerable to deterioration in export performance and less favorable lending terms. Under stress tests,
the PV of debt-to-export ratio breaches the threshold in 2010, while the debt service-to-exports ratios
are projected to exceed their respective thresholds starting in 2022 until the end of the projection
period. If export growth remained one standard deviation below its historical average in 2010­11, the
PV of debt would reach 210 percent of exports and 84 percent of fiscal revenue in 2029, while
external debt service would reach 16 percent of exports. If interest rates on new external borrowing
were 2 percent higher than in the baseline, the PV of debt would approach 190 percent of exports in
2029.

17. Under the non-adjustment scenario, external debt becomes rapidly unsustainable. Even
assuming that financing would continue to be available on favorable terms, all but one of the
thresholds (debt service-to-revenue ratio) are breached. Over the longer term, these ratios exceed their
respective sustainability thresholds by a considerable margin. Under these conditions, little room
would be left to absorb shocks associated with the projected end of oil production.

                                           CONCLUSION
18. The joint Bank-Fund debt sustainability analysis suggests that risk of debt distress in
Yemen remains high. Despite currently low debt ratios, dwindling oil production presents a
significant adjustment to both the fiscal and external account over the medium and long term.
Implementation of a comprehensive macroeconomic adjustment, a set of structural reforms to boost
financial management and growth, and supporting financial flows (remittances, non-hydrocarbon
FDI, and continued donor funding) will be essential to maintaining debt ratios below indicative
thresholds over the long term (with the exception of the PV of debt-to-exports ratio, which breaches
the sustainability threshold even with adjustment). However, given Yemen's relatively low level of
development, significant resource and capacity constraints, the outlook for such a sustained
adjustment effort is subject to numerous risks.



                                                   78
19. Even assuming full implementation of macroeconomic and structural reforms, Yemen's
debt sustainability is also vulnerable to a range of potential adverse shocks, such as lower
export growth and less favorable financing terms. Overall, the findings in this DSA echo the
results reported in the previous year's DSA. The high risk of debt distress underscores the importance
