                         Program Development Objective (from Program Document)

                         The main objective of the proposed DPG is to mitigate the impact of the current fiscal crisis in Yemen, assist the Government in implementing its economic reform
                         program, set the conditions for enhancing growth in the non-hydrocarbon part of the economy, and to mitigate the immediate poverty impact of the current reform
                         program on the poor by creating a more inclusive and more equitable cash transfer.
                         Has the Program Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Program?

                         As the operation was a single tranche development policy operation, with all the program actions completed prior to Board presentation, this ISR will serve as the only ISR for the
                         operation. It briefly records the findings of the Implementation Completion Report (ICR). For full details, please refer to the ICR.

                         The single tranche of SDR 45 million was released in December 2010. As designed, the operation had three principle development objectives (described as pillars in the program
                         document):

                         a.         To foster private sector growth in the non-hydrocarbon part of the economy.
                         b.         To improve key aspects of the public financial management system.
                         c.         To mitigate the impact of the on-going fuel subsidy reduction on the poor by creating a more inclusive and more equitable cash transfer system.

                         These three development objectives were operationalized in four program components:
                         First Component: Private Sector Growth and Employment

                         While there are three development objectives and four project components, components one and two can be viewed as both relating to the first development objective: the fostering
                         of private sector activity in the non-hydrocarbons sector. The first component focused on one area affecting performance in this sector (improvements in the private sector business
                         climate) while the second component focused on another aspect (improvements in the financial system). By contrast, component 3 addresses directly the second development
                         objective (improvements in the public financial management system) and component 4 relates directly to the third development objective (the development of a more inclusive and
                         more equitable cash transfer system). Thus, there is a close alignment among the project components and the development objectives.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         Although some of the actions - particularly those in the area of private sector development and improvements in the financial sector - can best be viewed as first steps in a medium
                         term programmatic reform, no follow on operation was envisioned at the time the operation was approved. The program document did suggest, however, that successful
                         implementation of the program would pave the way for future programmatic support. The Government is currently anxious to have additional budget support from the World Bank, as
                         it seeks to address its current situation.

                         Restructuring History
                         There has been no restructuring to date.

                         Related Operations
                         There are no related projects.
