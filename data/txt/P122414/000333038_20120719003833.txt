1.      Program Context, Development Objectives and Design

Yemen is a poor country (GNI per capita of about $1100) located on the southwestern tip of the
Arabian Peninsula. Yemen has poor social indicators and since 2000 income growth has been
low due to weak governance and on-going civil conflict.

The Development Policy Grant was a single tranche operation, approved by the Bank Board on
December 14, 2010, with the finance released on December 23, 2010. As stated in the Program
Document, the development objectives of the operation were to foster private sector growth in the
non-hydrocarbon part of the economy, to improve key aspects of the public financial management
system, and to mitigate the impact of the ongoing fuel subsidy reduction on the poor by creating a
more inclusive and more equitable cash transfer system.

The operation was prepared during the course of 2010 and effectively complemented an IMF
Extended Credit Facility of (SDR 243.5 million, covering three years) which focused in the short
run on stabilizing the fiscal situation and reducing a major source of fiscal drain, the fuel subsidy
which was equivalent to 27 percent of public expenditures in 2010. Over the medium term, the
program sought to continue the process of fiscal consolidation, and support non-oil sector sources
of growth and revenue. The World Bank operation complemented the IMF operation in two
important respects: it focused on key policy areas central to the program of fiscal consolidation
(improved public financial management and a more efficient cash transfer system), and it
provided significant finance (equivalent to roughly one third the projected external finance in the
IMF program) in support of the program.

As a longer term objective, the operation sought to improve the business climate to encourage
investment in the non-petroleum sector. Prior to 2010, Yemen’s economic performance had
been dominated by the hydrocarbon sector, which accounted for over 10 percent of GDP, and 65
percent of total Government fiscal revenues since 2000, and 90 percent of export revenues.
However, with declining oil production, there was a need to develop new sources of growth and
Government revenue.1

Yemen is classified as a fragile country and conflict in Yemen has national, regional and
international dimensions. Al-Queda is active in the country, having declared it as its basis on the
Arabian Peninsula (AQAP). The Houthi rebellion in the north (Sa’ada) has led to 6 domestic wars
since 2004. In early 2010, the 6th war was concluded with a cease-fire. Furthermore, a separatist
movement was and is active in the south challenging the unification of north and south Yemen in
1990.

With the conclusion of the 6th Houthi rebellion, successful conclusion of a program with the IMF,
the Bank was asked to complement with this development policy grant to help to build building
blocks toward more development inclined fiscal policies, seize the opportunity of relative
political calm to address long standing structural and fiscal problems and obstacles toward non-
hydrocarbon growth, while setting a step towards a more resilient economy.

 Absent new hydrocarbon discoveries and a change in government policies (notably the fuel subsidy),
Yemen was projected to become a net importer of petroleum products by 2015.

1.1      Context at Appraisal

After years of weak economic performance, Yemen’s macroeconomic situation deteriorated
significantly in 2009. Declining oil production, together with lower international oil prices, led to
a sharp decline in fiscal revenues derived from oil, which declined by 12.8 percentage points of
GDP from their level in 2008. This decline in receipts was partly offset by increases in non-oil
receipts (by 1.2 percent of GDP) and expenditure reduction (of 6.0 percentage points of GDP);
however, roughly half of this loss in revenues was absorbed through a widening of the deficit; the
overall fiscal deficit increased by 5.7 percentage points of GDP in 2009 to -10.2 percent of GDP.
Much of this deficit was financed by the Central Bank, with broad money growing at over 10
percent, in spite of a decrease in credit to the private sector and a reduction in external reserves.
This situation continued in 2010 with Government fiscal receipts remaining at around 25 percent
of GDP (down from roughly 37 percent in 2008). While expenditures were reduced further, the
overall fiscal deficit remained relatively high and the Government again had to have recourse to
the Central Bank for financing (with broad money increasing by over 9 percent) and a further
decline in reserves. Consumer price inflation, which in spite of rapid money growth the previous
year, had remained subdued, thanks to favorable external developments, accelerated to over 10
percent in 2010.

This deteriorating macro situation revealed a number of structural weaknesses in the Yemeni
economy, notably the overreliance on the oil sector as a source of government receipts, and the
need to control costs in domestic subsidies, which accounted for over a third of all expenditures
in 2008.2 The vast bulk of these subsides were attributable to the extensive system of petroleum
product subsidies. These subsidies were particularly pernicious as they encouraged domestic
consumption of petroleum products (at a time when domestic petroleum production was
declining) and benefitted primarily the better off.3

Given the structural nature of these macroeconomic imbalances, they could be expected to persist,
absent Government action to improve incentives for the private sector in the non-oil economy and
to reduce the fuel subsidies, which represented a growing drain on Government finances. In
addition, in a situation of tightening fiscal choices, there was a strong need to address deficiencies
in the cash transfer system (notably the Social Welfare Fund) which served also income groups
which were not considered eligible (28 percent) Justice and fiscal consideration recommended a
reform to protect the poor more effectively from the effects of the gradual elimination of the fuel
subsidy, a reform pursued by the government and supported by the IMF arrangement.

Earlier4, the Bank had identified these structural problems (i.e., the need for greater growth in the
non-oil sector and improved targeting of subsidies and cash transfers), and had in place a number
of interventions focused on these weaknesses (e.g., IFC technical assistance to improve the
business climate, IDA’s Institutional Reform Development Policy Grant, IDA’s Public Finance
Modernization project, IDA’s Social Development Fund Phase IV Project and Social Welfare
Fund Institutional Support Project). Hence, the Bank had a well-established dialogue in most of
the reform areas that the Government wished to pursue, facilitating their inclusion in the DPG. In

  This does not include Government transfers (such as payments to the Social Welfare Fund) which
accounted for an additional 9 percent of Government expenditures in 2008.
3
  In 2009, subsides for gasoline, diesel and jet fuel accounted for over 85 percent of the total fuel subsidy
bill. These are products which are consumed primarily by the better off, although the poor may have
benefited to some extent from lower transport costs made possible by the diesel subsidy.

this context, the operation offered the opportunity to leverage policy actions increasing the
effectiveness of the complementary Bank Group activities.5

In addition, the Bank had the capacity to provide (through the operation) additional finance in
support of the Government’s adjustment program. However, to be effective this finance needed
to be linked closely with the IMF medium term program, which focused on fiscal consolidation
and elimination over time of the fuel subsidy. This had important implications for the design of
the operation, which needed to align with the IMF program’s projected external financing
requirements, specifically the need for full disbursement by the end of 2010.

1.2        Original Program Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

As designed, the operation had three principle development objectives (described as pillars in the
program document):

      a.   To foster private sector growth in the non-hydrocarbon part of the economy.
      b.   To improve key aspects of the public financial management system.
      c.   To mitigate the impact of the on-going fuel subsidy reduction on the poor by creating a
           more inclusive and more equitable cash transfer system.

These three development objectives were operationalized in four program components. These are
set out below with the associated outcome indicators (as of end-December 2011):

While there are three development objectives and four project components, components one and
two can be viewed as both relating to the first development objective: the fostering of private
sector activity in the non-hydrocarbons sector. The first component focused on one area affecting
performance in this sector (improvements in the private sector business climate) while the second
component focused on another aspect (improvements in the financial system). By contrast,
component 3 addresses directly the second development objective (improvements in the public
financial management system) and component 4 relates directly to the third development
objective (the development of a more inclusive and more equitable cash transfer system). Thus,
there is a close alignment among the project components and the development objectives.

2.2       Major Factors Affecting Implementation:

Implementation of the operation was severely affected by the social and political unrest that broke
out in Yemen in early 2011, within weeks after approval of the program, and continued through
most of 2011. This unrest, which was inspired by popular uprisings elsewhere in the region (i.e.,
Tunisia and Egypt), sought the removal of the Head of State, who at the time was the longest
serving leader in the Arab world. However, the unrest also reflected long-standing social and
political tensions in the country (e.g., the divide between the North and South, differences among
clans, Sunni/Shia differences, etc.), compounded by the overall fragility in the country.

This unrest profoundly affected implementation of the reform program supported by the operation
in two key respects. First, the unrest effectively paralyzed the country and the government for the
year 2011 during which the impact of the measures taken in the operation was to have occurred.
While the full impact of this unrest is still being evaluated, it is clear that the economy suffered
considerably. Economic activity declined sharply (with GDP growth in 2011 estimated at -10.5
percent vs. +4.1 percent assumed in the program), and budget execution suffered as Government
revenues weakened as non-hydrocarbon receipts fell due to lower economic activity and a
weakening in tax compliance. The Government offset some of the revenue decline by squeezing
expenditures, primarily investment spending, but also had recourse to Central Bank borrowing.6
In addition to the macroeconomic disruption, program implementation also suffered during this
period. Much of the unrest occurred in the capital Sana’a, making day to day work by Yemeni
civil servants difficult, if not impossible. With fuel shortages, moving around the city became
increasingly difficult.

Second, the unrest negatively affected the Bank’s ability to supervise the program. With growing
unrest, the Bank office in Sana’a, including the operation’s TTL was evacuated in March 2011
and missions to Yemen were suspended, making oversight of key components difficult. Hence,
for virtually all of 2011 the World Bank had difficulties to oversee the impact of the program
measures on the development objectives, although so called reverse missions to Amman Jordan,
and to Cairo, Egypt by the sector and the DPG team took place.

Currently, the situation in Yemen has begun to stabilize. Bank missions to Yemen have resumed
in a limited manner since the beginning of 2012. An internationally endorsed transition plan is
being implemented; this plan involves the departure of the President and his replacement with his
Vice President, which occurred at end of February. Organization of legislative and presidential
elections are projected for early 2014, after conducting a national dialogue and implementing
some constitutional reforms. A transition government is in place since early December 2011.
However, the situation remains fragile, as the long standing political and social tensions remain,
and with a weakened central Government authority, militant groups have increased their activity
in the country, especially in the south. Reflecting this, Bank activity in Yemen remains
constrained.

2.3       Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization:

Because of the nature of the operation, one single tranche, the monitoring indicators were
necessarily fairly closely linked to the actions and, thus, not of a particularly high order. This

said, the operation contained 9 indicators to measure successful achievement of the development
outcomes (see Table 1). However, on closer examination, two of the indicators (the first, relating
to the enactment of the investment law, and the seventh, relating to automation of the government
accounts) are better viewed as output indicators, directly tied to the successful completion of the
policy actions.

Hence, for monitoring of program success one can retain from the policy matrix the following
seven indicators. These indicators, which describe results expected as of December, 2011 and
actual performance are set out below:

Given the constraints imposed by its nature (a single tranche program), the seven performance
indicators were reasonable measures of the impact of the measures taken on the development
objectives during the program period (i.e., through 2011). In the private sector growth area, the
objective was to encourage growth in the non-hydrocarbon sector by simplifying business
procedures and the performance indicator measured the actual impact of the action taken on the
ease of undertaking new investments in the three Governorates where this simplification was to
be implemented. In the financial sector, the focus was on increasing the access to and the volume
of private sector financial transactions and the associated policy measures involved
operationalization of the credit registry and enhanced financial activity of the micro-finance
sector. The performance measures associated with this involved the number of loan contracts
covered by the credit registry and the increase in the volume of microfinance activity, both
impacts that are linked closely to the measures taken and which contribute to achievement of the
                                                 11
development outcome. For improved public sector financial management, where the objective
was to improve the effectiveness of the budget, the specific measure focused on implementation
of the Commitment Control system in three key ministries and the indicator of success was
identification of level of arrears and better control over them in these three ministries. In the area
of social protection, the measures focused on improving the targeting of the key instrument in this
regard (the Social Welfare Fund) by removal of relatively well off recipients (and their
replacement with those who were less well off) and the recertification of recipients to ensure that
the most eligible were covered.

In each of these areas, the expected results were quantified and the information was generally
available. In several cases, e.g., on business registration and improvements in public financial
management, this information was routinely collected as part of World Bank group technical
assistance (IFC for the registry of businesses and the World Bank Public Finance Modernization
project).

Thus, the monitoring framework can be considered to have been satisfactory in its design, given
the constraints associated with the nature of a single tranche operation.

However, there were only limited opportunities to actually use this framework for monitoring of
program performance, given the events in Yemen in 2011 and the Bank’s evacuation from the
country and temporary suspension of activities. The situation in 2011 made it difficult for the
Government to carry out much of the implementation and effectively impossible for the Bank to
monitor what was happening on the ground. As a result, for a number of the indicators reliable
information was not available at this time of writing this report, for others it became available
during the first half of 2012 as activities took off again (see Table 3 above), albeit within limits
(see above).


2.4       Expected Next Phase/Follow-up Operation:

While some of the actions, particularly those in the area of private sector development and
improvements in the financial sector, can best be viewed as first steps in a medium term
programmatic reform, no follow on operation was envisioned at the time the operation was
approved. The program document did suggest, however, that successful implementation of the
program would pave the way for future programmatic support.7 The Government is currently
anxious to have additional budget support from the World Bank, as it seeks to address its current
situation.

3.          Assessment of Outcomes
3.1         Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

While the project was not envisioned in the World Bank’s Country Assistance Strategy for the
Period 2010-2013 (Report No.47562-YE, April 29, 2009), it was entirely consistent with the
Bank’s strategy at that time, which focused on helping to:

            (i) Accelerate and diversify economic growth;
            (ii) Enhance governance;
            (iii) Foster human and social development; and
            (iv) Manage natural resource scarcity and natural risks.8

The first and second components contributed directly to the first pillar of the CAS strategy; the
third component related directly to the second pillar and the fourth component was directly linked
to the third pillar.

The three development objectives of the operation clearly remain relevant in the current context.
Indeed, with the events of 2011, these developments objectives are even more salient. However,
given the lack of success of the operation, the program design would need to be rethought in light
of the current circumstances. In particular, the deterioration of the macroeconomic situation in
2011 arguably makes more important and urgent measures linked to stabilizing the fiscal situation
(i.e., components 3 and 4 of the operation).

      3.2       Achievement of Program Development Objectives

The policy measures supported were reasonably well-linked to the expected results, account taken
of the limitations associated with a single tranche operation. However, program implementation
was negatively affected by the civil unrest which commenced shortly after the operation was
approved. This is reflected in the indicator table (Table 3 above), which shows of the seven
performance indicators only three can be considered to have been fully achieved. Two indicators
were definitely not met, one in a way that compromised a key program objective (the reorienting
of the SWF while minimizing its fiscal burden). For the other two, lack of evidence precludes
firm judgments as to performance.

Considering the program more broadly, it becomes clear that the program objectives were not
attained, mainly presumably because of the crisis situation in 2011. The program sought to
promote the development of the non-oil sector. However, available evidence suggests that
domestic investment actually declined during 2011,9 a not unsurprising result given the turmoil.
In such a situation, it seems improbable that investment in the non-oil sector increased. Hence,
Yemen’s dependence on the petroleum sector for growth and government revenues remains
largely unchanged.

The other major objective, to support the Government’s efforts to consolidate its fiscal situation,
was also not achieved as developments in 2011 led to a breakdown in the process of fiscal
restructuring. That the fiscal program was severely off track is evident from the fact that the IMF



8
 Yemen Country Assistance Strategy, p. 20.
9
 IMF data (necessarily preliminary) show that private domestic investment declined from 7 percent of
GDP in 2010 to 3.5 percent of GDP in 2011.

                                                    13
program was suspended.10 As a result, the fiscal consolidation that had underpinned the original
program was overtaken by unprecedented events in Yemen. In this vein, while some progress
was made in 2010 on reducing the fuel subsidy (the Government raised the price of gasoline by
130 percent in August 2010 and the price of diesel by 50 percent in December of that year),
progress in this area effectively stalled in 2011. Supply disruptions resulted in shortages of
refined petroleum products, effectively reducing the amount of the subsidy, but even so fuel
subsidies decreased only slightly in nominal terms and still accounted for roughly 25 percent of
all Government expenditures in 2011.

As a result, achieving the development objectives in the program appear to have been largely
impaired by the 2011 events.

     3.3     Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Unsatisfactory

While the program objectives remain relevant, the failure to achieve the development objectives
dictates an unsatisfactory rating.11 It is reasonable to note, however, that this rating reflects in
large measure the events of 2011, which affected negatively the achievement of the envisioned
development outcomes. These events were external to the operation and were inherently not
predictable.12

In addition, the operation’s focus on reforming the cash transfer system, while unachieved, has
desensitized a politically sensitive topic and provided a platform for renewed reform in this area
once the situation on the ground is more stable.




10
   In addition, the World Bank ended up in canceling the second tranche of a parallel budget support
operation (the Institutional Reform Development Policy Grant). Release of this tranche has been
anticipated in 2011 after numerous delays, but in the end was held up because of the unsettled fiscal
situation.
11
   ICR guidelines indicate that an unsatisfactory rating is dictated when: ―there were major shortcomings in
the operation’s achievement of its objectives, in its efficiency, or in its relevance.‖ ICR Guidelines, p.32.
12
   The program document did identify political risks as being critical, but these risks were described in
terms of political tensions giving rise to weakness in program implementation. This risk was reflected in
the operation’s design (a single tranche) but it was assumed that an effective Government would still be in
place and committed to the reform program throughout the duration of the program, i.e., through 2011.
The eventuality of a social revolution was not factored into the political risks.

       3.4       Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

             The program document did indicate that higher growth attributable to higher levels of
             private sector investment resulting from Components 1 and 2 of the program would
             contribute to the alleviation of poverty.13 In the event, however, the events of 2011,
             particularly the decline in economic activity probably led to a worsening of the poverty
             situation.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

             As designed, the operation would have had an impact on institutional strengthening,
             particularly in the area of financial management and social protection with respect to the
             Social Welfare Fund. The latter was especially strengthened with the adoption of the By-
             law to the Social Welfare law giving the SWF legally sound instruments to improve
             targeting and graduation policies. However, events of 2011 imply that the actual impact
             of the operation in this regard was minimal. Nonetheless the investment authority (GIA)
             was successfully restructured in line with the new investment law, and is now limited to
             an Investment Promotion Agency. Also, the apparent institutionalization of the MTEF
             process has led to some institutional strengthening of budget planning.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative, if any)

             None.

       3.5       Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

While there were no specific consultations undertaken as part of the overall program’s
development, there were separate consultations with stakeholders on specific measures under the
program (e.g., the new investment law, simplification of business procedures, operationalization
of the credit registry, microfinance regulations, MTEF guidelines and implementation of the
Commitment Control System and reform of the SWF). The consultations reassured the Bank
team about the direction of the supported reform. They also helped to clarify the negative
externalities of petroleum subsidies (corruption, disincentives) and their costs to the poor, a topic
which was not directly covered by this operation but which is passionately debated in Yemen for
some time.

In addition, the program document was translated into Arabic and made available in Sana’a,
including on the Bank’s web-page

4.              Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

      Rating: High

While an internationally endorsed transition plan is being implemented, the political situation
remains extremely fragile in Yemen. Government control remains tenuous in parts of the country
and armed conflict has not fully ended. In addition, tensions within the Government remain high
and the ability of the Government to implement policy consistently even in areas that it controls
remains uncertain. As a result, a further outbreak of unrest cannot be excluded and the
Government’s capacity to implement meaningful reforms remains weak.


5.       Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
5.1      Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

       Rating: Moderately satisfactory

This rating reflects the balance of positive and negative elements in the preparation and design of
the operation. On the positive side, the operation was successfully put together under a very tight
deadline in order to be aligned with the IMF program. This necessitated sustained work by the
preparation team on a very short deadline. In addition, the choice of a single tranche
development policy operation was appropriate in this context. The Government was launching an
ambitious reform program, designed to address long-standing structural weaknesses and requiring
some key policy actions (e.g., elimination of the fuel subsidy and improvements in the cash
transfer system). The scope and extent of the Government’s program merited World Bank
support and it is not evident how this support could be achieved through stand-alone investment
projects in the key areas. In particular, the close linkage of the operation with the IMF program
arguably increased the effectiveness of both. However, known weaknesses in the Government’s
implementation capacity, dictated a prudent approach by the World Bank in its support, hence the
single tranche nature.15

In addition, in the specifics of its design the operation was well-linked to and supported by other
World Bank group activities such as IFC technical assistance, the on-going World Bank-financed
Public Financial Management project, and the Bank and EU supported projects to strengthen the
Social Welfare Fund. These linkages enabled the operation to draw on existing monitoring and
evaluation systems.

On the negative side, the operation was ambitious in terms of its objectives, given the nature of its
design as a single tranche operation. The operation envisioned simultaneously promoting growth
in the non-oil sector (Components 1 and 2) while also supporting reforms directly linked to the
fiscal consolidation process (Components 3 and 4). However, the promotion of growth in the
non-oil sector necessarily involved a series of actions that would need to take place over time. In
the context of a single tranche operation, only initial measures in this area could be envisioned,
leaving open the question of how these reforms would be sustained upon completion of the
operation16. By contrast, the measures in the areas of public finance management and reform of
the cash transfer system were both reasonably well contained in the context of the program period
(and hence suitable for inclusion in a single tranche operation) and directly supportive of the


                                                 16
objective of fiscal consolidation. Given the centrality of the fiscal consolidation for the
program’s success, it probably would have been better to have focused the operation more
explicitly on those measures that supported reforms in this area.

(b) Quality of Supervision

      Rating: Moderately satisfactory.

As noted above, the monitoring and evaluation system was reasonably well-designed at entry.
However, events in 2011 severely disrupted the Bank’s capacity to oversee the operation,
rendering the effectiveness of the design partially moot. Although this operation was designed as
a single tranche with all actions being completed prior to Board presentation, policy
implementation progress was monitored up to the evacuation of Bank staff in mid March 2011,
and resumed after the suspension of Bank operation in Yemen was terminated, in early 2012.
Since the evacuation of the Bank’s office staff in Sana’a supervision mission could be held
outside of Yemen, which allowed for a critical thrust of supervision.

During this period, especially the progress made in the area of public financial management was
monitored, partly aided by the Bank project supporting the government reforms in this area. In
particular the Expenditure Commitment Control Systems and the Automation of the Government
Financial Accounts (AFMIS) could make progress. But also the Social Welfare Fund reported in
early 2011 that it is making progress on the targeting problem, partly due to the issued By-law to
the Social Welfare Law. Bank missions supporting the building of capacity in the area of social
protection were conducted in 2011 and early 2012 outside of Yemen to follow up with the
Government and the SWF and the newly gained options to improve targeting and enhance options
for graduation from the SWF, for making the poor more productive. As a result, those households
who were newly admitted to the SWF in 2011 were only households of the income category A
and B, a category clearly identified as living at an income below the prevailing poverty line.

With resumption of the Bank engagement in Yemen, further monitoring was facilitated in an
overall difficult environment. It was then, when the audit letter was requested and obtained for
the designated account at the Central Bank receiving the operation’s funds. The audit letter was
an added outcome of the regular annual independent audit arrangements of the Central Bank of
Yemen.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

      Rating: Moderately satisfactory.

As both performance criteria are rated moderately satisfactorily, the overall Bank performance
rating is moderately satisfactory.


5.2    Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance

      Rating: Unsatisfactory



                                               17
Evaluation of Government performance must necessarily take into account the failure to achieve
the development objectives set out in the operation. As noted above, this failure can be
attributed to the civil unrest during 2011, which affected negatively implementation of the
program, which was overtaken by other more immediate priorities. In addition, the unrest, which
was concentrated in the capital city Sana’a, Ta’iz and Aden, made engagement in the program
difficult, even if government officials were inclined to continue with program implementation in
spite of the on-going unrest. As noted earlier, conditions on the ground were sufficiently
unsettled that resident Bank staff was evacuated earlier in the year and all missions to the country
were put on hold.

While Government performance is rated unsatisfactory this is not to imply that the unrest was due
to actions undertaken under the program nor that the officials responsible for the program are in
any way accountable for this unrest. As noted earlier, this civil unrest reflected long standing
tensions within the country, tensions which predated this operation, and the immediate spark was
provided by external events, notably the advent of the Arab Spring in first Tunisia and then Egypt.
While the existence of the tensions could have been, and to some extent was, known in advance,
the severity of the unrest and its effect on program execution was unpredictable.


(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

      Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

    This rating reflects the engagement of the implementing agency in the design of the operation,
which, as noted above, was generally well-thought through, and the successful efforts, in spite of
the unrest of 2011, to carry out some components of the operation under extremely difficult
circumstance, e.g., the operationalization of the credit registry and the production of the MTEF
for the period 2011-2013. Nonetheless, some of the operations overall failure to achieve its
development objectives must be attributable to the implementing agencies, notably those
responsible for the first component.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

      Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

    This summary rating is dictated by the subcomponent ratings of Unsatisfactory (for the
Government) and moderately successful (for the implementing agencies). As one of the ratings is
in the unsatisfactory range and the other is in the satisfactory, the overall rating is dictated by the
overall project rating, which was unsatisfactory. Hence, the summary rating should fall in the
unsatisfactory range.

6.        Lessons Learned
Description of Political Risks. The program document for the operation highlighted the political
risks associated with the Bank’s engagement in Yemen. As noted above, the document’s
discussion of political risks focused on the Government’s ability to sustain the reform program in
the face of political opposition to some of the measures, e.g., price increases for oil products.14
However, the operation did not identify explicitly as a political risk threats to the political

     Program document, paragraph 156, pp. 49-50.

                                                   18
legitimacy of the Government itself, a much broader political risk than that identified in the
program document. As a result, the mitigation measures taken in the context of the operation to
address the political risks (its design as a single tranche operation, its close links with the IMF
program) were ineffective in the face of this broader political risk.

This said, it was known that such broader risks did exist in a country which had been involved in
six domestic wars since 2004.15 This unrest necessarily raised questions about the Government’s
overall legitimacy. In such a context, it would have been prudent to have discussed in the risk
section this broader systemic risk. This would have meant acknowledging more explicitly that
Yemen was (and remains) a high political risk environment and that much of this risk cannot be
effectively mitigated.

It is important to note that in acknowledging such risks, the point should not be to thereby
exclude a priori any Bank engagement with the country. Such engagement can still be
appropriate, with the potential payoff from such engagement being relatively high. Also, the
existence of this broader risk should influence the design of Bank intervention: e.g., it may make
more sense for Bank engagement to be more through analytic work rather than lending operations.
If lending operations are to felt useful, then the risk should be reflected in the design of the
operation. For example, a premium would be placed on actions that can be accomplished quickly
and which are likely to be of an irreversible nature and therefore not subject to reversal in the
event of a complete breakdown in implementation capacity (e.g., upfront elimination of the fuel
subsidy in Yemen). In this regard, the operation’s design as a single tranche operation was
sensible. However, the design was perhaps overly complex, given the fragile political situation.

However, the evaluation criteria used to assess Bank projects are not particularly suited to
taking this kind of risk. In effect, when implementation is negatively affected by unrest related
to the perceived legitimacy of the Government, the criteria will lead necessarily to a down-
grading of performance. To avoid such an outcome, the Bank would need to remain disengaged
from countries where this risk was thought to be relatively high. Such a stance, however, would
not be consistent with the Bank’s mission of poverty reduction and arguably could make social
unrest more likely. On balance, Bank engagement in fragile states like Yemen carries high risks
and potentially high rewards. What is needed is not disengagement but more transparency with
respect to these contexts.

Scope of the Operation. Given the very fragile context against which this operation was
implemented, and the single tranche approach, a less ambitious operation would have been more
appropriate. While it is difficult ex-ante to judge properly the right scope which typically rivals
with the given moment of opportunity, a consistently simpler and more focused approach should
be the preferred option in a fragile context such as the one in Yemen.

Supervision of Single Tranche Operations. The design of an operation as a single tranche, if
embedded with investment operations – as was the case here - allows the Bank to conduct
oversight over the operation after the disbursement of the funds, even if the country’s own
monitoring and evaluation system is weak. The Bank remains this way engaged with the
Government through the full program period. Of course, in this specific case, supervision was
compromised by the civil unrest of 2011 and by the lack of any physical engagement of the Bank
team in Yemen from March 2011 to early 2012. Reversed missions helped to compensate.

Close Link to other Bank Group Activities. On the positive side, the design of the operation
benefitted from its close links with other World Bank group operations. This enabled the Bank,
among other things, to draw on monitoring and evaluation systems already in place in these
parallel operations and thereby overcome capacity weaknesses within the Government.

No comments.

(b) Cofinanciers

Not applicable. There were no co-financiers.

(c) Other Partners and Stakeholders

The Bank team worked in partnership with the IMF team, which implemented in parallel a
program under the Extended Credit Facility, and which was approved by the IMF’s Executive
Board on July 30, 2010.

The Bank’s operation was part of a broader support package that included an arrangement under
the Fund’s Extended Credit Facility (ECF) with a total amount of SDR 243.50 million (100
percent of the quota). About SDR 34.8 million (nearly US$50 million) had been released by the
IMF upon the approval of the arrangement. The first review under the arrangement, which was
scheduled for early 2011, was not completed due to the political crisis, and the ECF was
cancelled on April 4, 2012. At that time, a Rapid Credit Facility was approved by the IMF’s
Executive Board and US$94 million (25 percent of quota, SDR 60.9) million was disbursed. This
new arrangement allowed the IMF to respond with more flexibility to the needs of the new
Yemeni Government that was formed in late 2011.

The policy matrix used by the Bank has been different from the one used by the IMF but the
measures supported and monitored were complementary in the sense that the Bank (1) promoted
private sector led growth, (2) focused on strengthening public financial management, and (3)
consolidated and strengthened the cash transfer system to enable it respond better to the need of
the poor vulnerable households, which were seen to be adversely affected by the envisaged
gradual reduction of energy subsidies supported by the 2010 program agreed with the Fund. The
Fund’s program focused on macroeconomic stability, stabilizing the exchange rate, and
safeguarding foreign exchange reserves, which were deemed necessary to support inclusive
growth and avoid major adjustment in the balance of payments.

Staff from both the Bank and the Fund regularly consulted each other concerning the design of
their respective policy matrix, including the one which defines the DPG program. There was
appreciation that the Bank was prepared to include in the matrix areas which complemented the
areas supported by the Fund program and were also closely linked to ongoing Bank projects
which ensured the access to and availability of technical assistance, using each institutions
competences and advantages to minimize risks and success of the respective programs in the
fragile Yemeni context. The resulting policy matrix summarized appropriately the identified
priorities.


                                               20
The IMF team regarded the World Bank’s involvement as critical and felt that the engagement by
the team had been very constructive and collaborative. The IMF also participated or added to the
supervision of the project. Although, there were no formal review missions of the IMF’s ECF-
supported program given the very difficult political situation in 2011 in Yemen, two staff visits
were undertaken, in June and November of 2011, to assess the situation, and update the
macroeconomic framework. World Bank staff participated in the June mission. There was close
consultation throughout the period between the teams.

Furthermore, the complementarity of this Development Policy Grant to the ECF arrangement by
the IMF did not only lead to added financial resources, which were of lesser importance in this
case given the DPG’s volume, but added to deeper policy advice and dialogue. The provision of
IMF technical assistance did not increase, as envisaged, due to the crisis. Even if the 2011 events
prevented the realization of the full potential of these operations, both were mutually supportive
of each other. Given the potential gains to be made from full implementation, both were worth the
risk, and the new Government has recognized the importance of these programs and the
underlying objectives. Inaction or no support would have yielded other risks, which were rejected
and deemed higher than those assumed when the decision was made in favor of an engagement.


The World Bank’s Social Protection Team working in Yemen (MNSSP)

The Bank's engagement with the Social Welfare Fund (SWF) through two IDA operations (DPG
and ISP) highlighted the importance of strengthening and improving the efficiency and equity of
the social protection system. Prior actions (trigger) required for the DPG Social Protection
component of the DPG were: (a) the Government's approval of operationalizing a new targeting
methodology, and (b) the approval of by-laws to complete the legal framework and strengthen the
operation of the SWF. The ISP's key objective is operationalization of the new targeting
mechanism. The approval and enactment of By-laws through the DPG have paved the road for
the implementation of the ISP. In addition, the associated dialogue advanced questions of
efficiency and equity of the national cash transfer program, and coordination with other donors
has been strengthened as well. The EU financed technical assistance to draft and advice on the
By-laws. With confidence gained from the newly applied targeting mechanism, more donors
started using the beneficiary list to channel their funds to implement their programs.

The SWF is nonetheless still a weak institution. However, it showed adaptability and flexibility
in conducting its operations in a challenging environment throughout 2011. Despite a worsening
operating environment (with difficulties of access to some communities, shortage of fuel, security
concerns, and suspension of disbursement by donors), the SWF rose to the challenges and has
been able to deliver in 2011 the crucially needed cash transfers for its 1 million households for
the full 12 months, plus an additional 500,000 households for a 2-months period. It has also
engaged with UNICEF to improve monitoring and reporting. The IDA team is benefiting from
other donor interventions as they continue to verify the beneficiary list in providing their own
programs (e.g., UNICEF, WFP, EU, OXFAM). The WFP has used SWF's beneficiary list. The
EU conducted a monitoring mission in January/February 2012 visiting SWF offices and taking
sample of beneficiaries.

The complementary of two operations’ objectives benefited the client’s as well as the Bank’s
team. It helped strengthen implementation on the client side, efficiency in supervision for the
Bank team and brought synergy to donor coordination. The targeting improvement will be
continuously supported through the ISP and other donor interventions.
