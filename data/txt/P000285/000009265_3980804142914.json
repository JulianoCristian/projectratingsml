by the Ministry of\n            Agriculture and Livestock. The project constituted the first\n            phase of a long-term national program aimed at strengthening\n            agricultural services. It had three main objectives; to\n            improve the effectiveness of agricultural and livestock\n            extension services in transferring technology to farmers, to\n            strengthen animal health services, and to provide functional\n            literacy training to farmers, thereby enhancing their\n            ability to participate more directly in technology\n            generation and dissemination. The borrower's\n            performance was mixed but is deemed satisfactory overall and\n            the Bank\u0092s performance was also deemed satisfactory. Lessons\n            learned from this project were that participation by farmers\n            in the definition of extension themes increases the\n            relevance and effectiveness of the extension system. Regular\n            meetings between research and extension at regional level\n            are essential to capitalize on the participatory diagnosis\n            carried out with farmers, and to strengthen\n            research-extension linkages. The use of existing village\n            organizations as a basis for the creation of farmers'\n            contact groups increases the cost-effectiveness of the\n            public extension service. Decentralization of project\n            management to the regional and sub-regional level increases\n            the responsiveness and effectiveness of field extension\n            services. Extension of low-input, low-risk technologies in a\n            risky semi-arid environment where productivity growth is\n            essential for survival can result in substantial adoption\n            and impact. Last but not least, the establishment of a\n            full-time project coordination unit, with direct reporting\n            to the Minister's office, has been key to the good\n            implementation of the project."}, "docdt": "1998-06-26T00:00:00Z"}
