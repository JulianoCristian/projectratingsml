                  Re:   Bangladesh General Education Project
                        Credit No. 2118-BD
Dear Mr. Chaudhury:
       We refer to the Development Credit Agreement (General Education Project) 
between People's Republic of Bangladesh (the Borrower) and the International 
Development Association (the  Association) dated May 4, 1990.  We also refer to your 
letter dated January 27, 1992, requesting the Association to increase the Authorized 
Allocation for the Special Account from US$ 11 million to US$ 28 million.
       We are pleased to inform you that the Association, after due consideration, has 
agreed to increase the Authorized Allocation to US$ 19 million.  Accordingly, in 
paragraph 1 (c) of schedule 5 to the Development Credit Agreement the figure 
"$11,000,000" is deleted and replaced by "$19,000,000".
       However, as agreed during the meeting with the Minister of Finance on April 3, 
1992,  in Washington, D.C., the Association will review in November 1992 disbursements 
through the Special Account.  If it is determined that this increase was not 
justified, then the Authorized Allocation will be reduced, and may revert back to the 
original amount of $11,000,000.
