Specifically\n            the project will : a) increase equitable access to primary\n            and secondary schooling; b) improve the quality of education\n            at the primary and secondary levels; c) strengthen the\n            management capacity of the primary and secondary subsectors;\n            and d) prepare future policies and programs to reform the\n            structure and financing of higher secondary and post\n            secondary levels. Project components cover three broad\n            categories : 1) expanding equitable access to primary and\n            secondary schooling; 2) improving the quality of general\n            education; and 3) institutional development.  Specifically\n            these components include : a) increasing access to primary\n            schooling through construction or repair of 22,000\n            classrooms; b) increasing proportion of female teachers; c)\n            testing the use of satellite schools to reach the very poor\n            and girls; d) increase the quality and efficiency of\n            secondary education by strengthening the Directorate of\n            Secondary and Higher Education; e) reforming th examination\n            system; f) improving textbooks and curricula; g) expanding\n            the existing secondary school scholarship program for poor\n            girls; and h) finance Government studies of policy and\n            program options in higher and post secondary education."}, "docdt": "1990-02-05T00:00:00Z"}
