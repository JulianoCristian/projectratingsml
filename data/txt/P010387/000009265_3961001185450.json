program for the 1991-95 period. It will cover the\n            incremental costs associated with the program.

It will be co-financed by\n            UNICEF and take into account its experience in assisting the\n            Government of India in implementing the Universal\n            Immunization Program during the seventh five-year plan\n            (1985-90). Its specific objectives will be to enhance child\n            survival, prevent maternal mortality and morbidity, and\n            increase the effectiveness of service delivery. These\n            objectives will be achieved through supporting: (a) Child\n            Survival Programs; (b) Safe Motherhood Initiatives; and, (c)\n            Institutional Systems Development."}, "docdt": "1991-08-27T00:00:00Z"}
