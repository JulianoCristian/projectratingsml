{"cdata!": "The outcome of the Child Survival and\n            Safe Motherhood Project for India was satisfactory. The\n            project achieved its overall objectives, institutional\n            development was partially achieved, sustainability is\n            likely, and the performance of both the Bank and Borrower\n            was satisfactory. Several lessons can be learned from this\n            project. First, the expanded scope of activities undertaken\n            in CSSM required greater modifications in program strategy\n            than were adopted. Second, a country-wide project needs a\n            well-functioning MIS for monitoring and midcourse\n            corrections. CSSM lacked this. Also, a project with varied,\n            often competitive, activities and a \"life cycle\"\n            approach needs an MIS tailored to field operatives'\n            requirements for planning. Third, if involvement of the\n            private sector is imperative to meet project objectives,\n            mechanisms to ensure such involvement and monitor progress\n            must be built in, such as in performance reporting. Further,\n            the ways of involving the private sector need to be tailored\n            to its varied segments. Finally, systematic management\n            training must be a major concern for large and complex projects."}, "docdt": "1997-03-03T00:00:00Z"}
