CHILD SURVIVAL AND SAFE MOTHERHOOD PROJECT
(CREDIT 2300-IN)
PREFACE
This is the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) for the Child Survival and Safe
Motherhood Project in India, for which Credit No. 2300-IN in the amount of SDR 160.9
(US$214.5 million equivalent) was approved on September 17, 1991 and made effective on
March 5, 1992.
The Credit closed on September 30, 1996 compared to the original closing date of
September 30, 1995. It was fully disbursed, and the last disbursement took place on December 5,
1996.
The ICR was prepared by Anthony Measham (Task Manager) and Lessel H. David
(Consultant), with technical assistance from Ann Hammond, Mark Schlagel and R. Sethuraman.
Nira Singh and Mark Schlagel provided office technology assistance. The ICR was reviewed by
Richard Skolnik (Division Chief, SA2PH) and Kazuko Uchimura (Project Advisor, SA2DR).
Preparation of this ICR began during the September/October 1996 supervision mission.
It is based on material in the project files, field visits, and interviews/discussions with
beneficiaries, project staff, Government officials and Bank staff. The Borrower contributed to
the preparation of the ICR by hosting a workshop on September 30-October 1, 1996 and by
preparing its own evaluation of the project's preparation and execution. Comments were received
from the Borrower on drafts of the report and were taken into account in the final version.
The cooperation and assistance of the Government of India (GOI) and the State
Governments is gratefully acknowledged.

IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
INDIA
CHILD SURVIVAL AND SAFE MOTHERHOOD PROJECT
(CREDIT 2300-IN)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Introduction
1.   IDA has supported India's family welfare program since 1972 through nine India
Population Projects (IPPs) in various states. Four related projects, also limited to one or
two states, supported child health and nutrition services. The Child Survival and Safe
Motherhood (CSSM) project was the first project that operated country-wide.
Project Objectives
2.    The project's overall objectives were to: (a) shift India's family welfare program
from its near-exclusive concern with fertility regulation to mother and child health
(MCH); and (b) to provide a social safety net during the period of financial stringency
and economic reforms. The project's specific objectives were to: (a) increase child
survival; (b) promote safe motherhood, including establishing first referral units (FRUs)
for secondary-level care of mothers and their newborn; and (c) strengthen the delivery of
services by improving institutional capability.
3.    Enhancing institutional capability was to be achieved through: training for field
workers and program administrators; more effective information, education, and
communications (IEC); improved management information systems (MIS); better
materials management, including equipment maintenance; and extending coverage by
involving other government departments, private medical practitioners, and private
voluntary organizations (PVOs).
4.    The activities planned for the project were well conceived and collectively
comprise a comprehensive approach to improving the health of women and children. The
expected coverage, however, was ambitious given the project's four-year duration and
extensive geographic spread.
Implementation Experience and Results
5.    The project's overall objectives were met. The Department of Family Welfare has
discontinued its practice of setting fertility reduction targets and has increased the em-
phasis on MCH. Government of India (GOI) has also prepared a Reproductive and Child
Health Project which is to be appraised by IDA in early 1997. The credit was fully dis-



- 111 -
bursed. Not only were ongoing MCH activities sustained, but the range of services in-
creased.
6.    The specific objectives were met, though less substantially and not uniformly, as
follows:
7.    Child Survival. Surveys show that the percentage of children fully immunized
increased by about 20 percentage points during the project. Among the more recently in-
troduced services, the percentage of children receiving vitamin A prophylaxis increased
from 20 to 62 percent. Efforts to extend the treatment of acute respiratory infection
(ARI) -- an important cause of child mortality -- did not meet with much success. During
field visits, it was encouraging to note that parents spontaneously brought children for
immunization.
8.    Safe Motherhood. The protection of pregnant women against tetanus and anemia
increased, as did the proportion of institutional deliveries. However, the planned piloting
activities for safe motherhood were less successful. Against the required 1,700 FRUs,
about 600 are reported to be functioning. Even at the FRUs reported to be fully func-
tional, some services and specialists are not available.
9.    Institutional Capability Strengthening.  Approximately three-quarters of the
medical and paramedical staff have received the planned training. The effectiveness of
IEC increased and was well planned. MIS has not served its intended purpose of either
providing data for mid-course corrections or for planning activities at the field level.
Equipment maintenance, particularly for the transport and storage of vaccines, improved
dramatically.   Coverage has been extended by involving the Integrated Child
Development Services at the field level. Involvement of private practitioners, PVOs, and
local community groups did not make any significant progress.
10.   A special feature of the project was parallel co-financing from the United Nations
Children's Fund (UNICEF). This led to a rewarding collaboration between GOI,
UNICEF, and IDA.
Key Lessons Learned
11.   With the benefit of hindsight, the program strategy was not modified to the degree
required by the addition of new services to the program, for example, by greater
decentralization. Prior to CSSM, the major MCH activity was immunization through the
Universal Immunization Program (UIP). CSSM added curative components (UIP-plus) as
well as essential obstetric care (EOC), including secondary-level care at FRUs. UIP's
strategy was characterized by a high degree of centralization and rigid programming. It
served UIP well, but not CSSM. The UIP component carried over to CSSM did well; the
more recently introduced components did not; recency alone cannot explain the shortfall.



- iv -
12.   Large projects such as CSSM, especially those with varied components, need a
well-functioning MIS, one that has been designed in consultation with users at all levels and
therefore has a greater chance of being implemented. This need was not met.
13.   When private sector involvement is necessary to fully achieve project objectives, it
should be built into the project management and monitoring mechanisms. This requirement
was not met in the case of CSSM. Further, the private sector is heterogeneous and different
segments require different approaches.
14.   Management training of health planners and administrators becomes more critical as
boundaries and the size and shape of programs increase. Efforts to strengthen managerial
skills deserves more attention then they received in the project.
Project Outcome
15.   The project outcome is rated "satisfactory".  The project's contribution to
broadening the scope of the family welfare program, especially with regard to child survival
and safe motherhood, is noteworthy and certain to be sustained. Some of the more specific
objectives fell short of expectations, but these did not affect significantly the overall project
outcome.

INDIA
CHILD SURVIVAL AND SAFE MOTHERHOOD PROJECT
(CREDIT 2300-IN)
PART I: PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION ASSESSMENT
1.   IDA has assisted India's family planning - later, family welfare - program since 1972
through nine India Population Projects (IPPs). With two exceptions, IPPs supported multiple
family welfare activities in selected districts and urban agglomerates; the exceptions being IPPs
VI and VII which focused on training state-wide. Four related projects supported efforts to
improve the nutrition and health of pre-school children in selected states. All thirteen projects
were limited to a few states at a time; the Child Survival and Safe Motherhood (CSSM) project
broke new ground in that it was country-wide.
2.    In July 1991, the Government of India (GOI) announced its CSSM  program to
strengthen the maternal and child health (MCH) components of its National Family Welfare
Program. Essentially, CSSM combined disparate MCH programs into a single package and
initiated a wider range of maternal health measures.
3.    GOI allocated Rs. 11,255.81 million (US$495.8 million) for CSSM. This amount was
equivalent to the difference between MCH outlays for 1985-90 (Seventh Plan) and those
proposed for the six years 1991-97 (Eighth Plan and inter-plan period).
4.    The CSSM proposal was appraised by the Bank in April 1991, and the Staff Appraisal
Report (SAR) recommended an IDA credit of US$214.5 million. UNICEF committed an
additional US$67.8 million. The credit became effective in March 1992 and was to close on
September 30, 1995, later extended to September 30, 1996.
A. PROJECT OBJECTIVES
5.    The project's strategic objective was to shift the family welfare program from its
preoccupation with demographic goals and fertility reduction to more broad-based MCH
concerns. Within MCH, child-centered interventions dominated. While supporting and
extending services to under served areas and groups, the project sought to raise the concern for
mothers - safe motherhood - not merely as it related to child survival but in its own right. Later,
safe motherhood was to serve as an entry point for promoting reproductive health as a major
objective of the family welfare program.



- 2 -
6.    However, adverse economic conditions prevailing towards the end of the Seventh Plan
(1985-89) period threatened social services. This jeopardized their operations and made their
expansion infeasible. CSSM was, inter alia, an instrument to direct fiscal support to MCH;
quick disbursement of funds to sustain its programs was an implicit, but important, objective.
7.    The specific objectives of the project were in three clusters: child survival, safe
motherhood, and the effectiveness of their services.
8.    Child Survival (CS): Two ongoing programs formed the core of the CS strategy; the
Universal Immunization Program (UIP) and a wider range of MCH interventions that came to
be known collectively as UIP-plus. UIP immunized against six childhood diseases and
protected pregnant women against tetanus. UIP-plus provided curative (diarrhea and acute
respiratory infections - ARI), preventive (anemia and vitamin A deficiency), and promotive
(breast feeding and birth spacing) services.
9.    The UIP was already operating in all 466 districts of the country and was to be sustained
by the project. UIP-plus components were limited to a few pilot districts, and the project sought
to extend them to all districts, phased over five years (1991-92 to 1995-96).
10.   Safe Motherhood (SM): in addition to the UIP and UIP-plus components which benefit
mothers and the ante- and post-natal services already being provided, the project promoted
essential obstetric care (EOC) by:
(a)   strengthening the training of traditional birth attendants (TBAs) and providing
them and pregnant women with pre-sterilized disposable delivery kits (DDKs);
(b)   training TBAs and auxiliary nurse-midwives (ANMs) in early detection of high-
risk pregnancies; and,
(c)   establishing first referral units (FRUs) for secondary-level obstetrical and
neonatal care.
11.   FRUs to deal with obstetrical and neonatal emergencies were a significant addition to
the UIP and UIP-plus agendas. One FRU was to be established for every 500,000 (in some
instances, every 300,000) population by strengthening selected community health centers
(CHCs) or other sub-district facilities such as post-partum centers by: adding obstetrician-
gynecologists, pediatricians, and anesthetists to their staff; upgrading equipment; and increasing
mobility by providing an ambulance for each FRU.
12.   While the GOI's CSSM proposal initially supported SM in 215 districts in six states, the
program extended it to all states in 1995. IDA support, however, was limited to the six states
originally proposed -- Assam, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Orissa, Rajasthan, and Uttar Pradesh --
which together contain about half the country's population and are particularly deficient in
MCH care.



- 3 -
13.   Effectiveness of service delivery was a major concern of the project. The project
proposed to enhance it by:
(a)   strengthening institutional systems, specifically, training of field workers and
program administrators in association with private voluntary organizations
(PVOs);
(b)   expanding information, education, and communications (IEC) activities in
cooperation with women's and other community groups;
(c)   strengthening state and district management information systems (MIS) for mid-
course corrections and for field workers to plan their activities;
(d)   enhancing logistics and maintenance systems, including those of the cold chain;
and,
(e)   extending the program's reach through partnership with other public sector
programs such as the Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) program,
private medical practitioners, PVOs, and community action groups.
14.   The SAR recommended: operational research (OR) studies in nine program areas; a
baseline study to establish maternal mortality parameters; policy level reviews of UIP-plus
components that had been recently introduced - diarrhea management, nutritional anemia and
vitamin A deficiency; and a series of workshops to discuss, and if need be, recast, field workers'
work routines.
15.   Special aspects: Apart from the country-wide coverage of the project, three other
aspects deserve special mention:
(a)   the project received parallel co-financing from UNICEF and built on activities
assisted for several years by UNICEF;
(b)   project preparation was marked by intensive collaboration among the Ministry
of Health and Family Welfare (MOHFW), UNICEF, and the Bank; and,
(c)   the project was implemented directly by the existing management structure, and
not, as in most other projects of comparable size, through a separate project
implementation unit (PIU), either at MOHFW or in the health directorates of the
various states.
16.   The project objectives were wide-ranging yet mutually supportive and, prima facie,
manageable. Collectively they comprise a comprehensive approach to the health of children and
women, particularly the former. The expected coverage - the number of beneficiaries was



- 4 -
expected to double - appears unrealistic in hindsight given the project's four-year duration and
phased country-wide implementation.
B. ACHIEVEMENT OF PROJECT OBJECTIVES
17.   The strategic objective of broadening the scope of the family welfare program was met
substantially. MCH now receives more priority in district plans and field workers' activities and
this emphasis can be expected to increase even further consequent to the family welfare
program's recent discontinuation of its demographic, target-driven approach. In addition, GOI
has prepared a project to enhance reproductive and child health and it will be appraised by IDA
in early 1997.
18.   The financial objective - quick disbursement of funds - was met. After an initial lag,
disbursements picked up and the credit was fully utilized by the extended closing date. The
UNICEF commitment has also been fully utilized.

19.   The SAR specified service delivery objectives in terms of the absolute number of
beneficiaries. However, MOHFW reports the coverage rates (Tables 1 and 3), derived from
service statistics. Two other sources also report coverage rates, but derived directly from



surveys: the National Family Health Survey (NFHS), 1992-93, and UNICEF's Multi-Indicator
Sample Survey (MICS) 1995-96 round. Both these surveys sampled from the same universe
using nearly identical methodologies and, having been done three years apart, provide
comparisons over time (Table 2). These surveys show lower coverage rates than those
provided by MOHFW, but an increase over time.
20.   Child Survival. The objectives related to child survival were mostly achieved.
According to the data provided by the MOHFW, immunization coverage increased dramatically
-- to near universal coverage -- between 1986 and 1991 (Table 1), before the inception of the
project (1992). Subsequently, coverage increased marginally, or in some cases, declined. The
NFHS and MICS surveys show lower immunization coverage than that derived from service
statistics, but nonetheless, significant progress during the project (Table 2). Field visits
confirmed that the supply of vaccines was adequate, the cold chain was well maintained, and
parents increasingly brought their children for immunization at their own volition. This
suggests that the immunization coverage will rise steadily.

21.   The UIP-plus components, being more recently introduced, have lagged considerably
behind achievements in immunization. No service statistics data are available for UIP-plus
components except for Vitamin A prophylaxis, which has registered a substantial increase
(Table 1). Surveys show that coverage increased with respect to three out of five indicators
(Table 2). According to the statistics provided by MOHFW, 66.3 percent of the children with
ARI had been taken to health facility for treatment in 1992-93 and this slipped to 39.2 percent
in 1995-96'. However, this is based on two different surveys and could be due to
methodological differences between the two surveys.

22.   Safe Motherhood. The objectives related to safe motherhood were met partially. In
1996, based on service statistics, an estimated 79 percent of pregnant women were immunized
against tetanus and 57 percent received supplementary iron/folate for anemia prophylaxis
(Table 3). Surveys show lower coverage for iron/folate, but nonetheless indicate progress
(Table 2). Almost all ANMs met during field visits were well versed in identifying high-risk
pregnancies - an observation confirmed by UNICEF. A program to train all TBAs was started
in 1994 and was expected to be completed by March 1997. However, timely completion is
unlikely, given the backlog - in one state at least (Orissa), traditional birth attendant training has
not yet commenced - and the low priority accorded to TBA training. The supply of disposable
delivery kits was erratic.

23.   No accurate data are available regarding the functioning of FRUs in the SM states.
MOHFW estimated that 2,500 FRUs would be required country-wide. Of these, the location of
1,700 has been identified though only 600 are reported to have started functioning, albeit

mostly without blood replacement facilities. No information is available as to the number of
obstetrical and neonatal emergencies that have been dealt with at FRUs.
24.   During field visits, evidence of a functioning referral system was lacking. ANMs,
having identified pregnancies requiring secondary level care, leave to the family the option of
where they should seek such care. Not one FRU visited had the full complement of specialists;
anesthetists in particular, were lacking. Such specialists are in short supply and hesitant to
accept assignments away from district headquarters. The anesthetist posts have not been
sanctioned in some states for fear that they will add to the state's financial burden: the recurring
costs of FRUs are borne by the states. To circumvent this, general duty doctors assigned to
CHCs or sub-district hospitals where the FRU is located are being given short-term training in
the required discipline. The provision of ambulances is uneven.
25.   Effectiveness of service delivery. Objectives related to increasing the effectiveness of
service delivery were met only partially. The training of medical officers of primary health
centers (MOPHCs) and paramedical workers has fallen considerably behind schedule. UNICEF
reported that, as of December 1995, 31 per cent of MOPHCs and 40 per cent of paramedical
workers had yet to be trained, and this excludes those districts where CSSM was extended in
Phase V (1996-97)2. Since training should be a continuous process rather than one-time, the
backlog seems formidable. A national workshop on training was organized by UNICEF in
February 1996, the proceedings of which suggest that PVOs have not so far been involved in
the training to any significant extent3. At least three factors appear to have contributed to the
lack of progress in training MOPHCs and paramedical workers: competing demands on
trainees' time, shortage of trained trainers, and irregular supply of training materials.
26.   No reports are available on the management training of program administrators.
Discussions with several state and district administrators suggest that management training was
given to a select few and not spread evenly across the trainee universe.
27.   The IEC achieved considerable success: an awareness level of 95 percent was reported
for UIP and UIP-plus components. An integrated multi-media approach was used, including
television and radio spots supported by informative handouts distributed to paramedical staff
and women. In the last year, most of the IEC was in support of Pulse Polio Immunization
campaigns, to the possible neglect of other components.
28.   The MIS was designed to span all CSSM  components. Performance against key
indicators is not available either at MOHFW or in the states. Differences between coverage
levels as derived from service statistics and surveys have not been reconciled. There was no
evidence of the MIS being used by field level operatives to plan their activities or by their

supervisors for monitoring. Beyond providing hardware, MIS operations seem to have received
little attention.
29.   Material management was satisfactory. The most difficult task of maintaining the cold
chain has been successfully accomplished and the responsibility passed on from GOI to the
states with equal success. This is due to MOHFW's long experience with, and commitment to,
UIP, and UNICEF's continuous assistance. The procurement and supply of equipment to FRUs
was stalled and rectified only when, at the Bank's urging, the responsibility was assigned to the
Railway Institute for Telecommunication and Signalling (RITES) and UNICEF stepped in to
procure equipment domestically and internationally. With few exceptions, the supply logistics
for vaccines and other medical supplies worked well, and no shortage was reported. Vehicle
supply and maintenance continues to be a problem, especially for FRUs.
30.   Collaboration with GOI's Integrated Child Development Services was in evidence:
ANMs regularly visit ICDS nutrition centers and Anganwadi Workers (AWWs) assist in
immunization and seek the auxiliary nurse midwife's (ANM's) assistance to treat minor
ailments of children under their charge. AWWs also stock DDKs. However, joint planning and
training exercises were exceptions rather than routine. There was no evidence of private
medical practitioners being involved at the field level. PVOs were called upon only to muster
people for Pulse Polio Immunization. Women's health committees have been formed at some
health sub-centers. Their members were selected by the ANM and assigned responsibilities
such as bringing children for immunization.
31.   Studies. The project objectives relating to studies were partially met. Much of the
baseline data came from the NFHS survey. The Council for Social Development has been
commissioned for an end-line survey and Mothercare undertook a review of SM in three states.
Eight other studies were done through the Indian Council of Medical Research. Of these eight
studies, none has been made available to the Bank. A workshop to identify further study areas
was held in July 1996, and its report is awaited. A similar effort was made in February 1996 at
UNICEF's initiative and seven OR projects identified; they are expected to be completed by
mid-19974. A policy review of ARI was undertaken in 1994 and a similar exercise for Vitamin
A prophylaxis and nutritional anemia is to be completed shortly. No workshops to review field
worker routines were held. In general, OR studies and associated reviews were not done or
considerably delayed.
32.   UNICEF collaboration. The collaboration with UNICEF worked well, most notably in
the procurement and distribution of cold chain and FRU equipment. Other areas include the
design of training modules for MOPHCs and paramedical staff, and program monitoring
through MICS. Staff at the UNICEF state offices also provided invaluable insights into field
operations. Reciprocally, IDA's assistance helped UNICEF complete its unfinished UIP tasks
and gave greater clout to the latter's advocacy role.

C. MAJOR FACTORS AFFECTING PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
33.   The CSSM project differed from its IDA-financed predecessors not only in that its
scope was country-wide, but also in the range and complexity of its interventions. Project
implementation was therefore dependent on a wider range of factors than usual. These fall in
three clusters:
(a)   those largely, but not entirely, outside the implementing agency's control,
such as the project's structure and scope, the financial condition of the various
states, and the availability of specialists for FRUs;
(b)   those mainly within the implementing agency's control but determined at the
time of project design, especially the choice of implementation strategy; and
(c)   those entirely within the implementing agency's control, e.g., planning for
FRUs.
34.   Two aspects of the project's scope severely taxed the managerial capabilities of
MOHFW's MCH division: the country-wide coverage and the absence of a specially-created
PIU - both unusual for IDA projects in India. This is not to argue that the project should have
been limited to selected states: this would have been politically untenable, as evidenced by the
GOI extension of SM to all states. Nor is it argued that PIUs would be of benefit in the long
run. The point is that the large geographic spread combined with working through existing
structures did impose a major implementation burden in the short run. MOHFW, its MCH
Division in particular, lacked staff capacity, both in numbers and range of expertise, to handle
this heavy and variegated burden.
35.   The financial position of some states weakened in the 1990s, the safe motherhood ones
in particular. The release of CSSM allocations for locally-incurred expenditures such as the
training of TBAs, supply of DDKs and reimbursement of travel costs, was considerably delayed
and funds were not utilized in time nor carried to the next fiscal year. Thus, TBAs were not
trained and DDKs were not regularly available, to facilitate safer domiciliary deliveries.
36.   Nearly all states found it difficult to position qualified specialists, especially
anesthetists, at FRUs. Some sought to remedy this by short training programs for general duty
medical officers. However, in quite a few states, the trainees were reluctant to accept
responsibility when back at the FRU. The training, they said, was inadequate, no protection
was offered from the Consumer Protection Act, and they were denied specialist rank and pay
when they were doing the same work as the formally appointed specialists. The proposed
Reproductive and Child Health project will address this problem in part by contracting
specialists from the private sector.
37.   From the strategic and managerial perspectives, CSSM had two kinds of programs: (a)
the UIP which was concerned exclusively with immunization; and (b) UIP-plus and essential
obstetric care (EOC) which had more varied components. The UIP lent itself to top-down



-10-
planning, target setting, and a high degree of centralization. Further, it required only passive
compliance from the beneficiary, i.e., parents had to bring their children to a predetennined
place at a predetermined time to have them immunized. On the other hand, UIP-plus, its
curative components in particular, and much of EOC could only be served by bottom-up
planning, demand for services by the end user, and required the active participation by intended
beneficiaries; to that extent they do not readily lend themselves to performance targets. The
CSSM strategy was inherited from UIP5 and characterized by a high degree of centralization
and "push" of supplies and services. In further evidence of the degree of centralization, training
modules were centrally designed and the composition of drug kits supplied to ANMs was
determined by MOHFW and uniform across the country. As could be expected, not only were
the UIP achievements higher but its activities received more support from training, IEC, and
MIS, to the neglect of much of UIP-plus and almost all of EOC.
38.   FRUs were a major addition to the UIP and UIP-plus agendas and differed from them
on at least four counts: (a) all other activities were field-based, while FRUs provided
institutional care; (b) other interventions were top-down and discrete, while FRUs required
patients to flow in the reverse direction and the referral system to function well; (c) FRUs
would mainly be located in urban areas and run into competition with private sector facilities;
and (d) while selected recurrent costs of UIP and UIP-plus were supported by the project, those
of FRUs were not. None of these factors seems to have been taken into account in the training,
IEC, or MIS. Access to transport for moving patients to or from FRUs was not provided to any
significant extent. FRUs suffered, as a senior program administrator put it, "from faulty
planning, both in space and time".
D. PROJECT SUSTAINABILITY
39.   The financial sustainability of the project appears likely. The SAR estimated the
recurrent costs to be about Rs. 1,524 million or about 3.4 percent of projected MCH
expenditures. However, this probability needs to be qualified. In the first place, the Ninth Plan
is yet to be formulated. Though there is no reason to believe that it will curtail MCH
expenditures, the level of finance for capital items is uncertain. Second, the recurrent cost of
UIP and UIP-plus components are met by the GOI; those of FRUs are the responsibility of
states, and they, the SM ones particularly, have less stable finances.
40.   Programmatically, the UIP achievements are likely to be sustained. Both the supply and
demand sides of immunization have been developed to the take-off point and it is reasonable to
expect that immunization coverage will increase with minimal additional inputs. The UIP-plus
components impose no heavy financial burden and are likely to be sustained.
41.   The FRUs are not yet fully functional as referral centers (see paras. 22 and 23, above).
Their sustainability in terms of added functions is, therefore, unclear.

E. BANK PERFORMANCE
42.   The Bank's performance was satisfactory with respect to project identification,
preparation assistance, and appraisal. The Bank assisted GOI in developing the long-term
vision needed for MCH activities.
43.   The Bank's supervision was focused mainly on resolving critical finance procurement,
and implementation hurdles, and did so satisfactorily. Technical supervision was greatly aided
by the assistance provided by UNICEF, including its regional offices. In addition, UNICEF
provided valuable assistance in facilitating the procurement of equipment for the project.
44.   Task management was transferred to the New Delhi resident staff in February 1994.
From then on, supervision missions were carried out one state at a time, and supervision reports
submitted after several state visits. Delhi-based supervision facilitated the resolution of pro-
curement and disbursement problems, by making continuous follow-up easier.
F. BORROWER PERFORMANCE
45.   The borrower's performance was satisfactory with respect to project preparation, which
was worked out in adequate detail. The project's strategy, in hindsight, appears limited (para.
36). In particular, it was deficient in planning for FRUs (para. 37).
46.   Implementation was satisfactory with respect to utilization of the credit and the phasing
of districts. Drugs and medical supplies were provided to far-flung service delivery points. IEC
was well developed and effective for the UIP components. However, performance was deficient
in five areas: training, MIS, OR studies, the involvement of private medical practitioners, PVOs
and community groups, and reporting.
47.   Compliance with several covenants was delayed (see Table 8). MOHFW  did not
provide the Bank with Annual Plans and Monitoring Reports on time. Nor were reviews of
MIS, OR studies, nutritional anemia, vitamin A prophylaxis, and field worker routines
undertaken in a timely way. Finally, several planned studies were not undertaken and others
were delayed.
G. ASSESSMENT OF OUTCOME
48.   The overall outcome is satisfactory: the project achieved its major objective in
broadening MOHFW's family welfare strategy. The main service objectives other than EOC
were met. Critical institutional objectives such as MIS strengthening, OR studies, and private
sector involvement were not, but this did not prevent the project from achieving its
development objectives. When the project began, budgetary cutbacks threatened health
programs generally. The project was instrumental in not only sustaining MCH but expanding
it. One of the more noteworthy outcomes is that the concern for women - safe motherhood - has
been brought closer to center stage. Though achievements in safe motherhood have fallen short



- 12 -
of expectations, the means have been clarified and widely accepted. The MOHFW is now
initiating further support for women's health and will integrate these efforts with programs for
adolescent girls.
49.   The MOHFW is aware of the shortfalls of its CSSM program. These were discussed at
the workshop held during the Implementation Completion Mission and elaborated in the Aide-
Memoire of October 25, 1996 (Appendix A). Some of the remedial action, such as OR studies
and policy reviews, can be undertaken by March 1997. Most others will require more time.
H. LESSONS LEARNED
50.   The CSSM project differed from its predecessor family welfare projects on at least three
counts: it was country-wide, it was reform-oriented, and several of its interventions such as the
treatment of ARI, diarrhea, and EOC required clients to take the initiative. Assuming that
successor projects will be similar in these respects, the lessons leamed from the project are of
great relevance.
51.   First, the expanded scope of activities undertaken in CSSM  required greater
modifications in program strategy than were adopted. CSSM added UIP-plus and EOC to UIP
but did not either decentralize operations sufficiently, or put in place an enhanced program
management capacity.
52.   Second, a country-wide project needs a well-functioning MIS for monitoring and mid-
course corrections which CSSM lacked. A project with varied, often competitive, activities and
a "life cycle" approach needs an MIS tailored to field operatives' requirements for planning.
CSSM's MIS was found wanting on both counts (para. 27, above). The experiences of other
health and family welfare projects, including IDA-assisted ones, have been similar. What is
required is an MIS design keeping implementation and the needs and limitations of field
workers in mind. This approach is being followed in the proposed Reproductive and Child
Health Project.
53.   Third, if involvement of the private sector is imperative to meet project objectives,
mechanisms to ensure such involvement and monitor progress must be built in, such as in
performance reporting. Further, the ways of involving the private sector need to be tailored to
its varied segments. The private sector is not homogeneous; for example, the treatment of ARI
and EOC differ. Curative services, such as for ARI, are overwhelmingly provided by private
medical practitioners, most of whom in the rural areas are not members of the Indian Medical
Association and can only be approached at district or lower levels. Conversely, EOC requires
women to be mobilized to demand services. This requires local women's groups to be
activated but such groups can only gather strength if networked with larger and more
established ones, and the latter will not accept secondary roles which are handed down. They
need to be involved at the design stage. Active and purposeful partnership with PVOs is as
difficult as it is necessary.



- 13 -
54.   Fourth, systematic management training must be a major concern for large and complex
projects. CSSM's mandate was larger and more complex than say, UIP, or any other single-
purpose program and its management more taxing. Future projects could profit by paying
greater attention to broad-based, not project-specific, management training at district and higher
levels. This should be a continuous process, spread evenly across the trainee universe, and
based on a rigorous management needs assessment. One option would be to liaise with
established management institutions, particularly those with experience of mid-career training,
and entrust management development for one or two states to each of them on a long-term
basis.

INDIA
CHILD SURVIVAL AND SAFE MOTHERHOOD PROJECT
(CREDIT 2300-IN)
WORLD BANK IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION MISSION
SEPTEMBER 30-OCTOBER 11, 1996
Aide-Memoire
1.    A World Bank implementation completion mission was undertaken from September 30-
October 11, 1996. The mission consisted of Dr. Anthony Measham (PHN Adviser and task
manager), Mr. R. Sethuraman (Finance Specialist) and Dr. Lessel David (Consultant Public
Health Specialist contracted to draft the ICR).  The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare
(MOHFW) hosted a national workshop from September 30-October 1, 1996 to review the les-
sons learned from the CSSM project. In addition, MOHFW requested Mothercare, financed by
USAID, to send a team to India for one month to undertake an independent review of the CSSM
project. Dr. David accompanied the Mothercare team to the states of Madhya Pradesh and
Orissa. His report, which summarizes the main findings of the ICR mission, is attached as An-
nex 1 to this Aide-Memoire.
2.     The mission would like to express its appreciation to the Department of Family Welfare
for their cooperation, and for the excellent arrangements made for the successful
workshop. The mission would also like to extend its thanks to the Governments of Madhya
Pradesh and Orissa for receiving the mission, and to UNICEF, Mothercare and USAID for the
valuable assistance in reviewing the lessons learned from the project.
Mission Objectives and Overall Progress
3.    The objectives of the mission were: (a) to review project progress in the final months
leading up to the closing date of September 30,1996; (b) to discuss the views of the Borrower,
the Bank, and other interested parties on the main lessons learned from the project, especially as
they relate to the Government's Reproductive and Child Health Program; and (c) provide support
to the Borrower in the preparation of its contribution to the ICR.
4.    Progress on the Child Survival activities has continued to be good since the Rajasthan
mission in May 1996. Details are given on progress in Madhya Pradesh (M.P.) and Orissa in
Annex 1. The Safe Motherhood activities, especially the operationalization of the first-referral
units (FRUs) has continued to lag, although it is not clear exactly how many are now operational.
Annex I provides information on the slow progress evident in M.P. and Orissa. Good progress
has continued on procurement and on disbursement: the credit is over 95% disbursed and it
seems likely that the credit will be fully disbursed before January 31, 1997, the last date for dis-
bursements. With the adoption by Government of India of the Reproductive and Child Health
(RCH) approach, and the likely appraisal of a large, IDA-financed RCH project early in 1997,
the prospects for CSSM project activities being sustained look good.



AppendixA
Page 2 of 13
5.    Financial Performance. The credit became effective in March 1992, six months after
Board approval.  Implementation began slowly, and the allocations for the first three years of
the project fell short of the amounts specified in the project approved by the Expenditure Finance
Committee (EFC). GOI increased the allocations for FY1994-95 and FY1995-96, thereby fully
meeting the agreed commitments. Disbursements picked up correspondingly, particularly after
procurement delays were resolved (see below). Nevertheless, the slow start and four-year proj-
ect period combined to make it impossible to fully implement the project before the closing date,
and the project was extended for a one-year period up to September 30, 1996. The UNICEF
parallel co-financing of $67.8 million has been fully disbursed.
6.    Procurement. Progress on procurement, which accounts for the major share of the proj-
ect, began very slowly. Accordingly, the Bank recommended in late 1993 that responsibility for
procurement be shifted from DGS&D to RITES, and that UNICEF be requested to assist with
some of the procurement. These changes were instituted in August 1994 and dramatically im-
proved the procurement performance. UNICEF contributed in two major ways. First, a major
review was undertaken of the capacity of Indian suppliers to make available equipment and
supplies in sufficient quantity and of acceptable quality. Second, when indigenous suppliers
could not provide all the equipment needed for the project, UNICEF undertook offshore pro-
curement, and arranged for shipment after consolidating the purchases in its Copenhagen ware-
house. District-level delivery was then arranged after receipt of the goods in India. UNICEF
thus made a major contribution to the implementation of the project, in assuring that the FRUs
were equipped with the necessary items. Without this assistance, it is highly unlikely that the
disbursements would have reached the high level achieved, and a major objective of the project
would have been only partially achieved, i.e., equipping the FRUs.
7.    Annex I provides a brief summary of the mission's findings on service delivery, based
on field visits to M.P. and Orissa. Annex 2 outlines the approach to be taken in drafting the ICR.
Project Issues
8.    There are no outstanding project issues, except that the covenant annex has not yet been
revised, since the last supervision report. The updated covenant annex will form part of the im-
plementation completion report which is under preparation.
9.    The rest of the Aide-Memoire is devoted to the ICR process, the CSSM Review work-
shop and the preliminary findings to be elaborated in the ICR.
Implementation Completion Report
10.   In July 1996, the task team met with the project authorities and subsequently wrote to the
Government of India requesting that MOHFW prepare its contribution to the ICR, make avail-
able data required for that report, and organize the review workshop. The Department of Family
Welfare invited 12 states, bilateral and multilateral donors, 10 NGOs and 15 professional asso-
ciations and national experts to participate in the workshop. The workshop was well attended by
about 50 participants, including the four-person Mothercare team. The presentations and dis-
cussions were of a generally high standard.



Appendix A
Page 3 of 13
11.    Progress with the CSSM project was assessed against the original objectives, which were
as follows:
*   assist GOI to move the family welfare program to broader MCH concerns, espe-
cially improving the capacity of the maternity care system;
*   assist GOI to maintain the social safety net, expand services to underserved areas
and beneficiaries, and implement the integrated and cost-effective interventions
proposed for 1991-1995;
*   put more emphasis on targeting resources to most needy, more participation of
communities, PVOs, the private sector, and district-level planning and management;
and
*   promote a holistic approach to the delivery of MCH services
12.   The major achievements of the project are believed to be the following:
*   CSSM provided a bridge to the Reproductive and Child Health Approach
*   CSSM catalyzed district and state-level support for the family welfare program
*   CSSM revitalized the sub-center and enhanced the credibility of the ANM
*   CSSM  strengthened the training of ANMs and other health and family welfare
workers
C GSSM strengthened child survival efforts, especially through immunization
13.    Subject to confirmation in the ICR process, the following aspects of the project were
judged by the mission to be less successful:
*   operationalizing the FRUs - specialists lacking
*   establishment of the referral system
*   involvement of communities in Safe Motherhood efforts
*   provision of transport for obstetric emergencies
14.   Finally, key areas where further information is required to assess the success or lack
thereof in the project are the following:
*   what services have been provided?
*   how many FRUs are operational?
*   what are the research findings?



Appendix A
Page 4 of 13
15.   The Borrower, the Bank, UJNICEF and other interested parties appear to be in general
agreement with the main achievements of the project and those which did not succeed to the
same extent. The ICR will attempt to articulate these further and substantiate its findings on the
basis of data to be collected in the field, provided by GOI, and contributed by the Mothercare
review. In addition, the ICR will endeavor to explain the reasons for the relative success of dif-
ferent elements of the project. It is already clear that the CSSM project and program played a
strategic role in the shift of the GOI Family Welfare Program from a top-down, demographi-
cally-driven approach, to the broad-based reproductive and child health approach of 1996, which
emphasizes serving individual client needs and enhancing the quality of services.
Next Steps
16.   The MOHFW is requested to provide its contribution to the ICR by November 30, 1996
and to furnish the data requested in our letter of July 30, 1996.
17.   A first draft of the Bank's contribution to the ICR will be completed by November 30,
1996 and comments will be solicited from GOI and UNICEF. The draft ICR, including the GOI
contribution, will be submitted to the Bank's headquarters by December 31, 1996. It is due to be
sent to the Board by March 31, 1997.

Child Survival
The reported incidence of neonatal tetanus, polio, measles and diarrhea declined during 1995 - 96.
However, immunization coverage seems to be slipping (Table 1). Though program administrators
were aware of this, there was no evidence of any remedial steps taken by them apart from stepping
up Pulse Polio Immunization.

The state has assumed responsibility to maintain the cold chain and was doing it well. Equipment
breakdown less than one per cent and trained mechanics available in nearly all districts.
Safe Motherhood
About 85 per cent of the deliveries are domiciliary. Any attempt to decrease their number must
reckon with the poor physical infrastructure; two out of every three sub health centers function
from rented buildings and a similar proportion of CHCs do not have adequate buildings. The supply

Page 6 of 13
of DDKs, critical to domiciliary deliveries, is erratic. The training of Traditional Birth Attendants
(TBAs) was stalled up to 1994 and is reported to have picked up since then though the number
trained was not available.
First Referral Units (FRU)
Of the 228 institutions identified for upgrading to FRUs, 160 of them are reportedly equipped - with
hydraulic operation tables, shadowless lamps and wall clocks! The remaining are expected to be
equipped by the end of this year.
One of the FRUs visited was less than 10 kms from a headquarters hospital of an adjoining district
and, inevitably served for walk-in deliveries and not as a referral center. UNICEF felt about 15 to
20 per cent of the FRUs in the state were similarly sited. Of institutions where FRUs are, or will be
located, 40 per cent have less than 20 beds and 20 per cent six or less.
Training
About a quarter of the field personnel have yet to be trained. The training of medical officers for
specialist functions at FRUs was started in June 1996 and 100 are reported to have been trained. A
breakdown by discipline was not available.

Child Survival
The percentage of infants immunized range from 83 per cent (measles) to 101 per cent (BCG).
Those receiving routine micronutrient range from 83.8 (anti anemic) to 143.0 (vitamin A).
However, the immunization coverage evaluation survey (1992 - 93) by UNICEF in seven major
districts shows significant gaps between coverage levels as estimated from service statistics and
from surveys (Table 2). No attempt has been made to reconcile these two sets of figures.

The cold chain equipment breakdown is of the order of eight per cent.
Safe Motherhood
The training of TBAs is expected to start shortly; as of the present, only trainers have been trained.
As of March 1996, Rs 13,16,500 has been received for the purchase of DDKs. None of this has
been utilized due to 'non finalization of tender.'
First Referral Units (FRU)
Sixty three FRU sites have been identified for Phase I to IV districts. Funds have been requested
from ODA (UK) to renovate the buildings. The status of these FRUs in terms of equipment, staffing
and functioning was not available.
Training
The CSSM training of MOPHCs and paramedical staff for phase I - III districts have been
completed. UNICEF feels that the training has made a difference; field workers are better informed
and skilled; for example, they can identify high-risk pregnancies with greater acuity.
Skill training of FRU staff has been completed for three districts and GOI funds awaited for the
remaining.
COMMENTS
In both states child-centered activities have been much better implemented than those of direct
concem to women or mothers. This is in some measure due to CSSM inheriting not only the
strategy but also the priorities of UIP; witness, UIP's higher immunization coverage of children
than that of pregnant women. CSSM's generous funding for safe motherhood has not been able to
alter this bias; it would be too much to expect that it would. To what extent maternal morbidity and
mortality can be lowered by CSSM's prescriptions alone or needs to cross sectoral boundaries more
aggressively needs to be debated.

Reverting to child survival or child-centered activities, the immunization coverage seems to be
slipping. The impression is that health system managers are not aware of this, or if they are, have
not sought the reasons and explored possible solutions. If this is indeed so, then the MIS is not
serving its basic purpose.
It does not require unusual foresight to anticipate that levels of service provision would decline as
the delivery system was burdened. The SAR saw this and advised policy reviews such as that of
IFA distribution and of FFMPW work loads. This was not done, and the result is distressingly
evident.
In both states, there is no significant progress towards safe motherhood. Any shift towards
institutional deliveries is constrained by the condition of the SHCs, PHCs and CHCs. In Orissa,
some relief may be forthcoming during the third phase of UK ODA assistance. In Madhya Pradesh
less optimism is warranted as the third phase of Danida's assistance towards physical infrastructure
will be limited to two of the state's six divisions which have already benefited from earlier Danida
support.
At the same time, what could have been done for safer domiciliary deliveries such as better trained
TBAs and regular supply of DDKs has been neglected.
As for FRUs, as a senior administrator put it, 'suffer from faulty planning in terms of space and
time.' Perhaps their expansion should be frozen till a more coherent plan is developed.
All is not gloom, however. The cold chain functions most satisfactorily and its maintenance
intemalized. Further, CSSM has done well to combine all MCH related programs and in integrating
support systems, particularly for training and MIS. This needs to be built upon and attention paid to
their quality and relevance.
If key result areas need to be identified, two surface immediately. One, to raise planning and
coordination skills of CSSM apex and middle echelons. And two, sponsor multi-centric studies,
mainly in the social science areas so as to strengthen the quality of training and fine tune
implementation.

Annex 2
CSSM IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT:
DEFINING AN APPROACH
1.    The Program
1.1    The CSSM program's overall objective is similar to that of the Universal Immunization
Program (LJIP). This program was reckoned to have achieved a fair measure of success in
6
immunizing mothers and children . Circa 1990, UIP"s scope was expanded to a wider range of
MCH services; a package that came to be known as UIP plus7. CSSM adds institutional deliveries,
8
systems development and self sufficiency in all essential supplies to UIP plus' agenda .
1.2    To increase the number of institutional deliveries, CSSM strengthened subsidiary, primary
and community health centers to provide Essential Obstetric Care (EOC). Further, it sought to make
emergency EOC available. So far such care had been available only at district and a few sub-district
hospitals. CSSM planned to increase access by establishing one facility - first referral units (FRU) -
for every 30,000 - 50,000 population9. FRUs are expected to deal with neonatal emergencies in
addition to EOC.
1.3    FRUs were established by upgrading selected subdistrict hospitals and community health
centers (CHC). These were to be equipped, staffed and operated according to MOHFW guidelines.
1.4    For planning coverage and allocating resources to states, CSSM differentiates between
child survival (CS) and safe motherhood (SM). While CS would be supported in all the 466
districtsl' in the country, 215 districts in six states'1 would for SM along with ,'for demonstration
12
purposes', one in four other states
6 MOHFW, Child Survival and Safe Motherhood Program - India, July 1991, p 4
7 UIP plus consists of vaccination against tetanus, diphtheria, pertussis, tuberculosis, measles
and polio; provision of iron with folic acid, vitamin A; the treatment of respiratory infections
and diarrhea, promotion of breast feeding and contraceptive use.
8 MOHFW, 1991, p 13
9 lbid p45
10 Since then some the number of districts have increased by bifurcating existing ones.
1l Assam, Bihar, MP, Orissa, Rajasthan and UP
12 There is some confusion as to which four; at one place AP, Kamataka, Maharashtra and West
Bengal are mentioned, at another Tamnil Nadu replaces Maharashtra.



Appendix A
Page 10 of 13
1.5    CSSM's outlay is Rs 11,255.81 million over seven years(1991/92 to 1997/98). The actual
flow of funds delayed till August 199213. In effect, CSSM was operational from 1992/93. By April
1995, just over half (54.7 per cent) of the districts have been brought in for CS and less than half
(47.5 per cent) for SM14; the remaining are to be covered by March 1997.
1.6    No additional posts at state or district level were considered necessary; ORT and UPI
administrative and clerical staff were assigned to CSSM. The salaries of specialist staff (Ob/Gyn,
anesthetist and pediatrician) are borne by state governments.
1.7   In practice, CSSM's implementation follows that of UIP: to 'push' products and services to
the periphery; specific targets and time frames and using field workers to create demand. Though
CSSM mentions community participation, involvement of the private sector, IEC and such, these
are not reflected in either the planning process or reporting formats. It does emphasize training, but
1 5
again, mainly in service delivery protocols
2.     The CSSM Project Financed By IDA
2.1    The Staff Appraisal report (SAR) recommended a credit of US$214.5 million to be utilized
by FY 1995, later extended to September 1996. Three clusters of activities were identified and
provided for separately: Child Survival, Safe Motherhood and Institutional Development.
2.2    Child Survival: to sustain and extend UIP and UIP plus by financing equipment, training,
consumables, incremental staff salaries and vehicle purchase and operations. MOHFW  was
required to submit annual plans to IDA and ensure that no district was included unless it had
1 6
prepared UIP plus plans according to the IDA guidelines
2.3    Safe Motherhood: was to be supported for equipment, consumables, expert services and
training. Further, incremental staff salaries, equipment maintenance, vehicle operations and fees to
TBAs would be supported on a declining scale. MOHFW had agreed to establish by April 1992
Maternal Mortality Review Committees (MMRC) at national and regional levels to monitor,
1 7
evaluate and assist MOHFW in implementing SM
2.4   Institutional Systems Development was a major thrust of the project. The following
interventions were identified:

2.5    An indicative list of Operational Research studies lists nine areas and a baseline survey for
SM19. In addition, policies for diarrhea management, nutritional anemia and vitamin A deficiency
would be reviewed
21
2.6    SAR identified as many as 42 interventions and 27 expected outcomes . During
negotiations, agreements were reached on 15 points, including that MOHFW would submit annual
plans by January 1 5th each year
2.7    Key indicators identified were:

(f)    Contraceptive usage, by type
24
2.8    The number of beneficiaries was expected to virtually double between 1990 and 1995
2.9    Among the special features of the project, SAR mentions increased support to the private
sector and the collaboration with UNICEF25. As far as is known, there was nor private sector
involvement in UIP or UIP plus.
3.    Issues
3.1    Assessing performance: It will not be possible to assess impact in terms of lowering
maternal or child mortality. The National Family Health Survey (NFHS) estimated the Maternal
Mortality Rate of 4206, but this is a one-time estimate. More data are available on the Infant
Mortality Rate and several sources confirm that it has fallen; however, it is difficult to relate the
decline to any specific intervention. It would be more practical to limit assessment to the key
indicators as in para 2.6 above. These date are reported in the Annual Report and will have to be
specially asked for.
3.2    Assessing implementation will be easier. During Supervisory Missions more data were
available at state level than finds its way into the Annual Report. If the needed data are identified by
end August, it should not be very difficult for MOHFW to get most of it by end September.
3.3    What would be lacking are the insights gained during field visits. To supplement the
somewhat limited observations, it would be advisable to ferret out as many reports from other
23 SAR, Annex 29
24 SAR, Annex 1, p 2. However, SAR seems to have mistaken the quantum of services rendered
for the number of beneficiaries

agencies and donors. The evaluation by Mothercare, if available even in draft by end October will
be most useful.
3.4    First Referral Units (FRU): The establishment of FRUs was a significant addition to UIP
plus' agenda and is different on at least four counts. One, all other activities are field based, FRUs
provide institution based services. Two, other interventions are top-down; FRUs require patients to
flow in the reverse direction and a functioning referral system. Three, in some states the
administrative location of FRUs is different from that of the field based activities. Finally, it is
inevitable that FRUs would be located in urban areas and run into much more competition from
private sector facilities than any other CSSM activity. None of these seem to have been taken into
account in designing CSSM's administrative structure or training, for example there has been no
training in facility management or management of referral systems.
3.5    During Supervision Missions it appeared that FRUs functioned, where ever they did, as
walk-in facilities and not as units on a referral chain. It will be difficult to comment on their
performance as referral centers as, quite inexplicably, the monthly reporting forms do not ask for
the number and source of incoming referrals2 . As a proxy for referrals, UNICEF uses, somewhat
28
disputably, the number of Caesarian Sections
3.6   Incorporating FRUs into CSSM could have implications that go beyond providing better
maternal and child care: to knit field based services with static units. An analysis of the experience
with FRUs would be a significant contribution to India's health care policies and practices.
4.    ICR Components
4.1    Project Objectives will summarize paras 2.2 - 2.4 above. A priori, they appear somewhat
ambitious given that the project's effective duration was three, later extended to four, years.
4.2    Achievement of project objectives will be in two major parts; (a) the immediate objectives
as in paras 2.5 to 2.7, and (b), the long tern, mostly to do with policy shifts, institutional
development and the successive Reproductive and Child Health (RCH) Project.
4.3   Implementation record and major factors affecting the project will be against SAR
requirements as in para 2.5.
4.4    Future operations: the project comes to an end one year before the program does. Beyond
that, MOIFW plans, including RCH, will be commented on.

Introduction
I.    Several maternal and child health interventions have been implemented in the country for
reducing infant, child and maternal mortality, coverage levels were less than optimal due to
inadequate training, insufficient and irregular supplies and less effective use of available
resources. The Universal Immunization Programme (UIP) taken up as a technology mission in
1986 has succeeded in establishing a logistics network and a system of regular contact between
the beneficiaries and paramedical workers, i.e., the mothers, children and ANMs. The National
Development Council while reviewing the strategy for the Eighth Five Year Plan, emphasized
the importance of the interventions directed towards reduction of infant and child mortality rates
in the larger context of family welfare and recommended implementation of an integrated
package for bringing about qualitative improvement in the availability of services for improving
maternal and child health. Accordingly, the Government of India launched the Child Survival
and Safe Motherhood (CSSM) Programme in August 1992 by integrating all the basic MCH
interventions like ante-natal care, prophylaxis for mothers and children against nutritional
anaemia and Vitamin "A" deficiency, ORT Programme, ARI Control Programme and Dais'
Training Programme, with the Universal Immunization Programme. The basic strategy of the
CSSM Programme was to use the opportunity created by the UIP in terms of the regular contacts
between the paramedical workers located at the sub-centres and the mothers and children so that
all Maternal and Child Health Services could be provfded in an integrated manner and the
national goals of the Health Policy are achieved. The National Health Policy goals incorporate
the global objective of "Health for All by 2000 AD", as well as the goals agreed upon at the
World Summit for Children in 1990.
CSSM Programme Objectives
2.    The objectives for the CSSM programme broadly define the strategies which were to be
put into action to achieve the specific impact and coverage goals. These are:
(a)   to expand and improve the quality of care and universalize a package of child survival
and maternal health interventions;
(b)   to develop and initiate implementation of a safe motherhood programme;
(c)   to provide support to existing institutional systems to enable them to deliver more
effectively child survival and safe motherhood services; and
(d)   to achieve self-sufficiency in the production of all essential supplies required for the
interventions for child survival and safe motherhood, and the manufacture of essential
equipment for the programme.

Programme Components
3.    Child Surjvial. Among the measures taken in CSSM to improve Child Survival and to
reduce morbidity in the under-five age group, two stand out for particular attention in the
extension of CSSM activities: standard case management of Acute Respiratory Infections (ARI),
and neonatal care. Other measures like ORT and immunizations are also the core of the Child
Survival component:
(a)   sustaining the Immunization Programme in all the districts with particular emphasis on
increasing the coverage levels in identified pockets of low coverage;
(b)   sustaining the Oral Rehydration Therapy (ORT) programme in all the districts with
emphasis on the appropriate management of diarrhoea in the district and medical college
hospitals and increasing the availability of ORS packets in the rural areas;
(c)   expanding the ARI programme in the districts under CSSM by training the peripheral
health staff and supply of medicines;
(d)   intensifying Vitamin A coverage in children under three years of age in all the districts;
and
(e)   improving newborn care practice in the districts under CSSM by training medical and
health personnel.
4.    Safe Motherhood. The strategy adopted by the CSSM programme on safe motherhood is
comprehensive and covers most of the critical interventions required for the reduction of
maternal mortality:
(a)   intensifying coverage with IFA tablets in pregnant women to prevent maternal and
perinatal deaths due to anaemia;
(b)   increasing the proportion of institutional deliveries and deliveries by trained personnel;
(c)   improving ante-natal care for identification and treatment of maternal complications; and
(d)   improving accessibility to emergency care for obstetric complications by setting up First
Referral Units (FRUs) in sub-district level hospitals.
Present Status of Goals
5.    Immumizatio. The progress made under the Universal Immunization Programme has
been sustained under the Child Survival and Safe Motherhood Programme. Nearly 80 per cent of
the 27 million pregnant women and over 85 per cent of the 25 million infants received the full
course of vaccines annually since the inception of the Programme. Immunization coverage



Appendix]B
Page 5 of 11
levels have more than doubled since 1985-86. Drop-out rates have reduced and children are
being increasingly brought to the immunization sessions at the right age. Awareness about the
immunization programme and demand for services are high.
6.    Monitoring of Adverse Events. A well established system of monitoring of adverse
events has come into being in the last few years. Reporting of adverse events is a mandatory
component of the monthly CSSM monitoring report. In addition, each state and union territory
has set up a Committee of Experts to enquire into each reported adverse event and take
immediate corrective measures to prevent recurrence.
7.    Pulse Polio Immunization. The success achieved under immunization prompted the
launching of the initiative for eradication of poliomyelitis in 1995-96. In the first year of the
programme, every child under the age of three years was administered two doses of Oral Polio
Vaccine on December 9, 1995 and January 20, 1996. During this campaign over 80 million
children were immunized on each day. In the current year, children under five years have been
targeted. Over 120 million children are expected to be immunized. The first dose of this round
was given on December 7, 1996 and the second is scheduled for January 18, 1997.
8.    Quality of Cold Chain. A system for the testing of Oral Polio Vaccine Samples lifted
from various tiers of the health care delivery system has b5een established. Over 16,000 samples
were tested annually during the currency of the programme. Over 90 per cent of these tested
samples were found to be satisfactory indicating a satisfactory performance of the wide network
of cold chain system established in the country.
9.    Control of Diarrhoeal Diseases. The supply of ORS packets was taken up as central
supplies. 150 packets of ORS are supplied in the Drug Kit A every six months at the sub-centers.
The ORS packet has been standardized with a logo and uniform instructions for use on each of
the packets. This has meant 100 per cent access to ORS packets at sub-center level. Efforts were
made to supply ORS packets through Public Distribution System and an initial one time supply
to initiate this was made to some states who have taken up the sale and distribution of ORS
through the Public Distribution System. Population Services International have taken up social
marketing for ORS in Uttar Pradesh, Orissa and some other states with assistance from USAID.
10.   An algorithm for treatment of persistent diarrhoea in the health facilities was developed
with the help of experts from All India Institute of Medical Sciences and IAP and forms a part of
the clinical skills training for medical officers.
11.  In order to seek commitment of States, academicians, researchers, NGOs and professional
organizations and associations, a National Symposium on ORT was held in New Delhi in
January 1995. International and donor agencies also participated in this symposium. The
underlying objective for all efforts has been to improve the utilization of ORS in the community,
educate mothers on home management and to reduce the deaths caused not only by diarrhoeal
dehydration but also those caused by associated malnutrition.



Appendix B
Page 6 of 11
12.   Control of Acute Respiratory Infections. The ARI Control Programme was taken up as a
pilot project in 14 districts of the country in 1990. Ten more districts were added in 1991. Since
1992-93, the programme is being implemented as a part of the CSSM programme. The
diagnostic criteria and treatment schedules have been incorporated in the training material for the
medical officers and paramedical workers. Peripheral health workers are expected to diagnose
the cases of pneumonia and initiate treatment of uncomplicated cases. For this the anti-bacterial
cotrimoxazole was supplied to all health workers as a part of the drug kit A.
13.   Feedback from the field suggests that while the workers are now quite aware of the
diagnostic and management protocol, they are diffident in initiating therapy. A doubt as regards
the quality/management of cases is not of optimal quality. This may be a reflection on the
training which was imparted under the programme. The training lacked hands-on clinical
experience which may account for the fact that health workers are diffident in managing cases of
pneumonia in the field. Another reason could be the inaccessibility to our health workers at odd
hours of the day and on holidays. To cater to this scenario, discussions have been initiated with
the Department of Women and Child Development to enable the anganwadi workers, who are
present in the community throughout the day, to diagnose and initiate treatment of cases of
pneumonia.
14.   Essential Newborn Care. Essential care of the newborn was introduced as an intervention
under the CSSM  Programme.  Resuscitation of neonates, prevention of infection and
hypothermia and introduction of principles of exclusive breastfeeding were identified as prime
intervention for reduction for perinatal and neonatal mortality. Training modules for medical
officers and para-medical workers incorporate these issues. Since June 1993, an integrated
clinical skills course on newborn care and the management of acute respiratory infections and
diarrhoea has been started under the CSSM Programme for physicians working at district and
sub-district level hospitals. The training includes care of the sick newborn. Practical sessions on
resuscitation are held with the use of mannequins.
15.   A project with the collaboration of the National Neonatology Forum was undertaken in
1994 wherein simple equipment which was produced indigenously was supplied to sub-centres,
primary health centres and First Referral Units in 26 districts was initiated. Specialists from
National Neonatology Forum were involved in training staff and operationalizing the equipment.
Initial feedback from the districts shows that equipment supplied is being utilized and the
resuscitation rates of asphyxiated babies, and over all practices for the care of the newborn have
been institutionalized.
16.   Vitamin A Prophylaxis. The Vitamin A Prophylaxis Programme was continued as an
intervention under the CSSM programme. The objective of the intervention was to prevent the
Vitamin A deficiency associated with blindness under five years of age. Recognizing the
importance of Vitamin A in preventing morbidity and mortality in children, the scope of the
intervention has been enlarged to encompass the wider issues.



Appcndix B
Page 7 of 11
17.   Nutritional Issues. While the specific intervention under the programme focused only on
Vitamin A Prophylaxis, the wider issue of improving the nutritional status of infants and children
received due importance in the programme.
18.   Promotion of exclusive breastfeeding and appropriate weaning practices was introduced
although it was not envisaged earlier as an input under the programme. The Baby Friendly
Hospital Initiative has been firmly established in the country and till date over 900 hospitals have
become "Baby Friendly". A single sheeter on exclusive breastfeeding was published and
disseminated all over the country right down to the sub-entre level. An issue of the CSSM
Review Newsletter was devoted to exclusive breastfeeding and weaning practices. The revised
version of training materials have incorporated technical details of nutritional issues in detail.
19.   Considerable achievement has been recorded in the field of reduction of infant and child
(0-4) mortality. While the Infant Mortality Rate has been brought down to 74/1000 live births in
1'95, the Child Mortality Rate in 1993 was 23.7/1000. The comparative figures for IMR and
CMR for 1991 were 80 and 28.7 respectively. This drop in mortality rate implies that
interventions in 1993 were able to prevent the lives of over 3,15,000 children under five years of
age.

The Crude Birth Rate declined from 29.5/1000 population (1991) to 28.7 (1993) and is
required to be further reduced to 21 by 2000 AD. Likewise the Crude Death Rate has shown a
decline from 9.8/1000 (1991) to 9.3 (1993) and should drop down to 9 by 2000 AD. Similarly,
the life expectancy (at birth) of 58.1 year for females and 57.7 years for males during 1992-93
has enhanced during 1995-96 to 61 years for females and 60 years for males as a result of CSSM
Programme implementation in the country.
Infrastructure at Sub-Centre and Village Level for CSSM
In India 588651 villages are served for health care through 132285 Sub-centres of 21802
Primary Health Centres and 2401 Community Health Centres, besides the district level referral
facilities. As on 31st December, 1995, the availability of ANM/MPW(F) , at sub-centres, is
shown in table below:
ANMIMPW (F)                Average                   LHV / HAF

The CSSM programnme prioritized the organization and training of Traditional Birth
Attendance (TBAs) for their better skills towards maternal and child health at the village level.
They are equipped with disposable delivery kits and a system of their convergence with ANM,
anganwadi workers as well as community has been planned and is being operationalized in the
country. The following is the position of TBAs up till December 1995 in the country.
