WDIA FOR A COILD SURYIVAL AND SANE 10T331100D PROJMCT
1.        The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed credit to
India Is submitted for approval. The credit, for SDR 160.9 million (US$214.5
million equivalent), would be on standard IDA terms with 35 years maturity. The
credit would help finance a national Child Survival and Safe Motherhood Project.
The proceeds of the credit to be used by the States and Union Territories would
be passed to them as a budgetary allocation in the form of a grant.
2.       T^ekaroud   The Indian Family Welfare Program was established in 1951
to provide family planning (FP) and maternal and child health (MCH) services,
and is one of the most extensive program of its type in the world. The program
has contributed to reducing: the infant mortality rate from about 135 per 1,000
live births in the early 1970s to about 93 in 1989; the maternal mortality rate
from about 500 per 100,000 live births in the 19708 to about 400 in 1988; and
fertility from a total fertility rate of almost 6.0 in the 19609 to about 3.9 in
1988. Despite this progress, infant, young child and maternal mortality remain
unacceptably high.
3.       There are several factors contributing to high mortality rates among
young children. First, there is pre-maturity and low birth weight in at least
301 of all births. Second, children are exposed at high rates to unfavorable
environmental conditions and endemic and communicable diseases such as tetanus,
measles, respiratory infections, malaria and diarrhoea. In fact, the 600,000
deaths per year from acute respiratory infections in India account for more than
a quarter of all such deaths in the world. Over a third of deaths in the world
from dehydration due to diarrhoeal diseases (1,500,000 per year) are also in
India. Third, malnutrition iP the major underlying cause of death in 30-502 of
the 0-5 years age group and over 40,000 children become blind every year due to
Vitamin A deficiency.
4.       India also accounts for 251 of the total maternal deaths in the world.
The major immediate causes of maternal deaths are bleeding, puerperal sepsis,
eclampsia, abortions and obstructed labor. The maternal mortality rate in India
is unacceptably high, about 400 per 100,000 live births a year, with wide inter-
State variations, and compares with 280 per 100,000 live births for the world as
a whole and 80 per 100,000 live births in Sri Lanka. There are more than 25
million births a year in India, and around 30-402 of these are high-risk
pregnancies, dangerous to both mother and child. Between 100,000 and 150,000
4      women are estimated to die each year, while over 1.6 million women suffer
morbidity of varying degrees. Early marriage, early and frequent child bearing
and short-spaced pregnancies contribute to risk. These are aggravated by over-
work, malnutrition, low levels of female literacy, and lack of access to health
facilities. If India's maternal mortality ratio and total fertility rate were
on par with the developed countries, there would be only 2,000 maternal deaths
each year.
5.       There is broad consensus on four issues that point to why the Family
Welfare Program's achievements have not been more rapid and extensive. First,
maternal mortality and morbidity will remain at high levels unless there is
prompt and adequate medical care for women who develop obstetric complications.
Second, the quantity and quality of maternal and child health care services are



far below desired levels. Third, the rapid expansion in infrastructure for
family welfare services has not been accompanied by commensurate strengthening
in the support systems necessary to ensure efficient and effective use of these
resources. Fourth, awareness is low in the coammunity in general, and among
pregnant and lactating women in particular, of the need for effective maternal
health care, Including ante-natal check ups, improved nutrition, temporary
ethods of family planning, and the benefits of child spacing. From infancy
until death, females have limited access to health services.
6.       In 1983, the Government of India (GOI) established a National Health
Policy in the context of 'Health for All by 2000 A.D.' Program targets are:
(a) reduction of maternal mortality to below 200 per 100,000 live births;
(b) reduction to 0l or less, in the proportion of babies weighing less than
2,500 grams at birth; and (c) reduction in the infant mortality rate from 93 to
50 per 1,000 live births. By the end of 1990, the Universal Immunization
Program (UIP) which is supported by UNICEF, had achieved average coverage levels
of around 70S, but with significantly lower levels in selected districts in the
northern States of Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan. There-
fore, while many of these goals are ambitious and may not be fully achievable by
2000, substantial progress has already been made in im=nwization and with some
reorientation of program design, implementation and financing, most other
targets could be approached by 2000.
7.       The end of the Seventh Pive-Year Plan period (1989/90) coincided with
the advent of severe budgetary pressures in India, and this was aggravated by
the Gulf Crisis. The result is that expenditures on MCH services declined
significantly In 1990-91.  The 001 is now trying to restore expenditures on MCH
services to the levels achieved previously. The National Maternal and Child
Health Plan for the 1991-95 period calls for the Implementation of an integrated
package of services to improve both maternal and child survival and to deliver
these services In a more efficient and effective manuer within the constraints
of potentially major cuts in public expenditures. The strategy is to use the
experience of the Universal Immunization Program (UIP) to implement a UIP *Plus'
package of services combining immunization with other basic MCI interventions.
8.      Egm  rience in Previous and O29OnA9  Proiects.  IDA has supported the
main element of GOX's family welfare strategy: a concentration of service
delivery in rural areas and backward districts based on the Model Plan or Area
Projects Scheme. Since 1973, IDA has financed three nutrition and seven popula-
tion (family welfare) projects for a total of US$700 million. From our involve-
ment with these projects, we have learned that most maternal and child health
services have tended to focus on children and not addressed adequately the
causes of maternal mortality. Even where MCN services are in place, they have
not opersted with adequate effectiveness. We have also learned thats the demand
for family welfare is Inextricably linked to the economic and educational status
of women; assistance should focus on the natinal program, as well as its
execution at the State level; worker knowledge and productivity remain unaccept-
ably low and need to be treated in a systemic manner if service quality is to be
improved; and the program needs to shift increasingly toward disadvantaged
areas, low parity couples, and maternal and child health. The further lessons
learned from the completed projects are that: improving the quality and manage-
ment of family welfare facilities is a critical factor in influencing the demand
for services; detailed attention must be paid at the design stage to ensuring
field workers' jobs are manageable, their daily and monthly work routines are



clearly defined, sad they are continuously trained and updated on-the-job to
perform better the limited tasks they are assigned analysis of local
demographic characteristics is a prerequisite to developing realistic targete
and services; and the participation of local communities, the private sector and
other non-governmental organisations must be encouraged if efforts to extend the
program are to be successful.
9.       A number of lessons have also been learned from the execution of the
Universal Immunization Program (UIP) from 1985-89. These include the importance
oft developing and maintaintig the logistics and cold-chain systems, training
workers to undertake specific tasks, widespread use of information, education
and comnunications (ISC) and other demand generation activities, and the use of
coverage evaluation surveys to identify gaps in service delivery and determine
areas of required concentration. The proposed project incorporates, to the
extent possible, all of these lessons in "ays described in Annex 11, Section 2
of the Staff Appraisal Report. The design of the project also takes account of
recent research findings on Vitamin A and on iron supplementation.
10.      Rationale for IDA DIaolvemt.  There are several reasons for IDA to be
involved with this project. First, the project is a critical part of IDA's
strategy of supporting human capital development and poverty alleviation in
India. Second, It provides IDA with the opportunity to extend rapid but and
targeted assistance to poor women and children, who are at risk of falling
through the social safety net during a period of severe budgetary constraints on
publicly-financed social programs. Third, the project supports a revamped
maternal and child health program which takes Into account equally the issues of
maternal and child mortality and morbidity, overcoming a previous program bias
whlch focused on children to the detriment of mothers. Fourth, the project is
based on experience In implementing a national immunization program and on
recent research findiugs. Fifth, the project includes several areas where the
private secvpr, non-governmental and private voluntary organizations (NGOs/PVOs)
and local eovmunities will play a major role In service delivery, such as social
marketing of oral rehydration salts (ORB) and contracept'!es, the design and
implementation of information, educatLon and communication (IEC) activities and
of training programs. Finally, the project represents the first large-scale
cooperation between IDA and UNICIF In India and gives IDA the chance to work
closely with an organization whlch already has extensive contacts with the
medical coimunity and a wide network of offices and personnel In India. This
will enhance policy dialogue and project supervision, as well as overall program
evaluation.
11.      Prolect Ob ectives.  The broad aim of the project is to assist the GO0
in financing the incremental costs associated with the expansion and enhancement
of the national maternal and child health program. It would help tot (a)
sustain the Universal Immunization Program at least at levels attained at the
end of the Seventh Five-Year Plan (1989), as well as to expand coverage to
underserved areas and beneficiaries and build on the experience gained In
Implementing UIP; (b) expand coverage and improve the quality and efficiency of
lmplementing a number of prophylaxis lnterventions; and (c) assist 001 to launch
a major Safe Motherhood initiative.
12.      Prolect Descrietiom.  The project would be national in scope, but some
of the interventions, specifically those for UVP tPlus* and Safe Motherhood,
will be started In a limited number of districts, which were selected because of
high maternal mortality rates. The project would: enhance child survival;



- 4 -
reduce maternal mortality and morbidity; and increase the effectiveness of
service delivery. Child Survival Proarams would be called UIP Plus* and would
Includes sustaining and developing the Universal Iummuisation Program (UIP), as
well as strengthening diarrhoea control programs, control of acute respiratory
Infections (ARI), prophylaxis against blindness and eye lesions due to Vitamin A
deficiency, p_ophylazis against anemia, enhanced newborn care and the active
promotion of breast feeding. The Safe Motherhood initiative would include
improved maternity care and preventive care programs for all wamen, enhanced
empbhsis on pregnant women with high-risk factors, strengthening essential
obstetric care and capabilities to treat obstetric complications. while concur-
rently promoting birth spacing, timing, post-partum counselling, and p-ophylaxis
and control of nutritional anaemia. Service delivery would be Improved by
strengthening Institutional Systems. This would Include improving and expanding
on-going training programs, expanding commmnications and information dissemina-
tion activities with the active participation of women and other community
groups. and strengthening existing State/district management information,
supervision, planning, procurement, logistics and maintenance systems. These
activities would constitute enhancements and expansion of the national Maternal
and Child Health program beyond what were provided during the Seventh Five-Year
Plan. The project would finances the construction and equipping of health
facilities, essential drugs, vaccines, medicines, medical supplies and vitamins
for MCH programs; the training of over 2.8 million health workers; vehicles,
reporting fees for traditional birth attendants (TBAs), consultant services for
the development and implementation of IEC, management information systems (MIS),
procurement, and social marketingg the salaries of incremental staff; and
operation and maintenance costs for vehicles and the cold-chain.
13.      The total cost of the national MCH program for the 1991-95 period is
estimated at US$922.6 million. The total project cost is estimated at US$329.6
million. This cost represents the Incremental costs between the proposed
outlays on the national MCI program 1991-1995 and the actual expenditures on
that program from 1985-1990. In calculating that increment, ongoing liabilities
for salaries, the cost of the Medical Termination of Pregnancy program, as well
as the costs of customs duties and taxes have been excluded. IDA and UNICEF
would co-finance the project in parallel. The proposed IDA credit of US$214.5
million equivalent and a UNICEF Grant of US$67.8 million would together cover
about 90S of costs, net of taxes, including all foreign costs and about 83Z of
the local costs. GOI would finance the remaining US$47.3 million of project
costs and all taxes and duties, equal to US$15.9 million. Together UNICFF and
IDA financing represent about 312 of the proposed 1991-95 allocation for the MCH
program. A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A.
Retroactive financing of up to US$21.0 million would be provided for eligible
expenditures made after November 30, 1990. Amoun&s and methods of procurement
and of disbursements and the disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B. A
timetable of key processing events and the Status of Bank Group Operations in
India are given in Schedules C and D. The Staff Appraisal Report, No. 9489-IN
dated August 27, 1991 is being distributed separately.
14.      Part of the proposed project will be carried out in the State of Jammu
and Kashmir, which includes areas over which India and Pakistan have been in
dispute since 1947. In making the proposed credit to India, IDA does not intend
to prejudice the final determination of the claims of the parties involved.



15.      Acton. Lareed.  During negotiations, the Government provided
assurances that it shalls (a) by January 31 of each year commuencing In 1992,
agree with the Association on the annual Plan budget allocation to the MCI
program for the next fiscal year; (b) by January 31 of each year comencing in
1992, prepare and furnish to the Association for review and coment, an Annual
Plan for the U1P, UMP Plus,' and Safe Motherhood programs; (c) in consultation
with the Association, establish by April 1, 1992, National and Regional Materni-
ty Mortality Review Committees; (d) by January 1, 1992, institute on a national
basis, distribution of tasks and work routine changes for health workers as
agreed with the Association; (e) institute by January 1, 1992, project coordina-
tion mechanisms with the Women and Child Department, and utilixe throughout the
project period key Indicators for measuring project progress as agreed with the
Association; and (f) furnish to the Association a Letter of Undertaking from
each participating State or Union Territory as a condition of disbursement for
expenditures incurred by that State or Union Territory. The fulfillment of the
conditions precedent to the effectiveness of the UNICEF agreement will be a
condition of effectiveness of the Credit.
16.      Project Benefits.   The proposed project would have several immediate
benefits. First, In the absence of sustaining the Immunization program, another
250,000 children would die from tetanus, 500,000 would die from measles and
170,000 would risk paralysis each year due to poliomyelitis. Second, the pro-
ject would assist in sustaining and developing MCH services during a period when
the scale of publicly financed social services could be severely and negatively
Impacted by C0X budgetary constraints. Third, the project would contribute to a
001 review of its current national MCH policie# and to appropriate adjustments
In terms of content, targeting and delivery. Fourth, the project period allows
001 the time and opportunity to undertake vigorous trials at the district level
of the UIP 'Plus* and Safe Motherhood models which are being developed. The
ultimate long-term benefit of the project is that it would help to develop a
more efficient and effective national family welfare program which would lead to
significant reductions of maternal, infant and young child morbidity, mortality,
and disability, *hereby elhancing the quality of life and India's human capital.
Over the projec, period, it is estimated that about 115 million lower-income
women and about 190 mlllion children in rural areas and urban slums would
benefit from this project.
17.      ProJect Risks. There are some important risks to the project.  It will
be difficult to increase the number of activities to be undertaken at the point
of service delivery as well as change the way health workers and supervisors
perform their tasks. However, ongoing IDA support to five Population Projects
is assisting In the development of regular on-the-job training and improved
supervision of workers. In addition, the proposed project will support the
implementation of improved job descriptions and work routines for health workers
and supervisors. The large-scale cooperation between IDA and UNICEF will also
assist In reducing the constraints to successful project implementation. UNICEF
has extensive contacts with the medical conmmity in India and a wide network of
offices In the States. This should assist ;n project monitoring, supervision
and evaluation.   There are also risks associated with the Safe Motherhood Pro-
gram. The project would include activities to increase awareness and action
through Panchayats and Women's Groups, Including Mahilla Mmndals and Private
Voluntary Organizations. Moreover, IEC programs vould be designed to specifi-
cally address some local customs which are dangerous to wamen's survival. Also,
local communities, through their representatives and/or with the assistance of



-6-
PVCO, would be mobilized as an integral part of the planning for Safe Motherhood
In that eciunity.
18.      Reeomm  atia.  I am satisfied that the proposed credit will comply
With tie Articles of Agreement of the Association, and recoumend that the
xecutive Directors approve the proposed credit.
