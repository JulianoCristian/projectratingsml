program for the 1991-95 period. It will cover the\n            incremental costs associated with the program. It will be\n            national in scope, but with an emphasis on specific\n            districts where maternal and infant mortality rates are\n            higher than the national average. It will be co-financed by\n            UNICEF and take into account its experience in assisting the\n            Government of India in implementing the Universal\n            Immunization Program during the seventh five-year plan\n            (1985-90). Its specific objectives will be to enhance child\n            survival, prevent maternal mortality and morbidity, and\n            increase the effectiveness of service delivery. These\n            objectives will be achieved through supporting: (a) Child\n            Survival Programs; (b) Safe Motherhood Initiatives; and, (c)\n            Institutional Systems Development."}, "docdt": "1991-08-27T00:00:00Z"}
