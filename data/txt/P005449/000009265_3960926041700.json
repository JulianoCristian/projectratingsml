sector in\n            Morocco. Divided into five parts, it is intended to\n            introduce institutional improvements, cost recovery and long\n            term policy reforms that will strengthen the overall\n            development of the sector. First, it will promote the\n            creation and development of appropriate institutional,\n            financial, and technical structures to manage sewerage\n            services in major urban centers. Second, an extensive\n            rehabilitation program to prevent further deterioration of\n            the existing sewer systems p in the Greater Casablanca area\n            will be initiated. Third, additional facilities will be\n            built in order to cope with the increasing domestic and\n            industrial demand for sewerage and storm drainage. Fourth,\n            least cost alternatives for sewerage treatment and disposal\n            will be identified. Finally, effective operation and\n            maintenance of sewerage facilities and standardization in\n            the quality of design and implementation of sewerage\n            extension works will be provided."}, "docdt": "1987-05-06T00:00:00Z"}
