2) the local\n            and regional authorities should have been involved since the\n            beginning in making the major decisions, to ensure their\n            commitment and agreement on administrative and land use\n            approvals necessary to carry out the project; 3) more\n            realistic assumptions could have been made during the\n            appraisal stage if the sewerage master plan had been\n            available; 4) studies should anticipate potential\n            implementation problems; and 5) in selecting contractors and\n            suppliers, attention must be paid to their technical, human\n            and financial capacity to carry out the project."}, "docdt": "1997-12-10T00:00:00Z"}
