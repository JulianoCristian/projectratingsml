Iunicipality of Antananarivo
Amounta        SDR 23.0 million (US$ 30.5 million equivalent)
Termss         Standard IDA Terms
ProIect Ob1ectives
Th. overall objectives of the proposed project ore to
bmprove the living conditions of the low-income population
living in the low-lying areas of the city and la the
Antananarivo Plain, and to increase the productivity of the
industries and of the farms in the Plain.  To reach these
objectives, the specific objectives of the project are as
follows:
(a)  Provide a 100-year flood protection to th. suburba of
Antananarivo, as well as an efficient flood warning systems
<b)  Improve, rehatilltate and expand the drainage and severage
facilities to evacuate surface runoff and seuage from the
Plain under all condittone, developlng these fc%litAtes
consistently with, and in a manner fully compatible with
other urban, agricultural and flood protection
developmentsl
(c)  Rehabilitate the irrigation system of the Ikopa Right Bank
(3000 ha);
(d) Improve the performance of local governmente' revenues at
the regional level; and
(e) Strengthen the institutional framework for integrated and
controlled development of the Plain.
Pro loct Descriition
The proposed project vould include the folloving componorest
(a) Flood protection along the Ikopa River;
(b) Flood warning system;
(c) Drainage structures on the Plain;
(d)  Pumping station to evacuate vater from the Plain;
(e) Construction of an irrigation canal;



- V -
(f) Rehabilt.ation of irrigation systems;
(g) Rehabilitation ntd expansion of the severage system;
(h) Institution building, including privatisation of municipal
services; and
(1)  Studies, supervision, technical assistance and training.
Environment
The project vlll bave *' overall pê3itive environmeltai impact.
It vould atm primarily et arresting degradation of the unstable, nearly
deforested ferralitic solls of the tan.ty over an arga of 16,200 ha in tbe
Antananarivo Region.
lenefits
As a result of the deterioration of urban infrastructure ln
Antansnarivo, there existe a strong economic justificatton for cll
components of the project. The project vill improve the living condition#%
of the poorest population of the city and of the suburbs, and vill permit a
cohorent development of th$s Plain vh$ch is adjacent to the city center.
The main riaka faced by the prjoject are those derived from the
economic situation cf the country, since the capacity of the population,
particularly the urban poor, to p-y for Lmproved services depende on the
économic enviroument. This rabk la minimized by the signe of economie
recovery vhich appeared in 1988. Other risks are related to th. capacity
to manage the Project. This however ts minimised through project design by
privatising part of municipal activities (severage and solid vaste), having
one coordinating agency for the flood control systen and adequate technical
assistance.
Prolect cost
The total cost of the project $s estimated at FMg 129.8 billion
(US$ 68.6 million), of vhich US$ 39.1 million, or approximately 572
represents the foreign exchange component.

ANTANANARIVO PLAIN DEVELOPHMNT PROJECT
I  BACKGROUND AND PROJECT AREA
Population
1.01      Madagascar's population vas 11.3 million in 1Q88 and the average
population growth rate vas estUiated at 2.8% p.a. ln the early 1980's. This
population le unevenly distributed vith a high concentration in the central
highlands. In 1960, the urban population reprosented oaly 112 of the
country's population, however, by 1988, this proportion increased to 182.
At present, Central Antananarivo (Antananarivo Renivohitra) only has 800,000
Luhabitants, but in total 1.5 million inhabit Antananarivo's economrc
influence area. In the project area, the distinction between urban sad rural
populations is administrative and virtually meaningless. Urban and rural
settlements are interconnected, as moet farmers have clos. ties with urban
life sad, in most rural households, the principal source of income la from
employment in the city.
ccOn=nilc Situation
1.02      Madagascar9s Gross National Product (GNP) per capita vas about US$
180 Ln 1988. Madagascar has experienced a long-term decline in per capita
production and income, videspread detericration of its physical sad social
infrastructure, and extreme scarcity of financial resources, compounded with
a heavy debt burden. Since 1982, the Government embarked on stabilisation
and structural adjustment policies supported by four IDA adjustment
operations. While significant progress has been achieved in restoring
macro-economic equilibrium, real GDP growth has remained belov population
grovth. Nonetheless, based on data sad information through June 1989,
there has been an evident economic recovéry from about mi,i-1988. Available
indicators suggest GDP growth in 1989 of at least 42, the first increase in
per capita income in two decades. It is a clear indication that, at long
last, economic recovery is underway.
1.03      Household surveys and national accounts show that average per
capita income has continuously declined over the last two decades at an
average rate of 32 per year and that urban areas have been more severely
affected than rural areas. The situation is vorse in the Antananarivo
metropolitan area, where it is estimated that the per capita expenditure
decreased at an average rate cf 82 per year over 1978-1985. A revival of
the dynamism of Antananarivo's economy requires not only an improvement in
the macroeconomic enviroument sought after in the ongoing adjustment
process, but also an enabling envirornent which necessarily involves the
resumption of private investment vithin a well-defined strategy of expansion
and organization of the urbanized area, modernization of agriculture La the
hinterland of Antananarivo, and intensification of urban-rural exchanges, as
vell as the mastering of periodic flooding.

1.04      Th. cily of Antananarivo vas originally bullt on hills located at
the eastern border of the Plain of Antananarivo (seo map IBRD No.21918).
The flat are, (about 180 Km2) et the foot of the hills la a floodplain for
the Ikopa River and its tributariesa  the Mamba, the Sisaony and the
Andromba. The Antananarivo Pl-an han an altitude of approximately 1,250 m.
The annual average precipitation ls 1,500mm and the rainy season extendt
from November to March. The mean annual temperature ls 18 degroes Celsius.
This plain la subject to serious periodic flooding vhich occurred repeatedly
In 1954, 1959, 1977 and 1982. In the city, these floode diarupt normal
economuc activities and, on the plain, they demolish houses and other
structures, destroy the rlce crops and may cause los of human l.fe.
Aaricultur
1 05      Out of a total cultivated area of roughly three million ha La the
country, 1.2 million ha are uaed for paddy. Irrigation syste_ serve about
720,M00 ha, nearly all of lt to produce paddy, of which 500,000 ha of
traditional schemes vith some form of vater control. The remaning 220,000
ha consist of 80,000 ha of large projecta which have been recently
rehabilitated, and around 140,000 ha of some 300 small projecta, of which
about 10 ,000 ha have recently beon rehabilitated. At prosent, the key Issue
Ln this subsector iL the deterioration of irrigation infrastructure due to
tne lack of budget funds and foreigu exchange for inputs and equipment,
togethor vith inadequato management. Although the traditional paddy fields
have fewer problems, their yields hav" dropped because of reduced supply of
Inputs, and negative price and market incentives.
1.06      Paddy production in Madagascar, vhich grew 52 per year in the
1960. and increased from 1.2 million tons in 1960 to almost 2.2 million tons
ln 1970, did not grov thereafter, In spite of the growth of population and
the labor force.  Hadagascar, a net exporter of rice until the early 1970.,
thereafter imported increasing quantities, reaching a p.ak of 350,000 tons
In 1982, over 20Z of total consiumption. S_nco then, reduced rice importe
reflect changed policy but aise an overvhelming foreign exchange shortages
183,000 tons vere imported in 1983, 110,000 tons in 1984, 200,000 tons in
1986 and 112,000 tons in 1989.
1.07      Although most of the Plain is lov-lying and subject to frequent
flooding, it ls one of the oldest rice-producing areas in Madagascar, and
rice in groen in virtually every possible area of the Plain. (ut of a total
of 18,000 ha, the area for rice i estimated at about 13,100 ha, 4,000 ha at
most being currently unused because of drainage problems. taras are sialls
about 0.5 ha on the left bank and 0.80 ha on the right bank, vith an average
of 0.6 ha, vhile 1.2 ha vould b. ne.ded for family self-sufficiency, under
present irrigation conditions. Farms als are highly fragmenteds 10/15 plots
per family is not uncomon. Production methods on the Plain are reportedly
among th. most sophisticated La Madagascar, vith most farnmers using
fortilizer and proper cultivation techniques, and vith ready availability of
inputs and credit. Hovever, because    improper irrigation, flood protection
and drainage systems, current paddy yields vary from 1.4 to 3.0 tons per ha



3-
(1.9 ton/ha on average), according to hydrological and ramEfall condltions.
Two variettes of paddy are commonly usedt Ovary vakiembiaty" during the
rainy season, from October to April, and "vary alohaU ln the dry season.
1.08      Research  as undertaken from 1966 onwards on optimal farming
systeus for th& Plain. It appears that double cropping of rice 18
problematie, because the temperature La too low for rice from April to June.
However, double cropping of rice vith vegetables or cereals such as wheat or
maize offers good potential. After the rainy season, cultivation of vheat
and vegetables, called n off-season ', has increased rapidly dvsring recent
years on selected soils vith good wator retention and a shallow vater table.
The extension service in the Plain is probably st present one of the most
intensive ones in Madagascar, but it could no doubt still be improved.
Research on new varieties and nev farming system has given excellent
results, since the farmers of the Plain are relatively receptive to
extension advice and to improvements ln supply of inputs and credit.
1.09      Major flood control and drainage vorks offer good potential for
increasing agricultural production by avoiding losses of crope due to floods
or rains, bmproving vater control in existing rice areas and bringing new
marshy lande under cultivation <about 205 ha). The increase in production,
brought about by flood protection sad rehabilitation of irrigation and
drainage systema, la estimated at 600 kg of paddy per ha, at least. In
addition, measures to lmprove farming patterns could Lucrease production by
as much as 2.0 tons per ha (1.3 ton/ha on average). An Agrieultural
Extension Pilot Project us appraised by IDA in Auguat 1989 and vould cover
th. Aitananarivo Plain.
Urbaa Develovoent
1.10      Vith the grovth of the Antananarivo city and suburbe at about 4X a
year, and despite regulations against it, the southern part of the low-lying
floodplain has been increasingly developed, most of the tlme with low-
standard dwellings lacking modern infrastructure. A recant anrvey shows that
about 135,000 people live La the Plain, between the hille and the Ikopa
River, South of the 67ha (see Hop IBRD No 21918), about 53,000 in Isotry and
82,000 in the Southern part of the Plain.  Stuce 1982, the population growth
has been 3.12 to 3.42. Due to financial constraints, this development has
been roalised more by crovding into the existing dwellings (600 inhabitants
per ha) than by construction of new housings from 1983 teo 1988, the
construction growth msu on_y 12 per year.
1.11      In 1920, when the railvay vas completed, the low-lying area
between the Zoma Market and the station vas filled ln sad developed for
housing and services, according to a coherent plan. Nothing vas done for
industrial activities which developed anarchically in the Plain along the
existing roads. The 1954 Urban Master Plan, prepared by Messrs. Dorian and
Rasafandriamihango, proposed to fill in the Plain betveen the hills and a
beltway designed in the middle of the Plain. This master plan vas approved
but not systematically implemented, probably because the coet of filling (1
to 2m) seemed high. Nevertheless, after the disastrous flood of 1959,the
Societe Immobiliere de Madagascar (SIM) carried out a housing program in



-4-
Ampefiloha, near Lake Anosy, a8 part of a systematic development of the
Plain. Another urban operation vas carried out vith 67 ha, filling in the
Plain to an elevation of 1249.20 meters above sea level. This level vas
calculated to avoid submersion by rainvater falling vithin the dikes, but
did not assure protection against flooding due to breaches of the dikes.
1.12      Another Urban Master Plan vas elaborated ln 1974, but i_ vas not
approved or implemented. It was revised betwoen 1980 and 1982, with the holp
of the United Nations Development Program (UNDP). The latest master plan,
prepared by consultants AURA-Groupe Huit, proposed to prohibit aiy
construction on the Plain, considering a future development based on several
suburban centers. Since that, building licenses ln the Plain have been
systematically rejected, but this is not significant since building licenses
are requested for only 10 of the constructions.
1.13      Land registry vas implemented from 1936 to 1944, but Lt has not
been updated since then. Transfers of property are les. frequent than urban
growth vould lead one to believe.  This is due to the fact that more than
60S of households Ln the Plain are tenants and that properties are
maintained for generations in the same family, thus limiting these
transfers. Transfers are rarely registered at the land registry office, but
very often legalized at the 'FiraisanaO office (see para. 1.22). Since land
taxes cannot be based on the out-of-date land registry, fiscal services
periodically carry out surveys of built and non-built properties, presently
every three years.
Institutional Framevork
1.14      At present there is no central Govermemnt institution vith
sufficient authority and capacity to direct and manage development of the
Antananarivo Plain. Authority is fragmented, and the technical and
financial capacity of the various institutions is insufficient to deal vith
an lntegrated development of all the sectors Lnvolved ln the Antananarivo
Plain. Flood protection of the Plain scems to be the only common vorry of
the various institutions. At present, the institutions involved in or
affected by a flood protection project of the Antananarivo Plain, range from
various ministries through specializsd, state-owned enterprises to local
government units. The lmplementation of a flood protection project vould
have morne mpact on a great range of activities In all of these
Institutions. A quick review of these institutions followe below.
1.15      The overall coordinating body for development programs is the
Ministry of Economy and Planning (MEP). It reviews investment programs,
sets priorities and coordinates the $mplementation of the approved program.
HEP initiated and supervised several major preinvestment studies which had
an lmpact on several sectors.
1.16      The Ministry of Finance and Budget (MF) is responsible for the
financial aspects of development programs. The Ministry of Health oversees
hoalth aspects of any development vork. The Ministry of Industry, Energy and
Mines in responsible for developing vater supply policy, assessing vater
resources and providing general guidance to vater management undertakings.



1.17      The Ministry of Public Works (NTP) i8 responsible fort
(a)    urban development planning, design and construction of
drainage structures and construction supervision,
through the "Directorate of Architecture, Urban
Planning and Housing" (DAUH).
(b)    flood control, dike maintenance and public works
construction, through the uDirectorate of Public Works"
(DTP). In particular, DTP controls and operr in one
gate on the Antananarivo Plain.
1.18         The Directorate of National Meteorology of the Ministry of
Transport, Meteorology and Tourisi (NTMT) collects and manages hydrological
and meteorological data. The Directorate of Rural Infrastructure (DIR) of
the Ministry of Agriculture (MA) is responsible for irrigation and
agricultural drainage of the Antananarivo Plain.  It also controls and
operates the Tanjombato Dam and the Andriantany Canal (built at the end of
the l9th century for irrigation), and some of the flow control gates between
the irrigation channels and the rivera.
1.19         Two State-owned enterprises are involved in the secto-s
(a) JIRAMA (Jiro Sy Rano Malagasy - Power and Vater of
Madagascar) is responsible for construction and operation of
power and vater facilities, carries out all public utility
operations, and owns and operates all urban vater supply
systems. JIRAMA performs engineering studies and supervises
utility construction projects.
(b) SEIMAD (Housing Corporation of Madagascar) implements land
servicing and housing projecta. It performa studies,
supervises construction, manages development projecta, buys,
rents and sells real estate, and constructs and manages
housing projects.
L"cal Goveruments
1.20         Faritanv (province) of Antananarivo is comprised of 19
mnmicipalities (Fivondronana). The provincial branches and equipment of
each ministry are under the Faritany's authority.  The Faritany has the
responsibility of operating and maintaining publicly-owned structures on its
territory. However, financial and staff constraints serioualy limit the
Faritany's ability to assume responsibility for all structures in public
ownership.
1.21          Fivondronana (municipalities) differ in human resources and
organisation depending on the size of the municipality and its
organisational history. Recently-established municipalities have
Lnsufficient human resources and lack an appropriate organizational
structure. All municipalities lack sufficient financial resources. The



- 6 -
best equipped is Fivondronana Antananarivo-Renivohitra (FIVREN), the capital
city of Madagascar.
1.22         Firaisana (districts) keep records of the population (birtbs
and deaths), and are responsible for tax collection. FIVREN has six
Firaisana.
1.23         Fokontanv (nelghborhood-level-units) are the lowvst-level
political units. FIVREN has 189 Fokontany each having about 3,000 persons.
1.24         Administratively, the project area falls mainly vithin FIVREN.
Irrigation vorks to the North of the NMmba River are located vithin the
Fivondronana of Ambohidratrimo and Avaradrano. Some flood control vorks on
the loft bank of the Ikopa River lie vithin the Fivondronana of
Atsimandrano, the Firaisana of Soavina, Ampitatafika and Andranonahoatra.
Most of the project vorks are on the Firaisana of Ambohlmanarina, on a hill
emerging from the Plain. This Firaisana is included in FIVREN but has an
autonmous financial status.
Previous Bank Invol'rent
1.25         During the last decade, IDA, UNDP, the World Health
Organization (WHO) and the French Caisse Centrale de Coop&ration Economique
(CCCE) played significant roles in the urban development, vater
distribution, health and agriculture sectors. IDA was involved in the
Antananarivo Vater and Sanitation Project (Credit 1002-MAG, signed on May 8,
1980, for US$ 20.5 million). The project included extensions to water supply
systes and provision of maintenance equipment, rehabilitation and
extensions of severage and drainage systems, improvement to solid vaste
collection and disposal, and training for JIRAMA amd municipality staff. The
Credit vas closed on June 30, 1986, and the Project Completion Report vas
issued in July 1989.
1.26          On the vater supply side, JIRAMA implemented this component
efficiently and relatively on time. The project vas successful in addressing
deficiencies in water availability, tariff policy and financial management.
On the drainage and sanitation side, the bad performance of the local
consulting firms recruited, together vith the complexity of the Malagasy
procurement procedures, led to long delays which finally jeopardized the
entire component. Only some urgent vorks vere realized and seven million
dollars was cancelled on June 30, 1985. Nevertheless, the planned drainage
and sanitation component vill be reactivated, combined with flood control,
under the proposed project. The reviev of the existing studies, carried out
for its preparation, led to major revisions and better coordination between
the various components of the project.
1.27          In 1984, the Association approved the First Urban Project
(Credit 1497-MAG, signed on July 3, 1984, of US$ 12.8 million), for
Antananarivo and Toamasina. The project provided basic infrastructure,
particularly in Isotry and Anatihazo on the fringe of the Plain. The project
als addressed the municipalities' deficiencies by emproving financial



-7-
management and property tax administration. The project is being implemented
relativoly vell, albeit vich some delay.
1.28          During preparation of the Vater and Sanitation Projeet, the
Government requested including a flood control component in the project,
composed of several hydraulic works and an erosion control program ln the
catchments of the Ikopa River and its subsidiaries. Since these works vere
not supported by any fe.aibllity study, Ba-D  staff auggested that
consideration be given to the f:nancing of a global study hich vould first
review all the Ldeas and studies already done on this subject, and justify,
among several alternatives which hydraulic worka had to be constructed.
F£nally, it vas agreed at appraisal of the Vater and Sanitation Project that
this atudy vould not be included ln the project but vould be the subject of
a separate Technical Assistance Project, financed by an engineering credit
(Credit 1086-NAG, signed on October 1, 1981, of US$ 2.3 million).
Consultants SCET Agri-DINIKA carried out the studies and reviewod the
drainage studies already prepared under the Water and Sanitation Project.
The studies vere completed in November 1986 and the credit vas closed on
December 31, 1986. These studies are the basis of the proposed project.
1.29          The Forests Management sad Protection Project (Credit No 1878-
MAG, of SDR 5.1 million, signed on March 23, 1988), aima at preventing
further degradation of natural forests and promoting private sector
involvement ln reforestation sad wood processing. This project includes
16,200 ha in the Antananarivo Region and, therefore, yill have some Impact
Ln reducing the flooding from the Ikopa sad Mamba rivera.  The National
Agriculture Research Project, approved on June 15, 1989, vill help FOFIFA
develop nev strains of paddy, as vell as improved cultivation techniques. As
said above, an Agrieultural Extension Pilot Project vas appraised ln August
1989 and both projecta vould cover the Antananarivo Plain.

II. FLOOD CONTROL. DRAINAGE AND IRRIGATION
T btcenal Asiecte
2.01          Depending on the level of flood protection provided by the
various structures and the adequacy of their maintenance, the rivera have
inundated the floodplain at various intervals (in 1959 for example) and, at
other times rainvater falling vithin the protected area cannot be evacuated
and causes flooding (for example in 1982). Flood conditions are
particularly devastating on the Antananarivo Plain because the following
factors aggravate the flooding problems:
(a)    The Ikopa River is constrained in a stable rock bed at
Bevomanga, at the downstream end of the Plain, where
erosion cannot increase the gradient significantly.
This hampers evacuation of vater from the Plain;
(b)    The heavy silt load is filling up the river bed on the
Plain. The numerous islets, sand banks, vegetaticn in
the shallow waters and mmn-made structures are sl<itng
down the flow of vater on the Plaing
<c)    Lack of adequate maintenance also contributes to the
probleme. Repair of the dikes would reduce the riak of
breachesg
(d)    During the rainy season, gravitational flow of runoff
vater toward the river at Antananarivo is often
impossible, because the river bed La above the level of
the flood plain; and
(e)    Floode on the Plain can flush back sewage to the city,
creating hazardous sanitary conditions vithin low-lying
areas of the suburbe.
2.02          The flood protection problem cannot be solved without at the
ame time solving tLe problems ofs
(a)    improvement of the dikes protecting the plain;
(b)    retention and evacuation of the rainvater collected as
surface runoff from the catchments on the hills and
Plain;
(c)    evacuation of vaste vater and sevage from the city and
Plain;
(d)    regulation and management of the river vater for
irrigation purposes on the Plain; and
(e)    reforestation and soil conservation in the Ikopa River
watershed.

1istorv of Plooed nd Protective Measures
2.03            Major f loode devastated the Antananarivo Plain in 1954,
1959, 1974, 1977 sad 1982. In 1959, the dike on the right bank of the Ikopa
vas breached la several locations, 20S of the dvellinge of tho suburbe vere
flooded and destroyed and the Plain vas under 2 meters of vater for several
months.  The 1977 flood caused major damage to the badly maintained dikes.
In addition to breaches on the Ikopa dike, a dozon breaches vere opened on
the Siseony dikes and the Mamba dike vas breached at Laniera.  About 16,000
persons vere affected, large areas of the city vere flooded, and an
important part of the rice crop vas lost. In 1982, the fl_àd vas due to the
rainvater, collected on the hills and the Plain, vhich could not be
evacuated because of the flood level In the Ikopa River.
2.04          The firet recorded dlke construction dates from the 16th
century wven the objective vas to give some protection from frequent floode
to some cultivated lands.  In the 18th century, major systematic dike
constructions vas undertaken to protect the rice paddies on the Antananarivo
Plain, sad these dikes provided some protection until the 20th Century. The
Andriantany Canal vas built in the 19th century for the purpose of
irrigation and drainage of th. rice fields. Other canals and drainage vorks
vere cons ructed in 1914 and 1932. In 1927, a diversion dam vas constructed
at Tanjombato, to properly feed the Andriantany Canal. Folloving the 1959
flood, the Goverament decided to execute a multi-phase dike construction
program. Only the first phase of this program, consisting of a nev dike on
the Ikopa River, vas actually implemented. This dike vas completed ln 1964.
Although the prelUminary engineering vork for the second phase vas completed
in 1965, it has never been constructed.
2.05          Other flood protection measures in the 20th century have
included:
(a)    construction of two dams (Teiascmpaniry and Mantasoa)
to regulate floods at the upetream catchment of the
Ikopa drainage basin; sud
(b)    lovering of the river bed at Bevomanga and Tendro by
blastiug the rocks. lovever, a very amall part of the
huge undertaking required vas actually impl«emnted.
Although these measures helped to regulate river flove and accelerate the
discharges at Bevomanga and Tendro, they have fallen short of solving the
flood problem.
2.06          Institutionul probleus vere one of the main causes of the
flooding of the Antananarivo Plain in 1982. Some of the gates vere operated
by the Minustry of Public Works and others by the MNiistry of Agrieulture.
VWhen the Ministry of Public Works decided to close the gates as a preventive
measure against flooding, the Ministry of Agriculture still kept others open
for irrigation purposes. When ail gates vere finally closed, most of the
Plain vas under 2 meters of vater, and some of the suburbe wvre aleo
inundated.

Studles of Flod Control and Drainait
2.07          Many comyrehensive flood protection plans have been proposed
including the Carle Report (1914), the Coursia Project (1931), and the
Fontaine 'Plan (1957) but they have not been implemented. Folloving
completit of the dike in 1965, the Goverrment docided to stop impl.menting
the earlier multi-phase dike construction program. At that time, it becama
apparent thats
(a)    An integrated multi-sector approach to planning vas
required to optimize investments because the solutions
are inter-dependent; and
(b)    The nature, compatibility and feasibility of various
development plans vill depend on what protective
measures are adopted for flood control.
2.08          SOGREAH (France) vas selected in 1966 to prepare a feasibility
study. This study, completed in 1968, recommended construction of a series
of structures costing an est$mated FMg 13 billion to provide flood
protection to both urban and rural areas, to lmprove surface runoff and to
irrigate agricultural land. This program vas not implemented and the
detailed engineering vas not carried out.
2.09          The 1974 flood gave a new impetus to developing flood
protection measures. In the meantime, conditions had changed and earlier
studies could not be applied to these nev conditions. The population of the
Antananarivo area had doubled since the last dike construction in 1964. The
inrban expansion paralleling this population increase vas unplanned and
disorganized, and hundreds of dwellings had been constructed illegally on
lov-lying areas of the flood plain. This rapid expansion meant that even
the 1968 SOGREAE study had become somewhat outdated by 1975.
2.10          The study of the Plain of Antananarivo (para. 1.28), carried
out under a Technical Assistance Project (Credit 1086-MAG) aimed at defining
a technically coherent, economically justified and financially feasible
investment program for the Plain of Antananarivo. The study foeused on
flood protection and agricultural devt!-rment aspects.  In 1981, the DGP
(Direction Generale du Plan) contracted DINIKA (Madagascar)ISCET-Agri
(France) to carry out this preinvestment study. The DG? vith the technical
help of Mamokatra (Madagascar)iEuroconsult (Netherlands) supervised the
consultants' vork.  The final report vas completed in November 1986.
2.11          SCET/Dinika considered numerous development alternatives for
the Antananarivo Plain, c-mbining various levels of urban protection and
agrieultural development. The selected alternative has the folloving
general characteristicas
(a)    The right bank dike of the Ikopa will be rehabilitated
and raised to be able to contain a flood vith a
frequency of one in 100 years. This vill protect the
low lying areas of the city and the suburbs of



- il -
Antananarivo.  The diacharge of floode even more
poverf al than this vill b. directed through the flood
plain on the loft bank of the Ikopa River, whech te
aparsely populated, to the main river channel about S
or 10 km downstresm; and
(b)    The surface water from the hills and Plain, and the
vaste vater and sevage from the city vill be collected
in open channels and basins. This vill be carried
through the Plain to the northern corner of the
protected area of the plain.  Then the water vill be
carried by gravitational flow in an open channel on the
right bank of the Ikopa down to a point just downstream
of Bevomanga where it vill join the main river.
2.12          Under the Vater and Sanitation Project (Credit 1002-MAG), the
Ninistry of Public Works aise conducted studies which promoted the idea that
a pumping station should be installed in the northwest corner of the
protected area of the Plain.  This pumping station vould evacuate the
collected rain runoff and the vaste vater from the Plain through the
northern dike into a channel which vould carry it to the Mamba river. The
life-cycle cost and th, security of this technical solution has been
compared to the gravitational solution and the pumping station vas finally
found economically more justified than the gravity canal.

III. TUE PROJECT
3.01          In October 1984, lt vas proposed that the drainage vorks of
the Vater and Sanitation Project (Cr. 1002-MAG) together vith the Flood
Control project be implemented jointly under a project called Devolopment
Project of the Antananarivo Plain. The SCET Agri-DINIKA contract vas amended
to include the review of the drainage studies carried out under the Vater
and Sanitation Project. A preparation mission, lncluding representatives of
the French 'Caisse Centrale de Cooperation Economique" (CCCE), visited
Madagascar in January 1988 and recomended to carry out additional economie
and financial studies. The Government agreed and, since Credit 1086-MAG had
been closed on December 31, 1986, the Government requested a PPF on February
24, 1988. IDA approved this PPF by letter dated May 26, 1988, for a total
amount of US$ 650,000. An extension to US$ 1,100,000 vas granted on January
12, 1990.
3.02          The purpose of the PPF vas to finance studies almed at
updating and completing studies already carried outs
(a) Project cost. Cost estimates established in 1986 vere
updated.
(b) Alternatives. For the irrigation component, five
alternatives vert reviewed and evaluated. All vere rejected
because the savings vere negated by a lover level of service,
and this vas deemed unacceptable. For the irainage componont,
one alternative vas proposeds instead of duplicating the
Andriantany Canal, it vas proposed to enlarge the C3 canal
initially designed for the drainage of lov areas in order to
evacuate stormwater simultaneoualy from both urbanized and
non-urbanized areas (see map IBRD No.21918).
(c) Institutional study. The report issued in 1986 vas updated
and a statute vas proposed for the "Etablissement Public" to
be created for operation and maintenance of the flood control
sad dra'.uage facilities.
(d) Economie analysis. Internal rates of return vere
recalculated for every component and for the project as a
whole.
(e) Study of local finances. Its purpose vas to assess the
capacity of the local governments involved to contribute to
the cost of the project and to operation and maintenance.
(f) Urban-rural exchanges. Its purpose vas to assess the
financial capacity of the households of the region, and
particularly of the Plain.

(g) Urbanisation Structure Plan. The report reviewed how the
project would allow the urbanization in the southern part of
the Plain. In this ares, the report proposed to include ln the
project primary roado, retention ponds and drainage canals,
and explored the vartous instltutional, urban planning and
cost recovery issues involved.
Prolect Objectives
3.03          The overall objective of the proposed project ls to iuprove
the living conditions ef the low-income population living ln the low-lying
areas of the clty and in the Plain. Speciflc project objectives are (1) to
create an enabling environmont for the resumption of private lnvestment and
economic growth ln the Antananarivo metropolitan are; (Ili) to consolidate
the finauncial snd managerlal development of the municipalities, alr.ady
undortaken under the Firet Urban Project (Cr. 1497-MAO); (iii) to set up an
institutlonal framework for efficient operation and maintenance of the
structures and faclltles provided by the proposed project; sad (iv) to make
possible an lntegrated urban and agrieultural development on the
Antananarivo Plain.
3.04          To reach these goals, the physical objectives of the project
are as followss
(a)    Provide a 100-year flood protection tO the suburbs of
Antananarivo, as vell as an efficient flood warnlng
systema
(b)    Improve, rehabilitate and expand the drainage and
severage facilities to evacuate surface runoff and
sewage from the Plain under all conditions, developing
these facilities consistently with, and in a manner
fully compatible with other urban, agricultural and
flood protection developments;
(c)    Rehabilitate and expand the irrigation system of the
Ikopa Right Bank (3000 ha).

A detailed description of the project ls given in Annex 1.
Prolect Cost
3.06           The total cost of the project la *stimated at FM8 129.8
billion, US$ 68.6 million, of whlch US$ 39.1 million, or *pproximately 57S,
represents the foreign exchange componsnt. Base coat eattimtes are *xpressed
ln prices as of Decomber 1989. This cost inclutdes refinancing of the IDA
Project Proparation Facility (PPF) of US$ 6S0,000, which vas approved on May
26, 1988 for project preparation, snd it extension to US$ 1,100,000 which
vas approved on January 12, 1990. Coste of vork vert entimated on the basis
of final design& for flood control, irrigation sad drainage componunts.
Drainage canal C3, the urban sanitation component sad drainage of the South
Plain were estimated on the basts of prolmtinary design*. Since the
Government has determmued that good sund services procured under the project
vill be subject to taxation, the total cost includes customs duties snd
internal taxes amouating to US$ 10.2 million (15.0S). The full cost of land
acquisition for a total of 153 ha s tancluded as a Goverament counterpart

Price value, Dec. 1989.
3.07           Physical contingencies of 10 or 20 peccent have bean added to
base cost for components estiimated on the basis of final and prellminary
desigus respectiv.ly. No physical contingeucies have bean added to
consulting services and technical assistance. Pric. contingencies have been
added to base cost plus physical contingencles. Price contingencies for the
project cost presented in FHg are based on domestic inflation estimated at
92 par year. Price contingencias for the project cost expressed in US$ are
based on recent estimates of lnternational inflation as followss 7.2S in
1989 snd 1990, and 4.42 thereafter. The price contingencies were calculated
on the basis of the FM8 exchange rate boing adjusted to compensate for the
difference bet,..en domestic and international inflation.  The cost estimatas
total about US$ 2.4 million for techuical assistance, US$ 3.8 million for
consulting services, sd US$ 0.4 million for training.

3.15          To ensure prompt availability of funds for the project, IDA
and the Government vill oach make initial deposits. Assurances vere
obtained at negotiations that Government counterpart funds totalling FMg 1.0
billion, mainly to finance land acquisition, would be deposited in the
Project Adçance Accouant at the Central Bank, by thé date of the Credit
effectivenesa at the latest. Agreement vas reached that, at the beginning
of each year, the Project Advance Accouat vould be replenished up to the
amouant of FMg 2.0 billion. A separate Special Accouant (revolving fund) will
be established, in US$, ln a commercial bank with an initial deposit of US$
2.0 million.  The Special Account opening balance vas calculated as the
equivalent of three months of IDA disbursements from the proceeds of the
proposed Credit.

4.01          To ensure good coumnication between the institutions
involved, a Steering Committee viii be established to oversee project
implementation. It vill be composed of high level representatives of all
the institutions involveds Ministry of Economy and Planning (MEP), Ministry
of Public Works (MTP), Ministry of Interior, Ministry of Agriculture (HA),
Ministry of Finance (MF), Faritany of Antananarivo and Fivondronana of
Antananarivo-Renivohitra (FIVREN). This committee would be convened on a
regular basis, every three months for example, and vould be chaired by NEP.
4.02          General coordination of project implementation vill be the
responsibility of the Project Unit (BPPAs Bureau du Projet de la Plaine
d'Antananarivo), created in December 1987, under the authority of the
President of the Antananarivo Faritany (Province).   The role of the Proj3.ct
Unit is to efficiently prepare the project until Credit effectiveneso and,
aftervard, to coordinate project implementation. Under a Project Director,
BPPA is composed of five departmentss (i) administrative and financial; (iI)
land acquisition; (iii) urban sanitation; (iv) irrigation; and (v)
assistance to users' associations (of farmers).
4.03          The most urgent tasks of BPPA have beent  (a) to appoint a
firet nucleus of staff, both seconded from the ministries and directly
appointed, ajsisted by three technical adviserst a sanitation engineer, an
irrigation engineer and, later on, a specialist to help organise the
associations of irrigation usera (the latter two financed by the French
Cooperation); (b) to implement the large land acquisition/expropriation
program required by the project; and (c) to prepare the bidding process, no
that the major contracts could be signed soon after Credit effectiveness.
4.04          Most of the vorks financed by the Project are related to the
strengthening, rehabilitation or replacement of existing facilities built
for flood control, drainage and irrigation.  These existing facilities are
operated and maintained by s Ministry of Public Works for flood control
facilities, Ministry of Agriculture for irrigation and FIVREN for drainage.
The cost of operatlon and maintenance is covered by the budget of each
agency. During project tmplementation, these agencies vill keep the
responsibility for operation and maintenance of the existing facilit$es,
until a neo organization is put In place. Therefore, BPPA vill act on
behalf of these *gencies, for the execution of the vorks, according to
specific implementation agreements (see para.4.07 below).
4.05          Under the First Urban Project (Credit 1497-MAG), a project
unit (BPU, Bureau des Projets Urbains) vas created vithin the Ministry of
Public Works, to coordinate implementation of the project. It has nov a
good knowledge of urban management and urban problems in the Antananarivo
Region. Therefore, it is reasonable to keep it in operation and to use its
experience to implement some urban components of the proposed project which

(a)    emergency phase of urban sanitation between the railway
station and Isotry; and
(b)    dredging and enlarging the urban section of the
Andriantany Canal.

is based on the assumption that the IDA Credit vould be effective by the end
of 1990 and that land acquisition vould follow the proposed program

(para.4.10). The vorka could be started et the end of the rainy season,
March 1991, for the dikes, the pumping station and irrigation rehabilitation
(phases 0 and 1). The Andriantany Canal (dowvutream) and the drainage canal
(amen.e), the irrigation canal, irrigation rehabilitation (phase 2) and the
solld waste component vill b. started in March 1992, and the drainage canal
C3, urban sanitation and South Plain drainage in March 1993. Phases 3, 4
and 5 of irrigation rehabilitation vill b. started in March 1993, 1994 and
1995. Everything should be completed by mid 1996, and the closing date
would be June 30, 1997.
Land AcuuisitionlExaroriations
4.10          A prcgram of land acquisition, or expropriations, is necessary
to imploment the ;;oject. It represents 168.44 ha and a total cost of FMg
6,081.4 million, Lncluddng W1.g 600 million in ind.miitiea for houses bullt
on the dikes, which vill have teo be destroyed. A budget of FMg 700 million
bas already been made aveilable ln 1989. The progrme of land acquisition

Any delay in this program vould lead to the postponement of the components
affected.
4.11          The families (about 1,200) vho vould have to move are those
who have bullt houses on the dikes, mainly along the Mamba River and the
Andriantany Canal, most of them vithout any authorization. The Project vill
preparo platforme, protected from flooding, and vill grant to every family a
plot of land to rebuild their bouses. In addition, the fanilies vith a land
title vill receive an indemnity to rebuild their houses. This resettlement
plan vas discussed at appraisal and submitted to IDA before negotiations.



- 25 -
It vas deemed satisfactory, vith smoe minor modifications, agreed upon
during negotiations.
Studios
4.12          Soveral studies vill have to be carried out, ln order to have
aIl the components ready for $mplementation. Final design studies are
required for the urban sanitation componont (severage). They vill be
financed by an extension of the exasting PPF, from US$ 650,000 to 1,100,000.
Final design ts also required for the drainage canal C3. GCCE proposed at
appraisal to finance it through a Study Fund which is being put in place as
grant (FF.995,000). CCCE also proposed to finance through thls Study Fund
an urbanisation study for the Southern part of the Plain (MF.i,750,000), and
an Agriculture Dev.lopment Progrom for the Antananarivo Region (PF.500,000).
In addition, a solud waste study (USe 200,000) vill be carried out under the
project to optimise collection and treatmont, and to prepare their transfer
to a private company. During a pre-negotiation mission, a vat.rshed
mauagement study vas diseussed and agreed upon. This study viil follow the
verking paper alroady carried out (see the "Watershed Managemnt Plan' in
tih  Project File), and prepare a program of vhich the firet phase vould be
financed under PEl. A tsx burden study (about US$ 50,000) for the
Antananarivo area vill al8e be carried out under tne project.  Finally, an
amount of US$ 100,000 vill be made available for uwidentified studies.
Iustitutiol luildinx
4.13          One of the most impo tant objectives of the proposed project
is to strengthen the institutiona. framewsrk for integrated and controlled
development of the Antananarivo Plain, in all the sectors having an impact
on the living conditions of the populations fleod control, drainage,
irrigation, urban sanitation, solid vaste, land regltry, local taxation and
land development.  For that, the project vill help:
(a)    create a public entity (Si) 1/ to operate and maintain,
through a private firm, the flood control and drainage
facilities rehabilitated or constructed under the
project;
(b)    transfer to a private company (S2a) operation and
maintenance of the severage system ;
(c)    transfer to a private company (S2b), or companies,
collection and treatmont of solid vastes ;
1/ these appellations (Si, S2a, S2b, S2c sad S3) vere adopted early ln the
project preparation by consultants sad Malagaay authorities.



- 26 -
(d) create an autonomous department S2c(for example a "le5i
Autonome) vithin FIVREN to operate and maintain the
exiating urban drainage systes;
(e)    create a foderation of wsers' associations (S3) to
operate and maintain the irrigation systems
rehabllitated under the project; and
(f)    strengthen the following existing Lnstltut-on»s
(1) Meteorology Departmaent, responsible for operation
of the flood varning system to be put in place under
the project;
(il) Land Office (Direction du Patrimoine), reaponsible
for the land registry component; and
(iii) Land Tex Offïce, te iGprove the collection and
administration of the property tax in the Antananarivo
Region.
Flood Control and Draingt
4.14          Up to nov, flood control has been the responsibility of the
Public Works Ministry (MTP), through its regional department (SRPCE).
Drainage is the responsibility of FIVREN. However, the Andrienteay Canal te
oporated by thei Ministry of Agriculture, because up to nov lts main function
has been for irrigation. Studies and discussions vithin the authorities
involved concluded that a new Institution, called Si, should be La charge of
oporating and maintaining the flood protection dikes, the drainage system ln
the Plain, including the pumping station, as vell as the firet stretch
(about 7 km) of the main irrigation canal upatream of the irrigation area.
The Director General of this nev institution Si, receiving information from
the flood varaing system, vlll have sole responsibility for opening or
closing the main gates which control the flooding of the Plain, stopping
irrigation and starting the pumping station.
4.15          This institution Sl vould be a Decentralized Public
Corporation (Etablissement Public à Caractre. Administratif DicentraliJé,
EPA). Ita board vould be composed of representatives of all the
institutions involved. A management contract would be avarded to a private
company (contrat de gérance). This EPA should b. established by the and of
1992, ln order to taike the responsibility of the firet works upon
completion. Until then, the present institutions, MTP, MA and FIVREN vill
keep their present responsibilities, technically and financially.
Nevertheless, a decision on the financial resources, needed for operation
and maintenance of the flood control and drainage facilities, should be made
as soon as possible and vill be a condition of effectiveness of the IDA
Credit.



- 27 -
Irrimatio
4.16          At present, construction, operation and maintenance of
irrigation projecta vithin the Antananarivo Province are entrusted to the
eService Provincial de l'Infrastructure Ruralo' (SPIR) of MA. Under thé
proposed project, the associations of vater users vould establish a
federation of associations S3. This institution, aasisted by a supporting
unit (Cellule d'Appui), vill deal vith the oporation and maintenance of the
secondary and tertiary irrigation canals. This institutional set-up is in
conformity vith the present legisiation on small-scale irrigation projecta
(PPI).
4.17          Thereforù* the Tanjombato Dam, the second stretch of the main
irrigation canal and the irrigation syst.m vill remain, aus  t presant, under
the responsibility of MA. Ths is acceptable, provided thats
(1)   a formal agreement be signed betwe.n MA and S1 to assure
tihe de'ivory of guaranteed dilution discharges beoth for the
Andriantany and C3 Canais
(ii) the gates at the entrance and at the outlet of the Plain
be absolutely closed, upon formal and written order from the
manager of SI, in case of flood varningi
(iii) assurance be given that adequate irrigation vater rates
vould be raised to cover part of S3 expenses, and that an
adequate Goverrwent budget vould be allocated to cover
possible operational deficlts.
4.18          In addition, the irrigated areas should be protected against
urban development because the part of the Plain where irrigation vill be
rehabilitated is too low for urban development. Drainage vorks have been
dosigned to allow flooding on rice fields during three days, bocause the
crops can survive under 'rater for thls period, but thls would be
unacceptable for urban areas. Therefore, a decree protecting the irrigation
areas should be issued before Credit effectiveness.
Urban Sanitation
4.19          The project includes the rehablitation and expansion of the
soverage facilities, which are presently operated and maintained by FIVREN.
Due to a lack of funds, most of the vorks have not been maintained and are
nov out of service.  All parties agreed that nev lnstltutlonal arrangements
should b. established. It vas agreed at negotiations that the severage
system would be op-rated by a private company (S2a) under a 'contrat de
gerance", financed by a vater tax. It vas proposed that FIVREN and JIRAMA,
the national vater and electricity company, take an equîty participation in
S2a. This issue vas discussed at negotiations and signing of a contract
vith this private firm vill be a condition of disbursement of the IDA Credit
for thé amouats allocated to this component.

4.20          FIVREN te also responsible for the solid vaste collection end
disposai. Undet th. Antananarivo Water and Sanitation Project (Credit 1002-
MAG), 23 collection trucks wvre dol$vered, end a composting plant vas built.
Five trueks are *till in service and the plant is vorking relativoly well.
Last year, FIVREN r.eeived from the Japan Goverument, as a grant, 63 trucks
of 6 and 8 m3. Management of this huge oquipment is larg.ly beyond FIVREN's
capacity. Th. appraisal mission proposed to finance a solid vaste study
(son para.4.12) to optimize collection and treatment, snd to prepare their
transfer to one or tvo private companies (52b).  The Project includes the
rehabilitation and expansion of the composting plant, but signing of the
contracta vith private firma vould be a condition of diobursement of the IDA
Credit for this component.
4.21          Operatien and maintenance of the existtng urban dretnage
systea cannot be taken over by S2a because th. systeu in tn bad shapâ, due
to a lack of maintenance. TIVREN has decided ta croate a new institution
S2c, for exemple an autoavnous department wvthin PIVREN (Regie Autonome).
The appraisal mission proposed to *trengthen thts new institution, through
provision of equlpment and technicel assistance.  Studies are presently
carrted out to determine the staffing needa of FIVRES, taking lnto accouat
the privatization of municipal services.  As soon as they are completed,
FIVREN vill submit an action plan to IDA.
Flood Wartina Syst.
4.22          It has been agrQed that the Metoorology Department, of MTMT,
vould keep the responsibility for flood varning in th. Ikopa vatershed. NeW
equipment vill b. provided by the Project tO thls department, which yill
prepare the bid documents, BPPA being responsible for the btdding proces
itself.  Th. Project vill finance operation and maintenance.  An
Implementation agreement, deflning the respective responsibilities of each
agency (Meteorology and BPPA at the beginning), vould be signed before
Credit effectiveneus.
Land Reaistrr
4.23          An important component of the Envirosment Program (PE),
appraised in June 1989, is the establisbment of maps for 6.0 million ha
througiout the couatry, in priority zones for PE, and land registry for 2.2
million ha, but excluding urban areas. The cadastre of the Antananarivo
Plain vas establisied from 1936 to 1944, but has never been completely
updated, beause registry of changes is not mandatory. The proposed project
vill help update the cadastre in the city and the Plain, vith the equipment
supplied under PE, and vithin tie same lastitutional framework. That means
that physical operations vill be done by the National Geographic Department
(FTM), and all administrative tasks by the Land Office (Direction du
Patrimoine). If, for any reason, the arrangement under PE is not
ceonclusive, i.e. FT! not equipped under this program, the proposed project
vould procure maps and orthophotos necessary for cadastral surveys under
corpetitive bidding.  The program vill be completed in five years, from the
end of 1990 to tie beginning of 1996, under the responsibility 'f the
"Direction du Patrimoine" and the coordination of BPU and BPPA.  The land



_ 29 -
legislation sbould be monded to make mandatory the registry of any transfer
of the onersbip of land, prior to any diabursement for this componett.
LATR- - fTfie.
4.24          Improvement of the land rogistry vill lead to incr6ased
revenues for local governments only if the tax base and tex collection are
also improved.  Therefore, the proposed project vill strengthen the Land Tax
Office (Service de l'Iupet foncier) through technical  assistance and
*quipmnt. This vill be dons in 18 months, in 1991 and 1992. Bociuse of
Ito experience in this ares, SPU vill be responsible for this component,
with the coordination of BPPA.
Urbanisation of thé South Plaln
4 25          Although the development of tuls part of zhe Plain te not
included La the proposed project, the project vill technically allow ites
urbanization. la this are«, the project vlll finance storage basins,
drainage cavasl And primary roade. A preliminaery report vas prepared,
finsnced by the PPF, and an urbanieation study has been requested by MSP and
vill b. financed by CCCE, urnder the projeet. This study vill produce a
^aster plan for the development of the Plain sad the legislative framework
for its urbaniation. Tt vill be used for the preparation of the Second
Urbsn Projeet, under consideration for IDA financing.
4.26          Neasures to control th. urbanization of the South Plain vert
discussed *t negotiations and the submission of an official action plan vill
be a condition of disbursement of the IDA Credit for this component of the
project.
Uqaitorina. IeortLag sud SuDervision
4.27          BPPA vill be responsible for monitoring the progress of the
project toward its stated objectives. It vill prepare progreas reports cach
quarter that would briefly identify major problems sad recoraend solutions;
revi$e tha performance of the agenc$es involved; and maintain key indicators
of progresa in fulfil$ment of project goals. Reports of the last quarter of
each year vill contain information on the budgets of every agency involved
for the folloving year. It vill also include a statement that sufficient
couaterpart fund  bave bean included in the Flinance Law for that year.  In
addition, a Project Completion Report vould be prepared by BPPA, on the
basis of an otline mutually agreed upen, snd sent to IDA vithin six months
of the cloing date of the Credit.
4.28          IDA supervision of the project would require up to 100 weeks
of staff sud consultant t$me during the six-year implementation period.
This level of involvement vould be concentrated in the first three years,
after which some activities would vind doun and BPPA would have acquired
greater management experience.

V. FINANCIAL ANULYSIS
Introduction
5.01          Taking into account the national dimension of this large
project, the long term nature of the benefits it would generate and the
present economic situation of the country, it would be difficult to
lmplement a system of full cost-recovery of the investments. Therefore, it
la proposed that only operation, maintenance and renewal costs be recovered
by mobilizing local resources and user charges through local governments:
Faritany, Fivondronana Antananarivo-Renivohitra (FIVREN) and Firaisana of
the Antananarivo area.
5.02          Given the low monetary income of householda, Lt has also been
decided that the project would not raise local tax ratce or Implement new
tsxes, but would aim at improving the management and collection of the
existins tax system. The only exception would be the water tax, approved by
decre. ln 1983, but never implemented in Antananarivo (a water tax was
satisfactorJly iuplemented in 1988 in  o-amasina).
Local Finsce
5.03          The financial resources of the Fivondronana (Municipalities)
in Madagascar are not sufficient to cope with urban development. The total
budget of all urban fivondronana and firaisana in 1987 represents less than
12 of the national budget.  Local geverrments rely heavily on Central
Goverameut transfers whiih constitute more than 502 of their revenues.
Beasides structural imbalances that exist between central and local
allocations, local governments do not manage properly their tax base.
5.04          Revenues raised by local goveruments in the Antananarivo area
amount to about FMg 10.5 billion, of which 72Z for thé Faritany, 262 for
FIVREN end 22 for the Firaissna of Ambohimanarina (FA).  On the other hand,
current expenditures amount to about FMg 8.3 billion. The cumulative
surplus of about FMg 2 billion is not used by the Faritany.  Nevertheless,
services rendered by FIVREN are not adequate due to lack of sufficient
funds.  Financial situation of th. local governments, Faritany, FIVREN and
FA, from 1983 to 1988 snd projections from 1989 to 1997 are given in Annex
8.
5.05          The Faritany derives its revenues for 85S from the business
tax (taxe professionnelle) snd for 15S from the license duty on the sale of
aleoholic beverages, vehicles and slaughter taxes.  The main sources of
revenue for the Fivondronana and the Firaisana are detailed below.
Central Goverument TraDsfers
5.05          These transfers are based, in principle, on 82 of receipte
collected on importe and internal consumption items. Government transfers
represent over 50Z of FIVREN revenue. Hovever, these revenues are beyond
the control of local governments. They have varied ln volume and have been
Lrregularly transferred. Work has been done under the First Urban Project

to clarify the situation vith the Government who seems not to transfet the
totslity of what local SovernMents are entitled to raceive.  Ffforts in this
agea could raise substantially their revenues. The shortage in transfers
for FIVR>N te estimated at FMg 300 million for year 1988.
Pr@ortv TaU
S.06          Under this generic name are classified three different taxes
which are collected at the national level and transferred in totality to
local Oovernments. These resources are not accouated for In the Government
budgetary processs
(a)    Land Tax (Impôt Foncier sur les Terrains - IFT).  This tax
yields about FM8 13 million a ysar, which is abnormally low,
the reason being the use of 1965 criteria for evaluating the
tex baae. The atudy carried out under the PPF for the
proposed project shows that by updating and changing the
criteria on reasonable bases, the land tax would generate
about FMg 300 million per annum.
(b)    Property Tax (Impôt Foncier sur la Propriati bâtie - IFPB).
Up to 1977, this tax vas levied by the Province (Faritany).
Smnce 1978, it te transferred to local goverments as follovs:
- 502 for the Fivondronana
- 472 for the Firaisana
- 31 for the Fokontany
Tax on property is the major stable resource of local
governments, repr.senting an annual income for FIVREN and FA
of about FH4 900 million in 1P37. It in asssumed an Increase
of 32 per year froi 1988 to 1991, folloving population
increase, and 6S from 1992 onwards vith Improvements in the
tax base. It is expected that additional FMg 200 to 300
million per year could be raised if basic Issues vere
addressed by Central and local governments. These issues
relate mainly to management and evaluation criteria of the
physical parts of the propertys sise, quality of construction
and their environment which are important factors for
appraising taxable property.  Many of these critical elements
are nov not taken into consideration. It is also expected
that the Project would substantially raise the value of land
and hence the property tax return.
(c)     Surtax on Property (Taxe Annexe à l'IFPB).  This surtax
applies only to the Fivondronana.  It is levied on the sam
basis as the property tax with a 4% uniform rate. Its purpose
is to cover the cost of collection and treatment of solid
vastes. Presently, the surtax base is about FHg 540 million.
Using the same assumptions as for the property tax, the surtax
would yield approximately FMg 640 million in 1993, vmcih vould



- 32 -
cover the cost of operation and maintenance of solid wastes
activity. It ts also expected that improvements to the surtax
base would incroase it8 return by about 200 million per year.
Other       s
5.07          The Fivondronana derives part of its revenues from other local
taxes such as market stalle, rental on public buildings, etc. This
represents between 15S and 202 of total revenues. Because of poor
management and political sensitivity, local authorities have not been able
to tap thies resource proporly. FIVREN is not meeting its obligations vithin
the Firet Urban Projeet, financed by IDA. It had agreed to increase in real
terme, from 1984 to 1989, the rents of municipal housing by 1002 and the
fees charged for market stalle by 1402 This has not been dore, due to the
reluctance of the Popular Council to raise any taxes or fees. It le
considered that this part of local revenues has a big potential and could
easily yield MSg 200 million more than its present return. The newly
appointed President of the Fivondronana is decided to make proper use of the
Municipality's local resources.
Vat Tex
5.08          The tax on vater is usually levied to cover severage coste.
Toamasina started to collect such a tax on vater in 1988. The first attempt
to do the same thing in Antananarivo goes back to 1984. However, due to
difficulties between FIVREN and JIRAMA, this has never materialized. It i.
proposed to start vith a reasonable tax rate, FtMg 20 par m3 ln 1991, and to
increase it by 102 a year for three consecutive years, then by 5S until year
2000.  The nar vater tax vould represent about 132 price increase for vater
consumera. Based on an annual vater consumption of 24 million m3 in 1986,
the vater tax vould yield FMg 750 million the firet year of its
lmplementation.
coset R.cover
5.09          The Project vill aim at recovering the full cost of operation,
maintenance and reneval of the facilities constructed or rehabilitated under
the project. These facilities vill be managed by the institutions listed in
para.4.13 abova, croated or etrengthened under the projects
(a)    Public entity S1, responsible for flood control and drainage
facilities;
(b)    Private company S2a, responsible for the severage system;
(c)    Private company S2b, or companies, responsible for collection
and treatment of solid vastes;
(d)    Autonomous departmont S2c, vithin FIVREN, responsible for the
existing urban drainage system; and



- 33 -
(e)    Federation of users associations S3, responsible for the
irrigation systoma.
5.10          Financtal noeds of Si vould amount to about FMg 500 million aet
the beginning of its operations, of which 230 million are for reneval of
equipment (see projections in Annex 9). The financing of S1 vould be
supported, equally the firet year, bys (i) th. Central Government, (IL) the
Faritany, and (iii) FIVREN and the Firaisana of the Antananarivo area. This
would represent about FMg 160 million for each institution in 1993.  The
following years, the Government contribiution vould 8tay constant, the
Faritany and FIVREN providing equally the balance. Sl's budget would be
reviewed every three yesr by the Government and the contributions of th.
Faritany, FIVREN and Firaisana vould be adjusted on th. basis of this
review. Any surplus would be deposited in the Infrastructure Fund for Urban
Housing (FIHU). Hovever, any deficit vould be paid by Goverment for wiich
a financial covenant would be required in the Credit Agreement.
5.11          The expenses of S2a for the severage system vould be covered
by the vater tax (see para.5.08), which could yield about 1Kg 750 million in
1993. Financial projections of S2a are given in Annex 9. The introduction
of th. vater tax, at a rate acceptable to IDA would b. a condition of
disbursement for the sewerage component.
5.12          Collection and treatment of solid vastes are at present
performed by FIVREN, and eupposed to be financed by the existing surtax on
property. It is proposed to privatize this activity by transfer to one or
t-o private companies (S2b) under a 'contrat d'affermage wvith FIVREN
(para.4.20).  S2b'o financial resources vould come from the allocation of
part of the surtax on property and from the sales of compost produced by the
treatment plant. The financial needs of S2b are about FMg 650 million in
1993 (see Annex 9).
5.13          The existing stormwater system vould be managed by a nev
institution S2c, for example an autonomous department vithin FIVREN, which
vould finance it from its ovn budget, as it is the case nov.  Municipal
budgets related to this activity have to be strengthened in order to reach
acceptable levels of service.
5.14          Thi expenses of S3 would amount to nearly FUg 163 million a
year, at full development. This could be covered by s (i) vater rates at
FMg 45,000 per ha of rice (equivalent to 225 kg of paddy); (ii) contribution
of FUg 70,000 per ha of "off-season' crop (equivalent to 6.6S of the net
margin); and (iii) a contribution of MA to the management costs and to the
Project Unit ("cellule d'appui").

5.15         The financial needs of the entities responsible for operation,
maintenance and renesal of the facilities constructed or rehabilitated under
the project vill be covered by contributions based on local taxes and by a
vater tex.  The financial analysis shovu that these expenses are affordable,
taking into accouat the financial projections made for the local governuents
involved and for the operating agencies (see annexes 8 and 9).
(a)    Operating costs of Si would be FUg 485 million in 1993,
includiig FMg 230 million for reneval.  The Government,.
the Faritany, and FIVREN and firaisana vould contribute
about FMg 160 million each the firet year of operation.
Fivren and FA vould derive their revenues from the
prop.rty tax which would increase from ENS 900 million
in 1988 to FMg 1138 million in 1993. In addition, FMg
200 to 300 million more could be raised if tax
collection and administration were [mproved (sea para.
5.06 b). This vill be done uander the project by
assistance to the cadastre and to the Land Tax
Department.
(b)    Operating costs of S2a would be FUg 550 million in
1993, including FMg 170 million for reneusl. This
vould be covered by a vater tax of FM8 24.2 per m3.
Thi, ---tar tax (1.5 cents of UD$ per m3) vould
represent only 13S of the vater bill.
(c)    Oporating costs of S2b vould represent about 7Kg 650
million in 1993 (ineluding FMg 126 million for reneval)



- 35 -
end would be covered by the surtax on property. This
is affordable because lt is not a new charge: the
surtax already finances collection and treatment of
solid wastes. The only difference is that a private
firm would carry out this job. It is also expected
that Improvements could raise the revenue by FMg 200
million per year.
Flou of Funds
5.16          The proceeds of the IDA Credit would be made available by the
Government to the Faritany of Antananarivo, which has the responsibility of
th. Project Unit (BPPA). The project is included in the PIP, and is based
on a realistic schedule of diabursement.  During project implementation,
updated three-year investment and public expenditures progrsms for the urban
sector vould be submitted each year, by October 31, to IDA for its review
and comments.
Financial mNna_emnt
5.17                 The critical area in municipal finance is the weak
financial ninagement of fiscal resources to achieve the objective of
resource mobilization and cost recovery under the proposed project.
Strengthening of the institutional capacity of the tax authorities and the
local governments in therefore necessary. About US$ 1.5 million will be
spent under the project on strengthening the land tax office. This
intervention vould help in the management and the evaluation of the tsx
system performance, assessment, collection effort and information systems.
At the level of FIVRER, the Firat Urban Project has already placed some
emphasis on financial management, by reorganizing the Financial and
Administrative Department (DAF) and by introducing new financial management
techniques.
Accouatina and Auditin« Reonirem_nts
5.18          Separate project accounts will be established by BPPA, the
Varitany, FIVREN, FA and SI. Thes. agencies vould be required to complete
preparation of financial statemento of project transactions vithin three
monthe of the close of the Government fiscal year. Financial etatements of
!aritany, FIVREN and Si would also b) audited.  Auditors' opinions on these
financial statements will be prepared by independent auditors acceptable to
IDA, and submitted to the Government and IDA within six monthe of the end of
the Goverument fiscal year.  Independent auditors are available in
Madagascar and presently perform such audits for other Bank projecte.  The
audit report of BPPA's accouants would include a separate analysis of the use
of IDA funds under the Special Accouant.

VI. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION - B8NEFITS AND RISKS
6.01          The proposed project, vith its numerous components, vill
dramatically improve the physical and institutional environment of the city
of Antananarivo and of its rural hinterland, and the functioning of the
economy of the whole area. Beyond the usual micro-economic analysls of the
costs and benefits of each component, which is summarized below, a more
macro-economic and regional approach ts necessary to capture the short term
effects of the implementation of the proposed project on the regional
economy and its longer term impact on the structural changes of this
economy. This is explained and developped in Annex 11.
Coet-Benefit Analseis
6.02          Each project component has been carefully analyzed from a
micro-econdmic point of view, by maximiuing the present value of its costs
and ben<fits at a discounting rate of 102 for a given level of services,
vith sensitivity analysis for the main parameters such as macro-economic
environment, population growth rate, changes in market prices of rural and
urban land, etc..   This analysis has led to several important modifications
in the design of the main vorks such as the drainage and irrigation network,
the pumping station, etc.
6.03          The internal rates of return have been calculated for the
project as a whole (ex^ept the urban sanitation component for whidh the
benefits, related to health, environment, and quality of life, are hardly
quantifiable), and for various combinations of the components of the
project for which benefits can be directly identified and quantified. Two
different growth rates of the population of the plain have been considered s
32 (corresponding to the present trend and involves no new urban development
beyond the natural growth rate, whidh is an extreme hypothesis), and 52,
which is the most likely sad is taken as the base case.
Thi Uhole Prolot
6.04          la tXie base case, vith an urban growth rate of 5S in the
southera part of the plain, the overall rate of return of the project is 152
and 182 for an incremental value of the land in the southern part of the
plain of FMG 5,000 and FMG 10,000 per square meter, respectively (see para.
6.07). An urban growth rate of only 3S, which is unlikely, would reduce
those rates of return by 3%
Ftood Protection
6.05          The rate of return of the flood protection componento alone,
whiih inelude dikes, river bed improvement, and the flood-warning system, is
272 in the base case, sad vould still be above 202 if the population growth
rate vas OZ . This rate of return is not very sensitive to the population
grovth rate, because of the importance of the already existing urban assets.
A separate rate of return has been calculated for the protection of the
plain north of the Mamba river alone, assuming no other improvements in the



- 37 -
Irrigation and drainage. This rate of return would be 8S. This low rate of
return shows that it would not be economically justified to improve the
flood protection of the irrigated plain vithouti, at the same time,
rehabilitating the irrigation itself (see para. 6.08).
Drainat* of the Plain South of the H mba River
6.06          The southern part of this plain (south of the 67 hectares) is
already partially urban$sed, and the remaining agricultural production la
negligible. The future extension of urbanisation in this part of the plain
vill probably take place at a high pace, and the project provides the
min4mum infrastructure required to make sure that this urbanization vill be
manageable. In the northern part of the plain, which $s predomilantly
agricultural, no further extension of the urban activities and constructions
is forecasted, at least at the time horizon of the project.
6.07          The protection against submersion by the surface runoff from
the vater basin vill reduce the damage to existing urban assets and
activities and to crops, and vill increase the market value of land. The
rate of return of the corresponding components of the project (drainage
canals, pumping station, retention ponds and gravel roads along the canals
In the southern plain) mostly depends on the growth rate of the urban
population and activities and on the incremental value of the land suitable
for development.  In the base case, vith a 52 urban grovwth rate, for an
ineremental value of FMG 5,000 and 10,000 per square meter, the rate of
return is 252 and 312 respectively. The actual incremental value vill most
likely exceed F7G 5000, which corresponds to the cost of one meter of
landfill that the project vill save. If the urban growth rate le only 22,
the rate of return would be 18Z for an incremental value of land of FMG
5,000 per square meter.
Irrtitation Rehabilitation
6.08          The folloving cost-benefit analysis is related to the
rehabilitation of the irrigation perimeter on the right b*nk of the Ikopa
River, to the North of the "67 hectares". The costs include the investments,
operation and maintenance of the flood protection vorks of the agricultural
plain, the irrigation and drainage canals, the portion of the establisbment,
operation and management coste of the Federation of Users Associations (S3)
which are specifically related to the irrigation systems, and the additional
agrieultural production costs. The investment costs of the new canal GR and
of the main eanal C3 are charged to the "urban" component of the project, as
vell as half of the maintenance cost of the canal GR mad the totality of the
maintenance cost of the canal C3. The calculations are based on the shadow
price of paddy determined by reference to the market price of rice lmported
from Thaliand. For the Antananarivo area, this shadow price is FMG 279 per
kilogram of paddy.
6.09          In the base case (final yield of paddy s 3.8 ton/ha, and off-
season cultivation on 500 ha), the internal rate of return is 192 . Without
the off-season cultivation, the internal rate of return would be 16S . If
the final yield of paddy is reduced to 3.4 ton/ha (which means a 202



- 38 -
reduction of the additional output on already cultivated areas), these rates
of return would be 162 and 13Z respectively.
6.10          At full devolopment, the total operation and maintenance costs
of S3 vill amount to FMG 163 million per year. These costs vill be
recovered by a user fee of  i) FMG 45,000 per hectare for paddy cultivation,
equivalent to 225 kilos of paddy at the average market price, or to 8S of
the farmor's net added value; and >i) FMG 70,000 per hectare for off-season
cultivation, equivalent to 6.62 of the farmer'u corresponding added valut.
6.11          Although these water rates appear acceptable, the size of
esisting ferme (0.55 ha on average) is 80 small, and the monetary income
provided by the agrieultural activity is so low, that the corresponding cost
vill appear high for the average farmer, as shown in the farm budget
suunarized hereafter. The average fsmily farm of 0.55 ha vith 6.5 persons
vill produce 1,980 kilos of paddy, vîth a total market price of FTG 396,000.
However, 822 of this production vill be consumed by the family itself, go
that the gros. monetary income vill be only FMG 71,000.  The off-season
cultivation on 17Z of the farm, or .10 ha (as assumed in the project) vill
bring an additional gros. output of FMG 172,000, of which 902 vill be
actually marketed. After payment of the cash inputs (FMG 66,000) and of the
vater fee (FMG 7,000), the net monetary income provided by the off-season
cultivation viii be FMG 82,000. This average farmer vill therefore obtain
from his irrigated production a net monetary incomo of FMG 43,000. This
income is obviously too loy to support the monetary expenditure of a family
of 6.5 persons. Indeed, most farms have also other agrieultural income
obtained from non irrigated plots in the ltanetym (fira vood, cassavs,
etc.), and urban monetary income obtained from permanent or temporery jobs
ln the city. Nevertheless, it is clear that most farmes of the plain are too
-mall to be economically viable in the medium term. The project muet
therefore be considered as the first (and indispensable) phase in the
modernization of agriculture of the Antananarivo plain. In a not too
distant future, another project should address the more difficult issues
linked to the inadequacy betwaen the existing natural resources of the area,
the present distribution of population, and the present division of labor
and distribution of activities among this population.
Pov.rty Aso cts
6.12          The study of urban-rural exchanges in the Antenanarivo area
and the more datailed study of socioeconomic conditions in the southera
plain hava provided evidence of the extremely precarlous situation of the
most part of the rural and urban population of the project ares. In the
southern plain for inasance, the average family income is 382 below the
whole city average, vith more than 752 of this lncome obtained from the
informal sêetor. 30S of the population of the plain fall below the poverty
thrashold, cstitated at FMG 606,000 per household sand per year in 1989. 562
of the housing units have one single room, vith less than 2.7 square mater
par inhabitant. More than 302 of the houses are flooded oach rainy season.
The sanitary conditions are disastrous and the infant mortality ls above the
city average. In the rurel areas, as already mentioned, the poor conditions
of irrigation and drainage and the amall sle of farms also contribute to



- 39 -
the v.ry loy level of mon.tary income of farmero, despite the proxLimty of
the urban mark.t.
6.13          All componenta of th. project, although not specifically
foeused on poverty alleviation but more on the r.viving of the *conomic
activities La the are&, vill inde.d bonofit the poor, directly for the
existing population of the plain end of the "quartier de la gare' end of the
farmers, and also indirectly as explained in the macroconu&mjic anlysis of
the project prosonted in Annez 11.
Prolect Riaka
6.14          Th. most comuon riaks associated vith developuent projects are
linked vith veaknesses of the institutions involved. This vill be addressed
by provision of technical assistance and training to theso institutions. In
addition, the Project Unit vill b. La charge of carefully monitoring snd
coordinating the  implementation process.
6.15          Th. major risk of the proposed project La inherent to the
economic situation of the couutry. The project viii dramatically lmprove
the living conditions of an important part of tbo Antanuarivo population,
of vhich 307 te below the poverty level (soe para.6.12).  Their capacity to
pay for im :oved services depends on th  general economic environment.  The
firat budr of economic recovery appeared in 1988, and have been gathering
strength since then.  Hovever, the recovery la still extremely fragile and
narrowly-based. In any case, the severe economic decline that has occured
over an entire generation vill require years snd years to be reversed.  The
remedies are clearly beyond th. responsibility of this specific project, but
-ts impact on the Antananarivo Region La not negligible (see Aunez 11).
6.16          Another risk la associated vith the proposasl to privatise
most of the municipal services: sewerage, collection and treatment of solid
vastes and, through a public entity (SI), operated by a private company, the
day to day vork of operation and maintenance of the flood control and
drainage facilities constructed or rehabilitated under the project. Up to
now, the Municipality bas bean ideologically opposed to any privatisation,
but the vind has changed vith the 1989 elections.  The political environment
now favors liberalization and privatisation, vicih minimizes this risk.
Impact on the Luviropmet
6.17          Two different definitions of the physical environment of the
Project can be given s i) the entire vatershed of the Ikopa River and of its
affluents, upstream of the Antananarivo Plain; and ii) the more limited ares
directly affected by th. various project components, wilch la to say the
partly urbanized and partly agricultural Pla,tx of Antananarivo.
6.18          The protection, rehabilitation and management of the entire
Ikopa vatershed are beyond the scope of the proposed project. Hovever,
these issues are addressed in the Forest Management Project mentioned in
para. 1.29 . This project includes actions aimed at arresting the
degradation of the unstable, nearly deforested ferralitic soils of the



- 40 -
tsnaty over an .ea of 16,200 ha in the Antananarivo Region.  In addition, a
llmited envirocm.ntal assesbment vas carried out for the proposed project,
and sore urgent actions have beau identified for the protection of the
vatersieds (see Watershed Nanagement Plan in the Project File). A study for
the protection of the vatersheds has beon added to the project, sad the
Enviroument Progrem (PE) vill contribute to finance the firet phase, mainly
reforestation around the reservoirs of Hantasea and Tsiazompaniry.
6.19          The proposed project vill contribute to the efficiency of
these two environment projecte in the Antananarivo area by ensuring a more
rational land use, by providing an efficient flood varning system, by
providing protection againast the seasonal and exceptional floods which is
adapted to the requirements of the various settlments and activities, by
managing the circulation of vater throughout the plain, and by improving the
capecity of householde, aterprises and institutions of the rogion to plan
their activitles in a longer term horison and to b. more respectful of
environmental constraints (se. Annex 12).
6.20          The present situation Ln the caity's louer arase, in tho seml-
urban  sami-rural plain of the right bank of the Ikopa River, mni in the
irrigated plain has alraady beeu prssented in othar sections of thls report.
Iudeed, duriLg the past three decades, areas of concentration of population
and activities, such as tha Antananarivo Plain, have roceived val-y little,
if any, public investment Ln infrastructure.   This lack of public
investnant hms not only forced the population to live in extram_ly
pracarious and insalsbrious conditions, but has also constituted the main
cause of the environumental degradation of the Antananarivo area.
6.21          WithIut the proposed project, farmers, urban dvellers and
local govarnments vould be lass and less able to rehabilitate and even to
maintain thair ovn assets and vould inevitably be more preoccupied by
immediate survival than by tomorrov's aenvironuental problesm, as clearly
shown in e hi socio-ecenomic surveys of the Southern Plain. The groving
pressura of rural population on poorly maintained and highly fragmented
agricultural lande and of urban population on unprepared araas, deprived of
drainage and basic infrastructure, vould have devastating affects on th.
physical enviroDment.
6.22          The proposed project, which mainly aias at restoring the basic
drainage and flood protection infrastructure of the area, vill have
extremely positive effects on the imuediate enviroemant. Among the direct
effects of the project, it is vorth mentioning the follovingt reduction of
flooding risks and submersieti; loeered vater leval in the Plain for a given
series of rainfalls; disimmersion of draies sad savers in the lower
districts of the city and effective funetioning of sto.mwater and vastevater
systeas, vith its impact on the transmission of malaria, nov the leading
cause of death in children under 5 years of age; and the collection and
treatmont of solid vastes. The proposed project vill alseo have indirect,
but also significant, impacts on the environnent by changing the attitude of
households and local institutions who, during the past decades, have been
forced into poor envirormental management practices.



- 41 -
6.23          The proposed project vill have slight negative envtronmeutal
impacts. Untreated vaste vater vlll be pumped and discharged Into thé Mmba
River.  At prmenut, thé bota of Mamba River is tmpoverished folloving years
of pollution abuse. la addition, these vaste waters vill be diluted vith
rainuater collection as vell as by river flous, thus disturbance to aquatic
biot, Ln MNmba River vill be minor. la the longer term, vastevater
treatment muet be considered in future vater management plans for the
Antananarivo Region.  Novever, aet this tire, vaste vater Lreatmont beyond
dilution con not b. justified. The project vill slightly increase floodiug
in rice fields, outside the polder, during floods vith recurrencies
exceeding 50 years. This vill only marginally affect production In hesvy
flood years and vill not cause additional enviroumental damage beyond what
vould occur ln natural floods.

MADAGASCAR
&NTANANARIVO PLAIN DEVELOPHENT PROJECT
Assumntions for Financial Prolections
Introduction
Financial projections have been prepared for the following exlsting
and proposed entitiest
a)   Faritany-Antananarivo
b)   Fivondronana-Antananarlvo-Renivohitra
c)   Firaisana-Ambohimanarina
d)   SI (Etablissement Public à Caractère Administratif)
e)   Severage system company (S2a)
f) Solid vaste system company (S2b)
Assumptions
Financial projections of local governments for the period 1988 to
1997 have been extrapolated from actual financial statements of the past
five years 1983-1987.
(a) The S1 revenues are based on the 1987 figures of the property tax for
the FIVREN and FA i.e., FMG 1.1 biii'n.  To this figure an 80Z collection
rate la applied. Between 1988 and 1991 an increase of 32 per ennumis e
estimated, however a 6Z increase for 1992 assuming the start of tax
improvement effect, and an increase of 10 for subsequent five years then a
stable increase of 5S up to year 2000. 1993 would be the first year of S1
operation. The cost of Si 0 and M Ls shared equally by the Goverrment, the
Faritany, and the FIVREN and Finaisana of the Antananarivo area. The
Goverrment vill keep its contribution constant over the years while the
Faritany vill keep up with FIVRENIFiraisana contribution. On the
expenditure side it te assumed an increase of 3S per annum for salaries and
52 for O & N and renewel of equipment. In case of surpluses at end of the
year the Government could make transfers to FIHU.
(b) The severage system company (S2a) vould be financed by a water tax.
This water tax calculation in based on the cost of running the system.
This cout in added to the vater tariff. It is assumed that the increase in
volume vould b. 32 between 1986 (24 million m3) and 1990, then 5Z annual
increase up to year 2000 considering investments that are underwsy vould
increase production capacity. It i estimated that the vater tex oould be
FMG 20 in 1991 and vould increase by 10Z until 1994 and 52 aftervards. The
same assumption used for Si, for personnel salaries have been retained for
S2a. For O and M it i estimated that the increase vould be 5S until 1997
and 7S aftervards due to networks extensions on autofinancing (250 million
TMG in 1996 vith an increase of 102 until 2000).

(c) The solid vaste system company (S2b) would raise ttc revenues from
the surtax on property end vould follow the same principles and assumptions
as in the proporty tax mentioned above for revenue end expenditure
projections with two exceptionst on thé revenue aide the sale of compost iL
added wvth a 10  annuel increase from 1993 to 1997, end 5S aftervards. On
the expense aide the profit margin allocated to the company handling this
activity ls *etimted et 102 of total expenditures of operating the vaste
cystea.

01       Tho Antananarivo Plain Development Project, vith ite numerous
components, will dramaticelly improve the physical and lnatitutional
*nvironment ci the city of ntananarivo and of ite rural hinterland and the
functioning of the economy ct the whole aroe. Uayond the usuel micro-
economic analysit o  the coste and bondfitr of each component, which te
uwmmarized lA para 6.28 to 6.17, a more macro-economie and regional
approach it necessary to capture the *hort tor erffectr of the
imple ntation of this project on the rogional economy Lnd its longer term
impact on the structural changes of this regional economy. The tool uued
for this macro-economic analysts, the local Social Accounting Katrix, wyll
bo brieSly introduced firet.  Ths local SAN wlll thon holp to characterize
the prsennt situation of the Antananarivo aré. and to identity key issues
that the prMect will contribute teo addross.
The Local Social Accouatin matrui
02       Preliminary studios have h lped to idontity the main area of
influence ot the capital city, which corresponds to tfive PlVO tDROfàA with
a total population of about 1.5 million inhabitants, of which 1 Million
urban Lnd 0.5 Million rural.   t La Ln thls aoa  encompalsiag the area of
influence ot tho Antananarivo Plain Projoct, that relatively dotailed
micro-econosic and economic surveys have beon undortaken, with particular
emphasis on the *outhern part of the Antananarivo Plain.
03       Th o*  studios were intondod to analyse the lovel, origin and
destination of expenditure and income of varLous catogoreis ot households,
enterprisos (includin; the informal sector), local gove=mmnts, and central
governmont agenci4s, and to assena the bihavior of these varicus agents.
The corresponding flove cf gocdb, services and monoy betwaon and among the
agents of the Antananaiivo area ldentified, between tho capital city and
its hinterland, and between the whole area and the reot of the country have
beon prosentod in the fors ot a local Social Accounting Matrix <SAM).
04       Thii analyste provided a rea onably good understanding of the
tunctioa±ng of the reional economy, ot thi  behavior ot the diffarent
catgoris  t o ouschiolde, enterprises and Lnstitutions, and ot the factors
which contribute te the remaikably low lèvel of activity and  xchanges
whichi makb  the   eI-urban and rural periphery of Antananarivo ont ot the
poor.st aims of the country.
os       Following the  ae me thodology, à draft national SAX has alao been
pro,.*vd, although on a much weakor Information basi. The purpose ot this
national SAN la to serve au a 3frame of reftrence for the local SAN, tO
asos the micro-economic disparition between the Antananarivo area and the
rest of the country, and to asses* Inter r-gional *xchangos.

06       The local SAX and the national SAM *erved  s a bi  ftor the
construction ot a de«o-economic modal of the local-national *conemy (se.
D.m@econCoiC Modol in Project File).  This modal bridges the gap betwecn
the traditional macro-economic modela which ère g narally deprived of any
spatial and urban-rural dimension, on the one hand, and the sectorial and
micro-economic analyses which genorally fail to take the macre-economic
context into account, on the other hand. The followinq analysis of the
bonefits and impacts ef the project te, to a large extent, based on the
results provided br this demo-conomic model, which will alme serve au a
tool for monitoring the implementation of the project and for the analysis
of broader urban and rogional issue iLn Madagascar.
Local economic and socio-econoic backeround
07       The local SAM cf the year 1988, s*lectod au the base yoar, shows
that the econemy of the Antananarivo &rea has been seriouely hurt by the
economic criais cf the *701 and by the contraction of public expenditure
and domestic absorption fellowing the adjustmant procees. The monetary
incc«e of householde is no low, particularly in the modern sector, that
meut activities orientes towards  the domestic market have *xperenced a
dramatia decline, and,in some cases, disappeared, for lack of *olvent
cuatoers. A good illustration Ls provided by the construction sector:
the rents paid by tenante to landlords are generally v.ry low or eVen non-
existent (heberges gratuitement), the low incoa  from rntes doos not allow
for a proper maintenance of the existing stock of houses, the profitability
of investment in housing Ls low, and the total housing stock increases at a
pace at leaât two tises loevr than the almoady low urban population growth
rate (3.2%), resulting iL very high occupancy ratio«, especially in the
southern plain.
08       The lack of em7loyment and income oppoetuntties and the poor
housing conditions in the city pushes a growing number of householde in the
rural periphery and in the non monetized  oenomy, resulting in a low level
of division of labor Ènd exchanges between the city and itt periphory, in
an over-densification of the rural hinterland, and in a dramatic decroase
of the average ase of faru, esPecLally smong the young farmers. Those
farmers us most of their production for their own consumption (inded,
they are not aven food self-sufficient), they have not much teo ell to the
urban consumers, aM thir alre-dy low monetary ncous Las ineluctably
decreasing.
09       Te le  level of mon.tary laous of most urban and rural
households la on  of the main reasons of the lw yiold of local taxes and
of the lw lev1 of incare and expenditure of local governmntu, which
results Ln a furtiher deterioration of the quality Of public services and of
the physical environment in the Antananarivo area. The very poar
conditions of drainage, sanitation, and other basic amenities also acts as
a powerful disincentive to private investment in houein;, which makes the
conditions of living even more p-eca« ous for the majority of the urman
housrhold , includin; tie "rmddle=classs.  tt te against thL demographic,

conomic and *ocio-_conomic background of the Antananarivo arma that the
short and longer torm impacts of the project are pr-ented hmroafter.
Short tere Jmacte of the oroltet
10       Two main categories of short torm impacts can be identified.  The
firut catagory corresponde to the direct, Lntended effects of *ach
componant of the project: this firut catmgory of impacts, weighted against
the corrmsponding costs in the cort-ben fLt analysis, will only b- alluded
to. The second cat-gory corresponde to the indirect and inducod affecte of
the implementation of the project on regional economy.
il       The 100-year flood protection provided by the project to the
people and activitLes of the suburban plain and rural armas will
im ediatoly- zmduce the expected value of damagés on .xIsting ëssets and
activities b'l FMH 2 billion per year, or 0.2% of the total gros. regional
product, most of which corresponding to the urbanised part of the plain and
to urban a&rets and activitios. Thil estimation doms not include the
*value* of livms which might be lost if the main dikes wero braached as Lt
happenmd in the 1959 flood.
12       The rahabilitation of existing infrastructure and the botter
management of the circulation of water throughout the projmct arma will
also considerably improve the situation both during the rainy season, by
allowing the diacharge of the rain rur off and of the waste watar in a much
*horter pemiod of tim, and during the dry season, whare admquat-
irrigation and drainage of the cropped arma will remove one of the main
bottlanackr to the modernization and intensification of the pari-urban
agriculture.
13       The improved drainage of the already urbaniaed parte  of the PlIin,
wher- 135,000 people livm LA poor conditions, and the rahabilitation and
*xpansion of «xLating sswerage system will have an immediate impact on the
sanitary conditions and on the halth of the downtown residenta (quartier
de la gare) and of the suburban population. This improvement of the
drainage and sanitation will remové one cf the main constraints to private
Lnvest ret and to rehabilitation of habitat Ln the entire aroa. The market
value of the 500 hectares of private land protected against flood and
adequatoly drained in the southera plain is expected to increase from nome
PNB 3,000 to More    n ta    10,000 par square mater. This incremental value
only corrsponds to the reduction cf the cont of landfill petmitted by the
project, and doms not include the affect of the improved acceos to
infrastructure and services. Of course, thii incremmntal value of urban
land 1 only potential and will only materialize insofar as the land
protected will be actually developed.
14       In the irrigated aroas, the flod protection and drainage, and the
improved Irrigation, together with the expected improvement of farming
techniques, will progreesively rase- the average yiold oa the 2,400 ha
under cultivation from 1.9. to 3.8 ton of paddy par hectare within an
eatimated period of 7 ymarr. However, the average yiold will immediat-ly



- 76 -
Annex 11
Page 4 of 7
increase by at leaut 0.6 Cons par hmctaz.e  without any change in existing
agricultural practices, thanku to the reduction of loses resulting from
flood, insufficient drainage and inadequate irrigation. In addition, the
project will allow for an expansion of irrigation en 20S ha of maruhlands.
Overall, the production of paddy in the project area Lu *xpected to treble,
from ie prenant lev-l of 3,700 tons l an aiverage year, to some  10,S00
tons, nine ysars atter the boginning et the project. The project will also
croate the conditions for a development ot off steaon cultivation (cultures
de contre saison), mainly wheat, potateon, beans, cnLons and other
vegetables for the Antananarivo market. On the ba st et the existing cases
of *pontaneour development in other armas e the region whsre irrigation
and drainage conditions are favorable, off season cultivation would develop
on et loaet 500 hectares ever the 10 yearr following the beginning ot the
project, providing the farmrs with a uubstantial mount of cash income.
15       The second catmgory ot short torm impact* corresponde to the
Indirect ettecte, througheut the rogional *conomy, of the public
expenditure resulting trom the implementaion ot the project, to the Lnduced
ettectr of this expenditure through the use of the incom distributed to
the labor force mngag.d Ln the implementation of the projcte, and to the
reviving ot private inveotment Ln housing, encouragsd by the improvement of
drainage and sanitation conditions in the project are&. Thoes indirect and
lnduc-d effects, as they can be assessrd Ln th. demo-economic model of the
Antananarivo are&, are briLtly prseonted hereattor, for a period
correcponding to the average year of tull-pmed implmentation  nd
disburs m_nt (year 2 to yoar 6 of the project), during which the average
flow e  e*xpenditure will r- ch sos S12 million, or PMO 19 billion per ymar
at the 1988 mxchangm rate, of which PMG 10 billion pmr ymar LA foreign
currmhcy. in order to taie into account the inducmd ett*ct of the prqject
on private investment, -t La asuumd that the ratio betw en the growth rate
of the urban housing stock and the growth rats ot the corrmsponding
population w$il be rais d frou 50% LA the base year to 70% (the national
average) with the project. This assumption La not over-optimistic, since
it corresponde to oaly 1000 to 1500 *upplem_ntary nmw housing unitu par
y.ar in the *ntire Antananarivo are, and would imply a furthmr aggravation
(although at a lowmr pao>) of the ovmrcrowding of the existing housing
stock. However, an alterablve mutimate has bsn dons, wheroby the induced
tffect et the projoct on pr..vate Lnvsxtment (relaxation of the repr-x-sd
Lnvmstusnt La houLae ) la at consoLdred.
16       comprsi to thu current macro aggrsgates of Che arma (bacs ysar
1988), the annual flow of etxpnditure ot the project La not negligiblî,
*ince Lt Le 1qulvalont to 3% of the groes rogional product, to 16% of the
total tura oser ei th. construction sector Ln the area, and to 23% et the
total publie lnvmctmont Luplemmntod by the central govsrnmsnt services and
the local governmento in thic are&.

23       Firut, the Antananarivo plain project muet bO considored as one
fundamental stop in the implemontation of the etrategy of revival of the

of labor betwéen rural anu urban aroea and between agriculture and the
other soctors, to relax *xisting constraints to the mobility of population,
to croate an onablin; environm nt for private investont, especially in
urban and pori-urban areas,  nd to promote urban-rural exchanges. The
opportunitLes offored by the project for the expansion of central functions
cf th- capital city in the southern plain in expected to improve the
attractivenesm of Antananarivo, both for population, private investuent and
activities, and to improve the efficiency cf the city considored as an

rato cf the regional product will roach 7.8% in the high urbanization

affect the environment. The prenant report aime at identifying those impacts
together with describing thair aspects, both positive and negative.

As a consequence of urbanisation, natural vegetattion has smverely
d.terioratmd as the result of human landscaping: housing, reafforastatLon,
and irrigated agrIculturo and hortIculture. The most visible  ignes of
environmental degradation are thos. neighbouting high hil'. which have been
cleared for pastur., cr.ating wastmlands where *roded shoota and ravines are
frmqumntly found.
1.2. Land and houmine uetiltation
The agricultural plain in covored mainly with rice fields which are
cultivatmd by emall Zarmers with average cultivatcd armas of 0.5 ha *ach.
Lower parts are ur d for the culture of *arly ricm (vary aloha)> which in
plantmd-out In August-Septembor and harvostod Ln January. Due to the
d-terioratod canal notwork, farmers had to extend this programe ovor longer
poriodr, which incro-ass flood-rolatmd tosss. Lata rice <vary vakianbaty)
La cultivatod on the highor lande (above 1,248-1,249 m). It La plantmd-out
in December and harvestod in April-May. Low poorly drained lands, (o.g. at
the foot of thm Ambodimita), romain flooded and are usrd for fishing.
in and noar town <taston valley) low-bOd5 are usmd for watercrasr ponds or
for growing saonjo or cassava and rafter markmt-gardening.  ln the hillî
(Tanoty), market-gardening iL practis.d on the bottom parts of the olopos.
Dry farming is don- on th* higher parts. Severely doteriorated toils due to
over-grazLng, togqthmr with burning-out and rcaping practices confine dry-
farming near the villages wh-re Lt can be added bovine manure. On tho South
of the 67 ha, although the plain is "plantod" with scattered housinga, lt
har kmpt itr rural aspect -with the exception of tho nearby major routes.
In this arma, agriculture Lr dotorLorating. A sharp incroase in the
excavations can be observed and the hydraulic network La in a worse
condition than in the rlorth.
Housing dissemination La oxtending, so that doterioration of rice farming
ar4d infringmonts on lamination   low r lands are progressing northwardr
(Maaay, the hydrocarbono coad, etc).
Humun aLccomodLation include&. mainly villages built on hill topa. The double-
rloped roofied houss« are traditionally made of rmd-coatod brickr or clay
blockr. The banks of the Mamba River are occupied by more precarious,
daubed-walled, shoot-metal rocfed dw llings, 050 of which only serve au
uhelters for the watchmen in charge of looking after the fields.
1.3.  Plain hydraulie eouLP mnt
-     The Project covers the arma of the Betsimitatatra Plain which La
located batween the foot of tho hills whmro the Antananarivo town
originally devoloped and the dykes along the Ikopa and Mamba
Rivera. This arma Le naturally expor-d to seasonal flooding by the

above rivers, a flooding increaued by accumulated alluvL.al rai-n
deposits on the Plain watorrhudu.
The lower town district lLkely to be floeded is located betw on
1,248,50 m (along the Andriantany Canal whure embaonkments are fawt
and 1,251 m (noar the railway station).
131. <Remindur of) Plain olobal characteriutice
The 9 tuimitrata Pla.n in made of a 20m-thick alluvLum comprising two layera:
-     a lower mandy, thick, porour layer which Lt  fed by infiltration
waters from the Ikopa River,
-     a 3m- thick superficial impervious layer.
* The underground layer fed by the ikopa River rune through the *andy
alluvium and can be conftind in flooding periode.
* The Plain ends in the North with a rock mana which has croated a
la4ustrian morphology that generates a very low goneral gradient.
* It La croesed, within the project zono, by the Ikopa River which, in ito
northern part, collecte the waters coming from lte tributary, the Kamba
River.
A Agricultural occupation and the hydraulic system are old. The systom je
that of a dense canal network which Lr uued for irrigation and drainage.
* As a protection against flooding, farmers have damed-up the rivera, whose
levlel  rime above plain level at flood tim. The groat dyke on the right
bank of the Zkopa, which w'a  robuilt in 1962 following the drastie 1959
flood, Ls ex*pcted to protect the town during approximately 50 years. The
very old Mamba dyke retains waters one over throo years only.
Beuides levols issue, one hb to face river flood problems. During a 10-
year phase, the lkopa Rivera overflows in Lts upper part whore the plain
begins. Waters run down into the loft bank valu and are thon stopped by
variuog obstacles originated by the bottleneck of the river bud
(Tanlombato, Anosisato, Ztaomy). Ourinq river spates this provokes water
mhitting butwéen the major and minor beds thus producinq dynamic affecte on
the bankJ.
* RaLn falle of the town gather in the Andriantany Canal at the ftot cf the
urbanized hlle. The canal, which was originally planned for irrigation, has
beon dammed-up at approxisat-ly 1,249m to raine ahove rice fields level. it
rune into the Zkopa River about 10 !au downhtroem ef town. At dischacge, the
Ikopa level raines above 1,249m avery S years. With a view to stop the Ikopa
watoera Sic  boing pueh.d back into the canal, the latter has boon  uqLipped
with a eluice (au Ambodiaita, on the Ambohibaho Road), which Ls *uasonally
closed.

in the low r part formed by the canal* which run &cross it *long a north-
to-south direction and run into the canal downstrean of the sluice. T.e same
happen  to the northern network of the Hamba River (Laniera> that runs intz
the canal upstr»am of the *luice.
* DLscharging of waste waters is done with that of pluvial waters. Sewage
flows into the Andr4antany Canal, slightly above bcd level. Discharges are
partially obstructed by seUting of the canal where maintenanc te noet done.
he decayed network as wall as hydraulic hoad of the canal waters prevent
reqular flow of pluvial and waste waters, thus r-rulting in the flooding of
the lower town districts.
Main outlets do not suffice to allow run-off transit; on the other hand,
they are teo wide for swift draining-off of used-up waters in dry weather,
added to obstructions resulting from lack of maintenance and the poor
condition ef (rivulots), etc... In the dry season, the Andriantany feeds a
polluted ground water that stagnates at O.m undernath the  nbankmnte and
makes maintenance or ordinary repair workr difficult. In the rainy season,
the damaging e* fects of flood* are Lncreased by the network s comon
functioning factor.
In the town lower districts along the Andriantany and at hill foots (lsotry,
Tearalalana., Ampef,L:oha, Antanimena, ...), the sewage network is no longer
in workinq order.
132. Ploode and submersions rieke
Dyke breaking and ground water floading differ in their consaquences, which
ehould be clearly described.
a> Dyke collaoe s
When the dyke nearr breaking point (every 50 years) the Ikopa level reaches
1,253.5mi lt Le thon Sm above plain level. Flood rieke are therefore obvilus
for the house ln the plain and lower districts of the town. While
overflcwing of the Mamba occurs more frmquently, its impact Ls limited
culture damages.
b)  implvium tlloodin
The oeteitatrata Plain elevation Le between 1,246.6 m and 1,249m with an
average of 1,247.5m. Water levelo resulting from umpluvium submersion reach
1,247.7m e*vry 2 yearr, 1,248.5m *very 10 yearr and 1,249.3 *very 100 yearu.
Lower Antananarivo (Ampefiloha, Anatihazo, laotry, &long the Anosizato and
Anonipatrana roads) are partially flooed dvery 2 years and teotally flooded
once Ln *very 10 years.
The agricultural function of the Andriantany Canal iL also a cause ct
dïsorders. It nad be-en originally doeigned to transport 10 cubic
maters/second. Mow, Ltu bed La currently silted, and housin; has been unduly
buLlt on its bank, thus reducing Lt. etrangth <on-pL-e housinq at DAntemna,

1 4 Urban Environmfnt
141.  Plain occupation ptOeaCz
The current ettua:.on resultu from the two existing occupation modes, i.e.
the agrieultural one and the urban one  (namely aIl non-agra.culturaI
utilizations:  housLng, *quipment,  industrial and craftwork activitjes,
transportation, etc).
* Progressive development of irrigated agriculture han resuited in
continucus raising of protection dykes and in improved and r-inforced water-
feeding canals   (for the upetream extension of the irrigated area, the
forwarding of sed-beds dates, etc) and drainage canals (for the downstream
extension of the irr:gated area and the control ai water levele, etc).
with the Andriantany Canal being positioned at hill foot, around the h$1e.
* The incr-asing extension of non-agricultural land occupation recults from
the site's configuration: originally located on top of the Rova mountain
peak (1,450m), the town firut spread over the  alopes to reach the plain
around 1930. Since thon, with the devealopmnt of the railway network and the
construction of the railway station, a continuous urban developFnt proceos
started in the plain, to the detriment of irrigated cultures. Such
development te commended by:
-     economie entities looking for flat lands, conveniently located
with regard to the town center and accessible by road or railway -
which obviously hill canot provide in general.
the usual pressure of population housing occupation on the zones
mont close to administrative and industrial services and
employment. Such pressure is encouraged by the roadc nstwork that
connecta the capital to the various towns and regions of the
country. It results Ln land prices which have nothing to se with
agricultural land prices. The cost for a plain embankment -which
increases in proportion with the furthering-off of possible loan
facilities zones, the riLk of flooding, etc. are included in the
comparison with other, more distant or lesz efficie$tly connected
sites. The balance is that of plain urbanization versus hill
urbanisation (Ses J.L. V4nard, Phase 1 -1984), which changes with
ti.   (relative  factors coste,  inclusion of new hilly  zones
resulting fram space extension) and a*so dependz on the sconomic
conjuncture (a very low one will generate pauperication and
densifications a higher one will recult in extension) (Seo 'Plain
urbanization Schems' , M. Arnaud - 1989).
The above twofold pracezs recults in a complex dilemmea between:
-     ground and water wo-ks <Andy Canal) utilization,
-   agrieultural (MPAM) and urban (municipality and MTP) competences
for the repair and maintenance of oluices.

Town devOlopment on the sastern hills results in extensive grourd Water_
rep.lling proces  and consequently in an increase in surface water flows;
which occugO euddenly and within a few dais. The flows rush down towards
the bottom ci the plain and meet the Andriantany Canal, which was not mtant
to transport them resulting in accumulated water where the canal bank iu the
highest, followed by local overflowing, bankr damaging and specific f looding
of the urban districts.
in addition, the urban occupation of the plain withdrawo  lande  from
agricultural uses and owing te land-pricing market *peculations, causes
agricultural activities disorders, difficult relationJhips between land
owners and eharecroppers and speculation on lande awaiting urban
transformation. This urban occupation requires embankmnftu whose volume iL
thus withdrawn from the plain's absorptive capacity when gluices are celosed
the 500 ha embanked at an average 1.50m have alroady withdrawn 7.5 million
m3 (frem an approximate 25 million m3).
As indicated above, heuse construction on the banku of the canals are
another form of non-agricultural occupation. Besides the above types of land
withdrawals, these constructions result in canal dafaging through bank
crumblinq and waste discharge, which doter current maintenance.
Given the cont of flood protection prior te urban installation, and threat
cf recurrent seasonal flooding, the authoritiLe, understandably, are
roluctant or refuse ta officialise urbanization of the Plain. However, this
policy has not deforred illegal installations and drnsifications, which
progres. locally and erratically aceording eo ownerso will or thes» rare
land  sales.    This  unplanned  dev-lopment  leaver  no  room  for  future
ceonstruction; on maintenance they connequently cannot bonefit from regular
equipment action.  Finally, occupation is more and more that ci poorer
people since initial tenants leave to find better lodgings elsewhere. This
recults in the vicicus cycle of the resident population of those districts
being therofore the one that La the least adapted to the charges of a
rational occupation of the Plain.   Nousing in the Plain La therefore
precariLus.
Housing structur,s originally tock advar,tage of ;e accees roads embankments
and were at oufficient distance to be pratected f rom seasonal f loods. As the
population grew, housse have extended more towards the rice fields and have
ben built on low *mbankmente  (50-60cm>, which hardly allowr to raise
housinge abov  water level and to have accese  to thom. The high cost of
these embank)nte with regarde to the low means of living of these familias
has had an obvieus consequence on ground occupation: houses stand noxt to
one another in very dense blocks that hang on the main acous road oe on the
embankments or drainage conduits.
Acceas is done through dramatically narrow , insufficiently pedestrian paths
that use the rice fields dykes and whieh make communication from one place
to another quit. uneasy if not impossible.
Frequent flooding during the rainy s-aron, recurrent polluted-water invasion
of the housing (more than 1/3 Ls fLooded) and the preoence of swamps are the
living conditions ci the population in the plain are. A  a conoequence,

to a atone or brick pit set underneath the latrine device, and most cft-n
outside the house. Pit draining ir often discharged into the rice fields,
and although the latter are uuually slightly rai ed abova ground level,
there remains overflowing riske during the rainy seamon. (HUIT GROUP, June
l989).
One indirect consequence of *uch devalued urbanization of the plain in the
squatterinq of public spaces and prsviously dammed, unusod places.
142.  (Unuroiected)  vlIution trend
The Indication of what the evolution would be without Project completion in
such a compl-x environment requires an evaluation of the mechanisms of
spontaneou urbanization. It would be unrrealirtic to include the concept
of total control of the constructions *uch au, for instance, La the
circumsta ceu, respect of absolute dyke and construction forbidding in the
zones more or les licely to be flooded.
Vithout the Project, this would therefore globally and irroppr*ssibly result
in the planning of erratic occupation. The land market pressure ir teo
strong, and, moreover, increasing with the increare of the town and the
related furthering-off of competitive constructible lands. The rate of the
occupatior need  will take up  peed if the economic conjuncture Le bettert
in the recent past, the Antananarivo demographic development has
significantly *lowed down and the major part of urban development han been
absorbed by a ground and housing denzification, no that one mLght think that
the plain embankment Le under control. This iL not the case, and the above-
mentioned study by J.L. Venard har shown that for a more than 5%
devolopmant/year rate, hall of it would re-ult in the development of
urbanized land surface, with a *lightly lower rate for the central part
(including the Plain). At a 3% rate/year, land occupation in the plain would
double within 24 yearr.
All oth«  elomntr in conn«etion with this occupation tandency would
intansify with time and the urban pressures
-     authorities would flnd it more and more difficult to resut  the
pressure on zones which would be more and more central and
abandonad by agriculture: (without a proj ct), they could have no
sound reason to officialise urban occupation on lande that would
be more and more likely to be flooded (due to the continued
reduetion of accumulation land surface);
-     densification would make rehabilitation worke (drainage conduits
and canals) more and more costly; and Lt would be quite improbable
to provide for bumper basins to contain pluvial waters (10% of the
urbenized surface)#

_     densification would alas result in increaosd volumes of liquid and
uo3Âd waetes dilcharged on the surface or into the ground water;
_     growing uneanitary conditions would become more obviYus and
irreveruible and the resident population would tend to be more and
more marginal, thus making town-center housinq Ions and less
usable for quality investments$
-     dysfunctioning of the hydraulic, agricultural and urban systsm
would increase with non-agricultural occupation, thus acclorating
the discarding of agricultural activites and making maintenance
coste heavier;
-     after occupyLng mainly the *outhern part of the Plain and hills
border (where embankment requirement La minimum) -land prices
increasing as occupation grows- one would result in  banking-up
just any zone of the plain before *ven the beot ones would be
totally occupiedg
- without Lmproved organisation in the management of the water
protection and drainage system in the Plain, water level being
higher and higher for a standard liet of given serles ot
rainfalls, flooding and dyke breaking rieke would alto incroase
et flod recurrencies would be more frequenti
-      sA  a side-event, irrational utilisation of the central lande
potential would result in increased pressure on the old town,
which would seon endanger its architectural asset.
Orientations towards spread-out agglomeration could c.rtainly reduce the
above procees conuequences (this was wisely adopted in the Creator
Antananarivo Main Scheme, within an unprojected hypothesiî). Provided the
authoritiea were able te have *uch a *cheme agred upon, the most likely
renult would be a mixture of a nlower occupation of the Plain with a sproad-
out agglomeration. The mont probable hypothosis being to keep the plain for
central, quality works which would provide for the financing of individual
installations in this context.

Globally, the sanitary situation of the country is critical, and it in aven
more so ln the Antananarivo Region. Malaria, which is on a eoarin; trend,

2.  Pro Iet' sta ct on the euwionLeu
2.1.  Sumarv of Prolect contents
The Project for flood drainage and control  Js threefold:
-   renforcé_ent of dykes and floode transit
- improvement of drainage
- agrieultural rshabilitation.

,à) Dvke ad flood& transit
- The right benk dyka on the Ikopa vill be reinforced vith à viav to ensure
a 100-year protection. Anosizato, which ià the most fragile, wi: be
equipped teo facilitate flood& transit.
b) Imoro@vemnt of drainaxe
Ca-nal discharging vill be made permanent throurh a 9 m3/s pumping
station located downstream of the polder and which vill push the waters
back into the Mamba River (this is the major work in the draining
proceas).
T-he canal vill then be dredgad, iLt banks vill b. cleaned and its sole
role vill be that of draining.
A main collector located in the conter of the plain vill allov for the
rehabilitation of lover districts. Lamination basins vill b. worktd-
out. Current accumulation basins (Masay, Alarobia) vill b. controlled
vith a view to enable thom to have a lasting efficiency.
Full drainage efficiency vill thus be ensured for a 10-yoar period.
c) Framia rehabilitation
The Andriantany Canal vill be replacod by a nov agricultural supply main.
The area which it feeds vill be rehabilitated over a 3,000 ha surface
located betveen the 67 ha in the South and the Ivato Lake in the North.
2.2. Sectorial impact of hvdraulic eouiiments

thé vater transportation mechanisms betweer. t.he Ikopa b.d and t:-i
loft bank vale.
However, rehabliitation of the .Ikopa right bank dyke vill r*su.:
in increased flooding of the rie* fields downstream of the
B.tsimatatra for recurrency p.riods of between 50 to 100 ypars.
From the econocie standpoint, it has bean stated that ricc fiel-s
should be protected for 10-year p.riods.
223. lunact on lover district sanitarisation
The rsduction of the Andriantany vater level through pumping vill provide
for drains dismm ersion. Th. general level of are- pollutad by the canal and
network sa'-ks vill be low.red. Once r.habilitated, the towf's sanitatieto
n.twork vill thus be in workirLç order.
224 I»Moct on rie f telda oollution
The current situation, where the Andriantany Canal discharges sevage into
the rie. fields, vill be improveds
-    by d.dicating the canal to draining, vith its waters no longer boing
used for irrigation
-    by installing stoeri spillways that vill direct diluted waters onte the
plain.
225. Impeat of ilain esanals and storate basins
Thé *quipment of lerer zone  and svamps into lmination basins vill recult
in a beneficial offect on sanitation (contrary to doubta which may have been
expressed). Actually, these vater stretches vili b. controlled by the
hydraulie systom (which vill maintain a minimum depth level); banks
maintenance and vater circulation vill b. made feasible. The permanent vater
stretch will allow to preserve grubs and mosquitos predators. Besides, this
vill be a complementary fighting element against malaria.
Provided that, as la expected,those vorks are kept in good vorking condition
and bauks pedestrian pathways are landscaped (as is the case on Lake Anosy),
they would certainly have a positive influence on the environment as far as
esthetics and the population'* living conditions are concerned.
Besides, drainage of che lover zones currently used for pisciculture could
be compensated by fish breeding in the lamination basins.
It should aiso ie noted that, thanks to the projected 2 m3/second sanitary
flov injection,  pollution of the Andriantany Canal vlll be reduced.
226. Imact on tround vater
Ground vater levels vlli not be modified since drainage vill affect

superficiel waters only. It will ba possible eo drain "secondary" grount
waters crcated locally by the Andriantany. Given the negative affect on
sanitarisation, this impact vili bc an advantaga.
227. Imoact of the cnal b_arks exeropriations
Expropriated houses, in particular those on the Andrianceny Canal, are amorg
the most pracarious and insanitary onts. It has been planned to put the.
down to install maintenance tracks instcad; people vill b. rehoused on the
rice fields embanlment zones. Since current housing thero ls illegal, it has
only been plannae to grant people wLvh expropriation compensations based on
houe ng market value. Administration nov seema to be contemplating thc
viabilisation of thes. sites, but financing, paym.nt of maintenance taxes
by resourceloses people and solutions to doter spe.ulatory actions art issue*
uhich still remain to be locksd inat.
228. Impact of the smi,ns station rta«cted vat-rs
The station rojecttd waters into the M-mba River 1t lik.ly to lacreas. the
latter's pollution. How.ver, this nggative impact vll b. limitad due toc
-    rsjected used-up waters baing diluted by pluvial waters, on on
hand,
-    the Mmba River, as indicaced above, 1s a site vith little flora
and animal llfc, on thé ochte hand.
229. Imact of thé rehabilitation of non-irrlgata   trea
Rahabilitation of this are  should have a twofold influence on envirotments
-   A direct influence on rural population, whose incrasted Income
vill improve thir sanictry living conditions.
-   An indirect impact on urban envirotment through reduced rural
depopulatcon, which encourages current insanitary housing. Ont can
also hope for the preservation of the beautiful rural landscape
which complotes the grand Antananarivo site.
2.3. Global immct on urbanisation and livint conditions
The Project, et originally designad ("basic Project") had indirect impacts
on the urbmais&tion oe the Plain and the ganeral evolution of urbanization,
vithout any intervention in the urban field par se. Those impacts have becn
analyset in the complementary study (wrongly) entitled "Plain Urbanisation
Scheme" (M. Arnaud, 1989); chey are suarised balows
-    The closing of the northera bank of the urban and agricultural
polder,   the raising (and reinforcing)  of the whole of the
protection dykes in the plain, against cantenial flooding (insttad
of   the present 50 year recurrency),  together vith transit
arrangement on the Ikopa loft bank, vill improve security for any

existing or future investuent, aven though the submersion risk
vill never totally disappea:.
_   Piumping of waters from the Andriantany Canal downstrecm of t.e
Plain and their rejection beyond the dyke when aluice is c'osed,
viwI, if this is adequately controlled and all things being equa;,
allow tO louer down to aoen O,80m to lm thé level of highest
waters in the polderised plain (and consaquently to proportionally
roduce the need for banking-up).
-    Improved agricultural drainage vill result in the rehabilitation
of the PIRD and can improve the situation of lover occupied zones
that are currently poorly drained.
During the course of this study, the dense state of occupatior. of the
southern part of the Plain -south of thé 67 ha- vas a rcason to cancel
its planned rehabilitation.
In the course of the finalisation phase of the project, this analysis
cf impacts on urbanization led thé Technical Comuittee to study and
adopt a variant ta the Basic Projeut, as follevs:
-    to raplace the doubling of the Andriantany Canal by a plain-
bottom canal including the enlarging and r.inforcing of dralning
canal C3 able te transport pluvial waters falling in the South ot
the Plain -if the latter vere ta be urbanized.
-    the instalment of storage basins, during plain urbaniation, vith
a view to collect pluvial vater before returaing it to canal C3,
vich could possibly be extended upstream. Two of these storage
basins have been included in the Final Project, i.e.the ont which
will stop waters fro  tehe Railway Station vatershtd and the one
which vili stop waters from the densely populated districts of
Anatihazo and Anosibe, on either side of  National Road nr.1
(Arivanimamo Read), as vell as the extension of the C3 to the
latter.
Hou viil the whole of the above works affect urbanization?
It makes no doubt that they vill improve urbanization of the Plain, since
vater protection and drainage vill be better than th.y presently are, and
above all, in the longer term,  they viii be far better than they would be
vithout the Project. However, this is only a change in rhythm compared to
trend urbanisation. tesides, this change in rhythm vill aseo include a more
rational management of the toun with regard to its center.
On the contrary, if the protection of the northern rehabilitated part of the
PIRD is really completed against all improvement of the urbanisation (which
vill be facilitated by increased agricultural incomes and by a clear
distinction, described in the Project, betwven thé rehabilitated part and
the discarded ont), the Project vill result in urbanization b.ing elearly
directed to the southern part of the plain (whose banking-up is moreover
the most économic ont), which vill be an obvious benefit.

Th se vorks vill above ail allow the authorities to officially make the

officialisation vill allow for ±implementation requirements to be set-up and
Ln particular to stat. what arcas art res.rved (vhich is not fcasiblo in the
absence of officialisation) and to intervene in such setting-up, if
nec.ssary, which makes up for botter control of the situation.
3.   Conclusionas
3.1. Positive  a{aCts
- With or without the Project, th. Plain ta meant to be urbanised, at a more
or les. swift pace according to the country's economic situation; et eny
rate, the potential of the 300-400 ha of the southern part reflcte the
r.quired neoed for land of one year of the town's extension at à rate of
5lyear (100 m2/linhabLtant/l0,000 added inhabitants).
Th.  Project  encourages  such  urbanisation  but  Lt  alloWJ  official
urbnsaiation. which ls from fat preferabli to erratic urbanisation, but is
irrepressible under the land pressure of the town center. In particular, thé
combination of vorks and officialisation vill redirect grouad occupation
tovards uses and social categories who vill be more capable to finance the
costc r.quired for banking.up and networks.
Thé Project is not litralily a urban project, but its final variant provides
for ixetdiate and tangible improvements tO the environmnnt of the more or
less legal present occupants of this are&. The Projecc dots not require any
systematic tenants eviction. It leaves  to land marketing and to tim  the
task of rcneving this population, 701 of which live In rncitet housing (s-e
Groupe Huit Survey;.
The setting-up of a light but specifically responsible public administrative
organisation which would be able to regularly register fiscal resources, Ls
a guaranty for the maintenance and adequate vorka.ng of the plain'* vater
protection  and  drainage syste<,  itself  improved;  this,  a   State  of
Collective public service, subjected to Budget limitations, could not
guaranty.
*     TThe  Project provides  for  the  improvement  of  lover districts,
consequently that of the sanitary conditions of their inhabitants.
*   The kseping of  heaithy  vater levels ln the Andriant4ny Canal vill
reduce its pollution.

3.2. NReative impact$
*   Thé throving back of pump4 dvaetrs inte the Memba River vill increase
it3 pollution (albeit in low volumes sgiven the dilution of vaste waters by
pluvial waters).
*  Flooding of rice fields downstream of th. Batsimattra vill b. iicreased

* Eviction of illicit houas tenants on projected areas and canasl or
rivers banks vill b. a problematie issus since most of these people do not
have the mons tO finance rs-houaing zones.
3.3. ROco.ndations
* Officialisation of th ceonstructibility of the southera part of the Plain
dots not stand as e condition for th. completion of the °roject. It *hould
on th. contrary rather b. made chrough varlous stages (or time perioda) to
allov for discussions vith evners and tenants vith a viev to defin wh t
arias  art  to  b.  riserv.d  and  to  providc  for  greSter  eontrel  of
implementation.
It vould c.rtainly be an advantage to move as many precarious constructions
as possible in the rehabilitated part of the Plain so as tO clearly mark
that thls arta is meant to be used for agriculture (and aven improved
opertional conditions), and to maKe future building prohibition credible.
*   Strategy to re-housa low-incom  evicted tenants   sheould be clearly
defined. To offer them areas entails appropriate measures in order to avoid
tenants selling-off their lande to generate immediate profit and move to
precarious lodgings in the plain closer to their work
* The viability of positive impacts and improvement of nîgative ones should
be included vithin actions provided in a longer t-rm for ch. d-velopment of
the hydraulle syst« of the plain and of thé town of Antananarivo, t.e.s
-    Protection of the vatershed,
-    Hydraulic *quipment (Phase 2), (i.e.  floods transi:, dykes,
rehabilitation of other agricultural areas,etc.),
