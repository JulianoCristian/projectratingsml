The living\n            conditions of the low income population in the Antananarivo\n            Plain have been improved. The lessons learned include: 1) It\n            would have been preferable to undertake a review of issues\n            and opportunities in the region in order to define a set of\n            priorities. When faced with a range of issues, a set of more\n            focused, complementary projects could achieve better results\n            within a broader development program for the region. 2)\n            Cofinancing should be targeted to discrete projects of a\n            larger program or to discrete, physically unlinked\n            components of a single project to avoid interruption when\n            problems occur with one cofinancier. 3) Flood control\n            projects of this magnitude require support and funding from\n            national budgets as well as from local sources to make sure\n            the system will operate over the long term. Sustained\n            commitment is needed from high levels of the government. 4)\n            When projects are substantially delayed, the Bank should\n            review the project objectives to assess whether\n            restructuring is advisable. 5) The definition of the\n            institutional and resource mobilization arrangements to\n            ensure sustainability after implementation should not be\n            postponed until long after appraisal. Alternatives should be\n            carefully assessed, and an explicit plan should be agreed\n            upon at appraisal."}, "docdt": "2000-03-14T00:00:00Z"}
