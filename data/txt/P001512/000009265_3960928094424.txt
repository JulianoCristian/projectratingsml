MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTWE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE DENOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF MADAGASCAR
FOR AN ANTANANARIVO PLAIN DEVELOPMENT PFOJECT
1.        The folloving memorandum and recommendation on a proposed
Antananarivo Plain Development Gredit to the Democratic Republic of
Madagascar for SDR 23.0 millior. (US$ 30.5 million equivalent) i8
submitted for approval. The proposed credit vould be on standard
IDA terme vith 40 years' maturity and would support implementation
of the Gov*rnment's strategy for the urban, water supply and
sanitation sectors. The project vould be cofinanced by CCCE
(US$ 21.5 million equivalent) and FAC (US$ 0.8 million equivalent)
(France).
2.        Backtround.  The city of Antananarivo vas originally built
on hills located at the eastern border of thé Plain of Antananarivo.
The flat area of about 180 km2 at the foot of the hills is a flood
plain of the Ikopa River and its tributaries.  With the growth of
Antananarivo suburbs, the low-lying flood pl&iLn has been
substantially developed, mainly vith lov-standard dvellings lacking
modern infrastructure. In the past, thls plain has been subject to
serious floeding, resulting in diaruption in oconomic activities and
bo0s of humau llfe.
3.        Under the Antananarivo Water and Sanitation Project (Cr.
1002-MAG) approved In 1980, IDA intended among other objectives to
finance detalled engineering and vorks for surface drainage and
s&nitation. In October 1984, however, because of lengthy delays,
these components vere cancelled from the project.  It vas understood
with the Government, at that timo, that these coemponents w>uld form
part of a new project that vould cover the pretection and
development of the Antananarivo plain in a br,ader context.
Preliminary studies on the Antananarivo flood protection and
agricultural devlopment aspects were alr.ady underway under the
Plain of Antananarivo Technical Assistance Credit (1086-MAG),
approved in 1980 to define a least-cost investment progr.m for the
Plain.  The final report of thei.  studies vas completed In November
1986. Additional studies and experience relevant to the urban
elements of the project have been gathared in connection with the
on-going Urban Development Project (1497-MAG).
4.        Prclect oblectives.  The main objectives of the proposed
project vill be to (a) provide 100-year flood protection that vould
establsih conditions for long-term growth in the Antananarivo
suburbs; (b) rohabilitate and expand the drainage and sanitation
facilities in the Plain; (c) rehabilitate the irrigation schemes on
the Ikopa rigit bank to develop agriculture in the northern part of
the Plain; (d) initiate the establishment of an economically viable
urbanisation program to develop housing and employment in the
southern part of the Plain; (e) Improve the.local governments



-2-
revenues at the regional level; and (f) improve land use planning
and investment programngia ln the Antananarivo Metropolitan region.
The project would al80 strengthen the inatitutional framework for
integrated aud controlled development of the Plain.
5.        Prolect description.  The project vould include the
following componentss (a) rehabilitation and construction of dikes
along the Ikopa and Nomba Rivers to reinforce flood protection; (b)
construction of drainage structures including a pumping station to
evacu&te rain and vaste vater from the plain; (c) construction of an
irrigation channel and rehabilitation of Irrigation achemes; (d)
rehabilitation and expansion of the existing sewerage system; (e)
drainage in the southern part of the Plain in the perspective of a
future urbanization; (g) updating of the cadastre ln the
Antananarivo Region; Ch) tuprovement of local finances and resources
mobilisation; (i) creation of an Authority responsible for operation
and maintenance of flood control and drainage facilities, and
privatization of the severage system and of the collection and
treatment of solid vastes; and (j) studies, technical assistance
and training.
6.        Total project costs have been estimated at about US$68.6
million equivalent, with a foreign exchange component of US$39.1
million (57.0 percent`. A breakdown of costs aad the financing plan
are shown la Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement and of
disbursements, and the disbursement schedule, are ahown in Schedule
B. A timetable of key project processing events and the statue of
Bank Group operations in Madagascar are given ln schedule C and D,
respectively. A map is alse attachod. The Staff Appraisal Report
No.8152-MAG, dated February 23, 1990 is being distributed
separately.
7?        Rationale for IDA involvement.  The Government's urban
development strategy foeuses primarily on maintenance and
rehabilitation, which la fully consistent vith the IDA country
strategy. In this project, IDA emphasis vill be on Lmproved
financial and techaical capabilities of municipalities,
strengthening urban management and institution building,
privatization of municipal services and establishment of cost
recovery mechanisms through improvement of existing taxation, and
implementation of a new vater tax. Without IDA involvement, there
would be a serious risk that political pressures would lead to the
adoption of a program that does not provide for any institutional
strengthening.
8.        Actions axreed.  The Government and the Antananarivo
Municipality have agreed to privatize operation and maintenance of
the severage system, as vell as collection and treatment of solid
vastes. They alseo agreed to create, by December 31, 1992, an
autonomous agency for operation and maintenance of the flood control



-3-
sud drainage faciliti es, aud to control urbanisation in the southern
part of theo Plain during project execution. Conditions of
effectiveness vill be. ML) decision to protect the irrigated areas
against urbanisation ln the part of the Plain where irrigation vould
b. r.habilitated; and (iL) decision on a system to cover operation
and maintoenance cost of flood control and drainage facilitges.
Conditions of diabursement vill b.: (Ij mendment to the existing
land legislation to makoe mndatory the recording of any transfer of
ovn.rship of land; (ii) transfer of urban sewerage and solid vastes
collection and disposal activities to private companies, and
establishment of a vater ta%; (Mii) promulgation of measures to
control urbanisation in the southern part of the Plain; and (iv)
execution of the resettlement plan.
9.        Environment. A brief environmental assessment has been
carried out. Its overall conclusion is that the proposed project
vuld have a very positive enviroumental Tmpact on the environment
of the poor suburbs of the capital city, which are periodically
flooded, vith a severage system out of service and significant
health hazards. The project vould alse finance erosion
controllreforestation studies for vatersheds protection.
10.       Benefits.  The project vould lmprove the living conditions
of the poorest population of the city and of its suburbs, and vould
permit an environmentally safe and economically rational development
of this Plain which i. adjacent to the city center.
11.       Risks. Tho main risik  faced by the project are those
derived from the ecenomic situation of the country, since the
capacity of the population, particularly the urban poor, to pay for
improved services depends on the macroeconomic enviroument. This
risk is presently small as definite signa of economic recovery have
appeared in 1989 as a result of a nov vell eatablished economic
adjustment program. Other risks are related to the capacity to
manage the project. This however is minimized through project
design by privatising part of municipal activities (severage and
solid vaste), having one coordinating agency for the flood control
system and adequate technical assistance and training.
12.       Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed ci dit
vould comply vith the Articles of Agreement of the Association and
recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed credit.
