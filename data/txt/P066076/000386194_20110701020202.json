For the financing of a total\n            project cost of US$24.4 million, the International Bank of\n            Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) loan comprises US$21.9\n            million and the government contribution US$2.5 million. The\n            project could not be completed by the original closing date\n            of December 31, 2009, and the closing date was extended by\n            18 months, to June 30, 2011. However, this extended period\n            has not been sufficient to complete the project, due to (i)\n            limited implementation and coordination capacity in the\n            implementing agency; (ii) lengthy procurement processes;\n            (iii) changes in the judiciary leadership (although the pace\n            of implementation has picked up under Chief Justice Renato\n            Corona's leadership  more than $1.3 million has\n            disbursed in the first half of calendar 2011 alone) and (iv)\n            the very severe 2009 tropical storm Ondoy which set back\n            implementation into early 2010 due to damage to courts and\n            records. The modifications comprise (i) a one-year extension\n            of the closing date from June 30, 2011 to June 30, 2012,\n            (ii) reallocation of loan proceeds, (iii) cancellation of an\n            amount of US$0.5 million from the loan proceeds, and (iv)\n            dated covenants for cancellation, at the Bank's\n            discretion, of activities and associated loan proceeds if\n            agreed implementation milestones are not met. There are no\n            changes to components but there are modifications to some\n            activities within components, as indicated in the\n            procurement-cum-implementation plan. These changes have no\n            implications for the development objectives. The allocations\n            for contracts to be entered into during the extension period\n            are summarized below these are in line with agreed priorities."}, "docdt": "2011-06-27T00:00:00Z"}
