                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The Project's development objective is to support the development of a more effective and accessible judicial system that fosters public trust and confidence.
                         Specifically, the Project will assist in: (a) Ensuring speedy and fair dispensation of justice to all by improving the efficiency of case adjudication and access to
                         justice through: improved information and communication technology (ICT)-based case and court records management systems; reorganization of the court
                         jurisdictional structure; and piloting mechanisms for making courts more accessible to people in remote localities, through establishing mobile courts and
                         conducting studies; (b) Upgrading the integrity of the judiciary through: developing a comprehensive Code of Ethics for justices, judges, lawyers and court
                         personnel and alternative feedback mechanisms on judicial performance; implementing the Judicial Performance Management System; and enhancing
                         professional development within the judiciary, through the introduction of a Human Resources Development Master Plan for non-judicial personnel of the
                         judiciary; and strengthening the Philippines Judicial Academy (PHILJA); (c) Strengthening institutional capabilities through: implementing a decentralized
                         administration model for the judiciary; installing comprehensive computer-based financial and administrative systems; developing model integrated court
                         facilities; and strengthening policy, research and development (PR&D) capabilities through the establishment of a research facility and an electronic judicial
                         library; and, (d) Promoting stakeholder support for reform of the judiciary through: developing broad stakeholder support for the APJR, facilitating knowledge
                         sharing, and ensuring professional management of the reform process. The Aide Memoire and Management Letter are filed in IRIS.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         A loan to finance the Judicial Reform Support Project (JRSP), in an amount of US$21.9 million, was approved by the World Bank's Board of Executive Directors on October 2, 2003.
                         The project became effective on December 4, 2003. The project development objective is to support the development of a more effective and accessible Judiciary that would foster
                         public trust and confidence, through the implementation of the Supreme Court's Action Program for Judicial Reform (APJR). The project comprises four components: (a) improving
                         case adjudication and access to justice; (b) enhancing institutional integrity; (c) strengthening institutional capacity; and (d) support for the reform of the judicial system and the
                         Supreme Court's Program Management Office (PMO).

                         At the request of the Philippine authorities, the Closing Date of the loan was extended by eighteen months from December 31, 2009 to June 30, 2011 to enable completion of project
                         activities and achievement of the project development objective. However, as of October 31, 2010, US$12.4 million of loan proceeds have been disbursed, while US$9.5 million
                         remain undisbursed. Discussions between the Supreme Court and the World Bank on expediting implementation so as to achieve and sustain the development objective are
                         ongoing.
