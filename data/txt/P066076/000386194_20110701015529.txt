SUMMARY
For the financing of a total project cost of US$24.4 million, the IBRD loan comprises
US$21.9 million and the government contribution US$2.5 million. The project could not
be completed by the original closing date of December 31, 2009, and the closing date was
extended by 18 months, to June 30, 2011. However, this extended period has not been
sufficient to complete the project, due to (i) limited implementation and coordination
capacity in the implementing agency; (ii) lengthy procurement processes; (iii) changes in
the judiciary leadership (although the pace of implementation has picked up under Chief
Justice Renato Corona’s leadership – more than $1.3 million has disbursed in the first
half of calendar 2011 alone) and (iv) the very severe 2009 tropical storm Ondoy which
set back implementation into early 2010 due to damage to courts and records. The
proposed modifications comprise (i) a one-year extension of the closing date from June
30, 2011 to June 30, 2012, (ii) reallocation of loan proceeds, (iii) cancellation of an
amount of US$0.5 million from the loan proceeds, and (iv) dated covenants for
cancellation, at the Bank’s discretion, of activities and associated loan proceeds if agreed
implementation milestones are not met.


PROJECT STATUS
As of June 27, 2011 an amount of US$13.88 million has disbursed (63.4%). About 40%
of the results have been achieved after seven years of implementation. The project is
currently in “U” status for DO and IP. However, based on recent progress (including
results reporting, upturn in implementation pace and disbursements, faster procurement
processing, safeguards compliance, and active leadership by Chief Justice Corona and
other Justices) the team proposes to upgrade the IP rating to “MU” while keeping the DO
rating at “U”. The Court has prepared a credible procurement-cum-implementation plan
for the proposed extension period, and the Bank has agreed with the Court and with the
oversight bodies that the extension will be considered on condition that if key
implementation milestones are not met by the agreed dates, the activities and the
associated loan amounts would be cancelled at the discretion of the Bank and without
further notice to the Borrower or the implementing agency (i.e. the Supreme Court).

Most of the activities to be completed during the extension period relate to components C
(Strengthening the Institutional Capacity of the Judiciary – specifically subcomponent
C.3 which relates to the pilot courts in Angeles City and Lapu-Lapu, and the Philippine
Judicial Academy) and A (Improving Case Adjudication and Access to Justice).
Satisfactory completion of the activities would strengthen project results and impact and
improve the likelihood of sustainability of the PDO.



                                             4
The proposed extension will enable key activities necessary for maximum impact on the
achievement of the PDO and results indicators – 86.5% of the planned procurement being
for works and goods and 6.9% for consultancy services and training1 - in line with the
priorities in the May 24, 2011 letter from the Country Director to the Chief Justice.



PROPOSED CHANGES

       •   Components
           There are no changes to components but there are modifications to some activities
           within components, as indicated in the procurement-cum-implementation plan.
           These changes have no implications for the PDO. The proposed allocations for
           contracts to be entered into during the extension period are summarized below –
           these are in line with agreed priorities.

Category-wise amounts allocated for procurement during July 1, 2011 to June 30, 2012:

Consultancy services & training US$307,242.98                        (PHP13.21 million)   6.9%
Works                           US$3,351,162.79                      (PHP144.1 million)   75.1%
Goods                           US$510,465.12                        (PHP21.95 million)   11.4%
Incremental operating costs     US$69,767.44                         (PHP3.00 million)    1.6%
Contingency                     US$225,000.00                        (PHP9.68 million)    5%__
Total                           US$4,463,638.33                      (PHP191.9 million)   100%


       •   Safeguards
           There is no change to the safeguard classification.

       •   Financing
              o Project Costs: The project scope is proposed to be reduced somewhat by
                  cancellation of non-priority activities in the amount of US$0.5 million. As
                  a result of these changes, the loan amount will stand reduced from
                  US$21.9 million to US$21.4 million, and the total project cost will stand
                  reduced from US$24.4 million to US$23.9 million.

                o Disbursement arrangements: There are no changes in the disbursement
                  arrangements.

                o Cancellations:
                  The loan amount is proposed to be reduced to US$21.4 million by
                  cancelling an amount equivalent to US$0.5 million.

                     In addition, the team proposes the addition of a new paragraph 10 to
                     Schedule 5 to the Loan Agreement reading as follows:


1
    The rest is for incremental operating costs, contingency, etc.
                                                         5
                     “10. (a)        The Borrower shall, through the Supreme Court: (i) by not
                     later than July 31, 2011, sign the contract for the remaining civil works for
                     the Angeles City Hall of Justice under Part C of the Project; and (ii) by not
                     later than December 31, 2011, sign all other contracts for activities
                     included in the procurement plan agreed upon between the Borrower and
                     the Bank.

                              (b)     If the Borrower shall have failed to sign any of the
                     contracts referred to above by the respective due dates, the Bank may, at
                     its sole discretion, determine that the amount of the Loan pertaining to the
                     unsigned contracts will not be required under the Project, and, without
                     further notice to the Borrower, cancel such amount from the Loan
                     Account.”

                 and in Annex 1.

        Note: The amount proposed by the team is on the basis of cancellation of US$0.5 million of IBRD loan proceeds.


    •     Financial management
          Project financial management is rated Moderately Satisfactory. Two actions were
          agreed with the Supreme Court to address Financial Management issues and risks:
          (i) the PMO will coordinate with the Commission on Audit and submit the 2010
          Audited Financial Statements to the Bank by June 30, 2011, (ii) the PMO will
          reconcile the fixed assets/inventory accounting records with the physical count
          within August 31, 2011 and share a copy of the report with the Bank. The audit
          of the 2010 expenditures has since been completed by the Commission on Audit,
          and the 2010 audited Financial Statements was submitted to the Bank by the
          Supreme Court on June 24, 2011.

    •     Procurement
          o The team proposes amendment of the Loan Agreement to provide for:
             ƒ Application of the January 2011 Guidelines which mandates Procurement
                 Plans in Section 1, General Policy and Considerations of the Procurement
                 Guidelines;
             ƒ Adding an additional method of procurement, Direct Contracting, to be
                 used to procure goods and works under Section 3.7 of the 2011
                 Procurement Guidelines2;
2
 This is because the procurement plan includes some variation and change orders for works contracts,
which can be more efficiently procured through direct contracting given the extension period of one year.
                                                                  6
        o All modifications to implementation arrangements have been agreed between
          the Supreme Court and the Bank and reflected by the Supreme Court in an
          Implementation-cum-Procurement Plan as provided for in the January 2011
          Procurement and Consultant Guidelines of the Bank;
        o The agreed procurement-cum-implementation plan is attached at Annex 3.

    •   Implementation schedule
          o An agreed implementation-cum-procurement plan with milestones
             including those which, if not met, may result in cancellation of activities
             and of the associated loan proceeds from the applicable expenditure
             categories at the discretion of the Bank, is at Annex 3.

    •   Closing date
        The closing date is proposed to be extended by twelve months, from June 30,
        2011 to June 30, 2012.


APPRAISAL SUMMARY

    •   Risk:
        Some of the critical risks in the PAD have increased from Modest (M) to High
        (H). Thus, overall risk rating is proposed to be increased from Substantial (S) to
        High (H). The risks and mitigating actions are given below:

2.       The proposed reallocation will finance priority ‘wrap-up’ activities that can
facilitate achievement of the project development objective (PDO), strengthen and
sustain project results and impact, and ensure compliance with social and environmental
safeguards. The activities to be financed during the extension period have been divided
into (a) Priority 1 activities, to bring three sites - Angeles City Hall of Justice, Lapu-
Lapu Hall of Justice and the Philippine Judicial Academy - to minimal operating
standards and safeguard compliance; and (b) Priority 2 activities, which will facilitate the
determination of results directly relevant to the PDO. Details are in the procurement-
cum-implementation plan.

3.      An amount of US$0.5 million is proposed to be cancelled from the loan proceeds,
as they are for activities no longer considered priorities. As a result of this cancellation
the amount of loan proceeds will stand reduced from US$21.9 million to US$21.4
million.

                        Extension of Closing Date
1. The closing date for Philippines, PH Judicial REFORM SUPPORT PROJECT,
   P066076 will be extended from June 30, 2011 to June 30, 2012.

2. This will be the second extension of the project. The first extension, approved in
   December 2009, extended the closing date by eighteen months, from the original
   December 31, 2009 to June 30, 2011.

3. The proposed extension is necessary to facilitate achievement of the PDO and
   strengthen the project results and impact. In view of the weak implementation and
   disbursement performance so far, which has improved since June 2010, the
   recommendation for extension of the closing date is based on three criteria: (a)
   cancellation of activities which can no longer be implemented within the extension
   period, or will have no impact on achievement of the PDO or results indicators, or are
   no longer considered priorities; (b) a realistic procurement-cum-implementation plan
   developed by the Supreme Court covering the proposed extension period; and (c)
   dated covenants for cancellation of activities and loan proceeds from the respective
   expenditure categories, at the discretion of the Bank, if the related contracts are not
   signed by the dates stated.
