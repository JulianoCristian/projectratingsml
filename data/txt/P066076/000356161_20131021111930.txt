F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives

The Project's development objective was to support the development of a more effective
and accessible judicial system that fosters public trust and confidence.

Specifically, the Project sought to support:


                                                 v
(a) Ensuring speedy and fair dispensation of justice to all by improving the efficiency of
case adjudication and access to justice through: improved information and
communication technology (ICT)-based case and court records management systems;
reorganization of the court jurisdictional structure; and piloting mechanisms for making
courts more accessible to people in remote localities, through establishing mobile courts
and conducting studies;

(b) Upgrading the integrity of the judiciary through: developing a comprehensive Code of
Ethics for justices, judges, lawyers and court personnel and alternative feedback
mechanisms on judicial performance; implementing the Judicial Performance
Management System; and enhancing professional development within the judiciary,
through the introduction of a Human Resources Development Master Plan for non-
judicial personnel of the judiciary; and strengthening the Philippines Judicial Academy
(PHILJA);

(c) Strengthening institutional capabilities through: implementing a decentralized
administration model for the judiciary; installing comprehensive computer-based
financial and administrative systems; developing model integrated court facilities; and
strengthening policy, research and development (PR&D) capabilities through the
establishment of a research facility and an electronic judicial library; and

(d) Promoting stakeholder support for reform of the judiciary through: developing broad
stakeholder support for the APJR, facilitating knowledge sharing, and ensuring
professional management of the reform process.

1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

In the years immediately prior to preparation of the Judicial Reform Support Project (JRSP), the
Philippine Judiciary:
   i.   Embraced the following “Vision” - “A judiciary that is independent, effective and
        efficient, and worthy of public trust and confidence …” (1998); and
  ii.   Adopted an Action Program for Judicial Reform (APJR, first adopted in 2000 and
        subsequently refined) with six pillars3:
             a. Judicial systems and procedures,
             b. Institutional development,
             c. Human resources,
             d. Integrity infrastructure development,
             e. Access to justice by the poor, and
             f. Reform support systems.

The APJR was based on diagnostic studies funded by a Policy and Human Resource
Development (PHRD) Grant from the Government of Japan (as part of the JRSP preparation
process), the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) and other multilateral and bilateral
development partners, and responded to widespread public dissatisfaction with the judiciary,
perceptions of corruption, and growing backlogs at all levels within the judiciary. Furthermore,
APJR preparation and refinement involved substantial consultations with stakeholders within and
outside the judicial system.

The JRSP was designed to support implementation of the Supreme Court’s APJR, and in
recognition of the reality that the scale and cost of these reforms, and the know-how to support
and sustain implementation, required more technical and financial resources than could be
provided by the Supreme Court’s own resources and capacities alone. The JRSP thus became
part of an integrated array of supporting projects financed by multilateral (Asian Development
Bank, European Commission, United National Development Program and World Bank) and
bilateral (Australian Agency for International Development, Canadian International Development
Agency and United States Agency for International Development) development partners (see
Table 1). Overall coordination of support for the umbrella APJR was rightly in the hands of the
Supreme Court.

It was recognized that the full benefits of judicial reform efforts would only be realized when
commensurate improvements were made in other parts of the justice system. And a diagnostic
assessment of Department of Justice (DOJ) needs was under way with Asia Foundation support.
Nevertheless, in view of the Supreme Court’s initiation of reforms and the World Bank’s
experience in supporting judicial reforms in other countries, it was considered appropriate to
focus Bank assistance on the Judiciary at that time.

  The APJR targeted six key challenges: (a) delays in the delivery of justice and associated limits on access,
(b) corruption in the Judiciary, (c) weak administrative structures and operating systems, (d) deficient court
technologies and facilities, (e) underdeveloped human resources, and (f) improvements in information
provided to the public and greater collaboration with civil society.

As a central feature of Bank support to improve governance in the Philippines, improving the
performance of the Judiciary was important to the overarching objective of the World Bank’s
May 2002 Country Assistance Strategy – to support the Philippines in reducing poverty by
achieving more rapid growth and empowering the poor to participate more fully in development.
Improving judicial performance and governance more broadly was important to achieving the
desired increase in investment and productivity.

Prior to appraisal the Supreme Court had already established and staffed a Program Management
Office (PMO) with responsibility for overseeing the implementation of the APJR and
coordinating all development partner support. This PMO had procurement and financial
management staff in place at the time of appraisal. And the Supreme Court adopted an updated
Information Systems Strategy Plan (ISSP), a critical element of the foundation for systems
reforms, prior to the loan becoming effective. A Program of Infrastructure Needs was also
prepared, to serve as the foundation for assessing and financing the physical infrastructure
modernization priorities.

At appraisal, the proposed project met key criteria for likely success with judicial reform efforts,
including (a) a high level of national ownership of and commitment to reform, (b) reaching out
and working with users in the design and implementation of reform, (c) being mindful of
absorptive capacity in sequencing implementation, (d) achieving results to reinforce momentum
and support for on-going reform, and (e) ensuring that reforms and compatible with local culture.
The Medium Term Philippine Development Plan (MTPDP) of July 2002 highlighted judicial
reform as key to improvements in governance, growth and poverty reduction, and the President’s
State of the Nation Address (SONA) endorsed the project. The Supreme Court’s commitment to
the project was further demonstrated by the Chief Justice attending before the ICC meeting at the
time the project was approved and an Associate Justice attending the ICC meeting when the
extension of the closing date was considered.

  The bilateral development partners, UNDP and EC all contributed grant support, though specific data on
the amounts has not been provided, whereas the WB and ADB provided a blend of grant and loan support.
The ADB loan funds were not passed on from the executive to the judiciary so this JRSP loan is, as yet, the
only loan taken by the executive on behalf of the judiciary.

the Supreme Court’s Action Program for Judicial reform”. Objectives and key performance
indicators are in Table 2.

1.3 Revised PDO and Key Indicators, and reasons/justification

Although the JRSP was extended and amended, no revision was made to the project development
objectives. Relevant project results indicators were updated to reflect the new closing date.
Following discussions with the Supreme Court, it was felt that the PDO and indicators remained
relevant, and additional proxy indicators (such as, for example, relevant ratings from the periodic
Social Weather Stations surveys) could supplement the project results indicators without formally
amending the key performance indicators.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

The benefits, and hence beneficiaries, of a more effective and accessible judiciary with increased
public confidence and trust are far reaching and many. By consistently, predictably and
transparently applying the rule of law in deciding cases before them in a timelier manner, courts
could reduce corruption and increase respect for the law. This in turn could build confidence and
reduce the cost of doing business.

Though the locations of Pilot Model Courts would naturally be expected to receive greater early
benefits, these would only be transitional as it was anticipated that such improvements would
then be extended nation-wide as soon as resources and implementation capacity allowed.



                                                    3
Reducing the backlog of cases before the Court of Tax Appeals and promoting tax compliance,
would increase revenue collections and thereby enable public authorities to improve services.

Poverty would be reduced indirectly through the effects of improved business confidence
resulting in increased investment and faster economic and employment growth. Similarly,
improved public services resulting from increased public revenue would indirectly reduce poverty.
Indeed, Filipinos in general would benefit from the improved rule of law, not just those who have
cases before courts. Indeed, improved access to justice would enhance the well-being of Filipinos
in general.

Poverty would be reduced directly as a result of improved access to justice by the poor and near-
poor. This applies to improvements in dispute resolution, as well and cases resolved by formal
court hearings. In fact, improvements in the timeliness of case resolution would benefit the
relatively poor the most because the burden of delay is greater on the relatively poor.


1.5 Original Components

The JRSP had four components:

   A. Improving case adjudication and access to justice through:
       i. Designing and implementing an improved computer-based case management systems,
          initially in the Supreme Court and higher courts (the Court of Appeals, the
          Sandiganbayan and the Court of Tax Appeals) and in the pilot model courts;
      ii. Designing and implementing an improved court records management system;
     iii. Installing computer-aided transcription equipment in higher and pilot model courts;
     iv.  Reorganizing the jurisdictional structure of courts;
      v.  Developing policy options for addressing affordability constraints to access to the
          court system by the poor;
     vi.  Strengthening access to justice via mobile courts, and
    vii.  Upgrading the judiciary’s ICT system.

   B. Enhancing institutional integrity through:
       i. Developing a comprehensive Code of Ethics for justices, judges, lawyers and court
          personnel together with training;
      ii. Developing alternative feedback mechanisms on judicial performance that improve
          the quality and quantity of venues for information exchange on judicial functions,
          operations and performance;
     iii. Implementing a computerized judicial performance management system in three pilot
          courts and in the Higher Courts, and
     iv.  Introducing a gender sensitive Human Resources Development Master Plan for non-
          judicial personnel, and strengthening The Philippine Judicial Academy (PHILJA).

   C. Strengthening institutional capacity through:
       i.  Implementing a decentralized administration model for the judiciary in selected Pilot
           Model Courts;
      ii.  Developing and implementing a computer-based financial management improvement
           program for use in Pilot Model Courts;
     iii.  Establishing Pilot Model Courts in each of Mindanao, Visayas and Luzon; and
     iv.   Establishing an electronic library and research facility.



                                               4
   D. Assist in strengthening support for the reform process through:
       i.  Undertaking a study of the possible impact of the APJR of judicial personnel;
      ii.  Carrying out knowledge sharing programs;
     iii.  Providing technical and institutional support and assistance with implementation and
           supervision, and undertaking programs for internal communication for the courts;
     iv.   Implementing public communication programs to promote the Action Program for
           Judicial Reform, and developing community outreach and user-surveys to obtain
           feedback; and
      v.   Strengthening the capacity of the Program Management Office.

As such, the project was an integrated blend of institutional reforms supported by needed
infrastructure. Admittedly, the modest loan ($21.9 million) financed only an initial set of
activities within the judiciary’s vast infrastructure needs, but it was considered prudent to proceed
with a project of this size initially so that the Court could draw on the experience gained from
establishing three pilot model courts in addressing its wider infrastructure needs. Meanwhile,
much could be achieved with regard to the project development objectives through institutional
and systems reforms.

1.6 Revised Components

Component B (iv) was amended to also include renovations and additions to the headquarters of
the Philippine Judicial Academy. Component C was implicitly amended to omit development of a
Pilot Model Court in Mindanao (Cagayan de Oro City), thereby reducing the number of Pilot
Model Courts from three to two.

1.7 Other significant changes

Construction of the Cagayan de Oro City Hall of Justice (HOJ) (one of the three original Pilot
Model Courts) was deferred in July 2005 and the possibility of these funds being used towards
the construction of a Manila Hall of Justice was explored.

During 2008-2009, with project implementation progressing, the authorities proposed that the
Bank approve additional financing for the JRSP, to complete the Manila Hall of Justice and key
enterprise-wide information systems. However, given the pace of implementation, uncertainties
surrounding the finalization of a site for the Manila HOJ, the upcoming retirement of the Chief
Justice and uncertainty regarding the choice and timing of succession, this idea was abandoned.
Construction of the Manila Hall of Justice did not eventuate within the time framework of this
project and much of the funds originally provided for construction of the Cagayan de Oro City
HOJ were reallocated to PHILJA. However, it is worth noting that the Court has continued to
work to establish new Halls of Justice in both Cagayan de Oro and Manila. Land has now been
secured for a new HOJ for trial courts and the Court of Appeals in Cagayan de Oro, and the Court
is in the process of using its own resources to build new Halls of Justice in Cagayan de Oro, Cebu
and Manila."

The project was extended twice: first, for 18 months from January 1, 2010 to June 30, 2011 and
second for 12 months till June 30, 2012. The first extension was in response to the request from
the Court and the Executive for additional time to complete the project’s incomplete activities.
At the time it was thought that an 18-month extension would be sufficient for this. However,
towards the end of the extension period it became apparent that it was clearly impossible for the
project activities to be completed in their entirety due to slow procurement. Thus, in June 2011 it
was agreed that the Bank could not abandon the project with the Angeles City Hall of Justice



                                                 5
building still under construction. Hence, a second and very limited 12 month extension was
agreed and the project scope radically narrowed to enable completion of the civil works while
ensuring compliance with safeguard policies, and the implementation of a very limited set of
activities necessary for smooth project closing (e.g. the final user survey, preparation of the
Borrower contribution for the ICR and an independent evaluation of the APJR). A clear timetable
to complete the procurement process was agreed with dated legal covenants, after such dates the
activities can unilaterally be canceled, and the loan was partially canceled ($500,000).

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

As noted in section 1, the JRSP was well-grounded in diagnostic analyses and supported a
Philippine-led judicial reform program. There was strong national ownership of reforms, an
extensive consultation process both within the judiciary and with society more broadly, and a
Supreme Court PMO already established that would be responsible for supporting and overseeing
implementation. The context appeared very conducive to effective support of reforms. There was
a clear opportunity for the Bank to draw on its international experience in supporting strategic
aspects of the reform program that the Supreme Court had already adopted and begun to
implement. Moreover, the key findings from international experience, such as the importance of
national ownership of reforms and involvement of users in reform program design, appeared to be
well satisfied.

The project scope and activities were thought to be quite modest, with only three pilot model
courts to showcase the impact of integrated reforms, and upgraded information systems
supporting improved court, case and financial management, together with training and human
resource development, to achieve improved performance more broadly. It was anticipated that
once the potential gains from comprehensive reforms were showcased under the JRSP, they could
be implemented more broadly. However, in hindsight, there appears to have been a mismatch
between the Project Development Objective (PDO) and the JRSP, as the PDO was more
appropriate for the Judiciary’s overall Action Program for Judicial Reform rather than the APJR
elements supported by the JRSP. Moreover, while the World Bank consistently viewed the
systems reforms as the most important component of the project it has become apparent over time
that some within the judiciary may have seen the construction of new buildings as the top priority.
With successive changes in judicial leadership this disparity in focus and expectations became
increasingly evident.

In retrospect, though, the slow pace of actual reform during the project preparation period and the
fact that there were only minor reform activities ready for implementation in the months
following loan approval was a sign of things to come. Indeed, project preparation itself was not
rushed, but was relatively protracted, being spread over three years. At the time of appraisal it
was considered important to sustain strong multilateral support for the Philippine reform effort in
2003, though it was clear that disbursements in the months following loan approval would be
modest. It was hoped that the pace of reforms and presentation of project components ready for
disbursement would quickly gain pace, but that did not happen.

Significant risks were identified and recognized during preparation, and risk mitigation measures
identified. Unfortunately, these risk mitigation measures were not always effective. The risks
identified at appraisal, and what actually happened, are summarized in Table 3.

         reform leadership                             Justices, and changes in the composition of the Court as a

                                                       achievement of intended project outcomes. Moreover,
                                                       impeachment of the Chief Justice in December 2011 and
                                                       conviction in May 2012 undermined public confidence in
                                                       the judiciary, distracted the Court, stalled reform progress
                                                       and thereby negatively impacted the project.
    2.   Inadequate or                   M             An expansion of training, together with the early
         ineffective                                   establishment of an e-Library, and a large rise in the salary
         concurrent                                    of judges did mitigate this risk somewhat. But continued
         investment in human                           high vacancy rates for judges, and continuing limitations

                                                       third year of the project; thereafter the PMO lost the trust
                                                       of the Court leadership and its capacity was progressively
                                                       undermined as approvals for activities were withheld, staff
                                                       left and were frequently not replaced.

         funding/resources                             though very protracted procurement procedures within the

                                                       naturally need to be spread over time.

         contributions from                            Court virtually ceased to function after that. This lack of
         different                                     effective coordination has become evident in the lack of a
         development partners                          common platform for information systems throughout the
                                                       judicial system and confusion with regard to the Court’s

      procedures could                                 administrative procedures within the judiciary, whereby
      slow down project                                the approval of the Court En Banc and/or the Chief Justice
      implementation and                               is mandatory at numerous stages, significantly delayed
      output delivery                                  procurement, contracting, disbursement, acceptance of
                                                       outputs and consequently project results and impact.
 9. Overall risk rating                  S             Unfortunately the majority of these risks actually became
                                                       limitations on the project. There was no really effective
                                                       way to shield the intended development outcomes from
                                                       their impact although some (e.g. those at items 4, 6, 7 and
                                                       8) could have been mitigated through proactive actions by
                                                       the Office of the Chief Justice or by the Court en Banc.
Risk rating – H (high risk), S (substantial risk), M (modest risk), N (negligible or low risk)

2.2 Implementation

After initially being slow, project implementation gained momentum in the second and third
years before waning from year four onwards. During the life of the project, the focus on outcomes
waned with progressive narrowing of the project scope and increased focus on loan
disbursements. There were five Chief Justices during the 8.5 years of the project, five Court
Administrators, six heads of MISO and three Directors of the PMO.

Though there were quick actions with respect to the initial acquisition and deployment of two
Justice on Wheels buses and getting the e-library operating, it took until the third year of the
project (August, 2006) to sign a contract of works to construct the Pilot Model Court in Lapu-
Lapu City and the fourth year (October, 2007) to sign the construction contract for the Angeles
City Hall of Justice. Even by the end of the project there has been limited modernization of the
court, case, financial and human resource management systems within the judiciary. And the
administrative decentralization initiative is currently stalled, with the Court yet to decide upon its
approach to, and strategy for, decentralization7.

The overall slow and uneven pace of implementation was reflected in the pattern of project
disbursements. This pattern over time is summarized in Figure 1. Project disbursements were
much slower than was anticipated at appraisal. Only seven percent of the loan proceeds were

  E.g. the Fiscal Management and Budget Office, the Office of Halls of Justice and the Management
Information Systems Office.
7
  The Court spent considerable time and financial resources piloting a Regional Court Administration
Office (RCAO) in Lapu-lapu, with the pilot being abandoned after an evaluation disclosed its
ineffectiveness.


                                                      8
disbursed during the first two years. By the end of 2009 (the original project closing date), total
disbursements amounted to $ 11.7 million, only 53 percent of the total loan amount. The slow
disbursement rate was most acute in the case of works related to the Pilot Model Courts (see
Table 4).

A key recurring feature of implementation has been the frequency with which high-quality
analytical and diagnostic work exploring and evaluating reform options for various aspect of the
overall APJR has either languished with no decision taken on what actions to take or has been
followed by a decision on what options to pursue but then there has been little or no
implementation. Examples include (a) the Enterprise Information Systems Plan (EISP) for 2010-
14 and the associated MISO Re-engineering and Development Plan (MRDP), (b) reengineering
of the Court’s jurisdictional structure, (c) the development of policy options for addressing
affordability constraints to access the court system by the poor, and (d) the development of a
whistleblower system. This highlights two key difficulties. First, rules and procedures have
resulted in decision-making within the Supreme Court on judicial reform (including JRSP-


                                                     9
related) issues often being very slow. Second, even when decisions are made, such as the
adoption of the EISP, there has been limited capacity to manage change and actually implement
institutional reforms.

This pattern of indecision and inaction with regard to system reforms has deprived the project of
opportunities to showcase the intended reforms in court, case, financial and human resource
management which were a central part of the anticipated changes to help improve judicial
performance and access to justice. It has also contributed to delays in the construction of the pilot
Halls of Justice, but the associated delays in institutional developments have been particularly
detrimental to the pursuit of the PDO.

A number of key factors adversely affected implementation:

i.   The cumbersome, slow and unpredictable procurement procedures (with the Court En
     Banc involved in all but relatively small procurements and the Chief Justice involved at
     multiple stages in all procurements) greatly delayed implementation 8 . Significant delays
     arose at all stages of the procurement process: preparation and approval of specifications,
     cost estimates, terms of reference, and waiting for award of prerequisite contracts to
     determine requirements. Furthermore, at times there was a lack of appropriate segregation
     of duties of key Court officials involved in the JRSP. In the words of the Supreme Court
     such “situations and consequent temporary arrangements may have increased risks and have
     given rise to fiduciary issues.”9

     Using the Government Procurement Policy Board’s performance assessment method, gave a
     rating of 1.19 out of 3.00 for the Supreme Court’s Bids and Awards Committee on the APJR
     in 2009. While there was an improvement in 2010, there were still significant weaknesses.
     For example, the average number of days from submission of bids to evaluation of bids was
     60, compared with the standard of 8. Second, the shopping method took an average of four
     to five months from issuance of request for quotation to issuance of contract. The main
     reasons behind this poor procurement performance appear to be (a) frequent turnover of
     members of the BAC; (b) insufficient and ineffective procurement training to new members;
     and – perhaps most important - (c) BAC members’ fear of being exposed to allegations by
     losing bidders or to questions from the Commission on Audit, with the possibility of
     disciplinary proceedings and/or other (even criminal) sanctions. Consequently, decisions
     were delayed and processes prolonged. Also, since bidders came to know that contracts
     would take a long time to be awarded, some potential bidders appear to have chosen not to
     compete (as a result, the average number of bidders remained low for most contracts), while
     others factored the delay in contract award (and disbursement) into their prices.

     The procurement capacity does not appear to have improved in terms of efficiency,
     competitiveness and transparency over the JRSP period. The April 2007 World Bank Mid-
     term review Aide Memoire noted “… the length and time in processing and awarding of
     contracts are beyond the timelines prescribed under the Government Procurement reform
     Act No.9184”. In addressing this, the PMO met with the Government Procurement Policy
     Board to agree on the steps to assist the Supreme Court to improve procurement efficiency”.
     But no discernible improvement resulted. In fact, during 2010-2012 (i.e. the last 2 years of


8
 The assessment of high risk given to procurement capacity at Appraisal turned out to be accurate.
9
  An example of this is when the Chair of the Bids and Awards Committee for the APJR (BAC-APJR) was
also the requestor of the services, the approver of the terms of reference, the end-user of the services
provided by the firm, the authorizer of contract extensions, and the authorizer of payments to the firm.


                                                  10
       the project), the efficiency of key JRSP procurements seems to have declined (in contrast to
       other Bank-financed projects where, during the final years of a project, procurement tends to
       become more efficient due to the increased institutional capacity and proficiency). Most of
       the agreements on timelines for procurement processing and contract awards, which formed
       part of the June 2011 project closing date extension and Loan Agreement amendment, were
       not fulfilled.10

       It is clear that (i) procurement improvements will require significant changes in the Court’s
       processes, practices and mindsets, including delegation of procurement authority to lower
       courts; (ii) the high turnover rate of Bids and Awards Committee (BAC) members must be
       reduced; (iii) the quality of procurement training needs to be improved; and (iv) BAC
       members must be empowered to decide on procurement issues and assured of protection
       against baseless allegations by losing bidders. Without these changes, the Court will
       continue to struggle to operate a timely and effective procurement process.

 ii.   Problems with the winning tender led to delays in constructing the Angeles City Hall of
       Justice and new bidding was needed to complete the construction. After much delay, a
       contract for construction of the Angeles City HOJ was awarded. However, implementation
       problems and a contractual dispute arose and work ceased in September 2009, with
       construction partially completed. Work did not recommence with a new contractor until July
       2011 and was finally completed in May 2012.

iii.   Financial management was marred by unreliable information and a lack of effective
       internal control procedures. In response to significant weaknesses in the Financial
       Management system being identified during preparation11, a financial management capacity
       building component was included in the project12. Unfortunately, though, this was not done
       and no significant progress was made to improve the overall Financial Management system.
       Issues noted during project support missions include: a) inadequate contract management; b)
       ineligible expenditures 13 ; c) un-reconciled fixed asset records and d) long outstanding
       liabilities. The control environment remained weak throughout the life of the project and
       there continued to be inadequate analysis and monitoring of financial data and frequent late
       submission of financial information.




  10
     Only five of the planned 23 contracts identified as part of the second extension to complete priority
  activities were awarded by June 2012.
  11
     These included a) FM organization being not fully staffed and very centralized in the SC main office,
  thereby slowing down transactions; b) weak controls on cash management; c) no clear line of responsibility
  between the Financial Management and Budget Office (FMBO) and the Office of the Court Administrator
  in terms of financial matters involving the lower courts; d) inadequate financial analysis and monitoring; e)
  the absence of a Financial Management Manual and f) an inadequate internal audit function.
  12
     Component B of the project envisaged, among other things, the “development and implementation of a
  financial management improvement program, including reporting and information systems, revenue
  management, fund management, physical asset management and the payroll system for use in selected Pilot
  Model Courts”.
  13
     Ineligible expenditures are expenditures on goods or services other than those eligible under the loan
  agreement and agreed upon in work programs or procurement plans for the intended purposed of the
  project. All ineligible expenditures identified have either been refunded or resolved (e.g., documented or
  justified), and the loan account was officially closed as of August 21, 2013.


                                                       11
        Of the eight annual audit reports submitted, five were submitted late, four have unqualified
        or clean opinions, three have qualified audit opinions and the latest one (i.e. for 2011)
        received an adverse audit opinion.

 iv.    Failure to maintain an adequately staffed Program Management Office severely affected
        implementation during the second half of the project. The PMO was established prior to
        appraisal of the JRSP, and it was well staffed during the early years of implementation.
        Moreover, the PMO was given security by being established as an organic part of the
        Supreme Court’s structure (rather than as a temporary unit) and was paid from the Court’s
        budgetary allocations. However, with the waning of strong support from senior management
        midway through project implementation, PMO positions were frequently not refilled when
        staff left, and the capacity of the PMO declined.

  v.    Lack of clarity surrounding land titling and hence access to land with clear title on which
        to construct Halls of Justice led to the abandonment of efforts to establish a Pilot Hall of
        Justice in Cagayan de Oro within the project time frame. In addition, there was a delay of
        almost 2 years on PHILJA’s part in initiating the process of obtaining clear title to the land
        connected with the refurbishment of the PHILJA Annex Training Facility.

 vi.    The lack of continued strong support from senior management in the Supreme Court as
        changes of Chief Justice brought changes in emphasis and gave rise to a loss of reform
        momentum. In particular, the implementation of reforms slowed after 2006. More broadly,
        the evolving composition of the Supreme Court as a whole appears to have led to a waning
        of enthusiasm for the judicial reforms initiated under the Court’s Action Program for
        Judicial Reform. As mentioned earlier, important achievements were made after 2006, such
        as the completion of the Lapu Lapu City and Angeles City Halls of Justice, but progress
        with institutional reforms under the APJR waned.

vii.    The inability of the Court to begin implementation of an integrated computerised judicial
        information system without repeatedly reviewing and changing plans has led to much
        piloting of different (and fragmented) options but limited actual progress with these core
        reforms. This was in spite of an updated EISP being adopted by the Court En Banc in
        September 2009.

viii.   The inability of the Court to decide on and implement a decentralised basic court, case
        and financial management system has resulted in there still being very limited
        decentralisation. Various options have been explored and a Regional Court Administration
        Office piloted in Lapu-Lapu City, but after the JRSP project closed, decentralisation options
        were referred in late 2012 to yet another committee of the Court for examination. As a result,
        after a decade of efforts, there has yet to be substantive decentralisation.

   One factor that has positively impacted the project and helped sustain an active dialogue of
   judicial reform has been the concurrent rise in momentum for judicial reform and improved
   judicial performance in other countries. The fact that numerous other countries have embarked on
   reform of the judiciary has provided opportunities for cross-country learning. Closely connected
   with this has been continued support from bilateral and multilateral development partners.

   In keeping with slow disbursements and slow implementation of reforms, performance ratings
   during the project period have been disappointing (see Table 5). Moreover, the ratings have
   deteriorated during the latter part of project implementation with the overall achievement of
   development objectives and overall project implementation both being rated “Unsatisfactory”
   during the last two years of the project, i.e. the period of extension.

All performance ratings, except that for counterpart funding, have varied over the project period.
Financial management was assessed to be satisfactory or moderately satisfactory until near the
end. The project’s FM system was considered unsatisfactory in the October 2011 FM
Implementation Review mission due to: (a) delay in the settlement of open contracts, (b) long
outstanding payables, (c) ineligible expenditures, and (d) lapses in internal controls. Procurement
was rated unsatisfactory early on and then moderately unsatisfactory towards the end. Monitoring
and evaluation has been rated unsatisfactory both in the middle of the project and again towards
the end. Moreover, delays in contracting an independent evaluation of the APJR and a second
user survey after the project closure mitigate against arguments for higher ratings since 2012.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

Monitoring and evaluation has varied greatly over the project period, from satisfactory in the
early years to highly unsatisfactory in 2008, back to satisfactory in 2009 and ended up
unsatisfactory in 2012. This reflects the lack of attention to project results collection, monitoring
and reporting.

Even what little M&E information has been available has not been well used to feed back into
management decisions and help guide refinements to the reform program. There have been pilot
testing initiatives in the areas of information and communication technology options and
decentralization, but the outcome of these have not led to timely follow-up decisions and actions
concerning the future direction of reform in these important areas.


                                                 13
The delay in undertaking a second user survey scheduled towards the end of the project, though
for understandable reasons of results being biased by the impeachment process, has severely
compromised the Monitoring and Evaluation effort. As a result, although the contract for the
survey was issued in June 2013, the survey results needed to determine whether some of the
project’s performance indicators have been achieved have not become available in time for ICR
preparation.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

Safeguard compliance has been largely satisfactory overall, though environmental safeguards
were not always consistently observed in a timely manner during the construction of the Halls of
Justice in Lapu-Lapu City and Angeles City, and of the PHILJA training facility. As a result
finalization of the Lapu-Lapu City HOJ was delayed.

Fiduciary issues were generally well-attended to during the first half of the project. However,
fiduciary failures appear to have begun in 2010 and accelerated in 2011. From mid-2010, as
project decision-making became more centralized and PMO capacity deteriorated (along with
PMO attention to fiduciary issues), lack of segregation of functions led to a problematic internal
control environment and attenuated internal checks and balances; some expenditure on ineligible
items, and some retroactive contracts; vendor payments began to be delayed; and project accounts
differences between Court offices remained un-reconciled for prolonged periods. As a result, the
reliability of project financial information deteriorated, and fiduciary risks increased.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

The full potential for improvements in judicial performance is yet to be realized and the Supreme
Court continues to explore initiatives to pursue these and to strengthen society’s confidence.
Given the natural conservative nature of the justice system, reform of the judiciary is
understandably hard and time consuming. And it is an area in which national independence and
sovereignty is highly respected and highly guarded.

Apart from the substantial ongoing support USAID for the computerization of courts, the options
for further support from development partners are unclear at this time. But, given the importance
and the challenges inherent in judicial reforms, this would seem to be a natural area for
development partners to continue to be available to provide support as and when such support can
be helpful and efficiently utilized, with clear results and impact.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation


                                               14
The overall objective of the JRSP – to assist the Philippines in developing a more effective and
accessible Judiciary that would foster public trust and confidence – was strategic and remains
relevant. Moreover, the positioning of this project in support of a Philippine-designed reform
program (the Supreme Court’s APJR) was appropriate. However, in hindsight, the design and
implementation schedule were probably ambitious regarding what institutional reforms were
considered feasible to implement within a six-year period in the Philippines, the delays inherent
in land title complications in the Philippines and a very protracted and centralized procurement
process within the Judiciary. Moreover, the design was vulnerable to the effects of changes in
senior leadership within the Judiciary and the natural resistance to change by judicial and
administrative institutions that are so steeped in tradition. To be successful, the type of far-
reaching institutional reforms supported by the JRSP, needs sustained support from leaders and
champions within and across the Judiciary and from the other branches of government, and it
needs sustained buy-in by administrative units within the judiciary. Meanwhile, the importance
of improvements to judicial performance continues to be so high that it still remains a priority for
the Philippines and for development partner support.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

Overarching Objective. More effective and accessible judicial system

This overarching objective draws on the sum of actions taken to pursue the four subsequent
objectives. Hence, the discussion of actions to achieve this objective is spread over the discussion
of all objectives in the following sub-sections.

There was a study undertaken to explore options for improve access to justice and expedite case
dispensation through re-engineering the Court’s jurisdictional structure but its proposals were
modest and have yet to be acted upon. Meanwhile, vacancy rates for judge positions in lower
courts remains high, at over 20 percent in spite of a very sharp increase in judges’ salaries in 2005.
There was success in reducing the number of vacancies early in the project period, especially in
Regional Courts, but the overall vacancy rate in lower courts has remained high, thus adding to
the excessive workload of judges. Indeed, there continues to be significant vacancy rates for
judge and public prosecutor positions, though the vacancy rates for public defender positions has
fallen in recent years and it appears that there could well be overstaffing among support level
positions.

Areas in which the Philippines has made noticeable changes during the life of this project include
(a) environmental law and (b) the protection of human rights. Environmental law and application
have been strengthened with the development and application of the writs of Amparo and
Kalikasan, while improving the protection of human rights was a Court focus during 2007-9.

Related performance indicators:

   i.    5 percentage-point increase in user satisfaction and confidence in Higher Courts. Not
         achieved. There was improvement in the early years of project implementation, but this
         has not been maintained and has been severely compromised by other events (in
         particular the impeachment of the Chief Justice in 2012) that have distracted the Court
         and adversely affected user satisfaction. In this situation it is impossible to determine
         whether the partial implementation of reforms implemented with project support would
         have, by itself, significantly improved user satisfaction.

         The Social Weather Stations’ net satisfaction rating for the Chief Justice was high in
         2003 (+13 rating) but declined progressively to be very low in 2011 (-44 rating).

  ii.    5 percentage-point increase in user satisfaction and confidence in Pilot model Courts
         relative to the average for lower courts. Achievement uncertain. Though there is some
         survey evidence that user satisfaction has increased by more than 5 percentage points for
         Lapu-Lapu City Courts, there is too little consistent survey data to be definitive. From a
         survey it is clear that the overwhelming majority of court lawyers, litigants, prosecutors,
         police and other stakeholders in the Lapu-Lapu Court (84 percent) in mid-2012 had
         confidence in the impartiality of the Court and that their cases will be solved
         satisfactorily. In reality, though, even the two pilot model courts for which new and
         refurbished building have been completed (Lapu-Lapu City and Angeles City) are still
         not operating as envisaged because the computerisation of information systems and
         improvements in case and court management are only partially in place and the additional
         courtrooms remain empty because the new courts to use them have yet to be created and
         staffed. Hence, with only partial implementation, one would not expect to see the
         anticipated improvement in outcomes.

Objective 1. Improving case adjudication and access to justice.

Though ICT-based court and case management systems have been piloted in Pasay City and
Lapu-Lapu City, and ICT-based systems have been introduced in the Higher Courts, these have
not yet been extended to the lower courts as a whole. Indeed, there is still uncertainty regarding
the IT platform and standards to be adopted for the judiciary as a whole. Moreover, while the
Case Management Information Systems already introduced in the Court of Appeals, the Court of
Tax Appeals and the Supreme Court are operating reasonably effectively, the one in the




                                                 16
Sandiganbayan is not operating well, is not compatible with that in the other Higher Courts, and
the court is in the process of switching to the system used by the other higher courts14.

An overall Enterprise Information Systems Plan (EISP) was prepared for 2010-2014, and
approved by the Supreme Court En Banc in 2009. But this has not been implemented as planned.
Meanwhile, an Enhanced Caseflow Management System (e-CFM) has been pilot tested in Lapu-
Lapu City and Pasay City Trial Courts. The Judiciary’s Management Information Systems Office
(MISO) is working on progressively expanding the enhancement of information systems as
resources allow, but progress has been slower than anticipated or hoped for. To date there has
been limited modernization of court, case, financial and human resource management processes
and systems.

The Court has been quite successful in establishing a Justice on Wheels (JOW) system based on
buses as mobile courts. This began with two buses in 2004 and initial focused on mediation, case
adjudication, and information dissemination. The number of buses has subsequently been
expanded to eight, and the JOW program was enhanced to include medical and dental services for
prisoners (EJOW) in 2007. Moreover, two of the buses have been strategically deployed to
provide court facilities in locations where the existing courtrooms were damaged by natural
disasters. However, the EJOW program has not always been used for the primary purpose of
extending access to justice in under-served areas, as was its original primary focus. It has been
valuable in (a) decongesting selected courts by disposing of cases, (b) helping to decongest
prisons by expediting release of detainees and prisoners and (c) expanding mediation. At times it
appears to have also been used to promote the public profile of senior judicial officials. It even
seems possible that prison releases and case disposals may have been timed on occasions to
coincide with the visit of EJOW mobile courts, thus enhancing publicity. In the absence of data
on geographical deployment, downtime, EJOW operating costs and concurrent case disposals by
adjacent courts, it is not possible to assess the cost-effectiveness and impact of the EJOW
program.15

A key focus of efforts to decongest court dockets has been on small claims cases. Following the
promulgation of simplified Rules and Procedures for Small Claims Cases in 2008, and initial
piloting with USAID support, the small claims case management system (SC2MS in Court
parlance) initiative was expanded to a further 800 lower courts with IT equipment financed by the
JRSP and associated training during 2011 and 2012 (see Figure 2). This opportunistic support for
an initiative that could make a significant impact on case decongestion has led to a sharp rise in
the timeliness of small claims case dispensation, as many cases that would otherwise appear in
the caseload of Metropolitan and Municipal Trial Courts have been handled under these new
procedures. The rise in pending small claims court cases (Table 8) has been more than offset by a
sharp fall in pending cases in Metropolitan and Municipal Trial Courts (see Table 10).




14
   Although the Sandiganbayan had piloted the introduction of ICT-based case management systems
several years ago, the situation has so deteriorated that the court now operates a manual paper-based system
(including for case assignment and case management).
15
   This data has been requested from the PMO and OCA for more than a year but has not yet been received.

The most recent initiative to help improve the timeliness of case dispensation is the empowering
of judges to accept depositions in place of face-to-face evidence from witnesses. However, while
this is welcomed by judges and has the potential to speed up case hearings, much will depend on
whether needed expansion in capacity in the prosecutors’ offices and the public defendants’
offices is forthcoming to make the realization of potential court time saving possible.

Related performance indicators:

  i.      At least a 10 percentage reduction in case processing time (including mediation time
          from cases filed to closing of file) in Higher Courts. Achieved for the Court of Tax
          Appeals only. The Court of Tax Appeals has successfully reduced case management
          time by about 20 percent from 2003 to 2012 through improved case management
          supported by computerised information systems. Though there was progress in reducing
          case processing time for the Supreme Court during the first half of the project
          implementation period this has slipped back during the latter years as the momentum for
          reform waned and the Court became increasingly distracted by impeachment proceedings
          against the Chief Justice. The Court of Appeals has been successful in computerising
          information systems. However, the average case management time has increased by
          nearly 80 percent between 2003 and 2012. Similarly, the Sandiganbayan has actually
          experienced a marked increase in average case processing time (38 percent between 2003
          and 2012). Improvements in information technology have led to improvements in case
          tracking, but there does not appear to have been a resulting improvement in case
          processing time except for the impressive achievements with regard to small claims cases.
          However, increased success with the disposal of aged cases (especially for the
          Sandiganbayan), which is part of the reform effort supported by the JRSP, has militated
          against reductions in average case management time. To fully assess the impact on case
          management times it would be necessary to disaggregate the data and separate out


                                                    19
           dealing with aged cases, thus providing more nuanced information on case management
           time.

           The Supreme Court’s view is that “the more efficient tracking and disposition of aged
           cases, which could be partly attributed to the reform initiatives under the JRSP,
           accounted for the unexpected increase (and therefore, an ostensible and seeming
           deterioration) in the average case processing time for the Higher Courts, particularly for
           the Sandiganbayan. This is so because only when cases are disposed will they be
           counted/included in the computation of this indicator. Thus, as more aged cases are being
           disposed, they tend to increase the value of the indicator.”16

           Note: While the lower courts (Regional Trial Courts, and Metropolitan and Municipal Trial
           Courts) do submit semi-annual docket inventory information to OCA, this is not processed in a
           manner that yields information on average case processing time.18

     ii.   At least a 10 percentage reduction in case backlogs in Pilot Model Courts relative to
           the average for lower courts. Partially achieved. While there has been a 27 percent
           decrease since 2004 for Lapu-Lapu City, there has as yet been little change for Angeles
           City. However, the intention of this was to assess the impact of Pilot Model Courts and it
           is premature to evaluate this because they are not yet fully operational. While the
           buildings have been physically completed the agreed systems improvements that were the
           core of the Pilot Model are only partially in place. Moreover, additional courts in these
           premises are yet to be authorised and staffed.

           It seems likely that the decongestion of Lapu-Lapu City Courts to date is attributable to a
           combination of a targeted judicial audit with close monitoring of case management
           initiated in 2010 and the new provisions for handled small claims cases.

   Supreme Court email of September 20, 2013 and letter of September 23, 2013

   Average in years
18
   The Supreme Court Program Management Office has clarified in its email of September 20, 2013 that
the “values for the average case processing time for the regional trial courts (second level) and
metropolitan/municipal trial courts (first level) could not be generated from the records of the Office of the
Court Administrator (OCA). The monthly report of cases submitted by the first and second level courts
primarily contains only the number of cases disposed, pending and beyond the prescribed period for
promulgation (i.e., backlog). The difficulty also stems from the fact that there are no "systems" being used
by the OCA to be able to determine the average case processing time, nor an electronic database of the
"Docket Inventory" submitted semi-annually by the lower court judges. Incidentally, the docket inventory
contains information on the cases that could actually be used to determine the case processing time. Finally,
the OCA-Court Management Office's present operations do not include such docket analysis. Docket
inventory reports are mainly just compiled and copies are retrieved only when requested during judicial
audits for verification of cases disposed by specific judges.”

          It is only in the Metropolitan and Municipal Trial Courts that there has been a significant
          and sustained reduction in cases pending in Philippine courts (see Table 10). In contrast,
          Regional Trial Courts, the Court of Tax Appeals, the Sandiganbayan and the Supreme
          Court have all had an increase in cases pending. There was a reduction between 2004 and
          2008 for both the Supreme Court and the Court of Tax Appeals, but these gains have
          since been reversed. However, it is noted that this rise in the number of cases before the
          senior courts does not necessarily mean that there has been an increase in case processing
          time, as it may be due to an increase in the number of new cases.

          highlighting the unfortunate dependence of EJOW activity on regular involvement of
          Supreme Court Justices and senior officials. One would have anticipated that the EJOW
          Program would have been operating effectively and sustainably without intensive
          involvement by high-level Supreme Court officials well before now.

Objective 2. Enhancing institutional integrity.

The development and adoption of a Code of Conduct for Court Personnel and a new Code of
Judicial Conduct for the Philippine Judiciary by April 2004 demonstrated early intent with regard
to this objective. Moreover, there has been extensive in-service training of court personnel,
especially in the early years of the project. Second, a gender sensitive Human Resource
Development Plan was developed and adopted by 2006. A Strategic Gender and Development
Mainstreaming Plan had been adopted in 2004 recognizing the important role of women. Third,
there have been important JRSP-financed investments in computers, distance learning equipment,
building refurbishment and furniture to complement the Japan-funded new building to strengthen
PHILJA.

The initial push to enhance integrity has not been well supported by effective follow-up training,
by the effective implementation of a computerized court management system, or by the
establishment of more user-friendly alternative feedback mechanisms. The technical working
group responsible for exploring options for establishing an improved whistleblowing system
submitted its findings the Court En Banc in 2009, but a decision is still pending.

Finally, the computers and distance learning equipment purchased as part of strengthening
PHILJA has been of limited value because there was no internet connection available at PHILJA
until May 2013. While the new general training rooms at PHILJA are being quite well utilized,
the 64 computers placed in a dedicated computer training room have only been used once till
March 2013 since they were purchased 2.5 years ago.

Related performance indicators:

   i.   50 percent of judges and other court personnel receiving training on Code of Ethics.
        Achieved. Widespread training (97 per cent of court personnel) has been undertaken, but
        the achievement of a sustained outcome impact is less clear as there has been limited
        follow-up.

  ii.   Implementation of a gender sensitive Human Resource Development Master Plan.
        Achieved. A five-year gender-sensitive HRD plan was developed by 2006 and circulars
        issued implementing it. Moreover, there has been an expansion of in-service training of
        judges and court personnel with PHILJA being heavily involved and the establishment of
        an e-library has sharply improved the availability of timely information to judges.
        However, while the judiciary has been successful in advancing gender balance and
        making more timely information and training more available, ongoing effort is needed to
        achieve genuine and sustained improvements in human resources.

Objective 3. Strengthening institutional capacity.

The establishment of an e-library was an impressive early achievement by the Court. This e-
library has made Supreme Court decisions widely available much more quickly than had been the
case through the compilation of printed books. As can be seen from Table 12, usage of this e-
library expanded rapidly during the 2004-2006 period, and has continued to expand since.

A Regional Court Administration Office was piloted in Lapu-Lapu City but then closed following
evaluation. Meanwhile, all options for decentralization, including the roll-out of regional court
administration offices and more direct decentralization to individual Hall of Justice sites, are
being reviewed by a new Committee on decentralization established by the Supreme Court En
Banc in January 2013. However, this committee does not include the type of outside expertise on
administrative options and change management that one might expect for a fully informed review.

As yet the contracting of all court services for all lower courts, from security to cleaning, canteen,
building maintenance and common use supplies is still centralized in Manila. This has continued
to frustrate lower court officials and impede the timely response to needs as they arise. In spite of
what appear to be clear potential benefits to judicial service delivery, there has yet to be
substantive decentralization of court administration. Meanwhile, local government units continue
to be a source of material support to lower level courts, thus creating the possibility of a conflict
of interest when cases before the court involve local governments or their officials.

As mentioned in section 2, the planned development and implementation of a financial
management improvement program has not materialized. Financial management capacity within
the Supreme Court was weak when the project was prepared and it still is. Analytical work on
financial management was undertaken with support from the Asian Development Bank but there
has been no resulting change22.

Though the buildings are now complete for two of the three planned Pilot Model Courts (Lapu-
Lapu City and Angeles City), this has been a slow and challenging process. Plans to construct the
Pilot Model Court for Cagayan de Oro City were abandoned in 2005 due to an inability to resolve
issues regarding land title. This was replaced by a plan to construct a Pilot Model Court in Manila,
but after extensive preparation and protracted debate over two potential sites, the actual
construction of a much-needed new Hall of Justice for Manila has been deferred beyond the time
frame for the JRSP. Meanwhile, the process of designing and constructing the two Pilot Model
Court buildings has resulted in improvements in the standard HOJ design template. Such
improvements, showcased in Angeles City and Lapu-Lapu City, include making access to the
Clerks of Court more user-friendly, provision for information near the entrance (though there is
little information actually available on site as yet), and facilities for detainees.

The completion of these Pilot Model Court buildings does not, however, constitute the full
establishment of the planned Pilot Model Courts, as the associated systems changes (court, case,
financial and human resource management and systems) are yet to be fully implemented. Hence,
while judges and staff working in these locations are delighted to have the new facilities it is
premature to say that the Pilot Model Courts are fully operational. For example, the Pilot Model
Courts in Lapu-Lapu City and Angeles City have yet to include genuine decentralization of
administration from Manila. Additional IT capacity has been provided, but the full potential of a
streamlined court and case management system is yet to be realized. Finally, the additional
courtrooms that have been constructed remain empty because the laws to establish additional
courts for these facilities are yet to be passed. Thereafter, it will take at least two years to recruit
the additional judges and court staff.

Related performance indicators:

      i.   Completion and testing of Pilot Model Courts with provision of modern case
           management systems, decentralized administration and financial management systems,
           and adequate physical infrastructure. Not satisfied. While the Pilot Model Court
           buildings are complete for two of the three sites – Lapu-Lapu City and Angeles City –
           anticipated systems changes provision, such as modern case management, is only
           partially in place and these sites do not yet have decentralized administration and
           financial management systems.

     ii.   5 percentage-point increase in user satisfaction with Pilot Model Courts after first year
           of their operation. Not yet applicable, as none of the Pilot Model Courts are not yet
           fully operational.


Objective 4. Assist in strengthening support for the reform process.

There has been knowledge sharing with such widespread foreign jurisdictions as Venezuela,
Guatemala, Mexico, Spain, Egypt, South Africa and China. Philippine justices have participated
in Asia Pacific Judicial Reform Forums in Sydney (2006) Kuala Lumpur (2007), Singapore
(2008) and Beijing (2010) and a Distinguished Lecture series featuring notable international
speakers was established.

During project preparation, and till about early 2010, the Supreme Court actively coordinated
relatively wide-ranging stakeholder consultations to explore options and garnish support for
reforms, but this was not sustained thereafter. Thereafter, a succession of events placed this
process on the back burner due to the judicial leadership’s other preoccupations.23 Knowledge



23
   Some may ask whether project design should have included the continuation of stakeholder
consultations as some sort of condition for continuing or extending the project. However, doing so would
have implied a lack of confidence that the Supreme Court would continue doing what it was already doing
and was explicitly committed to as part of its APJR. Not only was the overall reform program designed and
being led by the Supreme Court but an ongoing consultation process was part of this and was already
operating. The falling off in consultations was a casualty of developments in the Court from early 2010
onwards, developments that could not have been anticipated and which would almost certainly have
curtailed consultations irrespective of how they had been specified in project design. From early 2010, the
Court leadership was first immobilized and then in a state of siege, due to successive developments (the
impending retirement of the Chief Justice in May 2010, the succession process, the appointment of a new
Chief Justice in May 2010, his impeachment in December 2011 and conviction in May 2012, the


                                                    24
sharing was part of consultations within the judiciary during the early years of the project, and
there has been assistance in using new ICT equipment.

The assessment of possible impacts of the APJR on the judiciary’s personnel and the subsequent
preparation and implementation of an impact mitigation program that was included in Component
D of the JRSP was not undertaken. This deprived the Court of a way to allay the concerns of
anyone who felt that their employment and livelihood might be adversely affected by its reform
program.

Establishment of the Program Management Office provided a much needed capacity to facilitate
reform initiatives and help coordinate development partner support, but its capacity was
undermined during the second half of the project period through reductions in staffing, the loss of
key expertise and protracted delays is decision making by the Court.

Related performance indicators:

  i.    Maintenance of an active institutionalized program of public education, knowledge
        sharing, consultations, citizen feedback and dissemination of results. Initially
        satisfactory, but has become unsatisfactory in the later years of the project. Though
        such initiatives were undertaken during the early years of the project this effort has
        waned as changes in Judicial leadership successively changed the pace and focus of
        reforms. The initial user survey undertaken in 2006, but the contract for the second one
        was not issued until June 2013, with the result being a lack of data on outcomes and
        impacts. This has deprived the Court of valuable feedback. As a result, although the
        contract for the survey was issued in June 2013, the survey results needed to determine
        whether some of the project’s performance indicators have been achieved have not
        become available in time for ICR preparation.

3.3 Efficiency

No cost benefit analysis has been done for this project, at appraisal or on completion, as it is very
difficult to reliably estimate the economic and social benefits. In addition it is very difficult to
accurately attribute benefits to JRSP initiatives when it is part of a wider APJR. However, it was
anticipated that the fiscal cost of this project ($24.4 million) would be more than offset by
increased tax revenue due to improved compliance, increased revenue from court fees and
improvements in the efficiency of judicial operations. In retrospect it is very difficult to even
confirm this. Overall tax revenue has certainly increased but even if one could estimate what
share of this was due to improved compliance, it would not be possible to estimate with
confidence what part of this improved compliance was due to the project. Similarly, while
revenue form court fees has increased one cannot confidently determine how much of this
increase was attributable to the project.

What is clear is that delays, difficulties and disappointments discussed elsewhere in the report
have reduced the efficiency of the project from what it could have been. Changes in the level of
support from senior Court Management for the originally designed APJR, very protracted
procurement and decision making processes often involving the Court En Banc, inherent
institutional reluctance to change, and a tendency to examine some options (e.g. decentralization)
repeatedly and defer decisions have undermined the efficiency of this project. So too has the


appointment of a new Chief Justice in August 2012 and the subsequent healing process) which effectively
focused judicial leadership inward rather than outward.


                                                  25
 dependence of the judiciary on other parts of government for complementary actions, such as the
 creating of additional courts and judge positions, and a lack of continued effective coordination of
 development partner support.

 3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

 Rating: Unsatisfactory.

 Though there have been some significant achievements under the program, the majority of
 development outcome objectives are yet to be achieved. This rating is consistent with ratings
 given in implementation status and results reports during the latter years of implementation of the
 project (see table 13). Moreover, contracts for the independent evaluation and user survey were
 not signed until June 2013, 11 months after the project closing date.

 Although the refurbished and extended Halls of Justice are now completed in Lapu-Lapu City and
 Angeles City, the envisaged Pilot Model Courts in these locations are still not fully operational as
 the anticipated improvements in case, court, financial, and human resource management systems
 are yet to be fully implemented and the additional courtrooms that have been constructed remain
 empty because the additional courts that would use these facilities have not yet been established
 by the legislature. Similarly, though computerization has come to the Higher Courts, its potential
 is only partly being used. Hence, not surprisingly, the targeted reductions in case backlog have
 not been achieved. Second, PHILJA is now well-equipped with a distance learning center and
 computers for training, but delays in gaining access to internet facilities have severely limited the
 value of computer training and left the distance learning center inoperative until May 2013. Third,
 while the e-library, Justice on Wheels and small claims court improvements are noteworthy, the
 lack of a Model Pilot Court in Cagayan de Oro City deprives the Court of an opportunity to
 showcase reforms in Mindanao. Fourth, though a new Code of Conduct has been adopted and
 widespread initial training undertaken, this has not been followed up and complemented by
 improvements in feedback mechanisms and an increase in the general perceptions regarding the
 Judiciary Fifth, though electronic recording of fee payments has been introduced along with
 electronic payments to staff, there is little genuine decentralization of administrative decisions
 and little real change to budget and financial management practices.

This project was not designed to directly impact poverty though an improvement in business
confidence and governance in general would accompany improved performance by the judiciary
would indirectly benefit the poor. However, the recent focus of small claims cases and the
substantial number of such cases resolved with project support through computerisation have
directly benefited the poor and near poor. And, with the adoption of a new gender-sensitive
Human Resource Master Plan, the Judiciary’s gender balance has been further strengthened.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

Institutional change and strengthening has been a core part of this project and hence pervades
much of the broader discussion of development outcome objectives and outcomes. As highlighted
in various places in this report, institutional change has fallen well short of what was hoped for.
PHILJA’s capacity has been markedly enhanced. The establishment of a Program Management
Office was an early enhancement of institutional strengthening but its capacity and influence
waned during the second half of the project period. The widespread increase in computer use
through all levels of the judiciary has enhanced capacity, as has the expansion of training efforts
and the e-library. But the continued lack of a well-integrated and well-coordinated ICT system in
operation limits the full power of this greater availability of computer hardware. After extensive
deliberations regarding decentralization, court administration and decisions regarding the
provision of basic HOJ services continued to be highly centralized and a limitation on the
efficiency of lower courts.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

One of the most significant outcomes of the JRSP has been the heightened level of discussion and
awareness throughout the judiciary of the need for reforms to improve judicial performance. The
project has resulted in the Bank being very actively involved in a substantive dialogue with the
Court en Banc, with the appellate and lower courts, and with the various administrative units of
the Court on reform options and implementation for the past decade.

The most visible unintended outcome and impacts are probably the success of the Small Claims
Cases and the rise in successful mediation. Both have important effects on the access to justice,
especially by the poor and near-poor.

In addition to the above, the perspective of the Supreme Court on the project’s unintended
benefits and consequences (expressed at page 30 of the Borrower Contribution at Annex 9) is also
worth recording: “There are, however, benefits and opportunities derived from the Project that
were not captured by the performance indicators. From the consultations done in the two pilot
model courts, the psychic reward of an improved court image, the physical comfort, the
improvements in work efficiency, the stronger commitment to live up to the image of a model
court, the happy faces of those transacting business with the court are just examples of effects not
captured by the indicators nor measured under the surveys. Better cooperation and relationship
with the LGU was also mentioned as a positive effect since the LGU also shares in the improved
image and prestige. Cases brought to mediation improved in success rates. The Public Attorney's
Office (P AO) reported that they are able to help more indigent litigants and do not mind the late
work hours because of the better work environment and space for the lawyers and the litigants.
Because of the privacy now being enjoyed, the litigants are more candid which result in faster
ways of disposing cases. The one stop concept of the pilot court added to the court's accessibility
and effectiveness in dealing with its clients. (Annex 12 for Highlights of recent FGDs in Angeles
and Lapu-lapu HoJs). The experience of managing and implementing a reform process with all
the successes, challenges and constraints is an invaluable gain in knowledge, behavior and skills


                                                27
outside of the expected benefits from the Project. The training[s] done under the Project have
provided opportunities for self-improvement among the judges and the court personnel.”

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

A stakeholder workshop was organized by the Supreme Court in June 2012 in Cebu, where
current and former Chief Justices, Justices, judges, other stakeholders (from justice-related
entities such as the Department of Justice, the DILG, prosecution, public defenders, probation
officers, Ombudsman Office etc.) were invited, along with the Bank and other development
partners who had supported the APJR. The workshop was largely attended, and the key items for
discussion related to the implementation experience and lessons to be drawn from the APJR and
the JRSP.

Other than the above, no beneficiary survey or stakeholder workshop has been undertaken as part
of preparation for this ICR.


4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: Substantial

All eight of the risks identified at Appraisal and reviewed in Table 3 of this report persist (see
Section 2). Not only has progress been slow and modest, but some of the gains achieved have not
been maintained and continued progress with efforts to improve judicial performance and build
public confidence in the judiciary remain vulnerable to significant risks. Sustainability remains
uncertain.

One risk that is dramatically reduced with the appointment of the current Chief Justice is that
arising from successive changes in Chief Justice, as there should not be any further change for
more than a decade. This continuity and stability in Supreme Court leadership would help
achieve sustained reforms provided other risks are contained. Furthermore, this stability of
Supreme Court senior management would provide a sound foundation for renewed coordination
of development partner assistance.

Achieving renewed and unified support from the Court en Banc for reforms is also uncertain. All
but one of the Associate Justices of the Supreme Court are new since the Court’s Action Program
for Judicial Reform was launched more than a decade ago. And there are varying degrees of
enthusiasm for reforms among the existing Supreme Court Justices. Moreover, uncertainties
arising from continuing changes to the Court as members reach the compulsory retirement age
will persist.

With the mid-term elections just completed there are now three years before the next Presidential
election, thus providing a period of stability on that front too. Meanwhile, a growing economy
with rising tax revenues should enable government to provide funding for continued improvement
in judicial facilities, equipment and human resource development. Hopefully, during this period
of relative stability, the various parts of government as a whole will find a way to more
effectively work together to address the need for adjustment to the number and location of
Regional and Municipal Trial Courts, as this has not kept pace with the evolving number and
geographic distribution of court cases.




                                               28
Though there is recognition of the need for concurrent and complementary reforms to the
Department of Justice the actual achievement of this change to alleviate constraints associate with
the capacity of the prosecution and public defenders offices also constitutes a risk. And the same
applies to the capacity of the police and prisons. Without concurrent improvements in other areas
of the justice system, a perfect judiciary would be unable to achieve the desired development
objectives in terms of access to justice and public trust.

Uncertainty also persists with regard to the future role, functions and capacity of the Program
Management Office. As mentioned earlier, its capacity has waned in recent years. If there is to be
a renewed judicial reform effort, the capacity to coordinate and monitor this effort will need to be
strengthened and a renewed PMO could be central to this. There is also need for a strategic
planning capacity within the judiciary and it may be possible for the PMO to evolve into this if
provided with suitable capacity, support and personnel.

The benefits of further reform will depend very heavily on the extent of those reforms.
Substantive reform of court, case, financial, and human resource management systems are needed
to achieve major improvements in judicial performance, and more timely access to justice.
Decentralization of court management is needed to meet day-to-day operating needs of courts
more effectively. Yet the nature and extent of decentralization to be implemented remains
unknown. The desired direction of information and communications systems improvements is
clearer but will likely take considerable time, as the provision of needed resources and the
capacity to implement such capacity improvements is limited.

Lastly, sustaining efforts to improve human resources will be an on-going challenge and hence
also constitutes an ongoing risk. Integrity training and feedback mechanisms need regular
maintenance and, while significant progress has been made, there is no certainty that this will be
maintained. There is yet to be a sustained reduction in vacancies rates for lower court judge
positions to the desired low levels though salaries have been sharply increased.


5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

Key aspects of project preparation have been reviewed in sections 1 and 2.1. Not only was this
project in direct support of the Philippine-initiated APJR, thereby reflecting strong Philippine
ownership, but it was well-grounded in background diagnostic work and complied well with other
lessons learned from elsewhere. Users were engaged in widespread consultations and involved in
the design of reforms. Absorptive capacity was considered in sequencing implementation as was
compatible with local culture. And the early achievement of results was targeted to reinforce
momentum and strengthen support for on-going reform.

In hindsight, there were four weaknesses in project design. First there was a degree of
compromise in that while many in the judiciary saw the construction of new court buildings as the
most important component of the project, the judicial leadership and the Bank viewed systems
improvement (i.e. of court, case, financial and human resource management) as the highest
priority. The buildings were to have been a means of showcasing these reforms. This difference
in emphasis has lived on throughout the project and is reflected in the observation made in this
ICR that the Pilot Model Courts in Lapu-Lapu City and Angeles City are still incomplete because



                                                29
the systems reforms are largely yet to occur. Second, key risks were clearly identified (see Table
3), but effective options for sheltering the project from the majority of them were not developed.
Hence, as many of these risks became reality they have limited project achievement and
outcomes. Third, there is a disconnect between the project being in a sense a pilot and the
overarching PDO and relatively broad performance indicators. The PDO was taken from the
overarching APJR – the development of a more effective and accessible judicial system that
would foster public trust and confidence – when something more limited to the actual scope of
the project would perhaps have been more appropriate. Though the JRSP was a substantial
injection of loan funds supporting institutional systems reform showcased in Pilot Model Courts
it was well short of what would be needed to make a major dent in either the physical and
information infrastructure needs of the judiciary, or in court performance in terms of backlog
reduction/case processing times. Thus it was overly ambitious to expect it to achieve this PDO.
Fourth, insufficient attention was given to the potential difficulties arising from unclear land
titling. This was not highlighted as a risk, which it was, as evidenced by the inability to proceed
with construction of the Cagayan de Oro City Hall of Justice.

(b) Quality of Supervision

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

The substantive high quality dialogue on JRSP issues that has characterized supervision of this
project is a credit to the Supreme Court and the World Bank implementation support team. There
have been challenging issues to deal with and numerous changes in personnel in the Supreme
Court and its administrative units and in the World Bank team. Yet the mutual commitment to
improving judicial performance and interest in Philippine development more broadly, together
with mutual respect and appreciation, has underpinned a high quality dialogue. Within the
framework of the JRSP, the Bank provided the Court with valuable analytical and technical
advice while appreciating the independence of the judiciary and respecting its leadership of
reforms.

Implementation support missions twice each year were complemented by substantial additional
support provided electronically, from the World Bank’s Office in Manila and through the
Supreme Court’s active participation in the World Bank’s knowledge-sharing initiatives such as
the Justice Sector Peer-Assisted Learning (JUSTPAL) Network. Indeed, the Bank’s task team
leader was resident in Manila for a substantial part of the project life. In keeping with the
recognized strategic importance of judicial reform, the Bank provided an unusually large and
intensive overall amount of implementation support and supervision for this project, and there
was an unusually large and prolonged involvement of relatively senior Bank personnel.
Moreover, implementation support was for a longer period than expected because the closing date
was extended by 2.5 years. In reality, the Bank has been responsive to the Court’s needs and
requests throughout the project period through the length, volume and intensity of the technical
support provided.

Aide Memoires of implementation support missions provided clear recommendations and
guidance. Difficulties were well documented and suggestions provided. Moreover, there has been
diligent follow up of issues until solutions are found. The latest such example is the need for the
PHILJA training center to have clear title to the land on which it is built, an issue that has
persisted well past the closing date for the project.

Implementation support from the Bank consistently highlighted the importance of ICT and
advocated the strengthening of MISO. Similarly, the importance of improving judiciary



                                                30
procurement and financial management, together with options for doing do, features frequently in
dialogue.

Implementation Status Reports became progressively more detailed over the course of the project.
However, they did not always provide a full explanation of why Implementation Performance
ratings changed. For example, monitoring and evaluation ratings changed from satisfactory one
year (2007) to highly unsatisfactory the next, and changed almost every year of the project, yet
the reason for these changes is not well documented.

As discussed in section 2 on implementation the project was extended twice, the second time with
a narrowing of the project scope to complete construction of the Angeles City Hall of Justice
building plus a very limited set of activities to smooth project completion. However, there was no
concurrent updating of the Project Development Objectives in spite of the fact that the initial
overarching PDO was overly ambitious.

While the disappointing lack of reforms and improvements in judicial performance renders the
overall development outcome of the JRSP unsatisfactory this does not offset the high quality of
implementation support provided by the Bank and the sustained high quality dialogue. One could
well argue that the quality of supervision has been fully satisfactory, though a rating of
moderately satisfactory is proposed here.

The Supreme Court assessed Bank performance on quality of supervision at page 25 of its ICR
Contribution as follows: “The Bank's implementation assistance had been helpful and timely in
identifying operational issues and constraints, and in providing the necessary suggestions to
address the issues. The details are documented in the Aides Memoire of the ISR Missions
covering the period of JRSP implementation.” The Court also opined, at page 35, that “The
Bank's ISR24 reports provided a wealth of useful information on project issues and advice.
These reports should have been taken seriously and agreements monitored and evaluated for
actions taken.”

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

As noted above this project was designed in support of an overarching Action Program for
Judicial Reform that had been designed by the judiciary and was already being implemented with
support from a number of development partners. At the time of negotiations the JRSP met the
criteria for a successful project - (a) a high level of national ownership of and commitment to
reform, (b) reaching out and working with users in the design and implementation of reform, (c)
being mindful of absorptive capacity in sequencing implementation, (d) achieving results to
reinforce momentum and support for on-going reform, and (e) ensuring that reforms were
compatible with local institutional culture and reality. There were significant risks that were well
documented in the Project Appraisal Document, but effective risk mitigation actions were not
developed.

Throughout the life of the JRSP, the Bank provided high quality and intensive implementation
support and maintained a constant substantive dialogue on judicial reform with frequently

                                                    31
changing personnel in the Supreme Court and its key administrative units. However, this support
was not effective in achieving the substantive reforms targeted for project support.


5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance

Rating: Not rated

As the Judiciary is an independent and autonomous part of government as whole, the government
(defined in this case to be the executive and legislative branches) has taken a modest role in this
project. As the conduit for loan funds and the provider of budgetary resources, the executive was
consistently supportive. But the executive and legislative branches of government did not
provide timely support when it came to creating new courts to operate in the newly constructed
courtrooms in Lapu-Lapu and Angeles City. Furthermore, there has been a lack of coordinated
engagement by all three branches in establishing a country-wide needs-driven system for
determining the number and location of courts (including consolidation of courts where needed)
as population density and caseloads vary over time. These challenges inevitably militated against
the smooth and timely implementation of judicial reforms and hence the project’s attainment of
targeted outcomes. It is in keeping with the independence of the judiciary and the modest
involvement of government in the JRSP, that government performance be not rated.

(b) Implementing Agency Performance

Rating: Unsatisfactory

As discussed throughout the first four sections of this report, the Court was substantially less
effective in implementing JRSP-financed institutional reforms and civil works than was
anticipated. Even by the end of the twice-extended closing date, reform achievements were
modest. Much of the Court’s original APJR remains a work in progress, as does important parts
of what this Judicial Reform Support Project was designed to support. Equally disappointing is
the fact that the Court is probably no better equipped to implement such a project successfully
and in a timely manner now than it was when the JRSP began because key aspects of institutional
capacity have not been strengthened.

Implementation was very slow, leading to two extensions of the closing date. Problems with land
titling resulted in one of the three Pilot Model Court sites being abandoned mid-project. Then,
after substantial preparation and feasibility studies the alternative of constructing new facilities
for the Regional and Metropolitan Trial Courts in Manila was deferred beyond the life of the
project because of Court flip-flops during 2009-2011 on finally deciding on a site. Despite
adopting an ICT policy and strategy in September 2009, the Court’s inability to implement a
judiciary-wide ICT-based case, financial and human resource management system with
substantial decentralization in a timely manner has deprived it of an opportunity to fully leverage
and showcase, through the JRSP, the potential benefits of such reforms. In general, high-quality
diagnostic analysis and planning has been completed on many areas for reform, but this has not
been followed through by actual reform implementation. Nevertheless, there continues to be an
active dialogue exploring options for further improving judicial performance.

At the time of project closing in June 2012, both the Bank and the Court agreed that in view of
the special circumstances, the Court, as a special case and in an effort to get basic minimum
information for the ICR, would utilize the unspent JRSP GOP allocations beyond the closing date


                                                32
to finance and complete three delayed activities. These were to be completed by December 31,
2012, and comprised (i) an independent evaluation of the APJR, (ii) the final user survey, and (iii)
a consultant to prepare the Borrower’s contribution to the ICR. Accordingly the Bank, at the
request of the Court, extended the ICR completion deadline to March 31, 2013, and finally to
September 30, 2013 after the Court informed the Bank that contracting for these three
assignments would take more time than anticipated. However the APJR independent evaluation
and the user survey were not contracted until June 2013 thus depriving this ICR of relevant data
and information that could have informed the assessment and ratings.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

Rating: Unsatisfactory

The very slow progress with project implementation, the incompleteness of associated
institutional reforms, delays in the completion of ICR-related actions and lack of information/data
needed for a more complete assessment of project components (e.g. data on mobile courts) leads
to the overall rating of unsatisfactory. There have been numerous factors (such as successive
changes in Supreme Court leadership, and the impeachment of the Chief Justice during the final
year of the project) contributing to this, but understanding the causes does not elevate this to a
satisfactory performance.

Key capacities that are essential for effective project implementation, such as financial
management and timely procurement, have consistently fallen short and have not been adequately
strengthened during the project period as was hoped. Lack of success in moving from top class
analytical work on reform options to the actual implementation of preferred options persists and
has hampered to pursuit of development outcomes.


6. Lessons Learned

It may be more reasonable to refer to these as lessons reinforced rather than lessons learned from
the experience of this project. They reflect various aspects of what could be considered key
foundations for effective and sustained institutional reform, and in some cases link directly with
risks identified during project preparation. It was known at the outset that this was a high-risk but
high-potential reward project and indeed implementation delays and the limited nature of clear
sustained development outcomes from the project have been consistent with this concern.

     a) Strong and consistent support from the Chief Justice and the Court En Banc is
        essential for sustained reform. Judicial reform, including this project, enjoyed this type
        of strong support during the first three years of this project but less so in the subsequent
        years. Indeed, at the turn of the century the Chief Justice was instrumental in preparation
        of the umbrella APJR and initiating its implementation. The waning of senior Court
        management support 25 (and indeed from the Court as a whole) for the reforms as
        envisaged at the start of the project, reduced attainment of the project’s development
        outcomes.



25
   This occurred after the first few years of the project with successive Chief Justices bringing somewhat
different and generally more modest reform visions. There were five Chief Justices during the eight and a
half years of the JRSP whereas it was anticipated that there would only be two during the originally
planned six-year project.


                                                   33
     b) When key capacities (such as financial management and timely procurement
        processes) necessary for effective project implementation are weak at the start,
        success with early efforts to build them is essential. Protracted procurement procedures
        and time-consuming management processes requiring heavy involvement by senior
        officials can undermine reform momentum and project results. Delays in finalising
        procurement arrangements for the construction and renovation of Halls of Justice for
        Lapu-Lapu City and Angeles City did not avoid problems during construction. But they
        did delay construction and hence the pursuit of early achievements. Similarly, inadequate
        financial management arrangements and capacity have hampered fiduciary monitoring
        and management controls.
     c) Project design could build in ‘circuit breakers’ to allow disengagement during
        project implementation if certain key assumptions are not fulfilled, or unforeseen
        events occur. In the case of the JRSP, such a ‘circuit breaker’ was inserted during the
        second extension (in the form of dated covenants to enable the Bank to cancel loan
        proceeds if the contracts for associated activities were not signed by agreed dates). In
        hindsight, given the independence of the judiciary and the reluctance of executive
        oversight bodies to intervene in projects implemented by the Supreme Court, it would
        have been helpful for such provisions to have been inserted in the legal documents at the
        outset, so that the Court or the Bank could have avoided – until too late - becoming
        locked into an unsatisfactory situation from which there was no escape for any of the
        parties involved.
     d) Consistent commitment of key administrative offices of the judiciary, as well as the
        Court en Banc, is essential for effective and sustained implementation of
        institutional reforms. While the establishment of a Program Management Office has
        been critical in coordinating and catalysing reforms and in getting reforms under way, it
        can never be a full substitute for the genuine embrace of reforms by key organic units
        such as the Office of Court Administration (OCA), MISO or the Fiscal Management and
        Budget Office (FMBO).
     e) Whenever focus moves from results and implementing agencies shift focus from
        outcomes to process, reform momentum wanes. Following due process is important
        but is not itself a project outcome. Similarly, while piloting reform options can be a
        valuable part of diagnostic research, excessive piloting can become a form of
        procrastination and ultimately undermine reform efforts by delaying achievements. In
        this case, the prolonged piloting and indecision surrounding options for decentralising,
        streamlining and automating court, case, financial and human resource management has
        greatly deferred the attainment of results and impact, and undermined reform momentum.
        Prioritization is needed to stay focused on results and avoid being excessively distracted
        by process.
     f) Care is needed to ensure that a dedicated PMO is well-equipped and supported
        throughout the project life, and that it works effectively with the judiciary’s key
        operating institutions 26 , in supporting and coordinating reforms, rather than
        succumbing to time-driven pressures and becoming directly involved in
        implementing reforms. Some quick reform gains can be achieved by dedicated project
        implementing agencies directly imposing reforms with authority derived from senior
        management. But without the genuine embrace of reforms by organic administrative units
        of the judiciary, short–term gains can be more than offset by medium and longer-term


26
 For example, the Office of Court Administrator, Management Information Systems Office, Office of
Halls of Justice, and Fiscal Management and Budget Office.


                                                34
         losses arising from the exacerbation of natural institutional resistance to change.
         Considerable time and effective working-level cooperation and teamwork between a
         PMO and organic institutional management is critical to build and sustain institutional
         support for reforms.
    g) Active support from the other branches of government and key related agencies of
       government (e.g. DOJ) is essential for necessary complementary actions that are
       outside the purview of the Judiciary. Without this wider support, risks arising from
       institutional impediments outside the control of the Judiciary can limit the attainment of
       desired development outcomes. In this case delays in establishing additional courts to
       make use of expanded court facilities constructed under the project as part of Pilot Model
       Courts has delayed and limited the achievement of targets project outcomes. Second,
       action by the DOJ is critical for ensuring that the constraints on the capacity of the
       prosecution office do not limit the attainment of potential improvements in judicial
       performance.
    h) Sustained coordination of development-partner assistance with effective local
       leadership is important for effectiveness and enduring success. In this case there was
       an effective donor forum led and coordinated by the Supreme Court at the time this
       project was prepared and during early years of implementation but this was not sustained
       beyond the third year of the project. This has led to inadequate coordination of
       development partner support. Furthermore, differing visions and fragmented (and
       uncoordinated) financial support advanced by individual development partners has
       contributed to significant distraction, confusion and delays in reform.
    i)   Care is needed to ensure that Project Development Objectives and Performance
         Indicators match the scope of the project well. In this case, there was somewhat of
         disconnect in that the PDO was more appropriate for the judiciary’s overarching APJR
         than the JRSP. Similarly, some of the performance indicators presumed that parts of the
         overall judicial reform program not directly under the JRSP would be concurrently
         achieved. Without this match between the project and PDOs, assessing project
         performance is difficult.
    Justice sector reform remains so important for sustained poverty reduction and overall human
    and economic development objectives that it warrants continued support from development
    partners. The attainment of targeted outcomes from individual support initiatives will
    continue to be high risk, but the potential rewards are very high. Indeed, improved justice
    sector performance in the Philippines remains critical for the broader attainment of improved
    governance and confidence in the consistent and transparent rule of law.



7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners

(a) Borrower/implementing agencies

The Borrower’s ICR Report is included as Annex 9. The most significant difference between this
and the Borrower’s ICR Report pertains to the ratings. In all but the substantial risk to
development outcomes, the Bank has rated outcome and performance more negatively than the
Borrower has. These differences are summarized below in Table 14. While the Bank very much
appreciates this opportunity to have worked closely with the Philippine Judiciary in support of its
Action Program for Judicial Reform, progress towards the objectives of the JRSP and with the
Court’s broader reform agenda has been such that the Bank cannot agree to a ‘Satisfactory” rating.

In parallel with this, Data Sheet G (Ratings of Project Performance in ICRs) in the Borrower ICR
Contribution is incomplete. In Data Sheet G there are actually six occasions when either the
achievement of Development Outcomes (DO) or Implementation Progress (IP) were rated as
Unsatisfactory, compared with only two in the Borrower Contribution version of this Data Sheet.

(b) Co-financiers

There were no direct co-financiers.

(c) Other partners and stakeholders

The ADB and USAID have both remained actively involved in supporting Philippine judiciary
reform efforts throughout the past decade. Not only did the ADB provide substantial Technical
assistance early on and an adjustment loan, but support for judicial reform remains a part of its
technical support for good governance. USAID have provided substantial support for upgrading
information systems and computerizing court and case management.
