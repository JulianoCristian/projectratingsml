The Second Forestry Development\n            Project was instrumental in the preparation of, and the\n            planning for a national forestry development strategy;\n            particularly beneficial, was the private sector development\n            component, which promoted communal participation and\n            investment activities. Private investments in reforestation\n            should progressively attract new enterprises, which could\n            eventually cover a variety of forest operations. The report\n            provides a number of key lessons, one of the most important\n            being that of an integrated approach, essential for a\n            successful forestry management. It is also suggested that\n            continuity of staff, both the Bank and the Borrower's,\n            is critical for an efficient project implementation, for a\n            sustained dialogue becomes essential, particularly, if\n            controversial issues arise. Discussions with government\n            officials and entrepreneurs on issues of conditionalities\n            and competitiveness, resulted in appropriate policy changes\n            for a successful private sector involvement. High priority\n            should be given to forestry maintenance to attain long-term\n            benefits and sustainability; should the enterprises become\n            involved in forest operations, maintenance requirements\n            should be legally specified to ensure those benefits."}, "docdt": "1999-04-27T00:00:00Z"}
