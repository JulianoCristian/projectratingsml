moderately satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was\n            high, the Bank performance was satisfactory, and the\n            Borrower performance was moderately satisfactory. Lessons\n            learned included: while the institutional problems of\n            Honduras' education sector were clearly diagnosed and\n            there was a consensus on the need to push for institutional\n            strengthening, one should be realistic about establishing\n            outcome indicators in this area. This Project, like its\n            predecessor, failed to achieve the expected strengthening of\n            the sector. At the same time, perhaps the plan was overly\n            optimistic, and underestimated the difficulties of changing\n            ingrained habits and traditions. Information is an important\n            tool to improve school performance and accountability.\n            Unfortunately, due to the deficient education data, the\n            Government has not able to use this instrument in its\n            pursuit to improve their education system.  Despite\n            previously mentioned challenges in reconciling financial\n            transfers to schools, schools are generally in the best\n            position to efficiently and effectively manage their\n            resources. Direct transfers to schools enable them to\n            allocate resources according to their priorities, in a\n            faster and often more efficient way. School Education\n            Projects (PECs) proved to be a powerful tool in\n            Honduras's rural areas, both in terms of responding to\n            minor but urgent infrastructure needs as well as financing\n            needed inputs for classrooms. Communities seemed more\n            willing to provide in-kind contributions, particularly with\n            labor, to complete the transfers. Finally, supervision teams\n            were left with the impression that communities felt more\n            ownership for their schools when delegated the financial\n            responsibility for their upkeep."}, "docdt": "2008-06-24T00:00:00Z"}
