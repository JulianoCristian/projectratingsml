  will as well, improve the quality of inter-cultural, and\n            bilingual education among indigenous communities. The four\n            project components will: 1) support the application of the\n            national curriculum in rural multi-grade, intercultural, and\n            bilingual schools through the validation by rural teachers,\n            of pertinent curriculum reforms, programs, and\n            methodologies. Student learning assessments will be\n            implemented, while teacher training programs will be\n            enhanced; 2) expand the Honduras Community Based Program\n            (PROHECO), through the provision of technical assistance to\n            support the organization of community education councils,\n            strengthen teachers basic education, and promote the\n            organization, and training of parental committees, featuring\n            the creation of inter-cultural, and bilingual schools; 3)\n            establish school-based management strategies in rural areas,\n            through the involvement of principals, teachers, parents,\n            and students, supported by capacity building towards an\n            education improvement planning, and improved administration\n            of financial resources; and, 4) strengthen institutional\n            capacity at the education departmental offices, through\n            technical assistance provision to plan, and monitor\n            community-based education programs."}, "docdt": "2001-04-10T00:00:00Z"}
