                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The project aims at improving the capabilities of the provincial governments and their municipalities to more effectively manage their resources and improve the quality
                         of government administrative services. Its specific objectives are: i) to support the integrated development and adoption of basic management tools that are conducive
                         to the efficient and transparent management of provincial and municipal resources; ii) to strengthen provincial governments in such key areas as those related to land
                         tax and tax administration, human resources management, judicial services, civil registries, control entities and public safety functions; and iii) to support the
                         strengthening of municipal governments through pilot activities designed to demonstrate the benefits of integrated modernization efforts.
