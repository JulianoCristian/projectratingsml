unsatisfactory; risk to\n            development outcome was moderate; Bank performance was\n            moderately unsatisfactory; and borrower performance was also\n            moderately satisfactory. Some lessons learned includes:\n            interventions should be limited to a few key institutional\n            and management reforms. Without such a focus, implementation\n            by the Borrower and supervision by the Bank risk losing\n            sight of the operation's priorities. Modernization\n            projects should be designed based on the achievement of\n            specific goals and align with the Government's reform\n            agenda. It is crucial to anticipate the additional\n            complexities of working not only with different branches of\n            government at the subnational level but also of getting\n            local laws approved for project implementation. Stronger\n            monitoring and evaluation processes would have allowed for\n            proactive execution and mid-course adjustments, as well as\n            learning from peers. Additional procurement support should\n            be considered for projects that involve relatively large and\n            complex procurement processes, such as the ICT investments\n            within this project."}, "docdt": "2013-11-29T00:00:00Z"}
