F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
The project aims at improving the capabilities of the provincial governments and their
municipalities to more effectively manage their resources and improve the quality of
government administrative services. Its specific objectives are: i) to support the integrated
development and adoption of basic management tools that are conducive to the efficient
and transparent management of provincial and municipal resources; ii) to strengthen
provincial governments in such key areas as those related to land tax and tax
administration, human resources management, judicial services, civil registries, control
entities and public safety functions; and iii) to support the strengthening of municipal
governments through pilot activities designed to demonstrate the benefits of integrated
modernization efforts.

I. Disbursement Profile
1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

1.      Argentina's recovery from the 2001-02 economic crisis was impressive. After
three years of fast growth (averaging roughly 8.8 percent during 2003-05)1, at the time of
design, gross domestic product (GDP) had recovered to the pre-crisis peak, thanks in
large part to prudent macroeconomic policies. Poverty was markedly reduced from 36.5
percent in the second half of 2003 to 24.7 percent in the second half of 2005 2 , and
unemployment fell by almost seven percentage points over a similar period3. However,
inequality (on a long-term upward trend in Argentina) was exacerbated by the crisis and
remained above its pre-crisis level.4

2.      Argentina faced the challenge of building upon the recovery to establish the
foundation for sustainable, more equitably shared growth – requiring addressing difficult
structural and governance reforms. Increasing public sector transparency and efficiency,
and improving institutions at the national – and subnational – levels was crucial.

3.     The bulk of Argentine social services were provided by its 24 provincial
governments (including the City of Buenos Aires) and 2,150 local governments, which
varied widely in fiscal and social performance, as well as size, populations and
endowments. Many governments were ill-prepared to meet growing demands for
improved services related to enhancing local development and economic competitiveness
and providing more adequate safety nets to deal with poverty and unemployment, and
many municipalities were entirely dependent on the provinces for their organization and
taxing powers. Thus, in order to support the needed upgrade in the provision of public
services by provinces and municipalities, the Government identified the need to first
improve subnational fiscal performance as well as revenue and expenditure management.

4.      The Project built upon previous efforts to modernize Argentine’s provincial
administrations and their municipalities; namely the First and Second Provincial
Development Loans (PDP-I and II) as well as the Municipal Development (MDP-I and
MDP-II) operations5, in which significant progress was made in areas including tax and
financial administration, and property registration (See Annex 10 for details).
Notwithstanding these achievements, there was a need to continue working in these areas.
Public sector modernization had been recognized to be a process entailing progressive

technological drive, integration and standardization efforts in these types of systems.

5.     The Government of Argentina requested further Bank support based on the
following elements:
    A. Demand. In response to a demand assessment of the Ministry of the Interior, the
       provincial governments submitted requests for institutional strengthening
       assistance exceeded a total cost of US$120 million.
    B. Need for public sector modernization at the sub-national level. Previous support
       had already shown beneficial economic and financial returns. The Implementation
       Completion and Results Reports (ICRs) of the aforementioned projects indicated
       that provinces that modernized their administrations had more opportunities for
       fiscal autonomy, had more cushion for economic downturns, and were better able
       to balance their accounts.
    C. The Bank was well positioned to support the modernization agenda. Its more than
       ten years of experience in this sector in Argentina provided the Bank with the
       capability to support the Government’s subnational government improvement
       agenda, and the subnational implementation of the Fiscal Responsibility Law6.
6.      Project objectives were fully consistent with the Country Assistance Strategy
(CAS) discussed by the Board on April 15, 2004, which emphasized Argentina’s needs
for sustained economic growth with equity, social inclusion, and stronger governance7.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

7.      The Project aimed at improving the capabilities of the provincial governments and
their municipalities to more effectively manage their resources and improve the quality of
government administrative services. Its specific objectives were: i) to support the
integrated development and adoption of basic management tools that are conducive to the
efficient and transparent management of provincial and municipal resources; ii) to
strengthen provincial governments in such key areas as those related to land tax and tax
administration, human resources management, judicial services, civil registries, control
entities and public safety functions; and iii) to support the strengthening of municipal
governments through pilot activities designed to demonstrate the benefits of integrated
modernization efforts.

  The CAS (Report No. 27340-AR) emphasized (i) achieving sustained growth with equity through
maintaining macroeconomic stability; (ii) strengthening social inclusion by reaching poor and vulnerable
groups, and (iii) promoting better governance by improving accountability and transparency. The CAS
made it clear that the indicative lending program, while agreed with the Government at that time, would be
kept flexible to permit substitutions of some proposed projects within the agreed strategic pillars (para. 83).

 The ratio between collected and emitted tax revenue for provincial real property and motor vehicle taxes has increased
  from 55% to 70%
 The percentage of provincial expenditures on human resources operating under integrated payroll information systems
  has increased from 30% to 55%
 In at least 50% of provinces in the Advanced Module, the exchange of information between property registries and
  cadastre systems is done on a daily basis.
 In at least 50% of provinces in the Advanced Module, the totality of built surface (in sq. meters) incorporated in the
  cadastre system are automatically reflected into the property tax.
 In at least 50% of provinces in the Advanced Module, municipalities representing at least 60% of the urban parcels
  exchange information with the provincial cadastre system in accordance with the tax cycle.

  1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
  reasons/justification

  8.      The PDO was not revised; however, PDO indicators and intermediate level
  indicators were revised in 2010 and 2012. In the 2010 restructuring, the results and output
  indicators were updated according to current project circumstances and based on the
  Government’s revealed priorities in implementation and existing limitations in
  implementation capacity by the PIUs. As such, it was decided that effective measurement
  of activities' impact upon PDO had to rely on (i) a limited number of indicators focused
  on key results; (ii) indicators related to sub-projects and activities with higher probability
  of implementation; and (iii) conservative and realistic targets. The restructuring
  substantially overhauled and reformulated the results indicators and reduced the Project’s
  scope. With respect to the intermediate outcome indicators, the original ones were
  dropped, replaced and significantly reduced from 30 to 7.

  9.      In the 2012 restructuring, the results framework was again revised to: (i) include
  indicators for new public sector management areas that, although envisioned in the PAD
  did not include indicators; and (ii) replace some indicators could not be measured with
  others that better captured the results of the Project. The new set of indicators was
  intended to reflect the real impact of this Project on public sector management which
  could not be accounted for by other external factors. Additionally, some indicators and
  targets were adjusted upward to better reflect Project achievements in 2012. Table 2
  summarizes the original and revised PDO indicators. (See Annex 11 for the list of
  intermediate outcome indicators adopted from the restructuring in 2010 and 2012,
  including the justification for the changes introduced.)

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

10.      The Project was expected to support the Ministry of the Interior, the coordination
mechanism amongst provinces. In the beginning, the target beneficiary provinces were:
Misiones, Formosa, Entre Rios, Tucuman, Santa Fe, Santa Cruz, San Juan, Rio Negro,
Mendoza, La Rioja, Cordoba and Chubut. In the end, only seven provinces met the
eligibility criteria and participated in the Project (Chubut, Formosa, Mendoza, Neuquén,
Rio Negro, Salta and Santa Fe).

1.5 Original Components

11.     Component 1: Basic Module (63 percent of Project costs - US$ 32.5 million
total; of which US$26.62 million correspond to Bank financing): This module was to
consist of two sub-components, focusing on the fiscal core of provincial administrations
and their municipalities. Tools were to be developed at the provincial level and replicated
at the municipal level, preferably using prototypes that had been developed and proved
effective under the PDP-II (P006018). Special emphasis was to be given to ensuring the
full integration of these tools to fully capitalize on their potential fiscal impact (the
integration between cadastres and property registries, as well as of cadastres and tax
administrations) and improved information flows between levels of government.

12.    Component 2: Advanced Module (25 percent of Project costs - US$13.0
million total, of which US$11.5 million correspond to Bank financing): This module
was open only to participating provinces that progressed further in the modernization of
their administrations and complied with the module’s criteria. It consisted of two



                                                                4
demand-driven sub-components. The first was to finance technical assistance (in areas
such as e-procurement; judicial modernization; advanced human resources management;
control and auditing, and business process re-engineering) to provincial governments that
demonstrated a strong vocation and capacity for public sector modernization The second
was to finance technical assistance to provincial governments in their efforts to improve
municipal governments’ basic management skills in priority areas (e.g. municipal
budgeting, capital investment planning, project evaluation). This sub-component was also
to finance the replication of the successful experience of the Municipality of the Third
Millennium (Municipio del Tercer Milenio, M3M) in provinces expressing a particular
interest, as well as the development of a system of municipal indicators, capitalizing on
lessons learned from Chile’s successful experience with SINIM (National System of
Municipal Indicators, Sistema Nacional de Indicadores Municipales).

13.     Component 3: Project Management: (12 percentof Project costs - US$6.19
million total). This component was to cover the operating expenses related to the
coordination of Project implementation, and support project management activities. The
central executing unit (CEU) in Ministry of Interior was responsible for the coordination
of the Project while the Provincial Management Units (PMUs) were responsible for
implementation.

14.     An overarching e-government strategy was intended to help integrate and
standardize all activities’ frameworks by creating an enabling and collaborative ICT
environment. To be eligible to participate in the Basic Module, Provinces needed to
demonstrate commitment towards public sector modernization. Eligibility for
participation in the Advanced Module required that Provinces had shown substantial
compliance with reforms included in the Basic Module and continued with consolidation
of these reforms. (See Annex 12 for details on eligibility criteria and the allocation of
loan proceeds as approved in the PAD).


1.6 Revised Components

15.    The components were not revised.

1.7 Other significant changes

16.     The Project was restructured several times. A major restructuring was done in
2010. It entailed the following: (i) reduction in project scope in order to focus efforts in
priority activities; (b) revision of results indicators, in line with the reduced scope of the
Project; and (c) extension of the closing date by 18 months (from September 30, 2010 to
March 31, 2012), to allow for implementation of the Restructuring Action Plan. The
restructuring effected the reduction in project scope through the declaration of a deadline
for signing contracts (set initially on March 31, 2011) to be eligible for financing under
the loan. With the deadline, the eight areas of intervention were adjusted and the sub-
projects expected to be pursued and financed under the Project were reduced to 21. Even
with the extension of the closing date through March 2012, it was expected that only



                                              5
about 90 percent of the loan would be disbursed by closing, and the restructuring was to
focus implementation on completing priority activities).

17.    A second restructuring in February 2011 reallocated loan proceeds and increase
the disbursement percentage to 100 percent to allow for full utilization of the loan
proceeds and to better capture the requirements of the sub-projects being implemented. In
March 2011, the Bank waived the contracting deadline date of March 31, 2011 to
accommodate earlier identified eligible contracts, the signing of which took longer than
expected. This waiver effectively set a new contracting deadline date of April 30, 2011.

18.     In February 2012, with loan disbursements having reached 76 percent, another
restructuring was processed to extend the closing date by another year from March 31,
2012 to March 31, 2013; and to revise results indicators. The extension was deemed
necessary to allow time for completion of ongoing activities and ensure a smooth
implementation during the change in administration. Most importantly, the additional
implementation time would allow for an evaluation of more measurable outputs and thus
the ability to better report on results and impact. (See Section 1.3 above.)

19.     In February 2013, a final restructuring was processed to reflect the final
reallocation of loan proceeds at closing.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

20.        The quality at entry is viewed to have been moderately unsatisfactory.

21.     As discussed above, the Project built upon several modernization projects8 which
had made progress in key areas of public management, but additional work was needed to
integrate the isolated efforts (see section 1.1 above and below for further discussion).
Project objectives were consistent with those of the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS)
of 2004 (Report No. 27340-AR) --which emphasized that Argentina needed sustained
economic growth with equity, social inclusion, and stronger governance -- and were also
aligned with Government priorities.

22.     Project design drew upon an understanding of shortfalls in previous
modernization efforts, taking into account earlier operations’ lessons, risks and proposed
mitigation measures, while also drawing upon recent years’ technological advances,
integration and standardization efforts in this type of systems. While the previous two
provincial projects had provided solutions in the business process redesigns of supported
sectors, these were ad-hoc measures and did not take full advantage of “e-government”
and ICT developments, and had resulted in the modernization of ‘administrative islands.”

                                                  6
To address these challenges, project design included the definition of areas of
intervention once progress was made (Advanced Module Component).

23.     The Project included several layers of ex-ante procedural approvals, whose
timelines were too optimistically estimated at design, including: (i) the adoption of
Provincial Debt Laws authorizing the Provincial Executive to access the project funding;9
(ii) Bank approval of Provincial Sector Strategies of Public Administration
Reform/Sector Management Program (PMG);10 and (iii) Bank approval for each Project
Document11 among the key eligibility criteria for provincial participation. Only thereafter
could a Subsidiary Loan Agreement (SLA) between the national government (through the
CEU, established within the Subsecretaria de Coordinacion under the Ministry of
Interior) and the participating province be processed. As a result, the Project encountered
significant start-up delays. The fulfillment of these conditions was needed to initiate
project procurement, which started only in 2008. Table 3 below illustrates the timeline
for the local debt laws approval and bank no objection to the subprojects.

24.     The PAD indicated that the Project met the criteria for readiness for
implementation. However, there were delays in signing the Loan and declaring
effectiveness. The Project was approved on December 15, 2005; the Loan Agreement
was signed only on December 20, 2006 and declared effective only on June 12, 2007.
Argentina’s Presidential Decree approving the terms of the Loan Agreement and
authorizing the signing of the Agreement was issued on November 8, 2006 (Presidential
Decree 1602/2006), about a year after Board approval. Subsequent to the decree, the
declaration of effectiveness required that at least one SLA be signed including legal
opinions issued that said agreement was authorized by the responsible authorities and was
legally binding.

 Provincial Debt Laws. In order to access the Bank’s funding, and under the Argentinean federal system, Debt Laws
had to be approved ex ante by each participating Provincial Congress. This step required in some cases a significant
amount of time, and it took some Provinces up to 18 months after the loan effectiveness to adopt this law.
10
   Provincial Public Sector Management Program (PMG).Eligibility to the Program funded by the Bank loan also
required Provinces to prepare a Program of Public Sector Reform, which had to be approved by the Bank. While this
process was originally expected to be short, the actual fulfillment required almost 1.5 years on average.
11
   Individual Project Document. In addition to the PMG, eligible Provinces were expected to prepare an individual
Project Document, also subject to Bank approval, for each component/project of the approved PMG. These projects
should include five ‘basic’ public management areas, and five ‘advanced’ public management areas. How ever, this step
increased the delay: 84 percent of the selected projects were approved after September 2008 only.

25.    In addition to the 18-month effectiveness delay; a complex project design – Basic
and Advanced Modules that were overly ambitious; the multiplicity of executing actors,
and limited implementation capacity –that had not been appropriately appraised,
contributed to having only 30 percent of the loan committed (signed contracts) and 15
percent disbursed by 2010 when the first restructuring and closing date extension took
place.

26.      Even though the rationale behind having basic and advanced modules within the
loan was technically sound, it was not well-suited to the provinces’ modernization
priorities. Conditions to move to the advanced module had to be relaxed in order to
motivate the provinces to engage within the scope of the Project. Requiring them to enter
through the basic module was not the best approach, and in practice, represented a flaw in
project design.

2.2 Implementation

27.    The implementation of the Project is viewed to have been moderately satisfactory.
Loan resources were lent by the national government to participating provincial
governments through SLAs. Project coordination was the responsibility of the CEU.
Provincial Ministries of Economy were expected to administer sub-loan implementation
through Provincial Management Units (PMUs).

28.     Project implementation began slowly. After the described delays in signing and
effectiveness, delays related to preparing the bidding documents were also encountered,
and project implementation was affected by the factors described below:

   A. Change of Procurement Strategy for Complex ICT Contracts financed by the loan.
      In 2009, due to the need to speed up contracting, the Bank requested that the ICT
      systems be procured through turn-key contracts. This differed from the original
      procurement strategy, which consisted of conducting separate procurement
      processes for the supply of ICT equipment; and hardware installation,
      commissioning and customization of software packages resulting from previously
      designed prototypes. However, these changes required modifications to efforts
      supporting the prior strategy, and ended up generating additional delays upon
      twelve tender dossiers out of 55. In terms of contract amount, the change was not
      minor; it impacted the processing of contracts whose total amount was equivalent
      to approximately 50 percent of the loan.
   B. Weak Government Implementation Capacity in the area of Procurement. The
      procurement of the ICT equipment and software had to be processed directly by
      Provinces, in which capacity was weak.
   C. Increased Bank Procurement Challenges. Given the intensification of
      procurement processes by the client starting in November 2009, available
      procurement resources were not sufficient to respond to demand in as timely a
      manner as would have been ideal.




                                            8
29.    The Project was designed and appraised based on financing requests of interested
and qualified provinces that had prepared preliminary PMGs during project preparation.13

30.     As these provinces had already invested a lot of time and resources, and were
very committed, they remained in the Project and prepared the documents according to
the new ICT procurement strategy referenced above. (Other provinces, such as Cordoba
chose not to bear the additional cost, and stepped out in 2008.) However, the adoption of
the new ICT procurement strategy necessitated additional work and starting some of the
procurement processes again which, combined with the weak procurement capacity at the
provincial level and CEU, the Bank procurement constraints, as well as the high
turnaround of Bank procurement specialists and task team leaders 14 , led to further
implementation delays. As a result of the unrealistic implementation schedule, including
failure to schedule sufficient time for start-up activities and mobilization, the contract
execution period was extremely short in most cases. In particular, out of eight provinces
with eligible projects, the implementation period in six provinces was only approximately
one and a half years by the time of the original closing date.

31.     With implementation constrained by lack of progress in procurement processes,
by Q4 of CY2009 and less than one year to original closing date, the Project had only
disbursed US$4.4 million (about 10 percent of the loan) vs. projected target of US$10
million. As mentioned, in addition to start-up delays, complex project design, the
multiplicity of executing actors, and limited implementation capacity, 15 as well as
developments following the 2007 elections, 16 also impacted project execution.
Procurement issues not only negatively affected the execution of the Project but also
posed a risk to its continuity, triggering internal Bank discussions on a possible close of
the loan by its initial closing date in September 2010.

32.    However, as a result of Bank supervision efforts in late 2010/early 2011- which
included weekly progress reports on the status of all procurement processes and
deployment of additional staff to monitor and facilitate meeting the contracting deadline
of March 31, 2011 initially and then the final deadline date of April 30, 2011 -
disbursement increased more than three-fold from US$8.5 million in 2011Q1 to US$30.3
million in 2012Q1.

33.    The project restructuring of February 2011 benefited from a collaborative
environment between the Government of Argentina and the Bank until the final phases of


13
   Of the 24 provinces including the City of Buenos Aires, eight indicated that they were not interested in
participating (Catamarca, Chaco, Corrientes, Ciudad Autónoma de Buenos Aires, Jujuy, La Pampa, San
Luis and Santiago del Estero). Another group was interested but did not have the debt requisite
space/capacity or was not in a condition to get a sanctioning Law approved by provincial legislatures.
14
   Over the period of project implementation, there were five task team leaders; four over the last three
years of implementation.

implementation, helping ensure a successful completion (supporting all the procurement
processes and contract signatures); at closing US$ 37.31 million were disbursed.

34.     Two additional project restructurings in 2012 and 2013 allowed the Project to
disburse almost 100 percent of loan proceeds and, more importantly, allowed for
additional time for greater achievement of the PDO. Annex 3 presents the sub-projects
completed by each province and the expected/initial observed gains from the project,
with additional progress expected next year in provinces where projects were only
recently completed.


2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

35.    Responsibility for Monitoring was divided among the national level CEU, which
monitored progress of provincial governments and PMUs which monitored progress of
municipalities. Monitoring arrangements were designed to support implementing
agencies strategic decision-making and create opportunities to benefit from continuous
learning. The M&E framework design and implementation is rated Moderately
Unsatisfactory, for the reasons described below:

36.     M&E design. The results framework presented in the PAD provided for
performance indicators for the PDO and intermediate results for each component.
However, the intermediate results indicators were neither clearly defined nor quantified;
they were left for provincial determination based on the actual sub-project implemented.
The 30 intermediate results indicators in the PAD were also too numerous. In general, the
results indicators were considered too complex and in some cases beyond what the
project activities could effectively deliver as outcome. As such, modifications were made
during implementation. Nevertheless, the problem was not adequately addressed.
Revisions of the results framework during the restructuring in 2010 mainly focused on
reducing targets for the indicators in a way that further limited the ability of the indicators
to capture actual success and impact of the project – which necessitated further revisions
in 2012. In the end, all targets were achieved but such success hardly demonstrates the
depth of the value added of the Project as a whole.

37.     M&E implementation. The PDO and intermediate indicators were adjusted during
project restructurings to establish a better link with project activities. The Bank regularly
monitored progress under the Project through periodic supervision missions. The Project
did not establish a proper M&E plan whereby provinces could share experiences and
provide feedback. The Project called for periodic “high” level meetings between
Ministers to discuss the progress of the projects, but these meetings did not occur as
planned and when they did, they could not provide the guidance to the Project at the
technical level needed. During the 2012 workshop17, provinces expressed their desire to



17
 A workshop to discuss lessons learned during implementation of the project, in which all of the provinces
participated, was held in Buenos Aires in 2012.


                                                   10
have had more provincial exchanges earlier in the Project in order to exchange
information, challenges and areas of opportunity, etc.

38.     M&E utilization. The PDO and intermediate results indicators, particularly with
respect to the target measures or percentages, were closely monitored by the Bank
supervision team and reported in ISRs. They have been heavily referenced and utilized in
justifying the two cases of Closing Date extension. As noted above, during 2010-2011,
the Bank team engaged in intensive supervision of the Project. During the last years, the
quality of the progress reports improved considerably - becoming more comprehensive,
timely and disaggregated at the subnational level. Considerable effort was made by the
CEU and PMUs to improve the M&E of the sub-projects to better assess the outcomes
and impacts of investments.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

39.      The PMUs and CEU’s relatively weak procurement capacity was an issue during
the first phases of project implementation. Due to the delays experienced during the
initial stages and changes in procurement strategies, strengthening local capacity was
difficult. However, with support from the Bank, the CEU’s performance on procurement
improved notably particularly after the 2010 restructuring, helping to support significant
progress in project implementation and the Project’s successful completion.

40.     Project financial management was considered to be satisfactory throughout
project implementation. Financial monitoring reports were submitted on time and were
acceptable to the Bank. All minor inconsistencies found during supervision were properly
addressed by the client and did not impact the outcome and controls of the Project.
Annual audit reports for the Project were submitted accordingly and reviewed by the
Bank, and auditors issued unqualified opinions.

41.     With respect to safeguard, no safeguard policies were triggered by the Project at
design, an appropriate decision, as no such issues arose during implementation.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

42.      In the 2012 workshop, all participating provinces reaffirmed their commitment to
the reforms that they were pursuing. To date, with the exception of one sub-project in
Mendoza (which is supposed to be finished by May 2014), all sub-projects have been
completed. Continuing commitment to the development objective beyond of the scope of
the loan has been demonstrated through the decisions of actors including the municipality
of Puerto Madryn and the province of Mendoza to engage in related activities with their
own funding, as well as the development of a post-implementation support plan for the
territorial information system in the province of Formosa.

43.    There are also positive signals that future Bank engagement in Argentina would
include a focus on strengthening capacities of sub-nationals for public service delivery.
To this end, the lessons from this project are expected to inform future operations and



                                           11
could therefore help consolidate and sustain gains under previous interventions and this
project in the area of sub-national governments’ public sector modernization.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

44.     Argentina is one of the most decentralized countries in Latin America,
underscoring the importance of local service delivery. Provincial and local governments
are responsible for approximately 50 percent of expenditures, on par with the United
States and Canada, but subnational governments collect only 20 percent of consolidated
revenue. On average, local revenues represent about 40 percent of total provincial
revenues; the remaining 60 percent are transfers from the federal tax sharing system.

45.     Project objectives continue to be highly relevant for the country, given the roles
and responsibilities of subnational governments in service delivery. Project outcomes
clearly show reductions in cost as well as savings in public sector management areas
identified in each province. Outcomes also include improved service delivery in
provinces like Mendoza, where IDs can now be issued in one week (previously one year)
following the modernization of the civil registry (as described in Section 3.3).
Presentations by the involved provinces in a workshop in Buenos Aires in 2012
highlighted the projects’ progress and emphasized the relevance of the Bank’s support
towards accomplishing their public management modernization objectives.

46.     The objectives and demonstrated results were also consistent with the Country
Partnership Strategy (CPS) for 2010-201218 and well-aligned with the outcomes targeted
under the pillar focused on improved governance (strengthened effectiveness, efficiency,
transparency and accountability of public sector management; expanded performance
management and improvement in the quality of public expenditure, enhanced service
delivery outcomes and trust in institutions; strengthened public sector capacity to spur
investment and growth). The governance agenda, as well as improved fiscal and public
sector management at the federal and subnational levels remain priorities. Through this
project, the Bank was able to sustain a meaningful relationship with sub-national
governments.


3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

47.    While fewer provinces were involved in project implementation than foreseen at
design and the project scope reduced through restructurings, all revised PDO and
intermediate outcome indicators were achieved, and tangible improvements in service
delivery have been observed. The ratio of collected provincial taxes has increased in real
terms in two provinces; the percentage of provincial staff operating under integrated
payroll information systems in human resources has increased from 0 percent to 30


18
     Report No. 48476-AR, discussed by the Board on June 9, 2009


                                                    12
percent in two provinces as well; the exchange of information between property registries
and cadaster systems is done on a regular basis; and some provinces have an interface
between territorial cadastre administration and Real State Property Register Systems.

48.     The Basic Module Component (Component 1) was originally designed to support
reforms in core management areas such as revenue administration, cadaster, financial
management and human resources. However, as not all the provinces met the eligibility
criteria to receive funding under this module, most provinces elected to finance these
reforms with their own resources and instead applied for resources under the Advanced
Module (Component 2). The provinces that executed Component 1 were Formosa and
Chubut. In Chubut, human resources, revenue administration and cadaster systems
projects were completed. The initial outcomes reported are: 40 percent of staff has been
integrated into the electronic payroll system and personnel information system, and tax
collection has increased 25 percent between September of 2010 and September of 2012.
In Formosa, land registry, cadaster and revenue administration projects were completed.
The initial outcomes reported are: 40 percent increase in tax collection between
September of 2010 and September of 2012, an interface between territorial cadastre
administration and Real State Property Register Systems has been developed, and the
process for producing the fiscal valuation of property "informe de valuacion" has been
reduced to 10 days. (See illustrations in Annex 13 regarding dissemination of outcomes
in local newspapers in Chubut and Formosa.)

49.     Most of the provinces supported by the Project demonstrated progress in the core
sector reforms and applied for funding under the Advanced Module (Component 2)
(Mendoza, Neuquén, Rio Negro, Salta and Santa Fe participated). Reforms supported
under this component included the following areas, among others: judicial management,
electronic government, and public registries. Initial reported achievements include:
   A field visit to Mendoza in 2012 demonstrated that the civil registry is now able to
      issue an ID in one week versus one year (after Civil Registries Modernization). The
      property registry is moving to establish a database and digitization, including
      scanning of all its records (which are currently processed with manual typewriters).
   The construction and establishment of the Data Center in Santa Fe has been
      completed. The Project also funded computer equipment for the Center, and the
      province is moving forward to implement many e-services for citizens
   Santa Fe increased the service capacity of its Data Center by 300 percent and Salta
      by 80 percent. Costs have also been reduced significantly in both provinces.

50.     While changes to indicators made during restructurings were consistent with the
overall project development objective and against such a metric project outcomes could
be considered moderately satisfactory, modifications during restructurings were such that
final project outcomes cannot be compared with these original PAD indicators,
suggesting that by such a metric, project outcomes could be viewed as moderately
unsatisfactory.




                                           13
3.3 Efficiency

50.     The reduction in scope and the time required for implementation suggest that
overall project efficiency was lower than expectations at design. However, the Project’s
interventions in eight areas (e.g. tax administration, property registries, etc.) have offered
financial gains to the participating provinces. While impact indicators have yet to be
measured (given the fact that most subprojects were only operational at the end of project
implementation), results from participating provinces already point to improvements in
service delivery and large annual potential savings in public sector management.
Assuming the provinces continue to implement the projects, annual savings are expected
to exceed the initial one-time investment of the systems in place. Annex 3 presents the
observed/expected gains from the various subprojects which are all geared towards
achieving greater public sector efficiency at the provincial level, and reflects some cost
savings and potential benefits in future years (increased tax collection, savings in
operational costs, etc.) In some provinces like Chubut the project investment was paid off
by the increase in revenue (tax collection went up 2 percent in 3 months).


3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

51.     As discussed above, project achievements demonstrate significant progress
towards the overall PDO of improving capabilities to more effectively manage their
resources and improve the quality of government administrative services. The public
sector management areas supported under this Project are now starting to contribute
significantly to the economic efficiency of provinces. Streamlining of processes,
organizational modernization, and better data management, have resulted in improved
decision-making and resource planning (see section 3.1) by (i) promoting inter-
government coordination at multiple levels, (ii) supporting system integration, and (iii)
encouraging transparency and accountability in public administration at the local level, as
well as improving administrative processes requiring direct involvement of civil society.

52.     While the Project fully achieved all of its revised outcome indicators, the
significant changes in these indicators during implementation, the reduction in project
scope, and lower than anticipated efficiency vis-à-vis project design suggest that as
measured against the PAD, the overall outcome is moderately unsatisfactory.

53.     Nevertheless, the Project’s relevance remains high, with engagement on
subnational governments work remaining a priority. While the future financial gains have
not been sufficiently quantified 19 , based on experience, it is expected that continuing
maintenance and operationalization of systems investments will allow for the savings
over time to far exceed the costs.



19
 As subprojects were only recently completed, and results in improved service delivery are evident, the
measurable results will only be available in the coming quarters (or next calendar year).


                                                   14
3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

54.     No direct poverty, gender or measurable impact on the population is directly
attributable to the Project. However, the Project’s impact on public sector management
areas has the potential to indirectly impact poverty and social conditions through the
effect of fiscal stabilization and improved service delivery conditions, as well as by
allowing for generated savings to be channeled into other provincial priorities.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

55.     This operation clearly contributed to institutional strengthening both at the federal
and subnational levels. The federal and provincial governments strengthened their
capacities in eight areas of public sector management through the completion of the
systems’ development and implementation. The Project has been effective in
strengthening the technical capacity of the PMUs, and has facilitated the accurate
collection of critical information required by law, as well as improving service delivery
and fostering citizen participation.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

56.    No significant unintended outcomes or impacts were identified.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

57.    No beneficiary survey or stakeholder workshops were conducted specifically for
reviewing Project performance.


4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Moderate

58.     Considering both the nature of the investments made and the next steps
envisioned, the risk to the Development Outcomes is considered to be moderate. Project
advances represent a new, automated platform for public management in these provinces.
By nature, this type of investment cannot be easily rolled back, and in fact, serves to
increase momentum behind business process service modernization within the public
sector, as evidenced by the municipality of Puerto Madryn’s decision to finance hardware
to extend the functionalities of the system linking the municipal and provincial cadasters.
Moreover, the province of Mendoza is committed to completing its judicial
modernization project by May 2014.

59.    Nevertheless, in the medium to long term, further advances in efficiency and
operational effectiveness, building off of project activities, will likely require additional
investments in technology and process redesign. While after implementing the
subprojects directed to improve public sector management tools, the Government (both at


                                             15
the federal and provincial levels) has developed the capacity to undertake similar
exercises in the future and expand the results to the remaining provinces, such efforts will
require a long term financial commitment.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Unsatisfactory

60.     This Project was intended to expand the positive results in public management
achieved by previous experiences supported also by the Bank, and was prepared taking
into account lessons learned from preceding projects. It was consistent with the federal
government’s objectives and the Bank strategy with Argentina. However, several
shortcomings in project design posed significant challenges to implementation. In
particular, the underestimation of timing to pass the local indebtedness laws, the failure to
identify the challenges involved in coordinating with several subnational governments,
and the overestimation of the team capacity to carry out complex procurement processes
caused significant risks to the successful completion of the Project. Likewise, the delay
alone in declaring the loan effective (18 months from Board approval) suggests
significant under-estimation of the Project’s readiness to implement. Additionally, the
significant problems with the design of the original monitoring and evaluation framework
(mentioned above) - indicators that were too complex, too numerous, and in some cases
more than the project could expect to deliver and not well-defined - required that
substantial changes be made in project restructurings.

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

61.     The initial supervision phase of the Project could be characterized as overly-
optimistic and highly focused on technical aspects, with inadequate attention paid to
operational constraints. For example, while all SLAs for the eligible provinces were not
yet signed (and neither commitment nor disbursement levels above 10 percent of the
loan), there were already discussions of possible additional financing. Realistic
assessment of project implementation constraints early on could have facilitated an
earlier turnaround of the Project, and the Bank’s 2009 request for the change in
procurement strategy generated challenges for the counterpart. There were also
indications that communications between the Bank team, CEU and PMUs could have
been better.

62.      By 2010, a new Bank task team had been assigned to provide implementation
support. From then on, the Bank flagged potential issues and took action to solve them
effectively throughout the extension period. As noted above, the Bank team engaged in
intensive supervision, including weekly progress reports of procurement processes and
more staff time devoted (Public Sector, Country Management Unit and Procurement) to
facilitate meeting the contracting deadline for signing new contracts. The joint effort of


                                             16
the Bank teams provided enough flexibility to find a solution for each province that
helped place the Project’s processes back on track, including almost full disbursement of
the loan. The Bank’s proactive supervision also contributed to the improvement in the
quality of the progress reports in the last years of implementation. The sum of these
issues is the reason for considering Bank supervision Moderately Satisfactory.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

63.     Based on the Bank performance in ensuring quality at entry, and in the quality of
Bank supervision, the overall Bank performance is rated as moderately unsatisfactory. A
number of challenges that led to delays in project start-up and execution were not fully
identified at design, and communication between the Bank and the client could have been
better in the initial part of implementation. However, this ICR recognizes the Bank
supervision team’s significant efforts during the latter part of implementation to solve the
procurement issues and to get the project back on track. While Project outcomes as
restructured were achieved and all prioritized programs and activities were undertaken
moderately satisfactorily, the significant problems with original M&E framework (which
impacted the assessment of the final project outcome) lead to an evaluation of moderately
unsatisfactory performance on the part of the Bank.

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a)Government Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

64.     Despite the fact that project implementation suffered delays in the initial stages,
the areas supported under this Project were part of the Government of Argentina’s agenda
with respect to improving service delivery by strengthening public sector management at
the local level. In addition to the political commitment, Argentinean provinces were able
to strengthen their capacity and devised the institutional and technical tools needed to
complete their projects. However, this commitment could have translated into proactivity
in ensuring that the Project was progressing satisfactorily. There is insufficient evidence
on the steering committee exercising its role to facilitate project implementation.20

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

65.     The CEU did a good job in coordinating all the efforts at the different levels and
especially in disseminating Project results and attracting demand for expanding the
coverage of local public sector management improvements. Provinces requested more
support from the Bank and the national government to conduct the processes related to
project activities and manage the associated contracts. Since subnational projects were
relatively small, they had difficulties in obtaining sufficient bids to comply with Bank


20
  Section 3.1.4 of the Loan Agreement covenants the establishment and operationalization of the steering
committee whose function include overall coordination of the Project.


                                                   17
rules and when contracts were signed, they had difficulties enforcing the conditions of the
contracts. However, the CEUs and PMUs’ strengthening is evidenced by their improved
project management capacities, as can been seen in their increasing procurement
capacity over implementation and the quality of the progress reports, which improved
considerably towards the last years - becoming more timely, comprehensive and
disaggregated at the subproject level.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

66.   Considering the above arguments, the overall borrower performance is deemed
moderately satisfactory.

6. Lessons Learned

67.     Interventions should be limited to a few key institutional and management reforms.
Without such a focus, implementation by the Borrower and supervision by the Bank risk
losing sight of the operation’s priorities. In this case, the restructuring of the loan’s scope
and indicators proved to be essential to achievement of the PDO and program’s outcomes.

68.    Modernization projects should be designed based on the achievement of specific
goals and align with the Government’s reform agenda. In the case of this project, even
though the rationale behind having basic and advanced modules was technically sound,
the conditions to move to the advanced module had to be relaxed in order to engage the
provinces and allow them to move forward on their modernization agenda.

69.     It is crucial to anticipate the additional complexities of working not only with
different branches of government at the subnational level but also of getting local laws
approved for project implementation. In this case, based on the expected coverage of the
loan as anticipated in the PAD, the Ministry of the Interior at the federal level needed to
coordinate with several counterparts. Considering the independence of these institutions
and the political nature of some of them, performance targets related to their participation
needed to consider the possibility that some of these institutions could revise their
decisions.

70.    Stronger monitoring and evaluation processes would have allowed for proactive
execution and mid-course adjustments, as well as learning from peers. As mentioned,
the Project did not establish a proper M&E plan whereby provinces could share
experiences and provide feedback. It has been proven, in other projects, that it is better to
have “technical” level meetings quarterly or bi-annually where subnational governments
can share their experiences amongst them and with the CEU and the Bank.

71.     Additional procurement support should be considered for projects that involve
relatively large and complex procurement processes, such as the ICT investments within
this Project. For this Project, the change in the procurement processes and need for
additional support should have been anticipated at the beginning of project
implementation, while capacities at the CEU and at the provincial level were adequately


                                             18
strengthened. Once the Bank assigned a Procurement Specialist on a more full time basis
to the Project and strengthened the supervision team, the pace of implementation of the
Project increased greatly and contracting dates were met.

          14 provinces made substantial progress toward upgrading their tax
          administration systems with almost 12 percent of all provincial tax
          revenues raised by tax administrations that underwent substantial
          modernization.22 Some tax systems were integrated with cadastre and
          taxpayer registration, and processing of declarations, payments and
          revenue is all electronic.

          12 provinces implemented financial administration systems that
          enhanced budgetary oversight, improved cash flow management, and
          achieved greater control over expenditures. As of 2005, approximately
          71 percent of provincial expenditures were covered by integrated
          financial management systems.

          19 provinces modernized the cadastres with an increased assessed land
          value (avalúo) and property tax bills (facturación) by 40 and 30
          percent, respectively.
          2 provinces systematically modernized human resources by
          streamlining procedures, consolidating personnel information, and
          developing a more transparent payroll.

  This data excludes the Province of Buenos Aires and the Municipality of Buenos Aires (C.A.B.A.),
which distort provincial statistics because of their large sizes. The 11.9 percent decreases to 4.6 percent
with the inclusion of Buenos Aires and C.A.B.A.

Annex 11. Changes in Intermediate Outcome Indicators

            Changes since restructuring in September 2010 and February 2012

Intermediate Result (Component One): (1) Cadastre management is efficient, provincial governments obtain
more fiscal revenue from the land tax, and users receive better services; (2) The administration of property
registries is more efficient and users (cadastre, citizens) receive better services; (3) The provinces and
municipalities have increased their own tax resources; (4) Provincial governments have real-time information
on public employees (including personal information, work history, post, pay level, aggregate wage bill, etc.).
Improper salary payments are stopped. The impact of proposed personnel policies can be modeled before they
are enacted.
Revised Intermediate Result (Component One): 1) Cadastre management is efficient and users receive
better services; (2) The administration of property registries is more efficient and users (cadastre, citizens)
receive better services; (3) Provincial governments have “on line” information on public employees (including
personal information, work history, post, pay level, aggregate wage bill, etc.). The impact of proposed
personnel policies can be modeled before they are enacted.
