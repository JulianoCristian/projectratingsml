SUB-NATIONAL GOVERNMENT PUBLIC SECTOR MODERNIZATION 
PROGRAM 
RESTRUCTURING PAPER 
 
SUMMARY 
 
1. 
The proposed changes to the 
Sub-national Government
 
Public Sector 
Modernization Program, Loan 7352-AR, P070448 
include: (a) the reallocation of loan 
proceeds between categories of expenditures and (b) the increase in disbursement 
percentage to 100% in all categories of expenditures.
 
The proposed increase in 
disbursement to 100% has been requested to allow the Government access to a greater 
percentage of loan funds for eligible contracts to be signed by March 31, 2011.  The 
reallocation of loan proceeds will allow for the realignment of the current procurement 
plan with the ceilings established for the different disbursement categories during project 
preparation. 
 
PROJECT STATUS 
 
2. 
The US$ 40 million loan was approved in December 2005, and became effective 
in June 2007, after an eighteen-month initial delay.  Loan resources are on lent by the 
National Government to participating provincial governments through subsidiary loan 
agreements.  Project coordination is the responsibility of a Central Executing Unit (CEU) 
under the borrower’s Ministry of Interior. At the sub-national level, the provincial 
Ministries of Economy are expected to administer sub-loan implementation through the 
Provincial Implementation Units (PIU).  
 
3. 
Progress on implementation was from the onset very limited due mainly to the 
initial effectiveness delay, a complex project design; multiplicity of executing actors, and 
limited implementation capacity.  In addition, the project lacked clear measurable results 
indicators, making it difficult to assess development achievement.  The project also 
included several layers of ex ante conditions to be fulfilled which delayed procurement 
until 2008. 
 
4. 
Once it became evident that the project would not achieve intended results on the 
original time frame the Government and the Bank agreed to restructure the project in 
October 2010.  This restructuring entailed an adjustment in project scope and 
disbursement arrangements, an extension of the Closing Date by 18 months, from 
September 30, 2010 to March 31, 2012; a contracting deadline of March 31, 2010 for 
signing of new contracts; and a modification of the outcome and output indicators 
adjusted to reflect revised priority activities, with a high probability of implementation 
and more realistic targets for each indicator.  Thus, while additional time was given for 
Page  5
5
achieving targets, the scope was in effect reduced by establishing a limit date for 
contracts to be financed with project resources.  
 
5. 
During the past months there has been an intensive supervision by the Bank team, 
including weekly progress reports of procurement processes and more staff time has been 
devoted to facilitate meeting the contracting deadline of March 31, 2011 for signing new 
contracts. 
 
6. 
As part of the proposed restructuring, the Borrower has committed to revise the 
Provincial Public Sector Management Reform Programs (PMGs) to include only those 
subprojects that will be financed with loan funds at the revised percentage of 100%, and 
thereafter send the revised PMGs to the Bank for its non-objection. As of today, the 
subprojects that will be financed with loan funds have not been fully identified by the 
Borrower, but these will be detailed and included in the revised PMGs no later than April 
30, 2011.  
 
7. 
The disbursement rate as of January 2011 is USD8.5 million or 21% of loan 
funds.  Pace of implementation has increased 
–
USD 2.5 million have been disbursed in 
the past four months and currently there are activities estimated at USD11 million soon to 
be contracted.  It is highly likely that given that PDO targets will be met, however, since 
the next few weeks will be an intense period for reviewing PMGs and starting and 
finishing contracting processes, a more accurate assessment of progress on outputs and 
intended outcomes will be made only after the contracting deadline of March 31, 2011.  
 
PROPOSED CHANGES  
 
Financing  
 
8. 
Reallocation
.
The amounts designated per expenditure category were based on 
the financing requests of interested and qualified provinces that had prepared preliminary 
PMGs) during project preparation.  To qualify for funds during the implementation of the 
project, each province then had to present and have approved their modernization plans 
(PMGs).  The final PMGs presented and approved did not match exactly the preliminary 
plans. In addition, not all provinces that initially had demonstrated interest in the project 
were actually incorporated.  Some used their own resources, instead of taking on debt, to 
proceed with their modernizations plans.  Finally, some sets of activities that were 
categorized as non-consulting services were actually reclassified as information systems 
that would be contracted either as “goods” or “consulting services”.  This resulted in a set 
of implementation activities different to those used for the cost projections and the need 
to reallocate among the categories of expenditures.
 
9. Disbursement 
Arrangements
One of the conditions of the October 2010 
restructuring of the project was to allow for the extension by 18 months of the IBRD loan 
closing date provided contracts to be financed with loan funds would be signed no later 
Page  6
6
than March 31, 2011 and projected to be 90% completed by the revised Closing Date of 
March 31, 2012.  Contracts signed after that date and any payments under eligible 
contracts falling due after the Closing Date will be financed with counterpart funds.  This 
in effect increases the share of counterpart contribution to project implementation, since 
any costs after March 31, 2012 will be entirely born by the client. In order to preserve a 
cost sharing ratio similar to the one originally intended of 73% loan funds and 27% 
counterpart funds and to ensure access to a greater portion of loan funds during the 
remaining implementation period, the disbursement percentage for all categories of 
expenditures and applicable to all contracts would be increased to 100% effective as of 
the date of the loan amendment pursuant to this restructuring.  This is consistent with the 
country financing parameters for Argentina.
