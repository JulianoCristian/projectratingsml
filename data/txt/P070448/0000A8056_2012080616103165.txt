                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The project aims at improving the capabilities of the provincial governments and their municipalities to more effectively manage their resources and improve the quality
                         of government administrative services. Its specific objectives are: i) to support the integrated development and adoption of basic management tools that are conducive
                         to the efficient and transparent management of provincial and municipal resources; ii) to strengthen provincial governments in such key areas as those related to land
                         tax and tax administration, human resources management, judicial services, civil registries, control entities and public safety functions; and iii) to support the
                         strengthening of municipal governments through pilot activities designed to demonstrate the benefits of integrated modernization efforts.

                         Implementation is in full swing with projects in the following provinces: Salta, Rio Negro, Mendoza, Neuquen, Santa Fe, Chubut and Formosa. A Bank/GOA co-sponsored workshop
                         involving sub-national government representatives and the central executing agency was held from June 5-6, 2012 to draw lessons learned from project implementation. The
                         workshop had a good turn out with all 7 provinces represented and over 30 participants. Each province did a brief presentation of their project, results obtained and problems
                         encountered during implementation. This ISR reflects the status of results indicators as of March 2012, and thus it does not differ much from the previous ISR. The next progress
