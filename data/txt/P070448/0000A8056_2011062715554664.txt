                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The project aims at improving the capabilities of the provincial governments and their municipalities to more effectively manage their resources and improve the
                         quality of government administrative services. Its specific objectives are: i) to support the integrated development and adoption of basic management tools that
                         are conducive to the efficient and transparent management of provincial and municipal resources; ii) to strengthen provincial governments in such key areas as
                         those related to land tax and tax administration, human resources management, judicial services, civil registries, control entities and public safety functions;
                         and iii) to support the strengthening of municipal governments through pilot activities designed to demonstrate the benefits of integrated modernization efforts.
