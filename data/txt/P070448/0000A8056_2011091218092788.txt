                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Project met target of committing most of the funds by end of April. Contracts for all activities were signed and have just commenced implementation. There are currently 21 projects
                         financing 8 different sectors in 7 provinces. During the next half of the year we should be able to monitor more concrete outputs and development targets. A supervision mission to
                         the the province of Santa Fe was able to confirm that implementation activities for strengthening judicial systems for the province are already resulting in reduced processing times
                         and increased access to information by the citizenry.
