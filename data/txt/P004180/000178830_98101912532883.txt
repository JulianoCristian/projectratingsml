LAO PEOPLE'S DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC
NAM NGUM HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT
1. ENERGY AND THE POWER SECTOR
An Overview
1.01      Laos is landlocked being surrounded by China in the north, Vietnam
in the east, Thailand and Cambodia in the south and Burma in the west. It
has a total land area of about 236,800 sq km and an estimated population of
about 3.2 million. The country consists of two main topographical regions:
the mountainous parts of the North and the East and the lowland alluvial
plains on the banks of the Mekong river.  The country is one of the poorest
in the world with an estimated GNP per capita of $100 per annum (1980).  The
country is basically agricultural with 90% of the population located in
rural areas. There are believed to be rich deposits of coal, iron, copper,
lead, tin, and other metals largely unexploited. The per capita consumption
of energy is low being about 2 barrels oil equivalent (gross), p.a. The
main source of energy (93%) is fuelwood. Electricity provides 2% and
petroleum products another 5% of the energy used in the country.
1.02      Laos has vast forest resources.  Despite the extensive damage done
by indiscriminate cuttings for fuelwood and by the Indochinese war, 40% /1
of the land area is still under effective forest cover, estimated at
10-11 million hectares. As yet no national forest inventory is available.
The official program envisages that 300-400 thousand hectares would be
inventoried each year and the task completed in 15 years. As against a
possible log output of 2 million cubic meters a year, current production is
about 10% of this figure and the 1985 target about 25% of the potential.
These outputs are primarily for the export market Which provided about US$9
million in 1979 in revenue or 25% of total exports exceeding income from power
sales to Thailand of about US$8.3 million.
1.03      In addition, Laos has great hydro resources.  The potential,
including the Mekong's, is over 18,000 MW of which only 113 MW has been
developed mostly at Nam Ngum and an additional 40 MW is planned under the
proposed project. Although the Mekong Committee has conducted some studies of
the hydro resources, these are generally at the reconnaissance stage.
This resource deserves to be tapped on a more systematic basis than has been
undertaken to date.
1.04      In contrast to the abundance of fuelwood and electricity, Laos
imports all of its petroleum requirements, which total about 400,000 bbl
annually, costing US$17-21 million. Electricity exports in 1979 financed
about 35% of the oil bill, Which preempts much of the country's foreign
/1 Based on land use maps drawn from satellite imagery.

exchange earnings. The local price /1 of oil products does not fully
reflect the high import cost.  Allocations are chiefly determined through
rationing rather than market forces. Imports mostly come through the Shell
Oil Company and retail distribution is effected by the Government fuel
corporation which is responsible to the Ministry of Public Works. Laos does
not have any identified petroleum reserves./2
1.05      Coal has been found in at least two areas:  around Vang Vieng in the
Northern Vientiane Province and in the Nam Pathene Basin in Khammouane
Province. The Vang Vieng mines are being surveyed for possible use in a
proposed cement plant in that area.
The Power Sector
1.06      The Nam Ngum hydroelectric plant (110 MW) located in Vientiane
Province, is the only important source of electricity generation in the
country (para. 3.03). In 1979, total sales of electricity amounted to 866 GWh
of which about 9% (78 GWh) was supplied to consumers in Laos and the remainder
91% was exported to Thailand.
1.07      Access to service.  Electricity is readily  available in Vientiane.
The present grid serves the city, the immediate vicinity, a few irrigation
pumping units, and some villages around Vientiane and Nam Ngum. Roughly
20-25% of households in the province have electricity and consumption
averages 130 kWh a month per connected household. Despite the relatively
high cost /3 of. getting the service, most households in Vientiane itself have
access to and use electricity.  This is because electric power is much cheaper
than any other alternative form of energy. Outside Vientiane only four other
provinces have public electricity supply: Savannakhet and Khammouane Provinces
which import 6-7 GWh a year from Thailand, and Champassak and Luang Prabang
Province which each produce about 4 GWh a year.
1.08      Existing Facilities.  The present total installed generating
capacity in Laos is 123 MW, consisting of about 113 MW of hydro and 10 MW of
diesel. Apart from the Nam Ngum plant (110 MW), Vientiane has 8 MW (4 x 2
MW) of diesel generating units installed at Sokpaluang which are now used as
/1 Official local prices range between 4.0 to 4.5 kips a liter, or US$65-70
per bbl at the official exchange rate. In contrast, at the free market
rate of exchange about 22 kip = US$1, product prices would be $29 to $32
per bbl while average import cost is $53 per bbl.
/2 According to a World Bank report, "oil could be located near Savannakhet"
- See Report No. 2282. LA, p. 22.
/3 Service connection costs 408 kips (US$40.80) for a 10 meter line from
the grid (single phase, 230 V service connection), and the corresponding
house wiring would cost about 275 kips (US$27.50) for 5 light points.

standby. In the event of loss of generation at Nam Ngum, power may be
imported from Thailand and supplemented by diesel generation from Sokpaluang.
The following table sets forth the location and MW capacities of existing
stations in Laos:

1.09      EDL's Vietiane transmission system is shown on the attached map
(IBRD 15514 R). In 1971, 72 km of 115 kV single circuit transmission lines
were constructed to transport energy to Vientiane's Phone Tong substation
from the first two-units (30 MW) installed at Nam Ngum. Phone Tong
substation was connected to Nong Khai and Udon substations in Thailand by an
additional 70 km, 115 kV single line. In 1978, a new 115 kV double circuit
transmission line was constructed from Nam Ngum to Phone Tong and Nong Khai
to transmit the additional output to Thailand from the next two units (2 x
40 MW) installed at Nam Ngum under Phase II and the anticipated output from
a possible fifth unlit (40 MW).
1.10      Power from Nam Ngum is stepped down from 115 kV to 22 kV at the
Phone Tong and Thanaleng substations in Vientiane by means of some 84 MVA of
115/22 kV transformer capacity. Subtransmission circuits from the step down
substations are then fed from 22 kV interconnected distribution substations at
Sisakheth, Sokpaluang, That Luang and Vat Tay. Distribution at 22 kV at Nam



- 4 -
Ngum is limited to electrification of EDL's staff quarters, and some small
villages near the Nam Ngum lake. 22 KV subtransmission and distribution
lines extend 210 km; LV lines total 465 route km. The subtransmission
system is shown in the map (IBRD 15514 R) attached to this report.
1,11      Rural Electrification.  About 95% of the country's population
living in some 10,000 villages and 10-12 towns do not have access to
electricity. Vientiane is an exception. EDL is expanding its rural network
in the Vientiane Plain using funds provided by the Asian Development Bank
(para. 1.13). The primary goal of the ADB's project is to provide power for
irrigation pumping and the development of agro-based and other small-scale
industries.
1.12      Distribution System Losses in Vientiane.  The distribution system
losses in Vientiane, including EDL's own-use, are high at 30%. The greatest
losses are due to incorrect meter readings and unmetered taps and by-passes
(14%). Primary and secondary lines losses account for another 10% and the
remainder is due to transmission system losses 2% and transformation losses
4%. At negotiations, EDL agreed to implement a program aimed to reduce these
losses to an acceptable level, especially since these losses reduce revenue
from EDL's sales to Thailand and has undertaken to prepare a program for the
reduction of distribution losses which it will submit to IDA for its review
by June 30, 1982. Provision has been made in the proposed IDA credit to
assist in implementation of the program to reduce distribution system
losses. The requirement and scope of any consultants services for this
component will be decided based on this review. Funds would also be
included to improve EDL's meter testing facilities (in all $210,000) (para.
3.09).
1.13      Power Development Program.  The Vientiane program, to be implemented
during 1981-85 (Annex 1), includes the expansion of the Nam Ngum generating
facilities (40 MW), the construction of 115 kV and 22 kV transmission
lines (270 km), low voltage distribution networks (150 km), and substations
(6,200 kVA). The Government is also planning a 115 kV transmission line
north of Nam Ngum to Vang Vieng to supply power to a cement plant. In
addition, 76 villages out of a total of 665 in the province will be
energized. The first three years (1981-83) of the 22 kV and low voltage
distribution program will be carried out using finance provided by ADB. The
salient features of the Vientiane program are shown in the attached Map
(IBRD-15514 R).
1.14      Major maintenance to the first two units at Nam Ngum which have
suffered extensive blade erosion, is being undertaken using funds granted
by the Government of Japan through the Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund
(OECF). The UN Capital Development Fund will finance on a grant basis
refurbishing of hydro plants in Luang Prabang and Selabam, the latter in the
southern province of Champassak. EDL has included these extraordinary
maintenance expenditures in its capital program (1981-85). Development
programs for other provinces will be based on studies under consideration or
envisaged in the proposed IDA project. The Government has commissioned a
study of electricity demand in the four southern provinces to establish a



- 5 -
least cost program for development of electricity supply with funds provided
under IDA's Third Agriculture and Rural Development Project (Credit No.
1021-LA).  Under this study, consultants would review the expected future
loads and consider the feasibility of taking further supplies through inter-
connections of the system with Thailand as an alternative to local generation.
In addition, a feasibility study of the Xeset (10 MW) hydro project in
Champassak, wil-l be undertaken using a grant of US$230,000 from ADB.
1.15      Ihe development of Laos' hydro potential might be achieved at a
comparative cost advantage over any power generation scheme in Thailand. On
the Nam Ngum river, for example, four other sites have been identified with a
total installed capacity of about 1,000 MW.  The Mekong Committee has already
conducted prefeasibility studies for many schemes oni Mekong tributaries in
Laos. However, these studies need review, necessary further investigations,
costing, also analysis for ranking accordinlg to econiomic merit, needs of
Thailand and Laos and other factors.  Tle Government would also like to
extend the electricity supplies in other provinces (i.e. outside Vientiane).
Accordingly, the proposed IDA credit includes $500,000 to further Mekong
Committee studies of the hydro-projeccs (excluding those on the Mekong
river) and establish hich should be considered next for future development.
It will also provide adequate information for Laos and Thailand to conduct
negotiations and devise a mechanism for jointly developing such projects.
Also, a study will be carried out to determine the optimum strategy for the
extension of power supply to the other provinces for which a provision of
$300,000 has been made.  This, along with the study in progress (para. 1.14)
will ensure that the strategy for developing power supplies will be evolved
in an optimal manner. At negotiations, the Government agreed to undertake
these studies employing consultants in accordance with the procedures set
out in the Bank's guidelines for use of consultants.
1.16       Sector Organization.  Electricite du Laos (EDL), is a wkiolly-owned
state enterprise, responsible for generations transmission and distribution
of electricity in Laos. Besides EDL, several agencies are directly
concerned with the operation of the power sector.  These include:
(a) the Ministry of Industry and Commerce;
(b) the National Planning Committee;
(c)  the Ministry of Finance;
(d) the Provincial Authorities;
(e) the Ministry of Public Work's; and
(f) the National Bank.
EDL is an executing and operating agency.  TUe responsibility for sector
planning and policy-making rests with the Ministry of Industry and Commerce
to which EDL reports.  Within the Ministry, the Department of Mechanics and
Electrical Energy coordinates development studies and regulatory functions.



The Ministry also supervises coal development and distribution. Policies
affecting the petroleum sector are, however, determined by the Mlinistry of
Public Workse
1.17      Tariffs. The prevailing rates from May 1981 are as follows:
Industrial and
Residential       agricultural
Province               rates              rates
Kip/kWh           Kip/kWh
Vientiane              0.23               0.17
Champassak             0.45               0.45
Savannakhet            0.45              0.35
Luang Prabang          0.36               0.25
Khammouane             0.30               0.25
The rates in Vientiane were increased to the above levels effective May 1,
1981. These increases which were almost six times the level of previously
existing rates, were implemented following a request by IDA that they be
gradually adjusted to reflect the long-run cost of supply from the Nam Ngum
plant. They are lower than the export price recently agreed with EGAT
(para. 1.18). During negotiations assurances were obtained from the
Government that the tariffs for electricity use within Laos will be reviewed
in consultation with IDA on an annual basis and revised progressively to
reflect by March 31, 1985 the long-run miarginal cost of supply. The present
tariffs are about 70% of the long-run marginal cost of supply. The future
revisions will assume greater significance for Laos because the projected
consumption of the cement factory which will go into operation near Vang
Vieng in 1984 and the lignite mine and the textile mill planned to become
operative in 1988 and 1990, will substantially reduce the amount of power
available for sale to EGAT.
1.18      Electricity rates and the future price formulation for EDL's sales
to EGAT in Thailand were reviewed /1 by Electrowatt Engineering Services
Ltd. (Switzerland) using funds provided also under IDA-s Third Agriculture
and Rural Development Project. An agreement was signed on October 21, 1981
between EDL and EGAT to price the exports at US 31 Mills/kWH from October 1,
1981 with provision for price escalation of 9% per annum for a five year
period ending September 30, 1986 after which the price would be reviewed on
the basis of economic conditions then prevailing.

2. THE PROJECT ENTITY AND THE BORROWER
Legislative Background
2.01      Prior to 1975, EDL was a public corporation responsible for
generating and distributing electricity in the country. After the present
Government came to power in 1975, EDL became a state enterprise reporting
to the Minister of Industry and Commerce. Until recently it has operated as
a Government Department but following a resolution (No. 217 of May 27, 1980)
of the Council of Ministers relating to state enterprises, it has been given
autonomy to manage its affairs subject to Government regulation and approval
of its plans. EDL's regulations have been drafted and are under consideration
by the Government. The regulations will cover such matters as the amount of
EDL's capital, its purposes, organization, objectives and obligations.
Internal regulations will be established by EDL's general manager. They will
relate to the rights and duties of workers and management.
Organization and Management
2.02      EDL is in the process of modifying its organization structure
following the "Council of Ministers' Directive on State Enterprises." The
proposed organization is shown in Annex 2. The general manager is appointed
by a decree of the Council of Ministers on the recommendation of the Minister
of Industry and Commerce to whom he is responsible through a three-man Manage-
ment Committee. The general manager will be supported by four deputy-general
managers responsible for planning, operation and maintenance, administration
and finance.  In the provinces, EDL has managers who operate the facilities
largely independently of EDL Vientiane except for procurement of materials and
technical support for construction and maintenance work which are coordinated
centrally from Vientiane. There is little prospect in the short-term of any
of the provinces being interconnected with the Vientiane system.
Training
2.03      As of mid-1980, EDL had about 1,000 employees of whom less than 40
had professional training. At the Nam Ngum power station, there are about
160 staff, and 7 have professional engineering qualifications. EDL is
responsible for upgrading its workers' skills, improving the living conditions
of the workers and for providing food and social welfare programs for them.
However, EDL lacks competent staff at all levels; management, planning,
operation and finance. This shortage has been aggravated by the departure of
large numbers of qualified staff since 1975, and also by the low level of
salaries.



Provision has been made in the proposed IDA Credit for training of
engineering and commercial personnel (para. 3.09) at a total cost of about
US$300,000. The proposed training will cover, inter alia, about 125
man-months of training for EDL personnel in technical areas of operation and
maintenance of power plant, transmission, distribution, relaying,
communications etc. and of EDL-s commercial staff in billing, storekeeping
and accounting.
2.04      EDL operates a training center, established in 1965 for the basic
training of trades level workers, particularly operators, wiremen, linesmen
and diesel mechanics. A two-year course is offered to about 64 candidates
each year. Selection is made from candidates between 16-19 years of age who
meet a minimum education requirement of six years. Plans to expand the
facility are being prepared by EDL and will comprise:
(a)  the construction of accommodation for teachers and students, who
will come from all parts of Laos; and
(b)  the expansion of the workshop for maintenance and repair of
electrical apparatus.
Provision has been made in the proposed IDA credit for tools and equipment
to improve the existing workshop and laboratory facilities at EDL's training
center (para. 3.09) at a cost of US$40,000. The building expansions will
be financed by the Government. The Government is also planning to build a
technical training institute in the next two to three years. This institute
will help to meet EDL's needs for technician level staff.
Accounts
2.05      Under the economic system in operation in Laos, EDL like all state
enterprises has responsibility for managing and operating the power sector
facilities but legal ownership of the assets is retained by the State.
However, EDL controls its own finances and is expected to earn a profit.
EDL is required to remit its profits, depreciation and taxes to the State
Budget each quarter based on its annual plan agreed with the Government.
Although the depreciation payments are not identified from other State
budget funds, they are considered to be available to the enterprise to meet
the cost of major overhauls and to replace worn out or obsolete assets. The
actual rates of depreciation are established by the Ministry of Finance.
Tax and duty payments to the Government amount to 3.3% of operating
revenues. If EDL exceeds its planned profit, the surplus can be used to
expand its facilities (50%) to augment its Social Welfare Fund (30%) and to
pay workers bonuses (20%).



- 9 -
2.06      The Ministry of Industry and Commerce reviews EDL's annual capital
and operating budgets with the Ministry of Finance and the National Planning
Committee (NPC). The plans are then approved by the Council of Ministers.
The provincial authorities of EDL and Government prepare the budgets and
production plans for the provinces and supervise program implementation.
The NPC is also responsible for coordinating the development of long-term
plans. A five-year development plan for 1981-85 has been recently prepared.
2.07      All funds needed by EDL for capital and operating purposes are
provided by allocations from the State Budget. In practice, EDL obtains
sufficient funds for operations from its own revenues. However,
restrictions on the level of working capital funds are being applied by
Government based on established norms. Public enterprises in need of
working capital funds in excess of the norm are expected to obtain them
through loans from the National Bank.
2.08      EDL does not record any long-term debt in its books since all
foreign borrowings have been contracted by Government and the proceeds made
available to EDL as Government contributions. However, it is maintaining
the detailed records of foreign loans arranged on its behalf by Government
and is now providing in its annual budget for debt service payments on this
debt.
2.09      EDL, Vientiane does not receive any information on the costs of
operations and revenues of the provincial centers and for the same reason
does not include the assets and liabilities of the provincial systems in its
balance sheet. In 1978, the Government prepared a new chart of accounts
which is being adopted by EDL and other public corporations. However, it
has few trained staff and its accounting systems and equipment are cumbersome
and unable to provide basic accounting and costing information. The electri-
city billing and addressing machines are so unreliable that EDL is about 2-3
months behind in issuing its electricity accounts. Under ADB's recently
approved loan for the Vientiane Plain Rural Electrification Project, EDL will
be provided with, a financial advisor who will review its accounting proce-
dures and systems and make recommendations for improvements. In the proposed
IDA credit, provision is being made for the replacement of EDL's existing
accounting machines ($210,000) (para. 3.09).
Audit
2.10      EDL prepares regular quarterly, semi-annual and annual financial
and operating reports. Workers assemble twice a year to receive reports on
operations, plans, organization and living conditions. Responsibility for
audit of EDL-s financial statements belongs to the Department of Finance in
the Ministry of Industry and Commerce and to the Ministry of Finance. Their
audits comprise detailed inspections of production operations, fixed assets,
planning and financial activities. They also establish the degree of compli-
ance with labor conditions and review wages and workers- living conditions.



- 10 -
:.'2c Creports for past years have been made available to IDA.  At
negotiations, EDL agreed that beginning with FY83, its financial statements
would be audited by independent auditors acceptable to IDA and copies of the
audited financial statements and the auditors' reports would be submitted to
A:l       I 1.h1 SiSf r9omths of the end of EDL's fiscal year.  The scope and content
of the au-dit reports would be agreed with IDA by not later than December 31,
1982.
Insurance
2.11      No specific arrangements are made by EDL for insurance of its
assets against loss arising from risks normally encountered by public utility
organizations.  The Government, as the owner of all assets managed by state
enterprises is responsible for meeting any losses Which cannot be covered
from the enterprise's normal revenues and this arrangement is acceptable to
IDA.  However, in case of the project, at negotiations, EDL agreed to ensure
that .ts con-tractors for the civil works and suppliers of equipment and
materials would take out appropriate insurance coverage during the
construction period.
3. THE PROJECT
Objectives and Description
3.01      The objectives of the proposed project are to:
(a) optimize output from the Nam Ngum generating station by installing
an additional 40 MW turbine-generator at the existing Nam Ngum
powers tation;
(b) assist EDL and EGAT to revise the agreement for the sale of
electricity from Nam Ngum to Thailand, to provide a satisfactory
rate;
(c) assist the Laos' Government and EDL in the study of hydroelectric
schemes within Laos to establish which projects should be con-
sidered next for development with cooperation of Thailand which is
fast running out of low cost renewable energy options.  Laos, on
the other hand, has many potential hydroelectric sites which could
be developed for the mutual benefit of Laos and Thailand;
(d) study the optimum strategy for extending power supply to other
provinces in Laos; and
(e) strengthen EDL-s organization.



- 11 -
3.02      The project consists of the installation of a fifth turbine-
generator unit (40 MW capacity) together with a short penstock and associated
intake gate, hoist and trash racks at the existing Nam Ngum hydroelectric
plant, similar in specifications to the third and fourth units installed under
Phase II (para. 3.03); auxiliary equipment including a stand-by heat exchanger
and communication equipment and a step-up substation. Civil construction
works consist of the embedding of the guides for the intake gate, clearing
of the No. 5 intake, embedding of the No. 5 turbine spiral case, and the
completion of the concreting (estimated at 2,500 cubic meters) around the
turbine-generator set. Some improvements to the drainage system of the entire
plant will also be carried out to improve plant reliability. Also included
are the necessary consulting engineering services, studies of the
hydropotential and power development of Laos, assistance for reduction of
distribution losses, training of EDL staff and provision of training tools
and equipment and accounting machines.
3.03      The Nam Ngum Hydroelectric Plant is located on the river of the same
name approximately 80 km north of Vientiane. The existing facilities, having
a total capacity of 110 MW and annual energy production of about 800 GWh, were
completed under two phases: Phase I, two 15 MW units placed in commercial
operation in 1971 and financed by a Development Fund /1 administered by the
World Bank; and Phase II, two 40 MW units placed in commercial operation in
1978 and financed under a Second Development Fund administered by the Asian
Development Bank/2 and with bilateral financing provided through Kreditanstalt
fur Wiederaufbau (KfW) of West Germany.
3.04      The existing 468 m long and 75 m high concrete gravity dam was
completed under Phase I. The reservoir has a catchment area of 8,460 sq km
and a surface area of 370 sq km at full supply level. The gross storage
capacity is 7,030 million cubic meters (MCM) and the usable storage between
elevation 212 meters and 196 meters above sea level is 4,700 MCM against the
average annual flow of about 10,000 MCM. The reservoir retention level was
raised during Phase II from elevation 202 meters above sea level by the
installation of four 12.5 m by 9.5 m radial spillway gates. The net available
head for the turbines varies from 28.5 meters (minimum) to 45.5 meters
(maximum).
3.05      The four existing turbines are Francis type supplied by Hitachi of
Japan. The generators for units 3 and 4 were provided by AEG of West Germany.
The generator voltage of 11 kV is stepped up to 115 kV and transmitted over
three transmission circuits to Vientiane and to Thailand, a total distance of
about 100 km.  These three circuits have adequate capacity to transmit the
power generated by the existing 110 MW and the proposed fifth unit.
/1  The Fund was made up of grants from the governments of Australia, Canada,
Denmark, France, Japan, the Netherlands, New Zealand and the United
States. Thailand supplied cement and electrical energy for construction
in exchange for future repayment in energy (already repaid) from the
Phase I project.
/2 Contributors to the fund were Japan, Australia, Canada, France, India,
Netherlands, New Zealand, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and Laos.



- 12 -
3.06      The fifth unit (40 MW) which would be of similar specifications as
units 3 and 4, would be installed in the existing powerhouse where provision
was made for it in Phase II. It would enable average annual energy
production to be increased by approximately 145 GWh due to use of overflow
water and avoid loss of production during machine outages for maintenance.
Further, it would ensure the greater usage of higher efficiency units and,
increase the reliability of supply (Annex 3).
Project Cost Estimate
3.07      The project cost based on October 1981 prices (excluding interest
during construction) is estimated at US$20 million and is summarized below.
Details are in Annex 4:
Foreign  Local   Total

Total Project Cost           18P565  1,435  20,000
3.08      Nam Ngum unit 5 costs are based on estimates prepared by Motor
Columbus, Consulting Engineers, Inc. of Switzerland, using prices from Phase
II contracts awarded in 1976 and 1977 after international competitive bidding
and considering mid-1980 estimates offered by the manufacturer of the Phase
II generators (AEG of Germany). Since the equipment specifications for
unit 5 will be practically the same as those for the Phase II contracts and
little uncertainty exists in detailed engineering, a physical contingency
of 5% was considered adequate. Price contingencies have been included as
follows:



- 13 -
1981    1982    1983    1984    1985
Local                   16%    12%      12%     10%       9%
Foreign                  9%     8.5%    7.5%    7.5%    7.5%
EDL is not subject to customs duties or taxes on equipment and materials in
the project. The estimated cost of about US$450/kW is reasonable and takes
account of the fact that neither major civil works nor transmission line
expansions are necessary.
3.09      The cost estimates also include provisions for studies (US$800,000)
(para. 1.15), training for engineers and professionals from the technical and
commercial departments of EDL (US$300,000) (para. 2.03); accounting machines
for billing and collections (US$210,000) (para. 2.09); tools and equipment
for EDL's trade training center (US$40,000) (para. 2.04) and assistance for
reduction of distribution systems losses (US$150,000) and meter testing
facilities (US$60,000) (para. 1.12). Training costs were estimated at a
basic man-month rate of US$2,000 per man-month for 125 man-months of training.
Tools and equipment costs were based on estimates prepared by EDL from recent
manufacturers catalogues.
Project Financing
3.10      IDA and the OPEC Fund /1 for International Development (OPEC Fund)
will finance 95% of the total project cost. The Government of Laos would
finance the remaining 5%. The joint IDA/OPEC Fund financing would cover all
the foreign exchange costs of the project (estimated at US$18.6 million, or
93% of the project cost). About 30% of the local currency cost, (US$435,000)
will be financed by the OPEC Fund. Laos' participation would be US$1 million
equivalent in local cost financing. The proposed financing plan is shown
below with amounts expressed in thousands of US dollars equivalent:
Foreign       Local

on August 24, 1981.



- 14 -
3 iX     The OPEC Fund loan of US$4 million would be administered by IDA
under a Joint financing arrangement. The loan was made to the Government on
0-rer terms including a 5-year period of grace subject to payment of a
i:_ca charge of 0.75% per annum.  The OPEC Fund loan would be onlent to EDL
at an -}nterest rate of 8%.  The IDA credit would be onlent to EDL on Bank
te_nis to low income countries, i.e., 20 years with 5 years grace at the
current Bank rate of interest. Effectiveness of the OPEC Fund loan and
:eaiution of a subsidiary loan agreement with EDL (acceptable to IDA) to
onlend the proceeds of the IDA credit would be conditions of effectiveness of
tke proposed IDA credit. A Project Agreement would be signed with EDL.
?1roject_ Implementation
II.     Project implementation activity has been initiated in September 1981
by Motor Columbus of Switzerland who are the project consultants (para. 3.14).
T'le new unit is scheduled for commissioning in the first quarter of 1985. The
detailed implementation schedule, included in Annex 5, assumes that the
equipment contracts would be awarded in September 1982 and the civil construc-
tion contract not later than November 1982 to ensure project completion as
envisaged. The implementation schedule is reasonable.
3S13      The annual schedule of project investments and disbursements based
on the anticipated progress in placing contracts is detailed in Annex 6.
Engineering and Construction
3.14      Motor Columbus of Switzerland who were the consultants for Phase II
of the Nam Ngum project have been selected by EDL as consultants for the
proposed expansion. They will be responsible for the engineering, tendering,
contract monitoring, and construction management services required for the
project in accordance with the detailed terms of reference approved by IDA.
The design review and preparation of tender documents (scheduled to be
completed by end-December 1981) will be financed from the IDA credit 1021-LA
at a cost of about US$160,000.
3.15      The total cost of engineering services will be Sw. Fr. 1.7 million
(SO.f million), involving about 55 manmonths of expatriate staff effort
~nclud½ng 30 manmonths spent in Laos. The basic manmonth rate for expatriates
averages Sw, Fr. 22,590 (US$11,825 equivalent). The gross manmonth rate
includlng field services, direct expenses, travel, subsistence in Laos etc.
averages Sw.  Fr. 30,900 (US$16,180 equivalent).  The services include
operational training of the EDL staff and post commissioning assistance by
consultants.
3.16      During negotiations EDL has agreed to form a project implementation
unit by March 31, 1982 to provide the maximum participation of EDL personnel
with the engineering consultant. The head of this, unit will be responsible
for coordination with the consultants' project manager. The resident
engineer, civil engineer, electrical engineer, mechanical engineer and
accountant assigned by the consulting firm will each have counterparts from



- 15 -
the technical and construction departments of EDL. A similar arrangement
proved satisfactory during the Phase II construction.  The training and
experience gained by EDL personnel under this arrangement will be useful
for future operation and maintenance of the plant.
Procurement and Disbursement
3.17      EDL has responsibility for its own procurement subject to consul-
tation with its Ministry on major contracts and will undertake procurement
for the proposed project with the assistance of its consultants. All works,
equipment and materials are proposed to be procured under ICB procedures.
3.18      Four supply contracts (turbine and auxiliaries; generator and
accessories; electrical equipment; and penstock, gate, hoist tower and racks
along with civil works) are proposed. A separate contract will be made
for communication equipment to improve protection and voice communication
facilities, for uhich the cost of terminal equipment at Udon II substation
will be borne by EGAT.
3.19      The proposed IDA credit together with the OPEC fund loan will
finance 100% of all foreign costs, shared in the ratio of 80.8% and 19.2%
respectively.  The local costs of the project will be financed 30.3% by the
OPEC Fund loan and 69.7% by the Government of Laos (para. 3.10). No
retroactive financing is proposed from the IDA credit.
3.20       The following tabulation shows the estimated IDA credit disburse-
ments.  Standard disbursement profiles were not used in this case as the
project consists of installation of a unit in an existing powerhouse with
all civil works in place and thus the project does not conform to a standard
hydropower project.

3.21      The closing date for disbursements under the proposed IDA credit
would be September 30, 1985.
Environment
3.22      The project has no environmental risks since it only adds a fifth
unit to the existing hydro powerstation without increasing the size of the
reservoir, or transmission facilities.
Project Risks
3.23      The major risk for project implementation would be the possibility
of the Thai-Laos border being closed which would prevent the free flow of
equipment and materials during the construction. Such an eventuality could
delay the implementation of the project. Also an inherent risk in a project
of this type is the possibility that at some future date either Thailand or
Laos may abrogate the sales agreement and refuse to buy or sell power.
However, given the fact that both countries benefit from the agreement and
considering the experience of the last ten years during which there has been
no interruption to supply, such a possibility is considered to be remote.
4. FINANCIAL ASPECTS
past Performance and Present Position
4.01      Since the new Government took over in 1975, EDL has not been able
to prepare reliable financial accounts. A balance sheet was prepared by
EDL for the 1979 financial year and statements of income and expenditure have
been reviewed for the years 1977 through 1979.  The latter show that EDL has
operated profitably and, especially since Phase II of Nam Ngum was commis-
sioned at the end of 1978, contributed significantly to the Government's
finances. During this period the currency was devalued about 100% against the
US dollar and finally at the end of 1979 it was withdrawn and replaced by new
kip.  For these reasons, no historical financial data prior to 1980 has been
presented in this report.  The figures for 1980 are shown in Annexes 8 and 9.
4.02      EDL presently sells about 90% of the electricity it produces to
Thailand and its revenues are a major source of Laos' foreign exchange earn-
ings. In 1979, these sales were valued at US$8.3 million and represented
about a third of the country's foreign exchange earnings. EDL's operating
income in 1980 of about US$3 million equivalent represented about a 3%
rate of return on its average net fixed assets after revaluation. EDL's



- 17 -
costs of operations are low. Direct salary payments to its staff average
below $40 a month but are supplemented by Government subsidized food, clothing
and other indirect benefits. Most major maintenance has been deferred at Nam
Ngum but EDL sets aside provisions for future maintenance equivalent to 0.5%
of its gross fixed assets.
4.03      An agreement between Laos and Thailand executed in 1971 for a ten-
year period provided for all surplus energy generated at Nam Ngum to be
exported to Thailand and paid for by EGAT at the rate of 4.5 mills per kWh.
In October 1975, this rate was revised to 10.5 mills per kWh to reflect the
increased cost of production from Nam Ngum. However, the revised price did
not match the increase in fuel oil prices or the increased alternative cost of
power to Thailand. Renegotiation of the price agreement to bring the selling
price to a satisfactory level was made a condition of the negotiation of this
credit and the Bank assisted EDL and EGAT in this process. In October 21,
1981, EDL and EGAT reached an agreement (Annex 7) according to which the
revised price of Nam Ngum power supplied to Thailand was adjusted to US 31
mills per kWh from October 1, 1981 (para. 1.18).
4.04      Most of EDL-s existing long-term debts (contracted by the
Government) are related to the Nam Ngum Phase II expansion and are owed 54% to
KfW (West Germany) and 35% to OECF (Japan). At the end of 1980, outstanding
long-term debts amounted to about US$62 million equivalent. All of this
amount is on soft terms repayable over periods ranging from 20-50 years.
4.05      At the end of 1980 EDL's net fixed assets had a historical value
equivalent to about US$65 million. The Nam Ngum facilities and the associated
transmission lines and substations comprised more than 90% of EDL's fixed
assets. Much of the remaining assets comprise obsolete machinery and
equipment including Vientiane-s diesel generating plant which is maintained on
stand-by for emergency use. After revaluing EDL-s main facilities using the
price level deflator for capital investment (the index also used by EGAT for
annual revaluation of its fixed assets), these assets have been valued at
about US$130 million after allowing for depreciation.
Financing Plan
4.06      EDL's financial projections, Income Statement, Statement of Sources
and Application of Funds and Balance Sheets for 1981-85 including assumptions
used are given in Annexes 8-11. Its estimated financing plan for the
four-year project construction period (1982-85) is given below:

4.07      EDL's capital expenditures during the four years 1982-85 are esti-
mated at NK 583 million, of which NK 235 million or about 40% represents the
cost of the proposed Nam Ngum project (including NK 35 million for interest
during construction) and NK 348 million (60%) is for other capital works
listed in Annex 1.  The Government's budget allocations will provide NK 358
million (61%); NK 219 million (38%) will come from borrowings and NK 6 million
(1%) would be a grant from the Government of Japan. EDL-s internal cash
generation during the period, after meeting the debt service and working
capital requirements, is projected to amount to NK 854 million or about 1.5
times the estimated capital expenditures and will be remitted to the
Government. Thus, there will be a net transfer of funds from EDL to the
Government of NK 496 million (US$49.6) over the four-year period.
Future Financial Position
4.08      The revised rate for electricity sales to EGAT effective October 1,
1981 (para. 4.03), will help substantially to improve the financial
performance of EDL. Some highlights are given below:

to Government (NK million)             -     74      194    208    214    238
4.09      EDL-s rate of return on net revalued fixed assets during the projec-
ted period will be 8% or higher compared to 3% in FY80 and 4% in FY81. Its
self-generation of funds will fully cover its capital expenditures and will
leave an average of NK 124 million per annum for transfer to the Government.
EDL's debt as a percentage of its capitalization is estimated to come down
from 42% in FY81 to 31% in FY85 mainly because of the large additions to
equity resulting from the assumed revaluation of assets.



_ 20 -
4.10      The electricity price agreed between EDL and EGAT (para. 1.18)
enables EDL to achieve a reasonable financial rate of return. The agreement
provides that (a) EGAT will purchase surplus electricity from EDL for at
least ten years and (b) the price to be negotiated from October 1986 will be
reviewed in light of economic conditions at the time. Hence no specific
financial performance covenants have been sought. EDL, however, undertook
at negotiations to (a) include all long-term debt arranged on its behalf by
Government in its future balance sheets and to show the related debt service
payments in its financial statements (i.e., income and sources and applica-
tion of funds statements); (b) revalue its gross fixed assets annually in
accordance with procedures acceptable to the IDA to facilitate calculation
of its annual rate of return performance. For the purposes of revaluation
of EDL's assets, the fixed capital formation deflator used by EGAT would be
used and this is acceptable to the Association. It was also agreed that any
change to the electricity sales agreement without IDA-s prior approval may
lead to suspension of the credit.
5. JUSTIFICATION
Power Market
5.01      The Vientiane power system constitutes the bulk of electricity
supply in Laos. The system serves two markets, domestic and foreign.
Currently the latter outlet amounts to 90% of the grid output.  Although the
local demand is now limited, it could expand rapidly in the 1980s. Much
depends on the growth of the economy: with the expanding use of electricity
in agriculture and industry, Nam Ngum's capacity would increasingly be
diverted from the external to the domestic market. Such a development
promoting the growth of the domestic economy would be beneficial to Laos.
5.02      Domestic Market.  Local market expansion depends on the state of
the economy which is expected to grow by 5.5-6.0% p.a. in the 1980s - 5% in
agriculture, 7-8% in industry and 6% in the service sector.  Lack of trained
manpower, established institutions and foreign exchange are major bottle-
necks which might, however, slow down the economic growth rate,
5.03      The demand projections detailed in Annex 12 and summarized in the
following table show that the generating capability of Nam Ngum would continue
to remain in excess of local demand thus permitting the export of surplus
energy to Thailand.

5.04      Foreign Market.  EDL's 1979 sales to EGAT (788 GWh) were about 5.6%
of the electricity generated in Thailand in that year. But because of
increased Laotian consumption in the 1980s, exports from the projected 150 MW
Nam Ngum facilities could fall; the estimated 1990 sales to Thailand are
projected at 536 GWh or less than 1.5% of the EGAT output for that year.
5.05      The average increase in output attributable to the proposed fifth
unit at Nam Ngum (145 GWh p.a.)/l would all be exported in the initial
years. In later years when the energy is locally used the benefit would be
larger than that obtained by revenue from sale of electricity to Thailand
due to indirect benefit by generation of consumer surplus. In the economic
analysis, the selling price to Thailand would indicate a fair measure of the
benefit from the project.

Project Justification
5.06      For the project to be cost effective both Thailand and Laos must
benefit from it. Thailand can only be expected to buy electricity from Laos
if it is to its advantage. Similarly, Laos should only invest in the project
if the economic rate of return is satisfactory.
5.07      The following table (The Supply Cost of Other Alternative Schemes
for Thailand) shows that the proposed project would provide electricity to
Thailand at the least-cost after considering all possible alternatives. The
Bang Pakong Project, which is already being constructed and forms part of the
least cost program for Thailand,/l is estimated to produce power at US3.7-6.8
cents per kWh, depending on the price of gas. EGAT's long-range cost is,
however, closer to the upper rather than the lower limit of the cost range,
since Thailand's gas and lignite reserves are insufficient to fully satisfy
the expected increase in electricity demand. Therefore, barring the massive
development of international hydro either on the Mekong or in neighboring
countries, EGAT's fuel imports must increase if the power requirements of its
rapidly expanding market are to be met. The table also presents the supply
cost of nuclear and coal-fired electricity, these costs being substantially
higher than those of the project. Therefore it is reasonable to assume that
sufficient incentive will exist for EGAT to continue to buy power from Nam
Ngum, over the foreseeable future.

Economic Rate of Return
5.08      The agreed price for the sale of Nam Ngum power will be US¢3.1 per
kWh from October 1, 1981 with an escalation of 9% per annum up to 1986,  kien
renegotiations will take place (para. 1.18, 4.03).  Since the escalation in
the tariff at 9% per annum is fixed, the present value of the price per kWh
of electricity in 1985-86 will depend on the actual inflation rate compared
to the 9% agreed.  Me table below shows the price with the agreed escalation
formula (Column 2) and the present worth of the 1985-86 tariff for two
assumed patterns of inflation (Columns 4 and 6).  From this it would be
observed that if the inflation is assumed to decrease from 9.0% in 1981/82 to
7.5% in 1985/86, the present value of electricity will be US$32.77 mills/kWh.
On the other hand, if inflation is assumed at a rate of 10% per year, the
present value will be US$29.89 mills/kWh.

5.09      Thus, accepting 9% as a fixed percentage for escalating the price
every year has a certain element of risk. However, since the Nam Ngum Unit
No. 5 will be commissioned only in early 1985, and since the escalation
formula is due for renegotiation prior to October 1986, it should be possible
to adjust the tariff level at that stage to compensate for unexpectedly large
movement in escalation rates.  Therefore, for the purpose of the analysis of
the internal economic rate of return of the project, the price of US$31 mills
per kWh is used and tested for sensitivity (Annex 14).
5.10      Annex 14 shows the calculations for the internal economic rate
of return (IERR). The basic assumptions are (a) capital expenditure as per
the SAR; (b) O&M costs at 3% of the capital costs; (c) production of
additional energy due to 5th unit will be 145 GWh, resulting in additional
sales to Thailand of 130 GWh (about 10% loss). On this basis the IERR for
the base case works out to be 17.85%. Sensitivity analysis shows the
following:
IERR
(a)  Change in capital cost   + 10%    16.45%
+ 20%    15.25%
(b)  Revenue 10% higher                   19.45%
10% lower                   16.15%
(c) Capital cost 10% higher
and revenue 10% lower              14.35%
The IERR to Laos of 17.8% is considered acceptable particularly since the
project's combined economic rate of return to Laos and Thailand is consider-
ably higher.
6. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
6.01      At Negotiations Government agreed:
(a)  to undertake studies employing consultants in accordance with pro-
cedures set out in the Bank's guidelines for use of consultants
to evaluate the potential hydro projects (excluding those on the
Mekong river) to establish which should be considered next for
future development and to evolve an optimum strategy for the
extension of power supply to other provinces (i.e. outside
Vientiane) (para. 1.15); and



- 26 -
(b) that the tariffs for electricity use within Laos will be reviewed
with IDA on an annual basis and revised progressively
to reflect by March 31, 1985 the long-term marginal cost of supply
(para. 1.17).
6.02      EDL agreed to:
(a) implement a program aimed to reduce distribution losses to an
acceptable level (para. 1.12);
(b) beginning FY83, its financial statements would be audited by
independent auditors acceptable to IDA and copies of the audit
report would be submitted to IDA within 6 months of the end of
its fiscal year. The scope and content of the audit reports
would be agreed with IDA not later than December 31, 1982
(para. 2.10);
(c) ensure that its contractors for the civil works and suppliers of
equipment and materials for the project would take out appropriate
insurance coverage (para. 2.11);
(d)  form a project implementation unit by March 31, 1982
to provide the maximum participation of EDL personnel with the
engineering consultant (para. 3.16);
(e)  include all long-term debt arranged on its behalf by Government
in its future balance sheets and to show the related debt service
payments in its financial statements (i.e. income and funds
statements) (para. 4.10);
(f) revalue its gross fixed assets annually in accordance with
procedures acceptable to IDA (para. 4.10); and
6.03      It was also agreed that any change to the electricity sales agree-
ment without IDA's prior approval may lead to suspension of the credit
(para. 4.10).
6.04      Effectiveness of the OPEC Fund loan and the execution of a
subsidiary loan agreement with EDL (acceptable to IDA), to onlend the
proceeds of the IDA credit (para. 3.11) would be conditions of effectiveness
of the proposed IDA credit.
6.05      Subject to agreement on the issues set forth in this report, the
proposed project is suitable for an IDA credit of US$15 million to the
Government of Laos.

Additional Energy Generation From Unit 5
1.        The Motor Columbus Consulting Engineers, Inc. of Switzerland
(Motor Columbus) used its computer program facilities in preparing monthly
average energy production estimates for EDL. Inflow data used by Motor
Columbus was based on information provided by Nippon Koei of Japan in its
feasibility study of Phase I. The average inflow in the Nam Ngum reservoir
over the 42-year study period (January 1929 - December 1970) is 10,300 MCM and
the monthly distribution is shown in the following tabulation:

2.        Flow observations from 1972 to 1979 confirm this pattern.  Maximum
inflows are in the months of June, July, August and September. Actual usable
storage of the reservoir is between 196 masl and 212 masl and amounts
to 4,700 MCM. With four units in operation (existing hydroplant), the total
inflow of an average year cannot be utilized and spill would occur. The
expected spill in an average year is over 1,600 MCM with four units in opera-
tion, corresponding to an annual generation of 150 GWh. Approximately 65%
of this volume, or 100 GWh, is spilled in August and September.
3.        The Motor Columbus program constraints were target water level at
the end of each month, and minimum required output. Evaporation, precipita-
tion and run-off coefficients (for the reservoir area) were given as average
values. Reservoir data (area, volume, tailrace, elevation as a function of
outflow) were interpolated from given tables. Maximum capacity of turbines
was determined from actual net head.
4.        On this basis, the theoretical maximum generation possible with
four units (Phase I and II), during an average inflow year amounts to a total
802.6 GWh in the Motor Columbus study. The monthly distribution of this
generation is summarized as follows:

5.         This total theoretical maximum energy cannot be reached (except in
above average years) because units must be shut down for maintenance. As
the units age, the maintenance requirements would generally increase. Regu-
lar overhauls would contribute to the decrease of future plant outage rates.
As an example, it will be necessary to take Units 1 and 2 out of service for
a total of 210 days in 1981 and 1982, mainly to repair severely corroded
parts (guides and stay vanes, head cover and speed rings). Since the repairs
of Units 1 and 2 are urgent and cannot be postponed until the fifth unit
will be in operation, a loss in average energy production of some 35 GWh is
anticipated from those units in each of the years mentioned.
6.         An average outage period for preventative maintenance for each
machine at Nam Ngum would be about three weeks per year, resulting in about
a 6% loss of production. Also, further reduction in station output by about
3% each year can be estimated for unscheduled outages due to faults and for
minor maintenance beyond the annual preventative maintenance program,
reflecting about 10 days per year. The annual preventive maintenance
schedule for each unit of approximately 3 weeks per year is relatively high
when compared to the US average of 1.5 weeks per unit per year./l It should
be noted that the Nam Ngum plant will be a base load plant with units
operating at full load for long periods of time, while the average US
hydroplants are mainly peaking plants operating only a few hours a day. In
this regard, weekend maintenance on US peaking units is common When demand
is low.  In some cases, the weekend down-time is not summed in the
maintenance-day computation. Further, in Laos, long delivery time of spare
parts must be taken into consideration as well as the lack of specialists in
the country to perform turbine and generator overhaul.
7.         Addition of the fifth unit, with a capacity of 40 MW, would make
it possible for the plant to increase its energy production for the following
reasons:
(a) it would permit routine and preventative maintenance as well as
unscheduled maintenance to be done without loss of energy produc-
tion;

D.C., March 1968, page 7.



- 31-                           ANNEX 3
Page3
(b)  it would permit the maximum usage of the higher efficiency 40 MW
units compared to the 15 MW units (see unit characteristics in
Attachment 1); and
(c)  it would permit a greater utilization of the reservoir inflow by
especially allowing for the use of the spill energy during monsoon
months.
8.        In the long-range view, about 10% of the theoretical maximum of
802.6 GWh, i.e. about 80 GWh, would appear a reasonable assumption of the
annual lost production of the existing four-unit plant, due to outages and
the extended usage of the two 15-MW units in the 4-unit operating scheme which
can now be replaced by the single 40-MW fifth, having a 4% higher turbine
efficiency, (the gain due to this is estimated at about 7.0 GWh per year).
9.        The maximum generation possible with 5 units, maintaining the con-
straints required in reservoir operation to provide a minimum monthly energy
production during an average year, would amount to 856 GWh in the Motor
Columbus proposal. The monthly distribution of this production is summarized
as follows:
GWh                                  GWh
January             82.3            July                  53.1
February           103.2            August                84.8
March              106.9            September             88.6
April               89.1            October               86.7
May                 77.1            November              41.8
June                17.7            December              23.7
Total Maximum Generation Phase I and II and III          855.6
10.       Under the Motor Columbus proposal, the installation and operation
of a fifth generating unit of 40 MW/50 MVA would increase the installed capa-
city at Nam Ngum from 110 MW to 150 MW. Utilization of the spill water
would be improved, resulting in added production of approximately 53 GWh in
an average year. It is reasonable to assume that the reservoir level could
be reduced further than indicated by Motor Columbus in several of the months
during the year to provide unused reservoir volume for a higher utilization
of the spill in August and September. It is felt that such an operation
could increase spill utilization in an average year and result in an
increased additional energy benefit averaging about 65 GWh rather than the
53 GWh proposed by Motor Columbus. This revised figure of additional energy
benefit, considered conservative, concurs with the similar figure calculated
by the Mekong Committee prepared for the Bank in May 1980.

11.       In summary, the total energy benefit realizable by the installation
of the fifth unit at Nam Ngum would be about 145 GWh, segregated as follows,
based on average year computations;

Assumptions for Financial Projections
1.        Operating Revenues are projected on the basis of the GWh sales to
EGAT and to domestic consumers at the rates agreed with EGAT and EDL's
current tariffs for domestic consumers escalated 9% annually. Revenues from
house wiring and connections follow the program of new connections for
domestic consumers.
2.        Operating Expenses are based on EDL/missions forecasts for staff
salaries, maintenance, repairs, etc. Taxes and duties amount to 3% of
operating revenues and depreciation has been assumed at about 2.6% on the
revalued average gross fixed assets.
Funds Remitted to Government
3.        Net internally generated funds after meeting the debt service and
working capital requirements are assumed remitted to Government in full.
4.        State Budget Allocation represent the funds which Government will
invest in EDL to finance the capital expenditures, after taking into account
the funds available from the proposed IDA credit; the OPEC Fund and ADB
loans; and the Government of Japan grant for rehabilitation of Nam Ngum Units
1 and 2.
Surplus Arising From Revaluation of Assets
5.        Gross fixed assets and accumulated depreciation are assumed
revalued at 10% annually.
