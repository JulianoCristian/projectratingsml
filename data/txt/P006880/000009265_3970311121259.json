Traditionally, this has been\n            public sector dominated, conservative, elite and driven by\n            supply rather than demand. As part of the Government's\n            National Agricultural Technology Transfer Program, the\n            Project will achieve the following: (a) introduce a new\n            approach, in support of the National System for Agricultural\n            Technology Development and Transfer, including with measures\n            to build institutional capacity, which would promote the\n            development and testing of technical packages especially\n            appropriate for small farmers, and to divulge new\n            technology; (b) promoting private sector participation in\n            agricultural research; (c) improving the quality and\n            efficiency of agricultural research by introducing a demand\n            driven, competitive selection system that will cofinance\n            projects with universities and private and public sector\n            entities; (d) supporting decentralization of agricultural\n            research and extension activities by strengthening regional\n            centers, training agricultural extensions, and disseminating\n            information; and (e) revitalizing underused assets, both\n            physical and human, that presently exist within\n            Colombia's research services system. Research funded\n            under the Project will ultimately help to reduce rural\n            poverty, increase rural employment, and improve the\n            competitiveness of Colombia's agricultural producers.\n            The project will finance a four year program with the\n            following two components: (a) technology development and\n            adaptation; and, (b) institutional development."}, "docdt": "1995-03-24T00:00:00Z"}
