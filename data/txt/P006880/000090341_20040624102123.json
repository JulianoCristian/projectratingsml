the institutional development impact was\n            substantial, and the Bank and borrower performance were both\n            satisfactory. The lessons learned indicate that the model of\n            Competitive Grants is viable in the Colombian context.\n            Processes have to be public, transparent and consistent\n            throughout the life of the subproject and are the only way\n            of ensuring credibility. Modern research systems depend on a\n            wide variety of sources of technology and funding and this\n            experience in Colombia has shown that a competitive grant is\n            an effective way to leverage idle resources for the science\n            and technology sectors. Demand driven research that is\n            competitively funded runs the risk of only solving short\n            term problems, and may not allow for a strategic vision or\n            program. In the selection and approval of subprojects care\n            has to be taken that certain strategic areas are covered\n            with a critical mass of subprojects. Because of the\n            dispersion of subprojects care has to be taken that\n            experiences, progress and results are communicated both\n            horizontally and vertically across the Project. Suitable\n            environment for competitive funds: a) require an intensive\n            level of monitoring and evaluation. b) competitive funding\n            has to be accompanied with a long-term strategy of\n            sustainability for core funding of research institutions. c)\n            competitive grants are suitable instruments to reduce\n            regional inequity. d) competitive funding is a good\n            instrument to promote alliances among the different actors\n            in the system. Processes that aim to change the culture of\n            allocation and implementation of public resources in\n            technology development require time for the institutional\n            structure to understand and utilize these instruments; and\n            adopt them as permanent components of technology development."}, "docdt": "2004-06-15T00:00:00Z"}
