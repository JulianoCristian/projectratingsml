Re:
Loan 3871-CO (Agricultural Technology Development Project)
Amendment to the Loan Agreement
We are in agreement with the amendment proposals stated in paragraphs a) through 
e) of your letter of March 8, 1996. We would like to take advantage of the opportunity 
to propose two further amendments:
(1)
In respect of Section 3.01 (e), we would like to extend the different 
implementation arrangements which are made possible by such paragraph in the amended 
version to all parts of the Project. In this way, the provision concerning the use of 
fiduciaries and/or other companies would be extended to all expenditures financed 
under the Loan.
(2)
In respect of the amendments stated in paragraphs (a) through (e) of the 
countersigned amendment letter as well as of that requested in (1) above, we would 
like them to become effective retroactively as of June 16, 1995, when the Loan 
agreement was signed.
If you agree with the contents of this letter, we would appreciate if
you could date and sign it, sending us a signed original for our files.
AGREED AND CONFIRMED

   RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
