MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMlENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE IBRD
U) THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO COLOMBIA
FOR AN AGRICULTURAL TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMET PROJECr
1.          I submit for your apprwval fte foowing memcnPadun and
recommendation on a proposed loan to the Republic of Colombia for the
equivalent of US$51 million to help finance an Agicultl Ibchnology
Denelopment Project The loan would be at the Bans standard variable
intest rate, with a matunity of 17 years including five years of grace.
2.          Backgroumd. In 1992 agriculftre, fisheries, and forestry
accounted for about 22 percent of GDP for Colombia, rvided employment
for 30 percent of the labor force (three million people) and contributed about
two-thirds of merchandise exports. Coffee accounted for about 13 percent of
agricultuzl GDP (and about 47 percent of total agricultural exports); other
permanent crops for 33 percent, annual crops for 19 percent, and livestck for
35 percent Coffee exports, as a proportion of total agricultural exports, have
remained fairly constant over the last two decades, but some diversification has
occurred within non-coffee exports, which now include flowers and banas.
Growth of agricultural GDP in Colombia averaged 4.8 percent a year from
1973-80, but slowed during 1980-92 to 3.2 percent a year reflecting both
weaeing demand for Colombias agricultural exports and filling international
prices.
3.          In 1992, the agriculual sector sufered one of its worst yeas in
recent history, and output contracted 0.9 percent. The effects of a severe
drought were exacerbated by low international commodity prices, tade
reforms that increased import competition, lack of credit aailability,
appreciation of the exchange rate, and nurl violence. Facing declinig rurl
incomes and growing pressure from agncultmral interests, the Government
recendy adopted an Agricultural Recuperation Program of trade, credit, and
other agricultual policy measures. The situation has improved and the sector
grew about 2.7 percent in 1993 and 2.1 percent in 1994. There is, however,
continuing political pressure to rentroduce protection in the sector that has
pardy, but not completly, been resisted by Governmet.
4.          Research and Extension. In the past, Colombiars agrictulal
technology was developed mainly by the public sector Colombian Agricultual
Institute (ICA). Extension services for small farmers were provided by a
multitude of agencies, and ecxtnsion and the research was often ill-adaped tOD
the needs of the small 2rmer. Although lage firmers benefitted more from
the services of growers associations and private cxtension agents, their
agricultural yields were generally lower than those in neighbonng countries.
About four years ago - as part of its decentralization inidatives - Government
started shifting esponsibilities for planning and implementing agricultural
development programs to municipalities and departmental and regional
authorities. In early 1989, Government adopted the National System for



-4-
Agricultural Tbchnology Tkansfer (SINTAP), a policy statement seing out
key sector objectives and institutional arrangements to coordinate research and
extension to small farmers. This policy aims to replace the largely top-down
approach to applied and strategic research and extension with a demand-
driven, decentralized approach.
5.          In 1991, Government estab!ished the National Agncultural
Technology Transfer Program (the Program) to put SIITrAP into effect. The
Program is the central instrument in Government's plans to modernize and
improve the competitiveness and incomes of Colombials small agricultural
producers. Through the Ministry of Agriculture (MOA), the Program will
coordinate research and extnsion activities in a more integrated way which
would include the private sector as well as government departments and
municipalities. To enable the extension part of this Program to be
implemented, Government delegated responsibility for national govenment
support to the FurLd for Integated Rural Development (DRI).
6.          Extension. Recent legislation puts the municipaliliesin charge
of providing extension services to amers. Each municipality must establish
its own extension unit, a Muimcipal Unit for Agricultual Assistance
(UMATA). Establishment of these UMAIAs, as well as specific subprojects
with firners (including demonstraion plots, field visits, and famer taining),
and the p- mration of municipal agricultual development plans are being
cofinanced by DRI. DRI, which is supported by the Bank and IDB under the
Rumal Development Inestment Program (Loan 3250-CO), channels funds to
municipalities in support of a wide range of subprojects (including zxtesidon,
rural roads, water supply, watrhed protection, marketing, fisheries and
income-generating activities for rural women). The DRI proect, which is now
in its fourth year of implementation, is proceeding welL
7.          Research. The former ICA was the main government agency
responsible for agriculural research and extension. Recently it has been split
in two.
ICA. With a staff of 1,600 (down from 6,700), ICA is financed
from the national budget. About 800 staff are part of a large
joint project between ICA and the United Slates Departnent of
Agrculture for the control and eradication of hoof-and-mouth
disease. ICA is also responsible for the control of animal and
plant diseases and pests (about 400 staff), for quality control of
agricultural inputs (about 200 stafl), and for adminis
special programs (with about 200 staff).
*     The Colombian Corporation for Agricul        tion
(CCIA). A joint public-priate sectr esearch  rporation with
a staff of about 3,500, CCIXs mandate is to undertake
agriculral research under contact from public and pivate



sources. Althiough it is expected to be financially self-sustaining
over the long trm, during this transition stage it will be partly
financed from the national budgeL The Corporation has a
largely private-sector Board, chaired by ICA's General
Manager. Representatives from such private sector assodates as
FENALCO and CENICAFE have taken  ts on the Board.
The CCLA is expected to be a major participant in agricultual
technology development and adaptation financed under this
projeeL
8.          Project Objectives. As part of Govemment's National
Agricutural lbchnology Transfer Program, the proposed Project aims to
achieve the following objectives.
*     Introducing a new approach in support of the National System
for Agricultural bchnology Development and lkansfer,
complete with measures to build instittional capacity, which
would promote the development and testij.,, of technical
packages especiafly appropriate for small farmers, and to
divulge new technology.
-     Promoting private sector participation in agricultural reserch.
lImproving the quality and efficiency of research by introducing
a demand-driven, competitive selection system that would
cofinance projects with universities and private and public sector
entities.
*     .Supporng decentalzation by strengthening regional centers
and training agrcultunal exensionists.
*     Revitalizing underused assets, both physical and human, that
presendy exist within Colombia!s research services system.
Research funded under the project would ultimately help to reduce rural
poverty, increase rural employment, and improve the competitveness of
Colombiars agricult3ma producers.
9.          Project Description. The proposed Project would finance a
four-year program with two main components.
*     The technology development and adaptation component would
include demand-driven investments in strategic, applied, and
adaptive research (including adjustment, validation, and
promotional activities).



The Instititional development component would include
establishment of a small unit in the MOA to oversee nPoject
coordination and promotion and monitoring and quality control
activities among the various participating organizations. This
unit would screen subprojects for technical quality and contact
out approved projects. The MOA would be supported by a
National Panel (which would make the selection of subprojects
for cofinancing and submit them to the Executive Council) and,
when established, by regional panels (for subproject screening).
Institutional development would also entail: the establishment of
regional coordination staff (which would carry out Program
promotion); technical assistance to assist with implementation of
a supervision system, a midterm review, and assessment of the
Project's impact; taining in available technologies and
subproject preparation for research staff, field technicians, and
other professionals; establishment of a University Assistantship
Program to link academic studies with practcal research work;
and estlishment of a system to meet agrcultural technology
information requirements at the departmental and municipal
levels.
10.        Total project costs are estimated at US$84 million equivalent,
with a foreign exchange component of US$29.6 million. The proposed Bank
loan of US$51 million would therefore finance 61 percent of total Project costs
(equivalent to 100 percent of the foreign exchange costs and 39 percent of
local costs). The balance of Project costs would be financed by the national
Government (US$22.3 million, or 26 percent) and by participating universities
and private sector entities (US$10.7 million, or 13 percent). Retoactive
financing, of up to US$5.1 million, would be provided for eligible
xpenditures. The Republic of Colombia would be the Borrower. The
Government would make the proceeds of the loan arailable to the MOA to
finance Project components. Schedules presenting project costs, financing,
procurement, disbursement and processing steps are attached (Schedules A, B,
and C). Schedule D summarizes the status of Bank Group operations in
Colombia.



-7-
11.         Project Implemation. An Executive Council has been
established within MOAQ to implement the Project (mcluding the confirmltion
of the subprojects selected after each semi-annual review by the National
Panel), supported by a Management Coordination Unit (MCU) responsible for
administration, supervision, and promotion of the Project and all related
traiuning, monitring, and evaluation. This unit would be responsible fir
screenig proposals, contracting with implementing entities (the unit plans to
hire one or more fiduciaries to, inter alia, administer the contracting and
payments on the cofinanced research investments), supervising the
implementation of subprojects, designing and implementing a technology
infrmation system, and coordinafing and financing the University
Asistantship Prwgrari and the training of extensionists. A national panel of
experts and regional panels would review and select research investment
proposals to be implemented under the Project.
12.         Two major evaluations would be carried out: a mid-trm
riew by the Borower, jointly with the Bank, of the perfbrmance of fte
Project. (including performance of the National Panel) starting tfirty months
after loan effectiveness; and a study, to begin in 1999, to evaluate the
Project's success and to assess the need for and possible timing of a second
phase. The Project's success would be determined on the basis of case
studies, from which it would be possible to assess the extent to which the
Project succeeded in developing and integating links among shategic and
applied research, adjustment and validation, and technology transfer and
extension and joint research and transfer activities that involve the public
sector and such private sector entities as grwers associations and uvrities
13.         Project Sustainability. Recent government initiatives and
continued government commitment to the new system for coordinating and
funding agricultumal msearch and extension should enhance the prvpsed
Project's sustainability. By financing incremental opeating and profesonal
stafflng costs within tie existing research infiastcure, the Project should
generate an increase in research activities and thereby increase the efficiency
of Colombia's reseach ivestmnent The Project would also help to ensure that
the private sector plays a pivotal role in the futr
14.        'Ib further enhance the sustainability of the Project (and the
overall Program), the Project would provide pssial assistance to help
departments  ordinat research and extension activite  lb help build local
capacity, it would tmain field technicians and other profsionals at the
UMAT  level. Tb improve coordination and communications, it would set up
administrative support links connecting the Executive Council, MCU, and the
Extenson Division in DRI. Appmpriate adjustments would be made fllowing
a midterm review, and subsequendy the success of the Project would be
evaluated so that a second phase could be planned if necessary.

15.         Lessons Learned from Previous Bankr Involvement. The
Colombia Agncultural Research and Extension Prject (Loan 2303-CO), that
closed on June 30, 1992 was designed to improve and expand ICAs research
activities to help Colombia raise its agricultural output at competitive costs.
The PCR noted that the project was satisfictry and met its tarets (such as
building and equipping research facilities at experimental stations and trining
research personnel), thereby expanding Colombia's capacity to develop useful
agricultural technology to improve and increase production.
16.         The achievements of tiat project provide a strong foundation for
the proposed Agricultural Ibchnology Development Project, and lessons from
it were incorporated in the Govemment's new research and extension policy
and in the proposed Bank Project. Because past projects have often been
overly academic and have not fully met the research needs of small farmers,
under the proposed project, small farmers will participate in the selection and
implementation of future research projects. lb increase the efficiency and
effectiveness of agricultural research, efforts of the national institute, formerly
responsible for such research, will be augmented by a broad program of
agricultural technology transfer that incorporates the talents of universities,
NGOs, and private firns in the execution of research projects. lb improve
the relevance and quality of the technologies generated, research funded by the
Project will be selected on the basis of predetermined critnia tat priotize
activities by type and location and promote inteinstitutional collaborin.
Given increasing problems of sustainable agriculte and environmental issues,
one of the selection criteria will be that proposed activities promote
environmentally sound technologies, which will entail specific training and
skills to develop a 'green' sensitivity throughout all zesearch subprojects
17.         Rationale for Bank Involvement. There are several major
reasons for the Bank to support the National Agricultural lbchnology ITansfer
Program, of which the proposed Project is a parL The Program's objectives
of maldng Colombia%s agricultuml sector more competitive is consistent with
the Bank's continuous support of the Government's efforts to libewalize trde
and modernize the agricultural sector. The Program also has a strong
antipoverty focus, addressing the needs of small farmers. With the declning
competitiveness of Colombia's agriculture following aperut and the removal
of tariffs and protections, it is imperaive ffiat measures be taken immediately
to increase agricultural productivity. Finally, the Program supports an
ecxpanded role for the private sector and Government decentralization -which
the Bank has been assisting though a variety of prgrams that include the
ongoing Rural Development Investment Prram (DRI) of agricultUra
extension activities.
18.         With its extensive experience in helping governments to
decentralize and encouraging icreased participation by the prvate sector (both
in Latin America and elsewhere), the Bank is uniquely placed to assist in the
financing of this proposed Project, which will be integmted into the exteion



- 9 -
system supported under Loan 3250-CQ The Project would build on the
Bank's experiences with the earlier Agricultural Research and Extension
Project (Loan 2303-CO). The most recent Country Assistance Stategy
(Report R93-198, of November 19, 1993) for Colombia was presented to the
Board on December 16, 1993. The proposed Project is fully consistent with
the CAS. It is specifically mentioned in the CAS and would support three of
the broad objectives for Colombia, prvate sector development, pverty
reduction and institutional strengthening.
19.         Agreed Actions. During negotiations, agreement was reached
with the Government on the following main actions.
(a)   Conditions of Effectiveness. Initial key staff of the MCU, with
qualifications and experience acceptable to the Bank, have been
appointed and an Operational Manual has been deemed
acceptable to the Bank and issued by the Ministry of Agrculture
and adopted by the MCU.
(b)   Conditions of Disbursemens. The Bank would not disburse
aginst expenditures for vehicles until an acoeptable plan has
been prpared and submitted to the Bank for the acquisition of
said vehicles and for maing them available to persons for the
purposes of the project or for the technology information
systm, other than expenditues With respect to consultant
services, untl a mutually agreeable, detiled action plan has
been accepted by both Government and the Bank.
(c)   Other Agreemens and Assurances The Colombian
Government would approve, and submit for Bank appxoval, any
proposed changes to the Operational Manual. Consultants
would be contacted by the MCU not later than three months
from the effectiveness date to assist with the refining and
implementation of the supervision system for the Project and
send a report on their findings and recommendations to the Bank
for Comment within six months from the effectiveness date.
MCU would prepare a proposal for a detied action plan for a
technology information system and submit it to the Bank for
comment no later tan six months from the effectiveness date.
No later than six months from the effectiveness date, the
Government would establish at least three regional panels and
fhree regional coordination units and appoint personnel and, no
later than 12 months from the effectiveness date, prepare a plan,
acceptable to the Bank, for the establishment of additional units.
Consultants will be contacted by the MCU not later than two
years from the effectiveness date to prepare a performance
report of the Project, including a study on which responsibilities
for the Project could be transded from the Central



- 10-
Government to the Departmental Agricultual Secretariats.
Based on the Consultant's report, and no later than 30 months
from the effectiveness date, the Borrower will carry out a
compiehensive midterm review, jointly with the Bank, and
introduce all necessary changes to the project. Consultants will
be contlracted by January 1, 1999 to assess the success of the
Project to date and to detenrine whether or not the Government
should prepare a follow-up project. No later than six months
after the close of the project, the Borrower will prepare a plan
fior the future operation of the system of financing agricultural
research to be put in place by this project, including the
institutional arrangements, discuss it with the Bank and,
thereafter, implement it.
20.         Poverty Category. The Project is classified as a progrm  of
targeted interventions under the poverty alleviation category. The Project will
emphasize investment in research that has the potential to benefit small
faimers, whose productivity is below averag. for the sector, a group that
includes the majority of Colombia's poor, tiree out of four of whom are in fte
rural areas
21.         Environmental Aspects. The Project would support resarch
and technology tiansfer directed at improving the protection of the
environment in areas of crop establishment and farm practices. Significant
eavironmental gans are foreseen, particularly with the introduction of
integated pest managenent and sustainable agricultural pracdces. Only
subproject proposals tht'  are envinmentally neutral or are specficall  aimed
at remedying environmental damages would be financed.
22.         Program Objective Category. The Program Objective
Categories of this project are Environmentally Sustainable Development,
Private Sector Development, Poverty Reduction and Human Resource
Development.
23.         Participatory Approach. The major component of the project
is the investment in research subprojects. Pardcipation is being accomplished
at three different levels: (a) the design of the process for the selection and
financing of the research subprojects was devloped with parti ipation frm the
rural municipalities, universities and growers associations; (b) the agriculual
research needs of the small farmers have been given top priority in the agreed
criteria for the selection of subprojects; and (c) no more than sity percent of
the annual investment in research subprojects can go to a single entity ensurng
that at least 40 percent would go to universities and private sector research
orgaitns.
24.         Project Benefits. Insofar as it helps to establish an agricultural
research system responsive to the needs of the small producers, the Project is



- II -
expected to benefit some 350,300 farmers by improving yields and
productivity, introducing higher-value crops, and promoting environmentally
sound practices. In addition, the quality of research should also improve with
the inmduction of competition into the research system. Over the long term,
the use of improved tochnology should bring increased income and
employment to fairmers, laborers, and the rural population at large.
25.         Risks. The main risks derive from attempting to establish an
integrated research and technology transfer program nationwide - involving up
to 1,000 municipalities, 31 Departmental Agriculatual Secretariats, and
numerous universities, NGOs, and private gwwers associations. I-urtenmore,
research results may not be effective in meeting the needs of the small
farmers.
26.         Under the Project, however, measures will be taken tO link
research and extension services in an efficient manner; research investment
targets would be based on input from the municipal level to ensure small
farmerse needs were being met; and the Project would be able to build on an
existing extension system (through DRI) which is operating well.
27.         The Government has established a high-level Executive Council
chaired by the Vice Minister of Agriculture (Policy Coordination) to resolve
any implementation problems that might arise and to approve annual operating
plans. Fially, to reduce the risk of start-up delay, the Project has been
designed around actual subprojects (proposed by potental ppating entities
and approved by the National Panel) for its firt year.
28.           cmendation. I am satisfied that the proposed loan would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the
Executive Directors approve it.
