The\n            project consists of three components.  The first, the\n            Secondary Education Grants Program will provide grants to\n            schools to: (a) facilitate the development and\n            implementation of broad based curricular programs and\n            technical and professional curricular families for secondary\n            education, and (b) enable certain schools to expand so that\n            students are able to study revised four year programs or\n            attend general education.  The second, education finance and\n            management, will facilitate the design and implementation of\n            more transparent formula-based financing mechanisms for\n            publicly-provided general education.  The third, project\n            implementation, will provide consulting services and\n            training to support project implementation."}, "docdt": "2005-05-18T00:00:00Z"}
