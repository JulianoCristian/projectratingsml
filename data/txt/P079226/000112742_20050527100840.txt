A. STRATEGIC CONTEXT AND RATIONALE

1. Countryandsector issues

The Project supports all three objectives in the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) (Report No.:
29196-BA) (see section A3 below). This Project was originally conceived, and included in the
CAS, as a project tackling structural reforms in both secondary and tertiary (higher) education.
Reform in tertiary education, however, requires a change in the legal and constitutional
framework. Despite repeated commitments from the government, including a negotiated and
signed Development Credit Agreement (DCA) (in February 2004), it proved impossible to make
these changes to the framework due to entrenched political interests. The tertiary education
elements o f the Project have been largely dropped, therefore, in order that the reforms in
secondary education, which are poverty alleviating, can proceed. The Credit size has also been
reduced, from US$12m to US$lOm. However, the tertiary reforms are still important for system
efficiency and effectiveness and they remain conditions o f the Economic Management Structural
Adjustment Credit (EMSAC) (PO71039).

The education system in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) tends to reinforce poverty because, for
the most part, it is designed to produce employees specifically trained for defined jobs in a
command economy, rather than young people with skills and competencies that are indemand in
a private and informal sector labor market, where there i s a premium on flexibility and
adaptability. More than 40 percent o f secondary students in BiH continue to study programs in
hundreds o f occupational specializations, for most o f which there are few jobs. The 2003
Poverty Assessment (Report No.: 25343-BIH) documented that people with specific
occupational training have a higher tendency than those with more general education to be both
poor and unemployed.

Education system inefficiencies are a major constraint to addressing poverty. Occupational
programs cost more per student than general programs, mainly due to lower studentheacher
ratios in practice courses and the need for more specialized equipment.           As BiH combines
serious medium term fiscal constraints with one o f the lowest secondary enrollment rates in
Europe - only 73 percent o f the 15-18 age group are enrolled according to the Poverty
Assessment - increasing efficiency i s a prerequisite to the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper
(PRSP) goal o f increasing secondary enrollments.          Inefficiencies are also a constraint to
improving the relevance and increasing enrollments intertiary education - the demand for which
will increase ifmore studentscomplete general secondary programs. Much o f the inefficiency in
tertiary education i s driven by extremely low graduation rates (in 2003, less than 3 percent o f
students at the University o f Sarajevo graduated on time, compared to an average o f 70 percent
for OECD countries, and 42 percent in Italy which has the lowest rate among EU countries).
Most universities consist o f a loose association o f legally independent Faculties.           This
institutional fragmentation also contributes to an inefficient use o f scarce public resources.

Although all countries face problems with participation o f the poor in tertiary education, BiH's
heavily tracked secondary education system (the poor tend to be tracked into occupational
programs with no access to tertiary education) has led to a situation in which the poor do not
benefit from public funding for tertiary education. Increasing secondary enrollments and making



                                                 1

sure that more youth attend general education programs will help address this problem over time.
Resources to meet this increased demand for tertiary education will have to be found from
increased efficiency and greater private contributions to the tertiary education system; and both
are PRSP objectives.

Education governance and management i s complex, with the main responsibilities lying with the
Republika Srpska (RS) and, in the Federation, with the ten cantonal ministries o f education; but
with coordination functions inthe Federation Ministry of Education and Science and at the State
level in the Ministry o f Civil Affairs (MoCA).         The European Commission (EC) recently
conducted a functional review o f the education sector. It recommendedthat cantonal and the RS
ministries o f education should have greater capacity for more effective management of the
sector.   The recently-closed Education Development Project (EDP) started this process, by
establishing an education management information system (EMIS), the further development o f
which i s envisaged under this Project. The EC report also recommended an increase in the
responsibilities o f the M o C A (see Annex 1for more details).

Government Strateav

The Government's PRSP, finalized in October 2003, analyses weaknesses in the education
system as a contributing factor to poverty in BiH and identifies a reformed education sector as
one o f its key instruments for addressing poverty issues. All activities to be financed under this
investmentproject support the adoption and implementationof PRSP recommendations.

A number of clear policy and institutional reforms aimed at addressing the poverty constraints
and pro-poor objectives discussed above have beenendorsed as part o f the PRSP process, as well
as through a broadly consultative initiative lead by the Organisation for Security and
Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) to develop an education reform strategy (Fall 2002). All major
donors and external supporters o f BiH's education system (see section C1 below) have endorsed
this reform agenda, which is slowly being implementedwith international support. The reforms
most relevant to this Project include:

    P A restructuring o f secondary education aimed at increasing the number of students
        attending and completing four year general and broad-based programs;
    P Shifting responsibility for funding tertiary education away from the cantons in the
        Federation o f BiH, to the Entity or State level and the re-structuring o f tertiary finance in
        both entities on the basis o f a per student funding model;
    P Transferring the legal status of tertiary education institutions from individual faculties to
        the university as a single legal entity; and,
    P A restructuring o f general educationfinance inBiH's 12 funding districts (RS, 10cantons
        inthe Federation of Bosnia-Herzegovina (FBiH), and the Brcko District) on the basis of
        transparent per student funding formulae which provide needed efficiency incentives.

2. Rationale for Bank involvement

In the context of the PRSP exercise and the preparation o f EMSAC, the Bank is the only
international institution that is consistently viewing education interms o f the interaction between
poverty and economic issues. Using the investment project and policy conditions under the


                                                   2

adjustment credit, the Bank intends to help drive reforms in the education system that will
fundamentally change how the system i s financed.           These systemic reforms will not be
introduced effectively in BiH without the financial leverage and investment funding being
provided by the World Bank in collaboration with the other international partners (see Section
C1below).

No other international agency i s providing direct support to implementationo f reforms in general
education finance or in general secondary education.          Adoption o f specific legislation for
reforming tertiary education i s a condition o f the EMSAC; this Project will provide some
resources for technical assistance to implement these reforms if the legislative framework
changes appropriately.

Finally, the EDP has supported the establishment o f new institutions and developed mechanisms
to achieve effective reform even ina difficult political and institutional setting.

3. Higher level objectivesto which the projectcontributes

Increasing the relevance o f secondary education programs and increasing the number o f youth
who complete a four year secondary degree and have access to tertiary education are among the
most important pro-poor measures that can be taken in BiH in the medium term and are both
PRSP objectives.

The Project is included in Bosnia's CAS which was presented to the World Bank's Board on
September 16, 2004. The Project supports all three objective o f the CAS. It is aimed at
improving public finance and strengthening institutions through its focus on innovative funding
mechanisms and building capacity to manage education finance more effectively; it promotes
sustainable private sector-led growth through its focus on promoting more relevant educational
programs in secondary education and increasing the human capital base; and it invests in key
social and economic infrastructure through provision o f grants to schools, more equitable
allocation o f public funding for education, and its promotion o f inter-constituent group
collaboration and cooperation.

B. PROJECT DESCRIPTION
1. Lendinginstrument

Under this Project, the International Development Association (IDA) will provide a US$lO
million equivalent Credit, to be implementedover four year period.

2. Projectdevelopmentobjectiveand key indicators

The overall project objectives are to: (a) increase participation in general and broad-based
secondary education programs; and (b) improve the efficiency o f education delivery, especially
insecondary education. While the project also directly supports investmentsaimed at improving
the quality and relevance o f programs, improvements in these areas will not be measurable
duringthe project period.




                                                 3

Progress toward achieving project outcomes will be monitored by:

    >    Share o f secondary enrollment in general or broad-based four-year vocational programs
         increases from 68% inthe Federation and 73% inthe RS in September 2003 (baseline) to
    >    90 percent ineach Entity in September 2008; and,
        Number o f Ministries of Education implementing a transparent student funding formula
         for primary and secondary education.

3. Projectcomponents

Approximately 50 percent o f project funding will be allocated directly to beneficiary institutions
(secondary schools) through the Secondary Education Grants Program. The grant mechanism
was chosen inorder to promote decentralization and empowerment o f local institutions and as an
appropriate response to the political fragmentation inthe Federationo f BiH, which does not lend
itself to centrally-managed initiatives.     This implementation approach also builds on the
successful implementation o f similar mechanisms inthe EDP.

The Secondary Education Grants Program (approximately US$5.0 million) will directly
benefit more than 50 percent o f secondary students through grantsto schools. The grants will (a)
facilitate the development and implementation o f broad-based curricular programs and
technical/professional curricular families for secondary education (including teacher training,
materials and assessment instruments), in collaboration with the ongoing EC-Cards project, and
(b) enable certain schools to expand so that students who would otherwise attend three year
courses are able to study revised four year programs or attend general education schools.
Individual grant size would not exceed US$20,000 (equivalent) per school. The component will
promote improved relevance, as well as increased attainment for those students who might
otherwise have left their formal education or not aspired to tertiary level education. The shift o f
studentsfrom three-year vocational programs to four year programs will be monitored as a broad
proxy for improved relevance. Technical assistance will be contracted to support development
planningand facilitation inschools.

Education Finance and Management (approximately US$4.0 million): technical assistance,
software and related equipment, and training to facilitate the design and implementation o f more
transparent formula-based financing mechanisms for publicly-provided general education. This
support for new financing mechanisms i s expected to increase efficiency and performance
monitoring through improved budget formulation and management o f resources against goals.
The indicator for success o f this initiative will be the number o f education jurisdictions in BiH
funding schools on the basis o f a capitation formula that focuses the attention o f policy makers
on the efficiency and equity o fpublic resource use. Support for providing greater autonomy over
spending by schools or devolving funding to municipalities will be offered to funding districts
that opt for such support, although these will not be requirements o f the formula funding
approach. This component will also support, through technical assistance, training and software
development, the extension o f the education management information system to include a
module on pre-school education and Bosnia and Herzegovina's participation in international
studies o f studentachievement.




                                                  4

The Project would provide technical assistance and training to help implementthe shift inpublic
funding o f tertiary education away from the cantons to the State level. This support would be
conditional on passage o f appropriate legislation (see Annex 4 for more details).

Project implementation (approximately US$1.OO million):            Credit proceeds will pay for
consultant services (for procurement, financial management, translation and project audit), and
for operating costs including travel and training (but excluding the salaries o f civil servants) for
the Project Steering Board, Project Coordination Secretariat, School Grants Evaluation Board,
and School Grants Quality Assurance Team.

4. Lessons learned and reflected in the project design

Inthe EDP, fundmechanisms were successful inmaking resources available to beneficiaries and
promoted innovation, rather than relying on centralized procurement o f goods and services to be
delivered to schools by the fragmented institutional structure in BiH. Improvements will be
made inthe proposed Project based on the experience o f EDP and similar mechanisms in other
countries. For example, the secondary education grant mechanism will specifically promote
linkages between the grant fund and existing institutions (RS and cantonal ministries o f
education, and Pedagogical Institutes), who will also be key implementingpartners, in order to
promote ownership and sustainability.

The EC is funding a reform o f vocational education and training (VET). It has demonstrated the
value o f schools collaborating on curriculum reform and this feature has been incorporated into
the Project.

More focus will be given in this project to setting baseline data for measuring outcomes under
the grant mechanism. During project preparation, focus was put on what indicators should be
usedand how they should be monitored.

5. Alternatives considered and reasons for rejection

Noproject

Without the Project, secondary education programs would likely continue to focus on overly
specialized programs which have little relevance to employment, and, without efficiency gains,
budget constraints would continue to restrict the number o f students completing four year
programs. A key anti-poverty measure would not be taken.

A projectfocused on efficiency and relevance in tertiary education

During the preparation o f this Project, agreements were reached with the government on reform
o f tertiary education financing (to shift financing away from cantons to the Entity or State level,
in line with the PRSP commitments). This, and associated reforms, would have improved
efficiency and relevance o f tertiary education, increased transparency o f public funding, and
shiftedpublic resources towards less affluent students. However, the reforms requiredlegislative
and constitutional changes which continue to be resisted by powerful political interests. These



                                                  5

reforms remain important and are a condition o f the EMSAC, and the Project will provide
technical assistance to implement a new funding mechanism if these legal changes are effected.
However, support directly to universities for reform and development i s no longer contemplated.

A projectfocused on basic education and the Millennium Development Goals

Primary education enrollment rates remain high, if not universal: the latest Poverty Assessment
found net enrollment rates to be about 93%. These rates did not vary significantly across gender,
income level or whether or not the child lives in a rural area. Official data on gross enrollment
rates show a gentle decline since the war (though household survey data shows better numbers).
The causes o f this trend are not well-understood, but they appear to be: very low levels of pre-
school education, continuing internal displacement, and the faltering economy. However, a big
factor i s likely to be the low demand for secondary education: BiH has the lowest rate o f net
enrollments in secondary education (73% overall, with only 57% o f the poor attending) o f all 12
transition countries for which data i s available. Poor students are more likely to be enrolled in
vocational education programs and/or to drop out o f education (because vocational education i s
their only option) and are therefore less likely to complete the secondary cycle. The proposed
Project tackles this issue directly by seeking to make secondary education more attractive.
While a project focused on early childhood interventions would yield significant benefits,
especially to the poor, this would not play to the Bank's comparative advantage or experience in
the country. The Project will also build the capacity o f ministries o f education to plan and
implement education policies which could address the needs of Roma (including through the
recently-established Roma EducationFund).

C. IMPLEMENTATION
1. Partnershiparrangements(if applicable)

The education reform program in BiH, as described in the PRSP, i s supported by a group o f
international actors including the EC, Council o f Europe (CoE), OSCE, UNESCO, UNICEF, the
Office o f the HighRepresentative (OHR), the World Bank and a number o f European bilaterals.
Inparticular, CoE and OSCE have worked closely with the Bank on tertiary education reforms,
and the Bank i s working closely with the EC on the reforms in secondary education. The EC i s
the only other donor which is making significant investments inthe sector. Its support includes
an approximately 2 million investment over two years in secondary VET, which was extended
for another two years in 2004, and a new approximately 3 million investment over two years
beginningin 2004 in general education- mostly curriculum development and teacher training -
which i s highly compatible with the Project.

The Project will not include any formal co-financing, although the level o f cooperation between
the Bank and the EC inthe sector represents parallel program financing in terms of supporting
various elements o f the government's reforms. The implementation arrangements also promote
coordination across donor projects.

2. Institutionalandimplementationarrangements

The Borrower will be Bosnia and Herzegovina, which will then on-lend, through separate sub-
Credit Agreements, to the two Entities (Federation o f Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Republika
Srpska). Coordination o f the Project activities will be done by civil servants appointed to the
Project Coordination Secretariat in the MoCA. Fiduciary functions (procurement and financial
management) will be handled by consultants. The project coordinators will manage the school
grant mechanism and the technical assistance in the Project. Technical assistance contracts and
school grants would be apportioned on a two-thirddone-third basis between the two Entities, as
i s standard practice inthe country.

Overall Project supervision will be the responsibility o f the Project Steering Board, which
consists o f all ministers o f the education (from the cantons, the RS and Federation Entities, and
the MoCA). A School Grants Quality Assurance Team, with representation from the RS and
each cantonal ministry o f education, will ensure integration of the grant program into ministry
strategies for secondary education. A School Grants Evaluation Board, consisting o f technical
experts appointed from each Entity,will evaluate schools' grant proposals.

(For more details, see Annexes 6, 7 and 8.)

3. Monitoringand evaluation of outcomeshesults

Baseline indicators have beendetermined using a combination o f Living Standards Measurement
Survey (LSMS) data and administrative statistics. The LSMS will be updated in 2006 in select
areas in BiH, and basic administrative data will be available using an education management
information system supported under the EDP.

Inaddition to these indicators, Credit proceeds will be usedto undertake two evaluations of the
secondary education grants program, one at mid-term and one at the end o f the Project. The
evaluations will makeuse o f standard data reporting which will be required inthe grant manual.

BiHhas begunto undertake external assessment of the performance inmath and local language
of primary school students, and i s expected to begin assessments o f secondary performance in
the coming years. The Project will support BiH's participation in international assessments.
However, changes in student performance are not considered viable indicators for this Project.
While the Project is expected to help increase the relevance of education programs by reducing
occupational training and increasing time spent on core subjects and skills, it will not be possible
to measure the impact o f the grants on schools interms o f improving learning outcomes during
the project period.

4. Sustainability

Government commitment for the reform measures to be supported under this Project has been
documented in its PRSP, as well as in the education strategy document presented to the Peace
Implementation Council in late 2002. All 12 Ministers o f Education in BiH have endorsed the
reform agenda. While some reforms in education have been fiercely resisted (such as intertiary
education), the main activities funded under this Project are not considered controversial.


                                                  7

Embedding project implementation in education ministries will also promote sustainability and
ownership o f the reform.

With regardto financial sustainability, project components are expected to contribute to a focus
on efficiency and equity in public education and thus free up resources which could be used to
continue the reforms.         In particular, per-student funding systems in general education will
provide efficiency incentives and highlight equity issues; and, secondary reform will help reduce
the need for expensive occupationally-specificprograms.

The sustainability o f the grant mechanism i s shown by a similar program begun under the EDP
which i s being continued with budgetfinancing.

D. APPRAISAL SUMMARY
1. Economicand financialanalyses

The essence o f this Project is to increase the internal efficiency o f public spending on secondary
education and to reinvest the savings realized in improving the external efficiency, equity and
quality o f education. Savings will come mainly from reducing repetition insecondary education,
reducing enrollment in expensive three-year programs, and improving the ratio o f students to
staff. External efficiency gains will result from increased overall secondary and, in due course,
tertiary enrollments, and shifting the balance o f secondary education toward general education
and away from vocational education. Equity gains will result from the expanded enrollments in
secondary education. In particular the progressive reduction o f the proportion o f secondary
students in vocational programs (who tend to come from the poorest households) will improve


                                                   9

poor students' prospects, both on the labor market and to tertiary education.               Quality
improvements will result from activities financed under the project's Secondary Education
Grants Program. Since all investments will come from internal efficiency savings, there are no
fiscal implications.

2. Technical

The biggest component of the Project is a grant fund mechanism because of the successful
experience o f the EDP. The Secondary School Grants Program will promote some activities
normally supported through a centralized mechanism, such as curriculum reform and the switch
from three year to four year programs. The choice o f approach i s based both on the team's
consensus that the political environment in BiHrequires a more decentralized approach and that
these reforms require strong school level inputs. Technical assistance will be provided to
overcome the likelihood that schools will not be able to think beyond traditional solutions to
their problems. However, this Project involves education ministries more extensively than the
EDP to build capacity for longer-term reform.

3. Fiduciary

Fiduciary assessment o f the revised implementationarrangements will be carried out before
Effectiveness. From a financial management risk perspective, the risks which could adversely
affect project implementation include: (a) possible misuse o f project funds by schools; (b)
potential inadequate internal control mechanismwithin Project Coordination Secretariat (PCS);
and, (c) possible non-cooperation by cantonal and Entity ministries with the PCS that could have
an impact on the flow o f information. Various risk-mitigation measures to address these risks
are documented inAnnex 7.

4. Social

The processes which led to the production o f the PRSP and the Peace Implementation Council
(PIC) strategy for education were based on broad consultation and participation among education
stakeholders inBiH. These exercises reflect consensus on the specific reforms that are neededto
improve educational outcomes and opportunities for all children in BiH. Teacher and student
union representatives were particularly vocal intheir support for major changes inthe system.

A beneficiaryhocial assessment was carried out during preparation.           Its main findings o f
relevance to the Project include:

    P Most students, teachers and parents believe the public education system has many
        strengths. These strengths include the quality o fthe theoretical teaching (practice courses
        were seen as a particular weakness) and the good relationship in schools between
        teachers and students. Reform initiatives should build on these strengths, as well as
        address the system's weaknesses.

    P Teachers inthe system are generally more conservative about change than students and
        parents, a finding that i s the norm innearly all education systems. Fundmechanisms that

        finance local priorities and allow local control over resources i s expectedto help address
        this resistanceto change.

The social impact of the project will be monitored through a repetition o f this survey instrument,
andthrough qualitative and quantitative assessments ofthe impact ofthe fundmechanisms.

                      Annex 1: Countryand Sector or ProgramBackground
               BOSNIAAND HERZEGOVINA: EducationRestructuringProject

BiH has complex governance and management arrangements, as a result of the constitutional
agreements reached at the end o f the war. The two Entities (RS and the Federation) have
different arrangements in the education sector. In the RS, responsibility for compulsory and
tertiary education is vested at the Entitylevel, while inthe Federation the mainresponsibility lies
with the cantons. (The cantons vary in size between 500,000 and 35,000 citizens; 95,000 and
4,300 students.) These bodies are responsible for financing and management o f all levels o f
education intheir respective jurisdictions. Adding to this complexity i s the Federation Ministry
of Education and Science and, at the State level, the Ministry o f Civil Affairs (MoCA) which has
an education unit. These latter two bodies have some, at present rather ill-defined, coordination
functions inthe sector.

InMarch 2005, the EC released a report on a functional review o f the education sector inBiH.
The main recommendations o frelevance here are the following:


    0    The MoCA should assume responsibility for, amongst other things: policy planning,
         monitoring and coordination across levels, monitoring the performance o f the education
         sector, and concluding intemational agreements and cooperation within the education
         sector. This would requireadditional staff.


     0   The responsibilities o f the Federation Ministry o f Education and Science should focus on
         the coordination and advisory role and transfer its other functions to other levels of
         government. This would imply a reduction instaff.


     0   Strengthen the capacity o f cantons to manage, finance and supervise their schools.


     0   Transfer functions related to school development and curriculum delivery to Pedagogical
         Institutes (PIS) and organize PISas independentpublic bodies.

At the time of writing (May 2005), the public discussion of these proposals has only just begun
and it i s not clear which, if any, o f these recommendations will be adopted. However, it i s likely
that some will be, given that many are not controversial. This shifting landscape represents a
minor risk for the Project (inparticular, the role o f the PISinschool development and curriculum
deliverywhich would imply a role for the PISinthe secondary school grants program).

StatisticalOverview

As can be seen from the following tables, overall enrollment in primary education is high, but
this begins to drop off significantly in secondary education, especially at age 17 because many
students are inthree year rather than four year programs.

The high rates o f enrollment in primary education are achieved through a good network o f
schools (though schools are significantly smaller inthe Federationon average).



                                                                                       OECD mean

Pre-School

Pre-school education i s not compulsory in any part of BiH. The number o f pre-schools has
fallen dramatically since the socialist period as most were attached to public enterprises.
Enrollment inthe Federation o f BiH i s estimated to be 8 percent (no figures are available for the
RS), with only about one percent of children in the lowest quintile households accessing pre-
school compared to 10 percent in the richest quintile. Supervision and financing, o f pre-school
education i s usually the responsibility o f municipalities, though it falls under social services
rather than education (and in Sarajevo and Una-Sana i s the responsibility o f the cantons).

Note. Kindergarten (ISCED 0) generally covers children inthe 3-5 or 3-6 age group and excludes the nursery
for the 0-2 age group, which explainsthe difference with the figure inTable 1.

Primary Education

While the enrollment figures in primary education are fairly good (Table 1 above), the lack of
good data makes it hard to identifythe direction o f change. Some official data (see, for example,
Table 4) suggest enrollment rates are falling, albeit slowly, while the household survey suggests
the opposite. Girls are representedin education at the same rate as boys. The main group that
does not enroll inprimary education i s Roma.

Notes: 1. The gross enrollment rate is basedon the number of children,regardlessof age, enrolled at agiven levelof
educationdivided by the total numberof children inthe generalpopulation that correspondsto the age group specified
for that level of education. Basic education(ISCED 1and 2), often called "compulsory schooling" or "elementary
schooling", normally lasts from age 6 or 7 to age 14 or 15. This is often divided into primary (to age 10)
and lower secondary levels.

InBiH, most students study inthe three year programs which are characterized by a curriculum
which provides students with only a narrow range o f occupational skills - for example, baker,
cook, or waiter - with relatively low general education demands and lack o f opportunity for
tertiary study. The Sarajevo Canton, for example, offers 180 separate three-year programs, and
similar numbers are offered throughout BiH. A number o f these programs are offered in
occupations where job opportunities are few or non-existent - such as, mining engineer and
florist. Finally, the infrastructure and equipment used inthese programs has become out o f date
or damaged due to the war, and opportunities for work placements have declined with the
economy; as a result the programs have emphasized theoretical study over practical skills.

Apart from questions o f labor market relevance or the demands o f modern society and economy,
re-building BiH's VET system as it is currently structured is not possible from a financial
perspective.     It is generally recognized in BiH and elsewhere that occupationally-specific
programs are more expensive than general programs, due to lower student-teacher ratios and the
need for specialized equipment and teacher training. As secondary enrollments expand in the
coming years, maintaining quality and improving relevance will largely be a function o f
expanding general education programs inBiH.

An ongoing EC project (recently extended) has been working on upgrading the curriculum of
vocational programs.      This project has been able to build a consensus among the various
constituent groups for a revised curriculum, which means that certificates from these programs
will be recognized throughout BiH. The project has also provided modern equipment and
teacher training. In the early phase o f this project, the improved programs continued to be
narrowly occupational and even more classroom time was being devoted to occupational
practice, and so lifelong learning and labor flexibility goals were not being met. However, the
latest phase i s working with stakeholders on clusters o f broader curricula.

Four year technician programs throughout BiH offer a more challenging curriculum and access
to tertiary education, although quality and relevance improvements are needed.            In the
development o f broad-based programs, strong consideration should be given to merging three
and four-year VET programs, at least in the initial years o f secondary. Such a reform would
have the advantage o f allowing children more time to learn and mature before they chose a
narrower occupationally-oriented training program.

There is another curriculum issue that needs attention. The curriculum insecondary education, in
both VET and general education, i s overloaded, with students often studying numerous subjects.
Any move to broaden the vocational curriculum in the first years o f secondary education will
need to ensure that this broadening does not take the form merely o f adding further subjects to
the curriculum.

Poor outcomes/results

As an apparent consequence of the narrow vocational curriculum, and the perceived lack of
relevance to their future lives, students drop out from vocational programs at a much higher rate
than from general education (gymnasium) schools (Poverty Assessment). Unemployment rates



                                                 5

are also higher for adults who attended these programs, with 44 percent o f male vocational
graduates either out o f the labor force, discouraged from enteringit, or unemployed, compared to
34 percent o f male general education graduates. In addition, vocational graduates have double
the rate o f participation in the informal sector. Finally, the poor are much more likely to enter
these programs. This has the effect o f perpetuating a cycle o f disadvantage in which the poor
have access to secondary education o f poorer quality and then either drop out or are less able to
find employment.

Unfortunately, there are as yet no reliable assessments o f student performance in secondary
education, though the Standards and Assessment Agency i s scheduled to begin work on a Matura
examination shortly.      BiH has not yet participated in international assessments of student
performance such as Trends in International Mathematics and Science Survey (TIMSS),
Programme in International Student Assessment (PISA) or Progress in International Reading
Literacy Study (PIRLS).

Tertiary Education

Lack of commonstandards

BiHlacks common standards ina number ofways: across its highly autonomous faculties within
a single university, between the universities within BiH, and between universities in BiH and
those inEurope. This has two important consequences. First, it makes it impossible for students
or policy makers to make informed judgments about the quality o f a university or indeed
faculties within a university.     Students cannot express their demand for quality and policy
makers cannot use incentives (financial or otherwise) to promote quality.

Second, students are denied the ability to move to different institutions within BiH and Europe.
Without commonly accepted standards about the levels o f performance that students are
expected to achieve at the end o f a course o f study or degree program, a student cannot
demonstrate to another institution what skills and knowledge he or she has acquired. Instead,
when they move to another institution, they mustbegintheir studies all over again. This is why
universities across Europe are moving towards a common credit based system in which each
institution would recognize and accept credits earned and degrees awarded at other institutions.

Some initial steps to create a credit system were started under the EDP, both within and across
institutions, through grants to universities.

Funding system lacks transparency and is based solely on inputs

There are no common budgeting formulas and/or regulations for determining financing plans and
executing them across the entities and across cantons in the Federation o f BiH (funding for
tertiary education in the Federation o f BiH i s the responsibility o f cantons). Moreover, budgets
are input-based and students numbers (of both fee paying and state supported students) are
controlled by the respective ministries o f education. This results in highly uneven per student
spending across BiH. For example, within the Federation o f BiH, spending in Tuzla Canton is




                                                  6

three times as high as that in Herzegovina-Neretva Canton, while the RS spends generally lower
than the average for the Federationoverall.

Inaddition to traditional public funding, universitiesget considerable resources from elsewhere.
There i s also an elaborate systemo f formal and informal cross-subsidies among funding districts.
Croat-majority cantons and enclave municipalities in the Federation o f BiH which do not have
tertiary education institutions pool public resources to fund the attendance o f students at Mostar
West University, although such transfers are reported to be not routinely enforced. Bosniac-
majority cantons provide student subsidies (transport, accommodation, etc.) to tertiary education
students from their areas, but do not provide budgetary resources for the operation o funiversities
outside their areas which are attended by their students. The result i s that the Canton o f
Sarajevo, which i s the most affluent canton per capita and owns the largest university (the
University o f Sarajevo enrolls approximately half o f all tertiary education students in BiH),
provides large (but indeterminate and non-transparent) informal subsidies to other cantons. Fee
revenue and self-financing income from students is also significant at all universities, but i s often
unrecorded.

The lack o f transparency o f these financing arrangements means that it is impossible to create a
system in which universities which receive students from across cantonal or entity boundaries
can be reimbursed. This reduces the degree o f mobility o f students. Without such a system o f
reimbursement, certain universities are effectively subsidizing tertiary education students from
other cantons. This may have positive effects on equity if these institutions are sustained by
richer cantons and the students come from poorer cantons. However, the lack o f transparency
makes it impossible to determine whether and to what extent this i s the case. It also means that
policy makers are unable to improve the efficiency o f the system by identifying higher cost
institutions andprograms.

Fragmentation of institutions

Since the end o f the war, there has been a proliferation o f institutions o f tertiary education in
BiH,partly because different constituent groups have moved to create separate faculties for each
subject. Most recently, in2004, Zenica canton established a new university, with three faculties.
This has resulted in a large number o f small institutions with a resulting loss of economies of
scale. The situation i s compounded by the autonomy that individual faculties exercise even
when they are notionally part o f a larger university. Faculties collect revenue and determine the
subjects that they will offer.      In addition, each faculty strives to offer a comprehensive
curriculum (for example, the law faculty will also offer language courses). This results in
significant duplication o f provision and highunit costs.

There are eight universities, six in the Federation o f BiH and two in RS (Table 6). Except at
Tuzla University, all faculties within the universities are separate legal institutions receiving
direct funding from public sources and collecting fees from students. In fact there are 87 legal
entities receiving funding for tertiary education at present (the 95 institutions in Table 6 less the
Tuzla faculties). The average faculty size i s 526 students, less than a typical secondary school.
Only about half o f secondary school completers enter university, largely the result o f the lack o f
access to those invocational schools.

Notes: 1. Academies are four-year tertiary education institutions that do not offer doctoral degrees (these are mostly
schools o f arts - like music, acting, drama, painting etc.), while faculties do offer doctoral programs.
2. Higher schools are two-year tertiary education institutions.

The strategic planning process and the development o f institutional development plans,
supported under the recently closed EDP, have begun the process o f reducing the autonomy o f
individual faculties and ultimately consolidating management o f institutions. These changes
need to be extended to all universities and current (May 2005) legislative proposals would do
this, In all educational administrations, with the exception o f the Tuzla canton which has re-
structured its universitysystem, the legal framework i s an obstacle to these types o f reforms.

Inadequate opportunitiesfor adults to return to education

Universities inBiH, in common with most universities indeveloping countries (and indeedmany
in developed ones), serve mainly young, full-time leamers who begin their studies immediately
after completing secondary education. As a consequence, there are only limitedopportunities for
those in the workforce, or who are unemployed but have completed secondary education, to
return to education to upgrade their skills or change their careers. When working adults do
returnto the system, with the exception o fpost graduate programs which cater to adults, they are
disadvantaged relative to the majority o f students: they pay higher fees, lectures are not held in
the evening or weekends but rather during regular business hours, and professors are not readily
available. In addition, programs are designed for study over a four year period. Moreover,
companies have not invested in training; productivity increases have been largely generated to
date through restructuring and redundancies.

Financing

A detailed analysis o f education financing is provided inAnnex 9.

Discrimination

Anecdotal evidence continues to abound about varieties o f discriminatory practices at the local
level throughout the educational system. Textbooks have been developed by each ethnic group,


                                                              8

especially inthe `national' subjects like history and language, often reflecting biased views about
recent and past history. Students o f ethnic minorities ina given canton are forced to study inthe
language o f the majority group and observe the associated religious rituals. Parents in some
areas continue to instill in their children racist attitudes. The OSCE and the OHR are active on
this issue, monitoring developments, occasionally banning educational materials, and trying to
develop a common curriculum to be used in all schools.             Finally, those children not in
compulsory education come overwhelmingly from Roma families where supply issues, including
discrimination, have dampened demand.

GovernmentStrategy

Inpreparation for the PIC meeting in November 2002, six working groups developed a set of
policy objectives and recommendations across a number o f different issues (Education Access
and Non-Discrimination; Primary and General Secondary Education; Vocational Education;
Tertiary education; Finance and Management; and Education Legislation).             These working
groups consisted o f local stakeholders plus the international community. The recommendations
from these working groups were then endorsed by the ministers o f 12 education ministries in
BiHandpresentedto the PIC meeting.

Following that, the Government o f BiH (as representedby the State level) prepared a Poverty
Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP), which was presentedto the World Bank's Board inJune 2004.
The recommendations from the Working Groups and the PRSP form the basis for all of the
policy changes being proposed inthis project.

However, given the decentralized nature o f education governance, reform has been embraced
and i s being taken forward to varying degrees indifferentjurisdictions.

        Annex 2: Major RelatedProjectsFinancedby the Bank and/or other Agencies
             BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA: EducationRestructuringProject

The Education Restructuring Project will be the fourth investmentthe World Bank has made in
the BiH education system. The first two projects were emergency reconstruction projects that
helped rebuild and re-equip BiH's schools following the war. Both projects achieved their
reconstruction objectives and were rated satisfactory by the World Bank's Operations Evaluation
Department (OED).

The recently closed Education Development Project was supporting quality improvements and
institutional development. It received parallel co-financing from the European Commission and
direct co-financing from the government o f Italy. The project has successfully supported the
establishment o f the SAA and a Tertiary education Coordination Board, the only two educational
institutions in BiH which are jointly owned by the two entities and which bring together
professionals from the three constituent groups to address sector development issues.          (The
Board has since been transformed into a Rectors Council.)           In addition, the project also
supported development o f an information system - a pre-requisite to the type of per student
funding being supported under the new Project - and implementation o f a Quality Fund for
primary education, which has proved the viability o f such an instrument to promote quality
initiatives and local empowerment in BiH. The Education Development Project was rated
satisfactory for both its development objectives and implementation progress (an Implementation
Completion Report i s under preparation).

The only other donor that has provided significant funding for systemic reform issues is the EC,
which has funded analysis and development activities in secondary vocational and technical
training and general and tertiary education, the latter two through co-financing the ongoing IDA-
funded project. The Bank has worked closely with the local EC office and its contractor to help
move forward a debate on the definition o f broad-based programs in secondary and the
relationship between the secondary VET system and the labor market (occupational skills v.
broad-based skills).    The EC has launched a major investment (3m) to support curriculum
development and teacher training in general education.            This selection of priorities is
complementary to the Bank's priorities and represents a division o f investment needs between
BiH's two major donors to education.

Various UN agencies, NGOs and bilateral donors are funding projects focused on improving
specific educational inputs (curriculum, teacher training, textbooks, school construction, etc.).

The OHR, the OSCE and Council o f Europe do not provide significant funding for the system,
but are heavily involved inthe policy and reform dialogue with the govemment inthe education
sector. There i s close agreement on the mainpolicy directions needed inBiH.

             BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA: EducationRestructuringProject

Project components have been identified together with government counterparts and in the
context o f the priorities and programs o f other education donors inBiH. Inview o f the fact that
other donors to BiH's education system tend to provide technical assistance and top down
support for sector initiatives, this Project - as with the EDP- will provide much o f its funding in
the form o f a demand-driven fund mechanism which will allow schools to compete for funding
to design or implement policy changes or programs.             Two fund mechanisms are being
successfully implemented under the EDP - one supporting primary education and one supporting
tertiary education.

Component One: The Secondary Education Grants Program (approximately US$ 5-00
million)

This component would make grants available to groups o f secondary schools to finance program
development and program implementation in three areas: (1) the development or initial
implementationof new broad based curricula or technical/vocational curriculum families for four
year VET programs; (2) the development or adaptation o f core subject curriculum in all
secondary schools; and (3)       the re-organization of school activities aimed at increasing
enrollments in general secondary schools. Inaddition to the development, piloting or evaluation
o f new programs, the Grant Program i s also expected to finance in-service retraining designed to
improve the capacity o f teachers to deliver new programs. Eligible expenditures under the
Programwill be consultants (local and foreign), training/workshops/studytours, per diems linked
to training, teaching aids/materials/books, training supplies and equipment for theoretical-based
subjects, and small works or repairs.        Non-eligible expenditures would include salaries for
teachers and staff, and equipment for practical and occupational-based subjects. The maximum
grant amount will be about US$20,000 (equivalent) per school, depending on school enrollment
(smaller schools will be eligible for smaller amounts).       Grant contracts will be signed with
individual schools, but schools will be required to show cooperation with partner schools from
another funding district in their proposal in order to qualify for financing.       Approximately
US$4.3 million i s expected to be allocated to schools under the Program, and the remainder o f
component funding will finance technical assistance, study tours, workshops/training, and
component evaluation.

A Program Manual has been appraised.             Two Grant Coordinators, located in the Project
Coordination Secretariat o f the Ministry o f Civil Affairs, will be appointed to be responsible for
Program activities and promotion o f the Program. There will be technical assistance to assist the
Coordinators to undertake outreach to schools to help with school development planning and
proposal writing.      All secondary schools will be eligible to receive technical assistance
facilitation and to submit proposals for evaluation. Schools to receive facilitation on a priority
basis will be determined annually by the Secondary Education Quality Assurance Team
(consisting o f representation from cantonal and RS ministries o f education).          The Quality
Assurance Team will also be responsible for conducting pre-evaluations o f proposals to ensure
they are aligned with ministerial priorities, and for overseeing the external evaluation o f the
Program.


                                                  13

A six member School Grant Evaluation Board will be appointed by the two Entity ministers of
education.    The Evaluation Board will meet at least quarterly to evaluate proposals and to
determine which proposals will be funded.

Financial and procurement arrangements, including audits, are defined in the Program Manual.
Credit proceeds will be used to finance an evaluation o f the Program just prior to the mid-term
review, and again just prior to Project closing. Schools will be required as part o f the proposal
process to provide data that will be used in the evaluations and to monitor the success o f the
project component.      Schools will be required to fill in the questionnaire for the Education
Management Information System.

Education Finance and Management (approximately US$4.0 million)

Technical assistance and training will be funded to facilitate the design and implementation o f
formula-based financing mechanisms for publicly provided general education. An Education
Finance Working Group will be established, and all 10 cantons and the RS are expected to be
involved in program design and receive capacity building training. The technical support and
training will be linked to the ongoing education management information system component,
implemented under the EDP.           Development o f per student funding mechanisms was
recommended inthe PRSP and has strong support among stakeholders. By the end o f the project
period, all 12 funding districts in BiH are expected to be operating per student funding formulas
which focus attention on efficiency and equity concerns in the budgeting process. Support for
devolving funding on a per student basis to municipalities or schools will be offered to funding
districts that opt for such support, although decentralization will not be a requirement o f the
formula funding approach.

Two Grant Coordinators, located inthe Project Coordination Secretariat o f the Ministry o f Civil
Affairs, will be appointed to act as the main counterparts to the technical assistance. Local
training under this component will be organized as part o f the consultant contract. Inaddition to
TA andtraining, eligible expenditures include office equipmentand software.

This component will support Bosnia and Herzegovina's participation in two international
assessments o f student achievement (the Programme for International Student Assessment and
the Trends inMathematics and Science Survey).

This component will also support, though technical assistance, training and software
development the extension o f the education management information system to include a module
on pre-school education.

The Project would provide technical assistance and training to help implement the shift inpublic
funding o f tertiary education away from the cantons to the State or Entity level. The following
conditions would have to be met:

    1. A body at the level o f the State has been established, with at least the following
        responsibilities:



                                                14

       above, are made following agreement with the Association.

Project implementation (approximately US$l.OO million):               Credit proceeds will pay for
consultant services (for procurement, financial management, translation and project audit), for
operating costs including travel and training (but excluding the salaries o f civil servants) for the
Project Steering Board, Project Coordination Secretariat, School Grants Evaluation Board, and
School Grants Quality Assurance Team.

             BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA: EducationRestructuringProject

The project is expected to be implementedover a period o f four years, from September 2005 to
September 2009.

Inbrief, the implementation ofthe ERP would beachieved through:


   0   A Project SteeringBoard, consisting of the ministers of education in each canton and
       the Entities, plusthe Ministerof Civil Affairs, will have overall responsibility for Project
       implementation.


   0   The School Grants Quality Assurance Team will be composed o f 15 specialists from
       the key institutions with responsibility for the conception and implementation of
       secondary school programs (one per Canton in the Federation o f BiH, and 5 for the
       Republika Srpska). The main function o f the Assurance Team i s to carry out pre-
       evaluations o f all grant proposals before their final review and approval by the Grant
       Board.


   0   The School Grants Evaluation Board, will be composed o f six members. The
       Federation Minister o f Education and Science appoints four members and the RS
       Minister o f Education and Culture appoints two members. The main functions o f the
       Grants Board are to review the pre-evaluation o f proposals by the School Grants Quality
       Assurance Team and give final approval to, or feedback on, these proposals.

Supporting these implementingagencies will be the following coordination arrangements:


   0   The Sector for Education, Science, Culture and Sports within the MoCA will act as
       Project Coordination Secretariat (PCS). The MoCA will appoint and pay for, when
       fully operational, four civil servants to this Secretariat: two grants and two finance
       coordinators.


   0   The PCS will employ one procurement and two financial managementspecialists as
       temporary consultants to help the Project implementation. These consultants will be
       paid from the Credit proceeds, under terms o f reference acceptable to the World Bank.

Inaddition to the groups described above, the cantonal and RS ministries of education will be
involved in the Project in other important ways. This will ensure that the Project serves the
needs o f these ministries inthe most effective way. The RS and cantonal ministers o f education
will need to appoint staff within their respective ministries who will be involved in different
parts of the Project intheir jurisdiction and will cooperate with Project Coordination Secretariat.
A typical education ministrymight need to identifytwo to four people, e.g., Assistant Ministerin
charge o f Secondary education (to be involved inthe School Grant Quality Assurance Team), an
EMIS responsible person (to be involved in the continuing work on the EMIS), and a Finance
management person (to participate inthe Finance Working Group). In addition, the Minister o f

1. Summary of the FinancialManagementAssessment

ExecutiveSummaryand Conclusion

An assessment to determine whether the financial management arrangements within the Project
Coordination Secretariat (PCS) within the State Ministry o f Civil Affairs (MoCA) for the
Education Restructuring Project are acceptable to IDA will be undertaken once the PCS has been
established. Currently (May 2005), the financial management arrangements are unsatisfactory as
the PCS i s yet to be established.

CountryIssues

A Country Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA) for BiH was carried out in 2001, The
CFAA identified systemic and structural weaknesses in public sector budgeting, accounting,
reporting, and auditing. However, there have been several positive developments in the past
three years, most notably, implementation o f a fully automated treasury system across all the
Cantons inthe Federation and all the regions in the RS. The introduction o f the on-line treasury
system has brought about a major improvement in the accounting and reporting o f budget
execution at the State, entity, and cantonal levels. The draft Country Financial Management
Strategy (CFMS) envisages mainstreaming o f project management into Ministries and
Departments, and abstains from creating stand-alone project implementation units (PIUs) outside
the ministries for implementing Bank-financed projects. This project accordingly will use
existing structures within the line ministries and thus desist from creating stand-alone PIUs. The
PCS is established within M o C A for the purposes o f coordinating the implementation o f this
project.

Inaddition, the CFAA identified weaknesses inthe country's bankingsector. Consequently, the
Special Accounts for the project will be opened in commercial banks assessed as acceptable to
the Bank.

2. FinancialManagementAssessment

(a) ImplementingEntities

The IDA credit would be provided to the Government o f BiH, and it would be actually disbursed
by the PCS, on the basis o f approvals from the Entities. The main task o f the PCS would be to
prepare and carry out financial management, supervision, reporting, and evaluation during the
project implementation period.      The PCS, through the MoCA, would report to the Project


                                                 19

Steering Board.     In order to ensure focused attention is given to project implementation,
ministries o f education in both the entities and cantons will nominate key counterparts to work
with PCS. All payments to suppliers,contractors, and consultants, and grants to the school would
be made by the PCS, following the procedure agreed with the relevant Entity Ministries and set
out in the Financial Management Manual, and to include verifying reports and supporting
documents before making such payments.           This would ensure project funds are paid after
thorough scrutiny and multiplereviews.

The risk associated with the implementing entities will be assessed once the FMManual i s
prepared and the PCS i s established.

(b) FundsFlow

The total project expenditures would be US$lO million equivalent financed from the IDA Credit.

A single Special Account would be established, which would be held in a commercial bank
acceptable to IDA. The PCS would be responsible for making all payments directly to the
contractors, suppliers, and consultants after receiving written instruction from Entity Ministersto
do so (e.g., that reports are of acceptable quality and/or the goods have been received). PCS will
also make grant payment to schools approvedby the School Grant Evaluation Board.

The exact funds flow arrangements and payment procedures will be finalized and documented in
the Financial Management Manual, which will be reviewed during the financial management
appraisal stage

The risk associated with funds will be assessedonce FM arrangements are completed.

(c) Staffing

The PCS finance and accounts function will be headed by a consultant specially appointed for
this purpose. S/he would be required to have extensive functional experience and substantial
experience inimplementing Bank-financed projects.

Payment authorizations procedures would be described in the flow o f funds diagrams in the
Program Manual and would be designed to ensure proper segregation o f duties. All payment
orders would requirejoint signatures.

The risk associated with staff - given the consultant nature o f appointment o f the FM staff -
would be assessedat the FMappraisal.

(d) Accountingand Reporting System

PCS will need to install financial management software capable o f tracking project's progress
and preparing FMRs.

The risks associated with financial accounting and reporting would be assessed during the FM
appraisal.




                                                  20

(e)AccountingPoliciesandProcedures

Accounting procedures would be set out inthe Financial Management Manual.

The acceptability o fthe manual would be assessed duringthe FMappraisal.

(f) InternalControls

To ensure proper use of grant funds by schools, grants will be released in two tranches. In
addition, operations (quality) audit will be undertakenby an international consulting group for
assessingthe efficacy o f school grants.

The Project Financial Manual will need to document internal controls to be established for the
project including segregation o f duties, verification and approval procedures, accounting
procedures etc.

The risk associated with internal controls (reliability o f financial reporting, the effectiveness and
efficiency o f operations, and compliance with laws and regulations) will be assessed at the FM
appraisal.

(g) PlanningandBudgeting

The PCS will prepareannual plans based onprojects implementationprogram.

(h)Audit reportsfor the previousyears

As the PCS will be a newly established unit, there are no previous audit reports to be reviewed.
However, review o f previous audit reports for project implemented by Education PIUs (in the
Federation and RS) contain no serious issues.

3. Audit Arrangements

Internal Audit. Since MoCA is part of the government set-up, it is subject to an audit by the
SupremeAudit Institution o fthe country.

External Audit. The project financial statements will be audited annually using acceptable
auditing standards and by acceptable independent auditors. Audit arrangements for the entire
portfolio are handledby the Government o f BiH(State) insteado f by each project authority. The
State Ministry o f Finance and Treasury (MoF&T) o f BiHhad a three-year contract (2001-2003)
with an international audit firm for auditing all WB-financed projects (with the exception of
revenue-earning projects). According to the master audit agreement, audited project financial
statements would be sent to the Bank within six (6) months o f the end o f the fiscal year. Audit
reports include opinions on the project financial statement (including statements o f
expenditures), the Special Account, and on the PCS's internal control arrangements and cover all
financial sources (IDA, Trust Funds, counterpart funds, etc.). The umbrella audit agreement has
ensured submission o f timely audit reports. The State MoF&T has procured audit services for
the period 2004-06. The global audit arrangements have worked well and are satisfactory to the
Association.




                                                21

The auditors would audit consolidated project financial statements and issue management letter.
The Terms o f Reference used would be the standard TORissuedby the MoF&T.

The first audited project financial statements and an audit report from the beginning o f the
project untilDecember 31,2005 are expected by June 30,2006.

4. ReportingandMonitoring.

The PCS would maintain separate financial records for the Project and would ensure appropriate
accounting for the funds provided.        They would prepare and submit quarterly Financial
Management Reports (FMRs) inagreedformats.

The FMRswould include:

1.     Project Sources and Uses of Funds Statement
2.     Uses o f Funds by Project Component Statement
3.     Project Balance Sheet
4.      Special Account Statement Plus Local Bank Account Statement
5.      Output MonitoringReports
6.      Procurement Process monitoring (consultants)
7.      Procurement Process Monitoring (Goods and Works)
8.      Reconciliation o f Credit Account balances

Format o f Financial Statements: The PCS would also prepare annual project financial statements
inthe format already agreed betweenthe Government of BiHand the auditors, which have been
found consistent with the FMRsandacceptable to the Bank.

5. FinancialRisk Analysis

From a financial management perspective, consolidated risk assessment for the project would be
carried out.

The following financial management risks could adversely affect project implementation:

(i)     High corruption. During 1999 and subsequently, serious concerns have been raised
        concerning fraud, waste and abuse o f donor funds in BiH. This has been reported in the
        following studies: (a) The 2001 Corruption Diagnostic Report of the World Bank, (b) The
        CFAA reports an environment o f pervasive corruption at all levels o f the economy and
        governments, and (c) The 1999-2000 Business Environment and Enterprise Performance
        Survey (BEEPS) conducted by the World Bank and the European Bank for
        Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) demonstrates that BiH i s amongst the bottom
        third of transition countries with the highest levels of state capture. Even though the
        project i s to be implemented in an environment of perceived highcorruption, the risk that
        school grants will not used as intendedi s judged as manageable since a strong PCS will
        be monitoring the project and thus providing it independence from the actual project
        implementation. Furthermore, the project has identified several steps indicated below, to
        minimize the risk o f misuse o f Bank funds.



                                                 22

(ii)     Possible misuse of project funds by the PCS. The risk of misuse or fraud will be
         minimized inthe following ways:

           Technical assistance will be contracted to support development planning and
           facilitation in schools and to help manage the Secondary Education Grant Program
           funds.
           The School Grants Evaluation Board will meet at least quarterly to evaluateproposals
           and toproduce evaluation reports
       0   Transfer of the proceeds of the credit to beneficiaries will be according to tightly-
           drafted restricted-purpose agreements that have been approved by the Bank. The
           agreement will contain a clause to assure the utilization o f funds according to agreed
           objectives, as well as a remedies section, which will include the possibility o f
           terminating the agreements which do not comply with agreed procedures and/or funds
           utilization;
           Disbursements to beneficiaries        linked to actual expenses - disbursements to
           beneficiaries are to be based on verifiable documents;
           Close monitoring and supervision by PCS. The PCS will have coordinators for close
           monitoring o f the performance o f grant utilization; and
       0   Intensive supervision by the World Bank. Overall supervision, including procurement
           supervision, will be undertaken on a periodic basis by Bank staff.

(iii) Unstable and weak banking sector may have an impact on the project
         implementation.The Special Account for the project, therefore, would have to bekept in
         a commercial bank that i s acceptable to the Bank.

The overall financial management risk for this project will be assessed at the FM appraisal stage,
expected August 2005.

6. DisbursementArrangements

It is expected that the proceeds o f the credit would be disbursed over a period of four and a half
years (2005 through 2010). Disbursements from the Credit would follow the transaction-based
method, Le., the traditional Bank procedures including reimbursements with full documentation,
Statements of Expenditure (SOE), direct payments and special commitments.

The CFAA Report for BiH recommended that report-based disbursement should not be
introduced in the BiH portfolio at this stage because o f significant risks relating to: (i)project
financial management weaknesses and lack o f capacity in implementingunits; (ii)     weak banking
system; and (iii)  unstable political situation and general governance problems presently affecting
Bosnia and Herzegovina.

Disbursements from the Credit proceeds would be administered by the PCS (see process
described above). PCS i s responsible for retaining supporting documentation for SOEs and
making them available to IDA supervision missions, as well as to the auditors.

Use of statements of expenditures (SOEs):

Replenishment applications should be submitted on a monthly basis and must be fully
documented and supported by statements and reconciliation statements.            SOE disbursements
should be made for: (i)   contracts for individual consultants valued at less than US$50,000; (ii)
contracts for consulting firms valued at less than US$lOO,OOO;     (iii) contracts for goods costing
less than US$lOO,OOO;     and (iv) training workshops and study tours, audit fees, and incremental
operating costs. The minimum size o f application for direct payment withdrawals and the
issuance o f special commitments from the Credit account would be 20 percent o f the Authorized
Allocation to the Special Account. This documentationwould be made available for the required
audit as well as to IDA supervision Missions, and would be retained by the implementing units
for at least one year after receipt by the Bank o f the audit report for the last fiscal year in which
disbursementwas made.

SpecialAccount:

To facilitate timely project implementation, the Government o f BiH would establish, maintain
and operate, under terms and conditions acceptable to the Bank, a Special Account, denominated
in Euro, Before a bank is selected to hold the Special Account, the Borrower shall provide

The initial authorized allocation for the Special Account is Euro 400,000 until withdrawals have
reached SDR 3,000,000, thenthe full authorized allocation o f Euro 750,000 could be disbursed.

7. SupervisionPlan

The frequency o f supervision would be dependent on the Project's risk rating. However, during
the initial stage of the project, considering moderate risk profile of the project, intense
supervision efforts would be ensured. During supervision missions, project's financial
management and disbursement arrangements (including a review o f a sample o f SOEs and
movements on the Special Account) would be reviewed to ensure compliance with the Bank's
minimumfiduciary requirements.

The Country FMS would review the FMRs for the project on a regular basis and the results
and/or issues would be followed up during the supervision missions.                     The Audited Project
Financial Statements for the PCS would be reviewedand identified issues would be followed up
withthe PCS.


8. Action Plan (Agreed with the Borrower).

It is concludedthat PCS inMoCA will needto undertakeseveral measures inorder to satisfy
Bank's minimumfinancial management requirements.

                                      Annex 8: Procurement
             BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA: EducationRestructuringProject

A.      General

1.      Procurement of contracts financed in whole or part by the International Development
Association for the proposed project would be carried out in accordance with the World Bank's
"Guidelines: Procurement Under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits" dated May 2004; "Guidelines:
Selection and Employment o f Consultants by World Bank Borrowers" dated May 2004, and the
provisions stipulated in the Legal Agreement. The general description o f various items under
different expenditure categories is given below. For each contract to be financed by the Credit,
the different procurement methods or consultant selection methods, estimated costs, prior review
requirements,and time frame are agreed betweenthe Borrower and the Bank project team inthe
Procurement Plan. The Procurement Plan will be updated at least annually or as required to
reflect the actual project implementation needs and improvements ininstitutional capacity.

2.      Procurement of Goods: Goods procured under this project will include off-the-shelf
goods, including minor office and computer equipment o f standard specifications, estimated to
cost under US$100,000 equivalent per contract, publications/periodicals, training materials,
office supplies and operational expenditure items required by the PCS. To the extent possible,
contracts for these goods will be grouped into bidding packages estimated to cost more than
US$100,000 equivalent and procured following International Competitive Bidding (ICB)
procedures, using relevant Bank-issued Standard Bidding Documents for procurement o f goods.
Contracts for goods which cannot be grouped into larger bidding packages and estimated to cost
less than US$lOO,OOO per contract may be procured using shopping procedures based on a model
request for quotations satisfactory to the Bank.

3.      Procurementof non-consultingservices: Non-consulting technical services, should the
need arise for such during project implementation, will be procured following the above spelled
arrangements for Procurement o f Goods.

4.      Selection o f Consultants: Consulting services from firms and individuals required for the
project will include technical assistance to participating education institutions, development o f
communication activities, studies, surveys, training, seminars, workshops and study tours.


Firms

5.      Contracts with firms estimated to cost US$lOO,OOO equivalent or more will be procured
using Quality and Cost-Based Selection (QCBS) procedures and the relevant World Bank
Standard Request for Proposals (RFP).

6.      Small and simple contracts estimated to cost less than US$lOO,OOO       equivalent will be
procured using Consultants' Qualifications Selection (CQS) or Least Cost Selection (LCS)
procedures. In a case by case basis and with Bank's approval, CQS could be used for contracts
estimated to cost more thanUS$lOO,OOO, but less than US$200,000.


                                                26

7.      Single-source selection o f firms will be allowed only with the previous approval o f the
Bank and under the exceptional cases describedinParagraphs 3.9 through 3.13 of the Consultant
Guidelines.


Individuals

8.      Services would be provided by individual consultants selected by comparison of
qualifications o f three candidates and hired in accordance with the provisions o f paragraphs 5.1
through 5.3 o f the Consultant Guidelines. In case o f direct invitation (not publicly advertised),
the list of individuals to be invited to submit curriculum vitae should be determined by a
committee or commission.

9.      Sole-source selection o f individual consultants will be allowed only with the previous
approval of the Bank and under the exceptional cases described in Paragraph 5.4 o f the
Consultant Guidelines.

10.     Short lists o f consultants for services estimated to cost less than US$lOO,OOO equivalent
per contract may be composed entirely o f national consultants inaccordance with the provisions
of paragraph 2.7 o f the Consultant Guidelines.

11.     Universities and research centers, as well as government officials and civil servants inthe
Borrower's country, my be hired as consultants only when they meet the eligibility criteria set
forth inparagraph 1.11o f the Consultant Guidelines.

12.     Procurement under the Secondary Education Grants program: For procurement
under small grants provided under the Second Education Grants Program the procurement
procedures established inthe Grant Program Manual would apply.

13.     Operating Costs: Operating costs, including the day-to-day operating cost for office
maintenance, supplies and consumables, and incremental costs o f operating and maintainingthe
equipment provided under the Project, other sundry items, office rental and utilities, recurrent
cost of the implementing agency directly related to project implementation, would be financed
under the Credit and would be procured using the implementing agency's administrative
procedures which were reviewed andfound acceptable to the Bank.


B.      Assessment of the agency's capacity to implement procurement

14.     An assessment o f the capacity of the Sector for Education, Science, Culture and Sports
withinthe MoCA which will act as the Project Coordination Secretariat (PCS) was carried out by
Nikola Kerleta, Procurement Analyst in the WB Sarajevo COYduring the pre-appraisal mission
and concluded on March 1, 2005. The assessment reviewed the organizational structure for
implementing the project and the interaction between the project's staff responsible for
procurementinthe PCS andthe Ministry.




                                                  27

15.     The MoCA will appoint, when fully operational, four people to this Secretariat: two
grants coordinators and two finance coordinators.

16.     Most o f the issues/risks concerning procurement management for implementation o f the
project have been identified     and include: (i) i s not own procurement capacity in the
                                                  there
ministry; (ii) current administrative structure of the country i s complex and does not lend
               the
itself for taking advantage of economies o f scale; (iii) i s a new procurement law in line
                                                           there
with European Unionprocurement regulations, but is only the law, and its enforcement, the new
procurement system, and a procurement capacity and culture are still to be introduced in the
country.     In the above described business environment, attempts to exert political or
administrative influence inthe outcome o f competitive procurement processes, and even corrupt
practices, are a real probability.

17.     The following measure i s envisaged to mitigate these risks: The Project Coordination
Secretariat will employ one procurement specialist as a consultant to help project
implementation. The services o f this consultant will be paid from the Credit proceeds and will
be procuredunder terms o f reference acceptable to the World Bank.

18.     The overall project risk for procurement under the project i s rated as high. However, this
i s a country-, rather than a project-specific issue. Procurement under previous and ongoing
Bank-financed projects has systematically been rated as Satisfactory.

C.      ProcurementPlan

19.     The Borrower, after pre-appraisal, developed a Procurement Plan for project
implementation, which provides the basis for the procurement methods. This plan has been
agreed between the Borrower and the Project Team. It will also be available in the Project's
database and in the Bank's external website.          The Procurement Plan will be updated in
agreement with the Project Team annually or as required to reflect the actual project
implementationneeds and improvements ininstitutional capacity.

D.      Frequencyof ProcurementSupervision

20.     In addition to prior review to be carried out by the Bank, the procurement capacity
assessment has recommended supervision missions to visit the field every six months to carry
out post reviewo f procurement actions.

21,     All other contracts will be subject to selective post-award reviews inaccordance with the
procedures described inAppendix 1,paragraph 4 o f the Procurement and Consultant Guidelines.

                           Annex 9: Economic andFinancialAnalysis
             BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA: EducationRestructuringProject

        The essence o f the framework-type project, and related education conditionality in the
parallel EMSAC, i s to increase the internal efficiency o f public spending on secondary and
tertiary education and to reinvest the savings realized inimproving the external efficiency, equity
and quality o f education at these levels.
ECONOMIC     ANALYSIS

A. Current Situation.

        Sector Overview. In general, the pattern o f public spending on education in Bosnia and
Herzegovina stems from the combination o f its former Yugoslav heritage and from the effects o f
the Dayton Peace Accords that have resulted in very fragmented political jurisdictions. There
are some strengths, including the lack o f any significant gender issues throughout the system, the
highprimary enrollment, and the pro-poor nature o f spending at the primary level.

    However, there are also serious weaknesses. These include:


    0   a high overall level o f spending relative to Gross Domestic Product (GDP), mostly the
        result o f highfragmentation infinancing the system;
    0   great internal inefficiency at all levels, largely the result o f having a large number o f
        small schools (primary and secondary) and separate faculties (tertiary level), low ratios o f
        teachers to students and non-teaching staffto students and very highrepetition rates;
     0  low enrollments in preschool, secondary and tertiary education compared to other
        European countries, the result o f limited access, especially for poor and rural children to
        preschool education and to general secondary education that provides the opportunity to
        go on to tertiary education;
     0  the pro-rich nature o f public spending at the secondary and tertiary levels; the lack of
        articulation between the secondary and tertiary education systems, on the one hand, and
        the labor market, on the other; and,
     0  overall quality levels that have not been consistently measured but, based on evidence
        from other countries o f the former Yugoslavia, are likely to be low by European
        standards, largely because the curriculum i s based on inputs rather than designed to
        produce students with a set o f skills, and the poor quality o f those inputs.

     While this general pattern characterizes the country as a whole, there are also some important
differences between the Federation and RS. Spending in RS i s more in line with that in other
countries but secondary and tertiary enrollments are lower than in the Federation, while the
proportion o f vocational secondary enrollments i s much higher.

        Financing. In the Federation, public spending on education is the responsibility o f the
canton. In RS, it is an entity responsibility, though municipalities also have some obligations
with regard to non-salary expenditures in general education. Secondary education i s largely



                                                  30

publicly financed and the pattern i s very similar throughout the Federation and RS, with the
exception that in the Federation it i s a cantonal responsibility and in RS an entity one. The
formula used to determine secondary school budgets in both entities i s based on pedagogical
standards that definethe number o f students, number and size o f classes, number and structure o f
teaching and non-teaching staff, normal number o f hours, physical surface area o f schools and
classrooms, furniture requirements, etc. On the basis o f these standards, and also the curriculum,
the number o f hours in a school i s determined, and then the number o f salaries (Le,, the number
o f teachers and non-teaching staff).     Non-salary expenditures are sometimes a cantonal and
sometimes a municipal responsibility. Regardless o f responsibility, however, they are very low.
Capital expenditures are largely financed by donors.

        Tertiary education financing, however, i s very different between the Entities and also
involves significant private financing. Tertiary education i s financed by the cantons inwhich the
universities are located in the Federation and by the Entity in RS. The only exception i s the
University inWest Mostar, which is financed not only by Herzegovina-Neretva canton, inwhich
it is located, but also by other Croat majority cantons. Public revenues account for varying
shares o f total university spending, ranging from 48 percent at Mostar Universityto 72 percent at
Tuzla University. Private funding i s much more significant at the higher level than in general
education; in Sarajevo canton, for instance, 59 percent o f tertiary education financing in 2002
was public compared to 94 percent o f primary education financing. Private funds come from (a)
entry fees from first year full-time students (KM 30-200 according to the university); (b) fees
from part-time students (KM 200-800); (c) fees from parallel students (those who finance their
own education (KM 900 in Economics to KM 4000 in Medicine at the University o f Sarajevo,
for instance); (d) fees from foreign students (KM 2000 on average); (e) fees for postgraduate
studies; (f) exam fees; and (g) research and consulting fees. The vast majority o f students pay
almost no fees, however. Last year, for instance, there were 20,679 regular students at the
University o f Sarajevo, paying almost nothing, with total revenues amounting to about KM 2.8
million. The social assessment carried out for this Project found a willingness amongst students
and parents to pay more for a better education. Ifthose students currently paying nothing were
to pay KM 500 per year if quality improved, this would be equivalent to KM 10.3 million per
year. Public spending on tertiary education i s calculated in largely the same way as in general
education, although the normal number o f hours expected o f a professor i s very low (6
hourdweek at Sarajevo and only 3 at Tuzla). However, each professor in practice has multiple
contracts with different faculties within one and at different universities, and typically receives
additional payments equivalent to 2-3 times his or her base payment, along with any necessary
travel and subsistence costs.

        Internal Efficiency. Public spending on education at the different levels i s very high by
European standards at the secondary level (Table l), this figure should be treated with
                                                            but
caution since the official GDP figure is likely to be understated given the prevalence o f the
informal sector. The high average i s mainly driven by higher than average spending in the
Federation o f BiH. This i s the result o f the highly fragmented system with very small school and
class sizes, the outdated formula for determining school budgets, and the excessive share o f
salaries and wages. The wage bill averages 90 percent o f spending (Table 2) and results from
low student-teacher ratios and, especially, low student-nonteaching staff ratios. In the case o f

tertiary education, there i s also the very highrepetition and dropout rate that pushes up unit costs
per graduate (Table 3).

        External Efficiency.    The low overall level o f enrollment in secondary education and the
high proportion of students enrolled in vocational schools act as a brake on BiH's future
economic growth and the employment prospects for these students. Throughout the world, there
i s a convergence occurring among general academic, technical and vocational streams at the
secondary level, with four years becoming the norm and an increasingly common core
curriculum o f general academic study. The reason i s simple - modern economies place a
premium on flexibility and the skills necessary to acquire other skills rather than on particular
skills for which there may be little demand in a few years' time. The contrast i s dramatic
betweenthe global trend, especially in Europe, and the continuing large number o f specialized
vocational programs inBiHfeeding into a large number o f occupational groupings.

        Similarly at the tertiary education level, there i s little relationship between students'
choice o f subjects and future labor market prospects. This i s largely the result o f the absence o f
fees, If students had to pay for their university education (currently or deferred, through loans),
they would tendto select subjects for which there was future demand for employment.

        Equity. Equity ineducation inBiHhas two aspects: access and expenditure. Access has
already been discussed - the principal issue i s the access o f the poor to four-year secondary
schools and hence potentially to tertiary education. Expenditure equity has two aspects - equity
across different government units and across different households. There i s a very significant
variation in public spending across the different cantons in the Federation, ranging from KM
1703 per secondary student inSarajevo cantonto KM666 inCentral Bosnia canton, compared to
KM596 inRS (Table 4). Spendingacross households is pro-poor at the primary level and pro-
affluent at the secondary and higher levels (Table 5).

    B. Likely Impact of Policy Changes andProject Activities

The package o f policy changes associated with the project and the related EMSAC will increase
internal efficiency, external efficiency, equity and quality in public spending on secondary and
tertiary education as follows:
    0   Internal efficiency savings from increasing teacher workloads, improving the ratio o f
        students to staff, and reducing repetition in both secondary and tertiary education. In
        particular, student-staff ratios will increase inboth secondary education (through a freeze
        on the general public sector wage bill and through limiting the wage bill to 85 percent o f
        sectoral spending) and in tertiary education (through elimination o f the separate legal


                                                       34

           status o f faculties and hence through elimination o f multiple employment contracts for
          professors), serving to increase contact hours between teachers and students at both
           levels;
     0    External efficiency gains from increased overall secondary and tertiary enrollments,
          better articulation with the labor market by shifting the balance of secondary education
          toward general education and away from vocational education, and linking tertiary
          education students' choice o f subject more to the fees they will pay (with associated loans
           and other repayment mechanisms)
     0    Equity gains will result from expanded enrollments at secondary and tertiary levels, by
           increasing the proportion enrolled at general grammar schools and reducing that in
          vocational schools (increasing the share in four-year programs) and in particular by
           starting to break the cycle o f poverty engendered by poorer children either not enrolling
          at all in secondary education or being concentrated in secondary vocational schools
          where their labor market prospects are limited and there i s no access to tertiary education.
     0    Quality improvements will result from limiting the share o f recurrent spendingon wages
           and salaries to 85 percent of the total, from the activities financed under the project's
           Secondary Education Grants Program and also from the activities o f the Standards and
          Assessment Agency, created under the EDP and now becoming fully operational.
     0     Funding through grants from the Project's Secondary Education Grants Program will
           achieve the broad objectives. These include such things as developing new programs,
          converting vocational into general secondary schools, increasing internal efficiency
          through the introduction o f common accounting systems inuniversities, etc.

     C. Monitoring Indicators

     These shifts in efficiency and equity will be monitored throughout the project through a set
o f indicators (Table 6 presents the indicators and the baseline data).

FINANCIALANALYSIS

      The project and its associated policy changes will have no fiscal impact on recurrent
spending because:

   a) No increase in public spending on education i s envisaged. All new investmentswill be
      met from savings resulting from increased internal efficiency, as discussed above.
      Moreover the project will be implemented in the broader macroeconomic framework
      being supported by the Bank's EMSAC, and the government's medium term economic
      framework and PRSP.

   b) All grant applications under the Secondary Education Grant Program will have to include
      provision for meeting the recurrent cost implications o f any grant activities either from
      private sources or from existing budget allocations.

   c) Incremental recurrent cost financing o f the fiduciary staff in the amount o f about
      $400,000 equivalent will be inherently transitory (ending at the end o f the Project). Cost
      o f staff inMinistry o f Civil Affairs i s already budgeted.
