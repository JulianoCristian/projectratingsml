timely financial resources in support of its\n            drought relief and recovery program.  This program will\n            alleviate human suffering, both at present and in the\n            future, by restoring and enhancing Zimbabwe's\n            productive capacity.  It will do so by providing\n            agricultural inputs that are essential for the next planting\n            season, rehabilitating the water supply system, providing\n            for critical inputs for the transport of goods needed for\n            relief and recovery, and upgrading the public works programs\n            through which drought relief is distributed.  The program is\n            designed to give special consideration to the recovery needs\n            of agricultural smallholders.  The project will also help\n            narrow the balance of payments gap that will result from\n            incremental imports and the collapse of food exports.  This\n            will lessen the risk that this natural disaster might derail\n            the Government's broad based economic structural\n            adjustment program.  Finally, the project will assure the\n            strengthening of short and long-term institutional capacity\n            in agriculture, water, and public works, to reduce the\n            country's vulnerability to future external risks and to\n            increase food security."}, "docdt": "1992-06-04T00:00:00Z"}
