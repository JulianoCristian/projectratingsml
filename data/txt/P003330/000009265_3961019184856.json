   Mitigation Project in Zambia. The two principal objectives\n            of the program were: (a) to address the risk of widespread\n            famine in Zimbabwe; and (b) to provide the conditions under\n            which the productive sectors could rebound quickly from the\n            drought.  Bank's performance was satisfactory.\n            Borrower's performance was satisfactory. The key\n            lessons learned were as follows: (i) approval to procure\n            inputs must be given in time whilst sourcing for funds is\n            still in progress; (ii) there is need for government to\n            provide enough funds for the whole project especially if the\n            component involves different ministries; (iii) the project\n            revealed the capacity constraint of government agencies in\n            implementing emergency drought relief operations\n            effectively; (iv) government should encourage and provide\n            incentives for input suppliers to invest in input\n            distribution warehouses in small holder farm areas; (v)\n            planning should not be centralised and whenever possible\n            involve all levels and layers of beneficiaries to enable\n            transparency and acceptability; (vi) emergency procurement\n            procedures need to be more carefully designed and fully\n            articulated at appraisal stage; (vii) the government Tender\n            Board should be requested to process emergency tenders on\n            their own instead of mixing them with other tenders; and\n            (viii) during the identification and appraisal stage,\n            Government should play a more significant role inorder to\n            influence project design."}, "docdt": "1995-12-20T00:00:00Z"}
