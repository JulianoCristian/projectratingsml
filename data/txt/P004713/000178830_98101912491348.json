NHA's\n            low-income housing program, initiated under the Bangkok\n            Sites and Services and Slum Improvement Project (Loan\n            1556-TH), by expanding its slum improvement program in\n            Bangkok and the sites and services approach both in Bangkok\n            and in five regional cities, and by consolidating\n            improvements in NHA's financial

The project\n            will also initiate preparation of a comprehensive urban\n            development program in regional cities, including the\n            strengthening of municipal administration. The project\n            includes: (a) the provision of sites and services in Bangkok\n            (Lat Krabang) for approximately 3,500 residential and\n            commercial units as well as community and industrial\n            development; (b) the provision of sites and services in five\n            regional cities (Chiang Mai, Songkhla, Khon Kaen, Nakhon\n            Sawan and Chantaburi) for approximately 3,250 low-income\n            housing units and small-scale industry development; (c) the\n            expansion of the slum improvement program in Bangkok\n            benefitting approximately 12,000 families; (d) the provision\n            of loans to small businesses in the sites and services\n            developments and upgraded slum areas; and (e) technical\n            assistance to strengthen NHA, to strengthen municipal\n            finance and administration, and to study housing finance."}, "docdt": "1980-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
