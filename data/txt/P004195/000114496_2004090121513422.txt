Dear Mrs.Dowsett-Coirolo,
        Re: UP land Agriculture Development Proiect
            (IDA Credit 2079 - LA)
      Since  the above-mentioned project was negotiated with IDA,
the Government of Lao PDR has changed its policy for channelling
rural credit to farmers.  Instead of using the provincial
agricultural services as intermediaries, which was the mechanism
agreed in the design of the project, all credit for the rural sector
should now be channel led throuRh commercial banks.
We,  therefore,  request  an  amendment  of  the  flow  of  funds
arrangements under the IDA Credit, so as to allow (i) the Ministry
of Economy, Planning and Finance to on-lend the Credit funds to the
Bank of Lao PDR,  and (ii)  the Bank of Lao PDR to on-lend to
commercial  banks  in the  project  area,  under  subsidiary  loan
agreements satisfactory to the Government and IDA.
We would appreciate if you would propose appropriate amendments to
the IDA Development Credit Agreement.
Best regards,
Sincerely yours,
Khamphoui Keoboualapha
Deputy Prime Minsiter and Minsiter
Ministry of Economy, Planning
  and Finance
