MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE
INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO THE LAO PEOPLE'S DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC
FOR AN UPLAND AGRICULTURE DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.       The following memorandum and  recommendation  on a proposed credit
to Lao PDR for SDR 15.9 million (US$20.2 million equivalent) is submitted
for approval. The proposed credit would be on standard IDA terms with 40
years' maturity, and would help finance an upland agriculture development
project. The project would be cofinanced by a US$6.9 million equivalent
grant from the Australian International Development Assistance Bureau
(AIDAB), and by a US$3.1 million equivalent grant from the Government of
France.
2.       Background.   From  independence  in  1975  through 1986, economic
development in Lao PDR was based on centralized planning and controls, with
state ownership of the means of production and distribution. The policy
framework for agriculture emphasized collectivization and creation of state
farms, low official producer prices and state monopoly over marketing.
Although food security was the clear priority, with the exception of rice,
crop production decreased and the agriculture sector stagnated at the
subsistence level.   In  1986,  sweeping  policy  reforms  introduced a new
system of economic management aimed at liberalization and a concerted move
towards a market economy,  including:    unification  of exchange rates and
alignment to the free market rate, deregulation of prices and trade,
elimination of farm subsidies, removal of private sector restrictions,
liberalization of commercial credit, fiscal and public enterprise reform.
IDA and the International Monetary Fund are supporting the reform process
through a recently signed Structural Adjustment Credit and a Structural
Adjustment Facility, approved by the Board in September 1989. In addition,
an Asian Development Bank's Agricultural Program Loan, due to be negotiated
in 1989, will address sector policy issues in manpower development,
research, extension, irrigation and seed multiplication.
3.       For the agricultural sector,   the National Agriculture Conference
in 1988 endorsed the reversal of previous collectivization policies, to be
substituted by agricultural development based on family farming units
operating in a commercial market  economy.   Individual private farmers now
have improved access to credit, inputs and support services. Farmgate
prices and marketing have largely been deregulated. Local agricultural
planning and research and extension  development  are being emphasized.  To
improve efficiency and accountability, many former functions of the
Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry (MAF) have been devolved to the
provinces, diss.ricts and villages, and  staff  have been reassigned to work
more directly with farmers.
4.       Rationale for IDA Involvement.  The proposed project would support
IDA's  country  development  strategy   for   Lao   PDR,  by  assisting  in
implementation of important sectoral reforms (paras. 2-3). During project
preparation, IDA played an important role in focussing attention on the
relevant technical and institutional issues constraining the development of
coffee and other crops for domestic processing and export; on the critical
measures needed to improve capacity utilization of existing agricultural
and rural infrastructure; and on the development of practical means to
address concerns over environmental degradation in the uplands. .'8 the
main external donor to date in the agriculture sector (Credit Nos. 760-LA,



- 2 -
924-LA, 1021-LA and 1395-LA), IDA is especially well placed to work with
the  principal  sectoral  agencies   in  designing  realistic  targets  and
implementation arrangements and closely supervising their execution.
5.       With regard to  IDA's  support  for  coffee  development under the
project, Laos is one of the poorest countries in the world and has no major
agricultural export alternatives to coffee at this time, other than
forestry products. For environmental reasons, recent Government policies
formulated in 1989 de-emphasize logging in favor of forest conservation.
As the coffee plantations established several decades ago continue to
degrade,  there   are   no   significant   economically  viable  investment
alternatives in the coffee growing  areas.    Presently almost the whole of
Laotian coffee production is sold to the Soviet Union and Eastern European
countries under  barter  arrangements.    It  is  expected that incremental
production under the  project would  be  readily  absorbed by this market,
since Laos presently has difficulty meeting demand. Additional production
under the project would represent only about 0.12 and 0.22 of world
production and exports, respectively, and therefore would not affect world
prices even if sold on the international market.
6.       Proiect Obiectives.  The  project  aims at reducing rural poverty,
expanding export earnings and improving food security, controlling soil
erosion and  strengthening  key  agricultural  institutions.    The guiding
strategy would be to concentrate on bringing past investments in coffee
plantations, irrigation, feed milling and rural roads, which are currently
yielding only limited benefits, into more productive use, as well as to
help  provide  the   technological   foundation   for  future  agricultural
diversification and growth.   The  project  would  build on the experiences
acquired by various entities in their implementation of earlier IDA
agricultural projects, and on improved technologies developed under similar
Bank Group projects elsewhere in the Asia Region. The main beneficiaries
would be farming families currently involved in highland coffee production
and upland subsistence farming and slash-and-burn cultivation.
7.       Prolect  Description.       The   five-year   project  would  cover
Champassak, Saravane and Sekong Provinces on the Bolovens Plateau in the
south, and Vientiane Municipality and Province in the north. Project
activities would extend mainly over the higher elevations of the project
areas and would concentrate on upland cropping systems, with the exception
of irrigation rehabilitation, which would apply only to valley floors in
Vientiane Province. The project would supportt (a) upland crop production,
mainly of coffee, soybeans and other cash crops, and valley floor irrigated
production of rice and other cash crops. through the development and
transfer of improved and environmentally safe crop production technologies,
and  the  provision  of   equipment,   inputs  and  support  services;  (b)
rehabilitation of existing small-scale gravity irrigation schemes and
establishment  of  pilot   irrigation   operation   and maintenance  (O&M)
arrangements based on adequate cost recovery from beneficiaries; (c) feeder
road rehabilitation and maintenance; and (d) technical assistance and
training. The total cost of the project is estimated at US$34.0 million,
with a foreign exchange component of US$27.0 million (802). The latter
includes US$10.0 million equivalent for technical assistance which would be
co-financed with grants from AIDAB  and  France.   A breakdown of costs and
the financing plan are shown in Schedule A. A Project Preparation Facility
advance   of   US$700,000   was    approved    by    IDA   on   August   9,



- 3 -
1989. Amounts and methods of procurement and of disbursements, and the
disbursement schedule,  are  shown  in  Schedule  B.    A  timetable of key
processing events and the status of Bank Group operations in Lao PDR are
given in Schedules C and  D.  respectively.    IBRD  map No. 21375R is also
attached. The Staff Appraisal Report No. 8003-LA, dated November 7, 1989,
is being distributed separately.
8.       Agreed Actionst   During  negotiations,  assurances were obtained
from the Government on the followings
(a) by September 30, 1990, the Ministry of Economy, Plan and
Finance (MEPF) would submit a proposal for setting up a project monitoring
and evaluation system satisfactory to IDA; (b) the Project Coordinating
Unit (PCU) would submit the first year's annual work plans by April 30,
1990 and subsequent annual work plans and budgets to IDA by September 30 of
the preceding year; and annual reports by September 30 of each year, and
six-monthly reports by March 31 and September 30 of each year; (c) the
National Project Coordination Committee (NPCC) would carry out a project
implementation mid-term review not later than December 31, 1992; (d) all
project agencies would submit annual project accounts to MEPP not later
than March 31 of the following year, and MEPF would submit annual audit
reports to IDA for the project on the project accounts, the Special Account
and Statements of Expenditure within nine months of the end of each fiscal
year; (e) the Borrower would carry out a study for the formulation of an
appropriate pricing and marketing strategy for upland crops produced under
the project not later than December 31, 1991; (f) inputs would be supplied
by provincial project entities and the Tha-Ngone Feed Hill Corporation
(TFMC) at full cost for cash or on credit, and payments woucld be kept in a
revolving fund for the replenishment of input supplies; and (g) a condition
for participation under the project would be the prior signing of an
agreement between district authorities and water user groups on the
establishment of an O&M organization and the payment of adequate irrigation
service fees. A condition of effectiveness would be that, by April 30,
1990, the NPCC would be appointed, and the PCU would be established at the
MEPP.
9.       Benefits:  Benefits under the project are expected from: (a) total
annual incremental production at full  development of 7,000 tons of coffee,
4,200 tons of  soybeans,  6,000  tons  of  maize  and  5,000 tons of paddy,
amounting to about 155Z, 1002, 152 and 0.6Z, respectively, of current total
national production; (b)  incremental  export  earnings  of  about US$ 12.4
million annually at full development;  (c)  improved farm incomes for about
29,000 smallholders, all of whom are at or below the relative poverty
level; (d) reduction in  environmental degradation caused by slash-and-burn
cultivation  on  slopes;  (e)   strengthening  of  essential  research  and
extension  entities   and   other   provincial  agricultural  institutions,
including manpower development; (f) development of pilot sustainable
irrigation 0&X arrangements; and (g) improvement of the productivity of
essential rural infrastructure and agro-processing plant capacity. The
internal economic rate of return for the overall project is estimated at
292 (342, 162 and 29?, respectively, for the coffee, irrigation and upland
crop components). Costs would have to increase by 115? or benefits decline
by 53Z to lower the ERR for the aggregate project to the 102 level.



10.     RLisks, The main risks  would  be  slower than expected adoption of
measures for coffee rehabilitation, Improved huebandry and conservation
cropping systems; reluctance of farmers to pay irrigation service fees;
unexpected changes in Government agricultural pricing policy; and a
substantial worsening of long-te:n international coffee and soybean prices
below current forecasts. However, these risks are not considered serious.
Projected farmer adoption rates of Improved technology are based on
experience gained under more recent IDA projects in Lao PDR. Benefits from
sustained water delivery far outweigh the level of irrigation service fees
and present a strong incentive for water user participation, and village
participation in project rehabilitation activities would be conditional on
their prior formal agreement to contribute to O&M costs. The Government of
Lao PDR is strongly coumitted to the implementation of agricultural pricing
and trade reforms, for which additional safeguards are provided under the
IDA Structural Adjustment Credit.    Long-term  coffee  prices, both in the
international market and under barter arrangements with Socialist bloc
countries, are expected to constitute adequate incentives to growers.
Finally, project development activities would be supported by intensive
technical assistance and training, supported by Australia and France.
11.      Recommendation.  I  am  satisfied  that  the proposed credit would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that
the Executive Directors approve the proposed Credit.
