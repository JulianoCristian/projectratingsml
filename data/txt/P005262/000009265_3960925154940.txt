FIFTH EDUCATION PROJECT
(LOAN 2246-JO)
PREFACE
This is t e Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Fifth
Education Project in Jordan, for which Loan 2246-Jo in the amount of USS 18.8m
was approved on March 15, 1983. The loan was closed on June 30, 1988,
according to the initial timetable. Actual disbursements amounted to US$
13.3m, about US$ 5.5m short of the original loan amount. The remaining
balance in the loan account (US$5,F47,177) was cancelled with effect from
December 31, 1988.
The PCR was jointly prepared by the Population and Human Resources
Division of the Europe, Middle East and North Africa Regional Office (Preface,
Evaluation Summary, Part I, Part III), and the Borrower (Part II).
The preparation of the report began in May, 1990, and is based on
information contained in the Staff Appraisal Report, the Loan Agreement,
supervision reports, correspondence between the Bank and the Borrower, and
internal Bank memoranda.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
JORDAN
FIFTH EDUCATION PROJECT
(LOAN 2246-JO)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Proiect Obiectives
1.          The project followed closely the objectives of Jordan's 1981-85
National Development Plan, which placed heavy emphasis on the accelerated
formation of skilled personnel, mainly through formal education, and the
continued expansion of educational services in remote areas. These objectives
were support edi through investment in fifteen Government Vocational Secondary
Schools (GVSSs), three pilot centralized schools, and related technical
assistance (Part ,, paras. 3.01, 3.02).
Implementation Record
2.          Except for the procurement of equipment provided by the British
ODA under the project, there are no differences in the views of the Borrower
and the Bank (para.3 of Part II). The equipment for the Boys' VTCs, which was
supplied by the Crown Agents under ODA parallel financing, was found to be
differrent from that in VTCs equipped by the MOE. In general, project
implementation proceeded according to appraisal estim.-tea. There was,
however, a significant discrepancy (Part III, Tables 4 and 5) between
estimated and actual total costs (USs 88.9m estimated vs. US$ 62.5m actual)
and loan disbursements (USS 18.8m estimated vs. US$ 13.3m actual). These
discrepancies were caused, inter alia, by (a) sharp increases in foreign
exchange rates compared with domestic inflation during project implementation,
(b) strong competition among local construction firms and (c) overestimation
of expected international price increases at appraisal.
Proiect Results and Sustainabilitv
3.          The ten GVSSs for girls operate at about two thirds of their
planned student capacity but enrollment is expected to expand to the initially
projected levels over the next few years. The principal reason for the
current shortfall seems to be the expansion of the preparatory school system
to include the 10th grade and the corresponding shortening of the secondary
level to grades 11 and 12 only.   The five GVSSs for boys also have not
realized their full student enrollment capacity and in view of the current
emphasis on industrial courses, it is doubtful whether they will meet
appraisal targets.   The three pilot centralized schools are currently used as



- iv -
regular schools, and the Government intends to open a small section of the
schools' boarding facil.ties to children from rural families.
4.          With respect to project sustainability, the future of the GVSSs
needs to be examined in the context of a broader reassessment of vocational
secondary education and' this is one of the objectives of the Human Resources
Sector Investment project (Loan 3106-Jo) which is currently under
implementation (this loan became effective in May 1990). Technical assistance
financed under the project for upgrading teachers and improving instruction in
schools will also assist in ensuring project sustainability. Moreover, a
maintenance study, financed under Loan 2890 (Education VII) recommended an
ongoing maintenance program to ensure adequate upkeep of project institutions
and the Government intends to pursue this initiative.
Lessons Learned
5.          The project experience provides the following lessons:
(a)   Project risks, including those arising from exogenous factors,
need to be identified more prudently. Specifically, the
possibility that economic growth might be reduced drastically,
thereby depressing demand for skilled workers, and also
constraining the availability of public sector resources for
education and training was not highlighted at appraisal. No
mention was made either of the risks accompanying the new concept
of centralized preparatory/secondary schools (Part I, para 8.01).
(b)   Timely supervision and continuity of project personnel are
critical during project implementation to ensure that project
components function efficiently and that cost savings are
identified expeditiously (Part I, para 8.03).

2.    Proiect Background
2-01        In early 1982, when the project was formulated, investment in
Jordan's education and training sector was a national priority. The
Government's 1981-85 Development Plan allocated the equivalent of US$ 650m to
inveetment in education and US$ 30m to investment in training (in total, about
5% of GNP).
2.02        The principal priorities of the 1981-85 Plan for Education were
to: (a) increase enrollments in secondary vocational education (grades 10-12)
to 30% of total secondary school enrollment; (b) expand the provision o1 basic
schooling (grades 1-9) to 94% (from 91%) of the corresponding age group; (c)
expand the access of children from rural families to preparatory (grades 7-9)
and secondary schools; (d) improve the quality of education by means of
adequate laboratories, equipment, teaching aids and libraries; and (e) expand
technician education (grades 13-14).
2.03        The dominant macro-economic objectives shaping these priorities
were twofold: First, it was considered that Jordan's rapidly growing and
increasingly sophisticated economy required ever increasing numbers of skilled
personnel; second, the buoyant labor markets of oil exporting countries in the
Middle East offered the opportunity for lucrative employment of Jordanian
skilled workers and, consequently, high levels of foreign exchange
remittances.



-2-
2.04        In full support of the Government's plans and basic choices, the
Bank was prepared to continue its substantial participation in Jordan's
education sector (following four previous projects in 1972-1982). It was
decided that the Bank's participation should be in the form of two operations
(Education V and Education VI), in rapid succession to each other, rather than
one larger operation. The reasons for this decision were: (a) to allow
greater flexibility to potentiti cofinanciers, in terms of timing and project
content; (b) to avoid overtaxing the implementation capacity of the Ministry
of Education; and (c) to proceed with the construction ce a number of schools
whose sites and designs were already available.
3.    Proiect Obiectives and Components
3.01        The main project objectives were to assist the Government in (a)
increasiAg the output of skilled male and female workers, (b) improving access
to preparatory and secondary education in remote rural areas, and (c)
supporting institutional development of the MOE, already begun under earlier
projects, in the areas of curriculum development, tracer studies and
information management. Moreover, the project carried the objectives of the
Fourth Education project (Loan 2068-JO) a stage further by increasing the
opportunities for providing training and the supply of skilled manpower,
particularly in rural areas and by promoting the system for tracking students
after their graduation (the tracer system).
3.02        To achieve these objectives, the project includec (a; construction
and operation c.: fifteen general vocational secondary schools (GVSS), (b)
construction and operation of three pilot centralized preparatory and
secondary level boarding schools for boys from rural areas; and (c) technical
assistance in the form of 16 man-years' of followehips and 2.5 man-years' of
specialist services. During implementation, the loan was amended (a) to
include the construction of two warehousee for temporary storage of equipment
and furniture procured under ongoing Bank financed projects; (b) to cancel
funding for teaching staff housing for project GVSSs; and (c) to cancel
funding for technical assistance, which was undertaken by UNDP following a
Government request.
4.    Proiect Desion
4.01        Despite the fact that its components were not directly related to
each other, the project had a coherent conceptual basis, in that it responded
to the main priorities of the 1981-85 Development Plan regarding investment in
education. Thus, the construction of fifteen GVSSs supported the Government's
objective to raise the proportion of vocatiornil education at the secondary
level. It also served the purpose of improving access to secondary education
for girls (ten of the fifteen schools are for girls) and for populations
outside the Amman-Zarqa metropolitan area (twelve of the fifteen schools are
located outside the capital). Also, in inc:.uding three pilot centralized



-3-
schools (with boarding facilities for children from remote areas), the project
explored new ways for acinieving near-complete coverage of baeic education
(grades 1-9) for Jordanian children, and for expanding opportunities for rural
children. Finally, the inclusion of an extensive fellowship program for
instructor training, manpower planning, and tracer study techniques addressed
the clear need for ir:reased relevance of vocational education.
5.    Proiect Implementation
5.01        Selection of the architects fcr the school designs was carried out
through an open design competition among local (private) architects. Four
firms were selected and awarded a contract by a panel representing the private
sector, the engineerf' association, the MOE and the University of Yarmouk, and
chaired by the Dean of the University of Jordan. The process, including the
signing of the contract, took about one year.
5.02        GVSSs under the project were generally well designed, constructed
a.id properly equipped and furnished. Design and construction standards were
appropriate and economical. In contrast, the centralized schools were not
efficiently designed and as a result, some sites are overdeveloped, with
unnecessary sidewalks and parking spaces. Some construction flaws have also
surfaced at these schools which have caused buildings to show evidence of
structural detexioration too early.
5.03        In order to facilitate project implementation and to minimize
procurement problems, the Bank organized a seminar on World Bank procedures
from March 22-26, 1986. The seminar, which had a positive effect on project
implenmentation, took place under the auspices of the Jordan Institute of
Public Administration, and was attended by staff of the MOE Directorate cf
Project Implementation.   Actual implementation of the physical aspects of the
project was generally satisfactory. The construction, equipping and
furnishing of all institutions was comoleted by April 30, 1988, 4.5 years
after the loan became effective on Ncvember 3, 1983   Despite site problems
(causing redesign of foundations and structural elements) and contractors'
delays, civil works components were completed only three months behind
appraisal estimates, and delivery and installation of equipment and furniture
was delayed by about six months. The project closed, as originally scheduled,
on June 30, 1988.
5.04        The TA component was considerably delayed, and was completed after
the project closed. The delays occurred, in part, because during
implementation, the Ministry of Planning asked the Bank to cancel the loan
allocation of US$ 0.9 million for the TA component, and requested instead
funding from the UNDP. Additional delays were subsequently caused by UNDP
internal procedures in making the approved funds available to the Government.
Although funding was approved on March 28, 1985 by UNDP, the contract was
signed only on August 1, 1988.  In the end, the program, involving the
upgrading of 52 teachers and MOE staff through 227 manmonths of overseas



4-
training, war successfully completed in December 31, 1989, over fotr years
behind appraisal estimates. In light of the experience gained by the MOE
under Education III and IV, the TA program, initially designed to be executed
by the Bank, was turned over to the MOE, which became the executing agency.
An Irish consulting firm (HEDCO) was selected as the main contractor for the
TA program.
6.    Project Results
The General Vocational Secondary Schools
6.01        All fifteen GVSSs are currently in operation.  The number of
students enrolled, however, is well below initial estimates (3043 in 1989/90
vs. 6220 projected in the appraisal report for full-scale operation). An
important reason for this discrepancy is the recent extension of preparatory
schools to include the 10th grade, with a corresponding shortening of the
secondary level from three to two years (grades 11 and 12).2 A second
important cause appears to be the deterior&ting economic situation, increasing
unemployment, and the reluctance of students to enroll in vocational training
programs. It is possible that a third reason for less than planned
enrollments is that due to the rather recent commencement of operation at the
project's GVSSs, the schools have not attracted all potential students from
neighboring are_: as yet.
6.02        The combination of the above factors has determined that
enrollments in boys' schools, whose planned size was double that of girls'
schools, and which offer more "vulnerable" programs, e.g., industrial trades
courses, are currently well below enrollments in girls' schools (boys: 759
actual vs. 3940 projected; girls: 2284 actual vs. 3840 projected).
6.03        The appraisal report and the Loan Agreement specified that the
GVSSe would be also used as trade training centers, offering 2-year courses to
about 1600 students yearly. This part of the project is not operating, with
the result that the facilities of project GVSSs are further underutilized.
The main reasons are that (a) the Vocational Training Corporation has become
the dominant public institution in vocational training, and (b) depressed
economic conditions after 1986 have reduced the demand for skilled labor.
6.04        In contrast to quantitative deficits as compared with appraisal
report estimates, the quality of instruction in project GVSSs appears to be
satisfactory. Teachers are well qualified, consumable materials are supplied
I The enrollment figure for 1989/90  efers to grades 11 and 12.  A few
project schools still accept 10th grade students, but this is a transitory
arrangement until 10th graders can be accommodated in neighboring preparatory
schools.



-5-
in adequate quantities despite the current difficult situation of the public
budget, and buildings are well maintained.
The Pilot Schools
6.05        The three pilot centralized preparatory/secondary schools were
completed on schedule, and have been in operation for two years. However,
they are being used only as ordinary schools serving the immediate area, to
which students have easy eccess. In this capacity, they are replacing
existing, presumably inadequate schools, and are also probably expanding
opportunities for secondary education to a limited number of students.
Boarding facilities are not operating yet, and dormitories, kitchens etc., are
unused. Furthermore, the limitation of the catchment area to the immediate
vicinity of the schools has resulted in underutilization of the teaching
facilities themselves. Thus, the total number of students in the three
schools was 1280 in 1989/90, compared with their capacity of 2500. Another
deviation from the initial concept, permitted in response to existing capacity
underutilization, has beer the admission of elementary school students (about
300 out of the 1280). Clearly, under these conditions, the Government has not
succeeded so far in establishing a model for expanding preparatory/secondary
schooling among dispersed rural communities, or even to test the one
underlying the three pilot schools.
6.06        There are two reasons why the Government has not so far opened the
schools' boarding facilities, which are the key to testing the effectiveness
of the underlying model. First, current fiscal difficulties make it difficult
to finance the subsistence of the planned 1200 boarders in the three schools.
Second, there is widespread belief among MOE officials that boarding
facilities, even if their financing could Le secured, are not enough of an
incentive to attract rural (nomadic) fanilies and their children, who for
various reasons are believed to be determined to live together, even at the
expense of necessary schooling.
6.07        Efforts are underway to utilize the schools according to their
initial purpose. A small section (say, 50 places) of boarding facilities will
be opened up in each school. Care will be taken to ensure that students come
exclusively from remote rural families. If the number of eligible applicants
is large, the MOE will try to secure the required recurrent financing despite
acute financial problema. If, on the other hand there is no significant
response, alternative uses for these schools will be sought.
6.08        Another problem facing the three schools (while they function as
ordinary local schools) is that their rather elaborate workshop and laboratory
equipment is heavily underutilized (in some cases it has not yet been used a.
all). The reasons for this are the smaller number of students than initially
planned for, and the current absence of specialized technical instructors from
the s-hools' teaching force.



-6-
7.   Proiect Sustainability
7.01        The GVSS has become a well established institution.  However, the
future of the GVSS needs to be examined in the context of a reassessment of
vocational education and training, taking account of the fact that the cost
per student of GVSS is about double that of academic secondary schools as well
as that unemployment among GVSS graduates is on the increase. This
reassessment should also consider GVSSs as part of a broader system of skill
producing institutions, including VTCs and public and private community
colleges, and with a view to avoiding duplication of efforts at a time that
available resources are severely constrained.
7.02        Regarding the three pilot centralized schools, it was noted above
that they are not being operated as envisaged at appraisal, but merely as
ordinary schools. As a result, room and board facilities are not being used,
while classroom space and equipment are heavily underutilized. For the
immediate future, MOE intends to make an effort to operate them as centralized
schools (para 6.07). Until this effort is made and the results are known, it
is uncertain whether this investment will be used to its fullest potential.
8.    Bank Performance
8.01        There was considerable optimism during project appraisal with
regard to (i) the novel concept of centralized preparatory/secondary schools;
(ii) the location of the GVSSm in small provincial towns; and (iii) the
expectation that demand for skilled workers and technicians would keep
increasing at the high rate prevailing in the late 70s and early 80s. This
optimism outweighed the risks involved.
8.02        During implementation, the Bank responded promptly to requests
from the Government to: (a) accept UNDP financing for the TA component (para
3.02), (b) install a Special Account, (c) amend the content of the project
(para 3.02), and (d) agree to the purchase of ten mobile maintenance units
with loan funds.
8.03        Project supervision by Bank staff, although carried out at regular
intervals lacked continuity of supervision personnel and was somewhat
deficient in its reporting of issues that later proved to be problematic, such
as shortcomings with regard to the construction and operation of the pilot
centralized schools and the underutilization of loan funds.
9.    Borrower Performance
9.01        Prior to loan effectiveness, MOE acted promptly in expediting all
actions necessary for project processing. All sites were acquired and
preliminary plans and equipment lists for the physical facilities were ready



prior to negotiations, so that bidding could start almost immediately after
affectiveness.
9.02        As part of the MOE's institution building efforts, the Directorate
of Project Implementation was merged in 1987 with the Directorate of School
Buildings to become the General Directorate of Projects and School Buildings
(GDPS). It has currently a total staff of about 100, half of whom are higher
level professional personnel (including 22 engineers and architects). The
GDPS has been generally effective in overall implementation of the physical
and educational aspects of the project and in maintaining liaison with the
various pr3ject entities and the Bank.
9.03        On the other hand, the benefits of having a Special Account were
not fully realized. Although an initial amount of US$2.5 million was
deposited in the Account in July 1986, by the project's Closing Date, two
years later, less than US$1.0 million was utilized and the residual amount of
about US$1.5 million was returned to the Bank.   Also, GDPS Procurement
Division personnel did not take advantage of other procurement procedures
permitted under the loan. Bidding was carried out mostly through ICB
procedures and reimbursement of almost all expenditures came directly from the
Bank through the lengthy withdrawal application procedure.
9.04        Institutional arrangements to accommodate new educational
services, e.g. evaluation/research, tracer studies and information systems,
have been put in place, but need to be improved. The MIS unit is well
staffed, but thc existing equipment (hardware) and systems are outdated and
should be upgraded on the basis of a comprehensive information needs analysis
and a coherent plan for the introduction of updated technology and information
systems.
10.   Consultant Performance
10.01       In contrast to the less than satisfactory performance of the Crown
Agents consultants in connection with the procurement of equipment for the
Boys' VTCs, the performance of the Irish consulting firm (HEDCO), selected as
the main contractor for the implementation of the project's technical
assistance program, was a positive experience.
11.   Cofinancino
11.01       The project was cofinanced by three external agencies, the Saudi
Fund, the British Overseas Development Administration (ODA) and the UNDP. The
Saudi Fund financed the local and foreign costs of the construction of eight
GVSS's in the Amman/Salt area for the total amount of US$21.5 million
(appraisal report estimate was US$22.1 million including contingencies) and
the ODA provided the equivalent of US$2.4 million (appraisal report amount
was US$3.2 million including contingencies) for the workshop equipment of five



boys GVSS's. The UNDP funds of US$0.6 million for the TA component, which
were requested by the Government after loan signing, were formally approved on
May 4, 1987 and replaced the 3ank's loan allocation (para 3.02). The Saudi
Fund and the UNDP have provided to the Bank copies of their respective
completion reports, in which both expressed their satisfaction on the
execution of their components.
12.   Compliance with Loan Covenants
12.01       Loan covenants were generally complied with satisfactorily,
although some difficulty was experienced with finalizing the refinement of the
tracer system and related studies. Progress reporting was regular and of good
quality. Year-end financial statements were routinely received in fulfillment
of the audit reporting requirement.



PART II: PROJECT REVIEW FROM BORROWER'S PERSPECTIVE
1.    Adecuacy and Accuracy of Factual Information in Part III
Information, data and defining the project profile included in
Part III were well prepared and discussed throughly both in field and on
tables. They served as the basis for tables in Part III.
2.    Bank's Performance
Bank successive missions personnel were recognized as
professionals in all respects. The mission members were always highly
qualified in their respective fields, but there were occasions when the
supervision missions visited the Kingdom in inappropriate time and, therefore,
they were not successful in addressing some kinds of implementation problems
occurring.
3.    Borrower's Performances
The performance of the participating institutions in overall was
quite good. The implementation of the Technical Assistance was accurate and
in a timely manner, and was carried out without any problem.
The implementation of procurement of equipment was not
satisfactory, especially that part concerning the British. Crown Agents,
which was not up to specifications or inadequate. This had little negative
effect on project implementation.
The implementation of the civil works was quite good and there
were no delays in their completion.
4.    Lessons Learned
1.    It is very necessary to keep the overall communications between
the Bank and the Borrower documented especially those of the
accounts, so that when any change in both sides happens, it never
affects the project implementation.
2.    The necessity of having the supervision missions' visits scheduled
beforehand so as to enable the staff in the implementation unit to
prepare information needed in advance.
