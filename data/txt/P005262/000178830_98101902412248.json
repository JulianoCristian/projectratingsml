access to secondary\n            education in remote rural areas. In addition, the project\n            would contribute to the institutional development of the\n            MOE, already initiated under the earlier Bank-financed\n            education projects. The project would include: (a)\n            constructing, equipping, and furnishing of ten general\n            vocational secondary schools for girls as well as five such\n            vocational schools and three centralized secondary schools\n            for boys; and (b) technical assistance for training\n            instructors and directors, and for strengthening MOE\n            programs of practical job experience, career guidance,\n            manpower planning, project preparation and implementation.\n            The main beneficiaries of the project are the secondary\n            school age groups who will be better prepared for\n            employment, and children from rural areas who will gain\n            access to post-primary education."}, "docdt": "1983-02-28T00:00:00Z"}
