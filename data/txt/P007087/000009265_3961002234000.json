first is a basic health care component which will\n            support the Ministry of Health (MOH)'s Basic Health\n            Care Program in extending coverage of and in improving the\n            quality of basic health care services to the poor. This\n            component is centered around maternal and child health care\n            interventions and includes: i) cost-effective health care\n            teams at local health facilities; ii) upgrading of\n            facilities; and iii) medical inputs and essential drugs on a\n            cost-recovery basis. The second is a nutrition component\n            containing subcomponents in information, dissemination, and\n            non-formal education, growth monitoring, and food\n            supplementation. Activities financed will include:\n            educational campaigns advocating good general nutrition,\n            feeding practices, and breastfeeding. Third, a basic\n            sanitation and safe water component will assist MOH in\n            improving access to safe water and sanitation facilities in\n            rural areas. Finally, a sector policy and institutional\n            strengthening component will support: (a) development of\n            institutional basis for decentralization; (b) staff\n            development; and (c) studies devoted to improved\n            inter-institutional coordination, cost recovery and payment\n            systems, hospital rehabilitation, and impact evaluation of\n            project activities and other activities in the public health sector."}, "docdt": "1992-06-29T00:00:00Z"}
