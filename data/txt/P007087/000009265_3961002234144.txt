NMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FCR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO
THE REPUBLIC OF ECUADOR
FOR A SECOND SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT - HEALTH AND NUTRITION
1.   I submit for your approval the following memorandum and reccmmendation
on a proposed loan to the Republic of Ecuador for US$70.0 million equivalent.
The proposed loan, which would finance basic health and nutrition activities,
would be repayable in 20 years, including 5 years of grace, at the Bank's
standard variable interest rate. The Government of Ecuador (GOE) would be the
borrower and the Ministry of Public Health (NOH) would be the executing
agency.
2.   Backaround.  In Ecuador, poverty remains widespread and income
distribution is highly skewed. Resources from the oil boom of the 1970s
allowed government to improve performance in the social sectors; however, the
resource constraints caused by the precipitous fall in oil prices in the 1980s
led to declines in expenditure per student and per patient. While part of the
reduction in social spending per beneficiary can be attributed to productivity
increases, there is serious concern that the quality of some social services
has been eroded. Public sector institutional capacity remains weak, with
limited progress toward better public investment programming mechanisms and
more timely program implementation.
3. The reduction of incomes that accompanied the fall in oil prices
predictably hit the poor even harder than the lower-middle income groups. The
Government in response assigned priority to significant expansion of social
programs as well as the scope of national coverage. However, in the wake of
declining federal revenues, social sector expenditures fell to 4.5 percent of
GNP in 1988 and to 4.2 percent in both 1989 and 1990. Additionally, the
rigidities that typify 8cuador's traditional budgeting process have severely
constrained the redistributive effect of the limited public social
expenditures available.
4.   Hence there was an urgent need to improve social policies and increase
public and private interest in exploring cost-effective, decentralized
approaches to provide social services to the poor. To meet this need, the
current Government created the Frente Social, comprised of ministers of the
four social sector ministries. Unfortunately, tangible progress towards
interministerial coordination has been limited; however, the approach did
encourage growth of NGOs active in poverty alleviation.
5.  Within the social sector, the Government is concentrating on remedial
measures to deal with the low quality of basic education and poor coverage of
basic health and related services. Public health programs currsntly reach only
one-third of the population with about half covered neither by public nor



private services. Moreover, about one-fourth of the populatio., mainly low-
incomte segments, lack access to potable water and about one-third to household
sanitation. Poor health status has recently been aggravated by the cholera
epidemic that has swept tnrough the region. The Government currently is
supporting a series of programs that address education and health sector
issues, including: (a) a Basic Education Quality Improvement Program; (b) the
vocational training Proarama de Capacitacifn Popular; and (c) a Basic Health
Care Program that incorporates a strong mother-and-child health care component
as well as family planning and nutrition activities, the latter under the
Programa de Alimentaci6n v Nutrici6n.
6.   A key aspect of the Government's efforts to address health sector
priorities and increase coverage of basic health services among the poor is to
deliver the required inputs through decentralized local networks. Pilot
health areas have been established, partially financed under World Bank PPP
110-EC and PPF 110-1-8C. The Government now seeks Bank assistance for a
project that would extend the system to provide services to two million poor.
7.   Rationale for Bank Involvement. The Bank strategy in Ecuador includes in
its core lending program a set of projects targeted on poverty alleviation in
the social sectors. The projects comprise a three-pronged social sector
program, incorporating operations in education, health, and social welfare to
strengthen social development in Ecuador. The program is an integral part of
the Bank assistance strategy for Ecuador agreed with the Government supporting
structural adjustment and poverty alleviation elaborated in Bank sector report
8935-BC. The first World Bank Loan (3425-BC) in the education and training
area is already underway. This second project builds on the recommendations
of the Bank report 8935-EC, as well as the Bank-supported health sector study
done in 1986. Its objective is to improve coverage and quality of basic health
care for the poor. Also addressed are the compelling issues of equity and
access of the poor to essential social services. The project is also designed
to strengthen related public sector management and decision-making programs,
the keystone of the Bank's overall country strate3y.
8.   Lessons from Past Experience.  Experience with health sector projects
elsewhere and with projects in various sectors in Ecuador has shown that
implementation delays occurred mainly because of inadequate and delayed
provision of counterpart funds (exacerbated by lack of attention to sectoral
financing) and to weak management. Successful Bank-financed basic health-care
projects have had significant built-in flexibility. In this respect, the                 4
project design incorporates a gradual incremental implementation approach.
Design of each component has been kept simple, consistent with project
objectives of promoting safe motherhood (including family planning), and
addressing nutrition and water and sanitation issues. The proposed project is
designed to achieve fundamental improvements in the welfare of women and
children. Key activities have been included that address these issues and are
discussed below (paras. 10, 12-15 and 17).
9.   Proiect Obiectives.  This second part of the Bank's three-part social
sector program supports the Government's planned development and investment
programs for expanding and strengthening basic health services programs,



-3
including nutrition and basic sanitation. It aims to: (a) expand basic health
care, including nutrition and water &td sanitation coverage, to reach the
poorest populations; (b) improve the quality of basic health-care services
already provided to the poor; and (c) strengthen decision-making and
management of public institutions involved in the delivery of basic health,
nutrition, and water and sanitation programs.
10. Prolect Descriotion. The proposed project has four components. The
first covers basic health care (68 percent of total project costs), and would
support the Basic Health Care Program of the KOH and Local Health Systems in
extending coverage to about two million of the poorest, as well as improve the
quality of basic health-care services to which the poor already have access.
This component foeuses on maternal and child health-care programs that
incorporate family planning, with financing for: (a) cost-effective health-
care teams at health posts, health centers, and first-tier hospitals,
including outreach processes; (b) construction and upgrading of physical
facilities, including basic equipment; and (c) crucial medical inputs and
pharmaceuticals on a cost-recovery basis. A decentralized network will be
used for delivery of health-care services and mobilizing community and NGO
participation in selected activities to enhance program cost-effectiveness.
The nutrition component (6 percent of total project costs) comprises: (a)
educational campaigns advocating improved nutrition, better feeding practices,
and breast-feeding; (b) expanded coverage of growth monitoring for children
under age 3, and expanded coverage of prenatal care and corrective measures
for substandard cases; and (c) targeted supplementary food distribution for
low-income mothers and children participating in basic health care programs,
plus a micronutrient program with emphasis on iron deficiency. A third
component, bagsic sanitation and safe water (13 percent of total project
costs), would help MOH organize sustainable systems for water and sanitation
services (mostly latrines) involving community organizations in rural areas.
Due to lack of previous experience, this would be a pilot program with
coverage restricted to about one-tenth of the potential target population.
The sector 2olicv and institutional develooment component (13 percent of total
project costs) supports: (a) development of institutional bases for
decentralization, including budget programming and management information
systems; (b) sector staff development; and (c) studies to identify priority
istues and evaluate the impact of sector activities.
11. Total project costs are estimated at US$95.7 million equivalent (net of
taxes and duties), with a foreign exchange component of US$31.4 mll2ion
(32.81). The proposed loan of US$70 million would finance 73% of total
project costs, while US$31.7 million would be provided by GOB and the direct
beneficiaries (UDP wold cofinance US$O.S million for technical assistance
expenditures). The project provides for retroactive financing of up to US$5
million equivalent to cover eligible expenditures from January 24, 1992 to the
date of loan signing. A breakdown of costs and the fiancing plan appeW  in
Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procuremnt and disbursements as well as
the disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key project
processing events and the status of Bank Group operations in Ucuador are given
in Schedules C and D, respectively. The Staff Appraisal Report, Mo. 10486-IC,
is also attached.



12. The Borrower would be GOE. aTe proceeds of the loan would be disbursed
over seven years. The project would be implentented through existing
organizational structures in MOM supported by a Project Coordination Unit
(PCU). The PCU would submit to the Bank semi-annual reports with data on
physical and financial progrjss. In addition, an annual project
implementation review would be carried out between the Bank and GOB to assess
project progress, resource management, sector performance and provide the
basis for the forthcoming year's annual operational plan. A comprehensive
mid-project review would take advantage of the project's built-in flexibility
to fine tune the project after the third year of project implementation.
13.   Actions Agreed.  During anMraisal the Government provided evidence that
issues related to project sustainability were being addressed, espbcialny the
substantial percentage of MOH budget (12 percent by the time of project
completion) allocated to corer project incremental recurrent costs. The
Government has established the Directorate of Basic Health Care Services and
Local Health Service Areas and the Project Coordination Unit and has provided
evidence that project teams are operational.
14. During neaotiations, the Government agreed to: (a) annual programs and
timetables for levels of new and redeployed staff; (b) use the loan's proceeds
to finance only generic druas included on the country's basic drug list; study
drug distribution and prices, and after review with the Bank, recommend
appropriate actions; (c) carry out recommendations of a food suDolementation
program study; take measures to involve the private sector in operating the
food production plant based on a prefeasibility study; agree on a timetable
for evaluating micronutrient supplementation along with joint review of the
evaluation; (d) water and sanitation--implement preliminary designs for water
systems slated for the first project year; implement recommendations of the
sanitation sector institutional study and evaluate models for provincial
trials; establish cost-recovery mechanisms for water and sanitation programs;
choose communities for the first project year and set selection criteria for
the remaining years; (e) institutional stren&thenina--complete timetables for
developing and establishing each of the MIS subsystems; carry out studies
under the policy and institutional strengthening component and implement
recommendations under agreed timetables; (f) exoenditure and imnlementation
reviews--carry out Government/Bank annual review of the MOH budget and project
expenditures for the next year in the third quarter of the previous year.
During the budget review, the Government would provide assurances that: (i)
the expenditures allocated annually to basic public health programs will cover
the project costs, including incremental recurrent expenses on an increasing
basis, without falling below the level they had in year 1991, and (ii) if it
wishes to undertake an expanded MDN basic health care program, it will
allocate thp additional resourceb  needed; (g) the precimn  staffing of the PCU;
(h) audits conducted by an independent auditor acceptable to the Bank; and (i)
targets and indicators of project activities included in the monitoring plan.
15. The following are conditions of Loan Iffectiveness: a procurement agent
and technical assistance management agents contracted, including an agreement
signed with UNDP to implement the technical assistance and training program of
the basic sanitation component.



5 -
16.  B=Iits.  The proposed proje_t would help alleviate poverty into the
medium term and increase human capital accumulation among the poor, thus
improving the country's human capital stock and strengthening the bases for
economic development. The impact on improved sector policy would be
substantial. At the policy level, the project would support a new approach to
basic health care, nutrition, and sanitation and water programs. In addition,
the project would improve the efficiency of public resource use by
strengthening the Ministry of Health's planning and budgeting process,
including its main autonomous agencies, IEOS and CEM.IM, as well as its
implementation capacity, and offering sector-level support necessary for the
overall macroeconomic budget reform measures underway. These processes would
be reinforced through introducing the practice of affordable cost-recovery
mechanisms and impact evaluation.
17. Riskg and Safeauards. The main risk derives from poor implementation
capacity by the Ministry of Health. This problem could be aggravated by the
change of government in 1992. The project components basically have a poverty
alleviation focus and as such should enjoy continued popular and political
support despite a change in administration. Intensive supervision will be
maintained during the political transition to ensure clear understanding of a
conuitment to sustain the project. The project design incorporates special
features to overcome implementation problems, including: a decentralized
management network for basic health care services; use of experience gained
while managing Bank PPFs; contracting with specialized international agencies
to manage procurement and technical assistance; assuring incorporation of
counterpart funding of recurrent expenditures in the national budget beginning
in 1992; introducing cost-recovery schemes and managing proceeds in a
decentralized system; and establishing direct ties with communities to
encourage local ownership and strengthen implementation.
18. Recmmendai2g. I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with
the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed loan.
