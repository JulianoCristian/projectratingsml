development program, the project would help remove some\n            existing capacity constraints of the railway network,\n            particularly in linking the mines of Shanxi province to\n            major industrial centers and ports in Eastern China. The\n            infrastructure features of the project would cover two\n            railway lines (Xinxiang to Yanzhou and Datong to Taiyuan)\n            and would include: (i) laying of single and double track;\n            (ii) construction of a bridge, connections to other lines\n            and yards, and additional crossing stations; (iii)\n            lengthening of existing stations; (iv) line electrification;\n            and (v) other upgrading work. Through provision of\n            equipment, technical assistance and training, the project\n            would also assist the Ministry of Railways in expanding and\n            improving electric locomotive production. The project is\n            expected to contribute to the Government's overall plan\n            for increased energy supply to support economic development\n            in China."}, "docdt": "1984-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
