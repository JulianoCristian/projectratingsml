                              RESTRUCTURING PAPER


  A. SUMMARY

1.       In its letters dated February 27, 2012 and April 27, 2012, the Government of
Madagascar has requested to restructure the Madagascar Transport Infrastructure
Investment Project (P082806, Credit 38360-MAG and Credit 38361-MAG) to: (i) extend
the closing date to allow completion of activities that got delayed due to the political
crisis; and (ii) reallocate the projects’ proceeds to use up the credits’ remaining funds
(US$852,361.28) to finance some additional activities. The borrower has also requested
to include a disbursement grace period to enable the payment of eligible expenditures up
to four months after the project’s closing date. However, due to the very limited amount
of undisbursed funds, the Bank would only consider the project fund’s reallocation
proceed and deal with the disbursement grace period in a separate letter to the Borrower.


  B. PROJECT STATUS

2.       The credit constitutes the third phase of an Adaptable Program Loan. The initial
credit in the amount of Special Drawing Rights (SDR) 104,400,000 (US$150 million
equivalent) was approved on December 8, 2003 and became effective on March 10, 2004.
The project’s Additional Financing, in the amount of SDR 10,400,000 (US$15.6 million
equivalent) was approved on May 22, 2007 and became effective on August 31, 2007.

3.        The Project’s Development Objective (PDO) is to assist the Recipient in the
rehabilitation of its major transport infrastructure in order to reduce transport cost and to
facilitate trade. The project allowed the Recipient to finance key transport infrastructure,
including the following activities:
     The periodic maintenance of the country’s two most trafficked routes (National
         Road (RN) 2 and RN7);
     The rehabilitation and extension of the port of Mahajanga;
     The rehabilitation of four main lighthouses and coastal navigation aids to help
         make the country compliant with the IMO-MARPOL convention (the
         International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships, which was
         adopted at International Maritime Organization);
     The rehabilitation of the country’s main international airports (Ivato and Nosy
         Be);
     The rehabilitation and maintenance of consistent portions of the Northern railway
         line.

4.      From an institutional point of view, thanks to the project and the three phases
APL, the Recipient was able to:
                                             6
      help the Government to implement its divestiture policy through institutional
       reforms and the creation of key regulatory entities in each sub-sector (the Civil
       Aviation Authority (ACM); the Port and Maritime Authority (APMF), and the
       Land Transport Authority (ATT));
      finance the social plan for the redeployment of more than 50 percent of the
       Ministries in charge of Public Works and Transport; and,
      keep the railway concessionaire of the Northern Network afloat, re-creating a
       competition between rail and road.

5.       The project’s progress towards the achievement of its PDO is rated Satisfactory,
and the PDO is still fully relevant and attainable. Overall, the key project indicators have
been achieved, especially regarding increased traffic through improved transport
infrastructure. Likewise, the objective to rehabilitate 4,045 km of RN with the support of
all the Development Partners has been exceeded since 5,079 km of RN were rehabilitated
by early 2010, which is after the beginning of the current political crisis. For the railways
component, operational and financial indicators have been improving along the years
thanks to the project’s investments on the northern railway network infrastructures.

6.     As of June 21, 2012, the initial credit had disbursed SDR103.85 million
(US$158.03 million equivalent) i.e. 99.47 percent of its total amount, and the additional
financing has disbursed SDR10.39 million (US$15.81 million equivalent) or 99.92
percent of its amount.


  C. PROPOSED CHANGES


Reallocation of project’s proceeds

7.       The Credit’s earlier undisbursed funds, now amounting US$ 852,361.28, are
being used as follows: (i) resumption of earlier suspended contracts (the periodic
maintenance of the RN2, the rehabilitation works at the port of Toliary to assist it in
achieving International Ship and Port Security code (ISPS) compliant status; and study
for the reconstruction of the Manakarabe bridge); and (ii) additional activities that are
compliant with the credit’s PDO and would help the government to get prepared on
priorities to be addressed when the Bank operations would resume normally, as described
in the section related to the proposed changes below.

8.      Road Maintenance Fund Audit. The scheduled audit of the Road Maintenance
Fund is a continuation of similar audits carried out for previous exercises (2006 to 2008),
financed under the Madagascar Rural Transport Project (APL2), and is aimed at
reviewing the key technical and financial issues that requires significant improvements.
Based on the results of the previous audits, many recommendations have been suggested
(regarding the appointment of the General Secretary; the definition of transparent criteria
of their works program prioritization; the control of the placement and utilization of the
collected funds; the control of the work quality; the standardization of the payment
procedure and delay of payment of the contractors; etc.), but most of them do not seem to
                                             7
have been implemented nor monitored due to the political crisis. Therefore, the audit
would help to further assess the impact of the current crisis on the long term
sustainability and governance of the Road Maintenance Fund.

9.      Payment of salary arrears to Road Authority. The same financing and
sustainability concerns exists with the Road Authority (RA or ARM, Autorité Routière de
Madagascar), as the emoluments of its agents have not been paid since November 2011.
The Bank and the other Development Partners used to contribute to the RA’s set-up and
financing. Therefore, to reduce the financial pressure on Ministry of Public Works and
Meteorology’s (MPWM) budget, it has been agreed that the RA’s agents’ salary from
December 2011 to June 2012 would be paid from the proceeds on the Credit, and that an
audit of such salary payments be carried out to ensure payment.

10.     Update of road network data. As there was a loss of reliable data on the country’s
road network condition, it has been decided to update such data in order to know the
exact length of the network as well as their real condition (i.e. in good, fair and poor
condition). This review has been undertaken by the RA and the Ministry’s agents and is
progressing well. The results, which are expected to be completed by July 2012, will be
used as a new database for the Government and the Donors. Since there is a very strong
ownership of this activity from the agents in charge of the study, it is expected that they
will continue updating the road condition surveys to present a true picture of its
condition.

11.    Reallocation of Credit proceeds for MADRAIL. Regarding the railways
component, Madarail undertook using its own funds, emergency works on two metal
bridges (respectively located at PK 350+395 and PK 356+520) which were scheduled to
be rehabilitated by the Credit and is requesting the reimbursement of such works by the
Government, through the railways investment fund. Regarding the rehabilitation of
Andasibe rail station, it has been considered as a second priority, compared to priorities
in the rail track replacement and operating costs needs, and this activity will be
discontinued. Therefore, the Government is requesting the allocation of the remaining
funds under the Credits Additional financing from Works category to Goods, Consultant
Services, and Operating Costs category.

12.     Based on the above-mentioned scheduled activities, the revised new reallocation
table, to replace the allocation table contained in the respective Financing Agreements is
as presented in Annex 2. With the insertion of additional activities and the revised project
costs would change as follows:

15.      A grace period of four months after the closing date, June 30, 2012, is also being
requested to allow for the payment of eligible expenditures incurred after the project’s
closing date.


Revised project’s implementation schedule and procurement plan

16.      The project’s implementation schedule has been revised as per the new action
plan attached to this restructuring package. The following activities are on-going and are
scheduled to be completed by the end of this calendar year: the suspended activities
which have resumed (works on the port of Toliary; works on RN2; feasibility study for
the bridge of Manakarabe) as well as the audit/ review of the Road Authority’s salary
policy, the payment of its staff salary (until June 2012), and the update of the roads’
network status. Those activities that cannot be completed by the current closing date
(such as the technical and financial audits of the RMF) will be dropped and can be
considered under the new multisectorial infrastructure project which is being set up.


Results indicators

17.     The results framework and performance target indicators have been updated for
the railway component to reflect the new target values. Minor changes will be made in
the Monitoring and Evaluation framework to ensure measurability, inclusion of core
sector indicators and revision of targets where appropriate. See Annex 1 for details.
