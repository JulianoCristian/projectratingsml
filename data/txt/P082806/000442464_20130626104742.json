Infrastructure\n            Investment Project (TIIP) for Madagascar were as follows:\n            outcomes were moderately satisfactory, risk to development\n            outcome was high, Bank performance was moderately\n            satisfactory, and Borrower performance was moderately\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: two of the\n            reasons why the transport sector reforms in general and the\n            ports and airports concession in particular were not\n            entirely successful were: (i) the high-level political\n            interference in the sector, and (ii) the overambitious\n            target to concession all the ports and airports in the\n            country. The instability risk raises the question about the\n            adequacy of the Adaptable Program Loan (APL) instruments\n            which were designed to support a long-term transport sector\n            transformational agenda. The choice of the Project\n            Development Objective (PDO) indicators should take into\n            account the type of data which can be collected during\n            implementation. The Monitoring and Evaluation (M and E)\n            system of the TIIP did not make clear distinction between\n            the achievements under: (a) the standalone project; (b) the\n            APL series; and (c) the government long-term program. As a\n            result, it was not easy to assess the achievements, the\n            outcomes and the impacts of the project. Some sections had\n            to be rehabilitated or reconstructed contributing to a\n            higher cost than anticipated. Proactivity and innovation\n            during project implementation are necessary to adapting to\n            an ever changing environment. While supporting railway\n            concession, ensure enabling environment and fair intermodal competition."}, "docdt": "2013-06-20T00:00:00Z"}
