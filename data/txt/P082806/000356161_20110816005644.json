The additional activities are unlikely to\n            require any change in the project objective. The extension\n            of the closing date is being processed as a level two\n            restructuring, requiring the Vice President's approval\n            since it involves a cumulative extension of the closing date\n            of more than two years from the original closing date. This\n            extension will allow for: 1) the completion of the suspended\n            works contracts as a result of the disbursement freeze due\n            to the crisis, in order to reinforce the outcome of our\n            investments in railways infrastructure; 2) the payment of\n            arrears for works, goods, and services for contracts\n            committed after March 17, 2009, and whose corresponding\n            services have been duly completed, and 3) the use of the\n            remaining funds of SDR2.87 millions, after the payment of\n            the two above-mentioned items, to finance transport\n            equipment and infrastructure, for unfinished road surface\n            layer, slope stabilizations, and some consultancy services."}, "docdt": "2011-08-10T00:00:00Z"}
