satisfactory,\n            sustainability likely, though institutional development\n            impacts were only modest. Lessons learned are addressed as\n            follows. First, lessons for project preparation indicate\n            that although the project was not featured in the Country\n            Assistance Strategy (needing additional funding allocation\n            from the International Development Association (IDA) because\n            of the civil conflict, it was nonetheless successfully\n            implemented given its relief type lending, where assistance\n            from Bank staff, provided strong inputs, even in the absence\n            of a sector development strategy. However, a project such as\n            this one, designed as a quick relief operation, should\n            include sufficient activities for the physical outputs, and\n            address capacity issues to ensure sustainability;\n            additionally, arrangements for the road fund should have\n            been made under the project, with assistance to be\n            undertaken from the private sector. Second, as for project\n            implementation, recommendations suggest that sound\n            accounting, and financial management systems should have\n            been included, to avoid irreconcilable difficulties of\n            project accounts. Third, as per a post conflict assistance,\n            it is paramount to count on political stability, or to be\n            able to minimize claims due to force majeure, the absence of\n            which delayed the resumption of some project activities,\n            which are still unsettled."}, "docdt": "2001-12-27T00:00:00Z"}
