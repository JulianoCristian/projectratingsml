These six city center markets provide water\n            supply, toilet and ablution facilities. Garbage collection,\n            disposal facilities, solid waste operations and repairs are\n            being added to market building structures. The project\n            rehabilitates and upgrades access roads to the project area,\n            as well as, the improvement of the Government of Sierra\n            Leone's (GVWC) water supply system and operations by\n            reducing water leakage through a metering and connection\n            program. The institutional capabilities of the Sierra Leone\n            Roads Authority (SLRA) to manage and coordinate this project\n            is being strengthened. Technical assistance and coordinated\n            studies are in place to address longer-term issues of\n            infrastructural development in Greater Freetown. Financial\n            review of the Freetown City Council (FCC) and city traffic\n            management is also necessary."}, "docdt": "1993-05-11T00:00:00Z"}
