MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INRNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDff
TO THE REPUBLIC OF SIERRA LEONE
FOR  H  FREETQWN INFRASTRUCTURE REHABILITATION PRO.ECT
1.    I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the Republic of Sierra Leone for SDR 18.4 million, the equivalent of
US$26.0 million, on standard IDA terms with a maturity of 40 years to help finance the
Freetown Infrastructure Rehabilitation Project (FIRP). Out of the Credit, the equivalent of
US$7.0 million would be onlent to the Guma Valley Water Company (GVWC) for 20 years
including 5 years of grace at the prevailing IBRD interest rate, with GVWC bearing the
foreign exchange risk. The remaining balance of US$19.0 million would be made available
to the Sierra Leone Roads Authority (SLRA) as grant.
2.    Barkgund. Sierra Leone had a population of 4.1 million in 1990, growing at a rate
of 2.4 percent per annum. The urban population (1.3 million) accounts for 32 percent of the
total, and is growing at about 4.5 percent per annum, almost twice the national average. If
these trends continue, by the year 2,000 the urban population will almost double, and will
then represent about 39 percent of the national total. Freetown is the largest city, with a
population of some 600,000 in 1990. It accounts for about one half of the urban population.
By the year 2,000, the City's population is expected to at least double, particularly if the
hoslity in the eastern region continues to add to rural-urban migration pressures. Ihis
growth will place severe stress on the already overburdened urban institutions, infrastructure
and services.
3.    With a per capita income of US$240 in 1991, Sierra Leone is classified by the UN as
being among the "least developedn countries. The downturn in the economy since the mid-
1970s, brought on partly by external shocks due to the oil crisis, coupled with poor economic
management in the 1980s, put a heavy toll on urban infrastructure and services. These are
now in an advanced state of disrepair, with little attention being paid to regular maintenance.
Given the already low levels of infrastructure provision and service delivery and the
anticipated high level of population growth over the next decade, the physical and institutional
problems need to be urgently addressed, especially if the urban areas are to make an effective
contribution to the Government's current efforts to restructure the economy.
4.    A brief summary of the key infrastructure and related institutional issues in Freetown
is as follows: (a) Road: (i) the network, which is managed by the semi-autonomous Sierra
Leone Roads Authority (SLRA), comprises about 118 km of predominantly asphalted roads in
a state of disrepair, particularly in the Central Business District (CBD) and the surrounding
high density low income residential areas; (ii) the CBD is heavfly congested due to a lack of
transportation planning, management and road network maintenance; (b) DIaingM: (i) the
system is in general need of maenanc and rehabilitation; (U) in the absence of adequate
solid waste management and domestic sanitation, it has become the dumping ground for
garbage, fecal matter and other debris washed down from the surrounding hilsides; (c) Wat.
Suw1y: (J) water is provided by a fairly effective parastatal, the Guma Valley Water
Company (GVWC); (ii) there is adequate bulk water, but capacity of trunk and distribution
mains is inadequate, resulting in low pressures and unreliable service in some areas; (iii) the
level of unaccounted-for-water is high due to significant network leakages; (iv) although water
rates were raised five times during the past four years, current rates based on property values



2
for domestic consumers who are non-metered are still Inadequate, particularly in light of
massive devaluations of the Leone over the years; (d) Solid Waste Mana  : (i) the
system, originally established with bilateral assistance, is in need of major equipment overhaul
and restructuring; (ii) collection is being carried out by private contractor but performance is
poor due pardy to the irregularity of payments to the contractor by the Government; (e)
Domestic Sanitatio: (i) since only part of CBD is sewered, most of city relies on a
combination of septic tanks, pit latrines, bucket latrines, or has no disposal method, resulting
in eavironmental degradation and serious health risks; (t) Markets and Abattoirs: (i) these
facilities are generally overcrowded, dilapidated, and lacking adequate access, sanitation and
drainage; (ii) cost recovery is inadequate; (g) Municpal Magen: (i) of Freetown City
Council (FCC) is generally very weak with little urban management or maintenance work
being undertaken; (ii) the city is relatively self-sufficient financially, although at very low
levels of infrastructure maintenance and development and service delivery; (iii) the
accounting, financial planning budgeting, and billing and collection systems are inadequate.
S.    Prolect Objectives. The primary objective of the project is to improve the
infrastructure in Greater Freetown, with special regard for the mest disadvantaged of the
urban poor in the city. It would also improve sustainability of such infrastructure by
strengthening the technical and financial capacities of the agencies responsible for operating
and mainning new facilities and for planning and managing future investment programs.
6.    Sroect Dsscription. The proposed project comprises five components: (O) jJ.
ilpgrnding: (I) Impoen of D=Iyed Setlements: Six community/slum areas exhibiting
the worst conditions in Freetown have been selected for upgrading, including Krootown/Kroo
Bay, Mabella, Susan's Bay, Congo Market, Brookfields and Ginger Hall. Upgrading
measures to be provided include the provision of roads and footpaths, water supply, sanitary
facilities, drainage and solid waste disposal; (i) Market Improvement: The project would
improve the conditions at six of the busiest city center markets (Krootown Road Market,
Smythe Street Market, Kennedy Street/ Kissy Road Market, Garrison Street Market, Guard
Street Market and Aba.toir, and Bombay Street Market) which are unhygienic, overcrowded
and severely dilapidated; (iii) SolidWaste Managen: Acquisition of 50 garbage
containers to be sited within thb project upgrading and market areas, 2 skip trucks and
required transport vehicles to support the monitoring unit of the Department of Health and
Social Services (DOHSS); (11) RehabilitagnLUgrding of Access Roads: Tle road
component will mainy provide access to deprived areas and markets selected for upgrading;
(R) Water &uppi: This component is aimed at optmizing the capacity of the existing water
supply system and improving the financial and management capacity of the GVWC and
consists of carrying out a leak detection and repair program to reduce system losses, a
universal metering program and equipment to improve the company's operations and
accounting and billing systems; (IV) Institutional Support: (i) To SLRA: Provision of the
services of a Project Manager to head the Project Management and Coordination Unit
(PMCUIFIRP) already established within SLRA for project implementation; and (ii) o FCC:
Provision of the services of a municipal engineer ^nd equipment to establish a maintenance
capability within FCC; and (V) Techncal Assistance   luding consulting services to carry
out studies for solid waste management, traffic management, water supply, storm drainage
and sewerage, organizational and financial review of FCC, structure plan for Greater
Freetown, feasibility studies for the rehabilitationl upgrading of infrastructure in the other
major urban centers in Sierra Leone as well as for engineering design and construction
supervision for the various project components.

7.    The project cost including contingencies, duties and taxes is estimated at US$36.0
million equivalent of which US$20.8 million is in foreign currency. IDA would finance
US$26.0 million, which amounts to about 90% of the project cost excluding duties and taxes.
A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and
methods of procurement and disbursement schedule are shown in Scheduie B. A timetable of
key project processing events and the status of Bank Group operations are given in Schedules
C and D, respectively. Maps are also attached. The Staff Appraisal Report No. 11791-SL,
dated May 11, 1993, is being distributed separately.
S.    Pro jectImplementation. GVWC would be responsible for implementing the water
supply component including the facilities, mainly standpipes, in the urban community
upgrading and market areas. For the remaining project components, since FCC's technical
capacity is virtually non-existent and there is a need to manage and coordinate closely the
various project activities, it has been agreed with the Government and the entities concerned
that SLRA, one of the project beneficiaries, will be the implementing agency. SLRA, also a
beneficiary of an ongoing IDA-financed Road Rehabilitation and Maintenance Project, has a
capable top management which has demonstrated its effectiveness in coordinaLing the
preparation of the proposed project. Thus, SLRA would be responsible for implementing the
urban roads and drainage component, the urban upgrading and market improvement
components on behalf of FCC, and the solid waste project sub-component on behalf of
DOHSS. FCC would be responsible for establishing a maintenance capability (Maintenace
Unit) within its City Engineer's Department and for involving the affected communities in the
project and sustaining the involvement and interest of community residents. DOHSS would
ensure that the solid waste disposal facilities provided under the project would be properly
operated and maintained by a suitable private contractor.
9.    Project Sustainabili. In view of the institutional weaknesses of the sectoral entities,
especially FCC, sustainability of urban infrastructure in Freetown is a long-term goal. As a
first step, the project is aimed at developing institutional capacity in the agencies involved,
particularly FCC, through the establishment of a maintenance capability and other measures
that would arise from the organizational and financial review (para. 6). The pi ject would
ensure the sustainability of the urban upgrading and ruad components by establishing a
maintenance capability within FCC to carry out day-to-day maintenance of these facilities, awd
by educating the communities involved on the proper use of such facilities through local
NGOs' ongoing community development programs. Funding for this Unit's recurrent
expenditures will be provided mainly from FCC's general revenues, although allocations for
materials will be available from a road fund managed by SLRA, which was set up to finance,
inter alia, the maintenance of the road network in the country. As a commercial utility to be
modernized as part of the project, GVWC would maintain adequate water tariffs to properly
operate and maintain its water supply system, including those provided under the project.
10.   Lessons from Previous Bank/IDA Involvement. The proposed project would be the
first Bank/IDA urban development operation in Sierra Leone. In the related roads/highway
sector, the PPARlPCRs cited certain relevant main lessons, including (i) a specific list of
roads should be agreed during negotiations and included in the credit agreement; (ii) provision
should be made for adequate local currency funding; and (ii) supervision by IDA should be
frequent with required performance defined in an agreed action plan. These lessons have
been incorporated in the proposed project design and supervision plan.

11.   Assistance Strategy and Rationale for IDA Involvement. The Bank's main objectives
in Sierra Leone are to promote a sustained supply response and poverty reduction. To these
ends, the strategy gives priority to assisting the Government to (i) re-establish the
macroeconomic stability; (ii) restore physical and social infrastructure (power, water supply,
the road network, health and education) to serviceable levels; and (iii) rebuild management
and administrative capacity throughout the public sector, via technical assistance, inter alia.
By focussing on upgrading the aes of exreme urban poverty, improving urban services, and
creating job opportnities, the project would help relieve urban poverty. It would directly
improve physical infrastructure. Bank policy for urban development stresses the need for
basic ifrastructure to support urban economic growth, to alleviate urban poverty and to
improve the urban environment. These objectives are central to the proposed project. Given
IDA's experience with similar projects elsewhere, it is best placed to assist the Government in
this undertaking.
12.   Agred Acins: Agreements reached with the Government, FCC and SLRA include:
(a) an orgaizational and financial review of FCC will be completed by December 31, 1993;
(b) a structure plan for Greater Freetown will be completed by September 30, 1994; (c) a
solid waste sector review for Greater Freetown will be completed by March 31, 1994; (i) a
traffic management study will be completed by December 31, 1994; (e) subject to the findings
and recommendation of the organizational and financial review of FCC, FCC will establisii
the Mai;tnance Unit and appoint the Municipal Engineer by January 31, 1994; (f) the
Government will establish a project account with an initial deposit of Le 200 mii.icn; (g)
SLRA will appoint the Engineer/Procurement Specialist and Project Accountant of the
PMCU/FIRP by June 30, 1993 and appoint the Assistant Project Manager by July 31, 1993;
Qi) FCC will implement the agreed action plan to involve the residents of the affected
communJities during the implementation of the project; (i) DOHSS will ensure that the solid
waste collection and disposal facilities be properly operated and maintained, and that the
project areas would be serviced satisfactorily; () annual project reviews will be held annually
fiom the date of credit effectiveness; (k) FCC/SLRA/the Government will implement the
agreed action plans for the relocation of affected people by October 31, 1993; () SLRAIFCC/
the Government will carry out the agreed plan for the mitigation of potential environment
harm during the course of project execution; and (m) SLRA will have the project accounts,
special account and statement of expenditures audited annually by independent auditors
acceptable to IDA. Agreements have been reached with GVWC that: (a) it will raise water
charges for non-metered domestic consumers to Le 20 o. rateable value by November 1,
1993; implement a new tariff structure based on metered consumption effective November 1,
1994 and adjust tariffs from time to time to enable the company to earn a rate of return on
average revalued net fixed assets in operations of not less than 2% in 1994/95,3% in
1995196,5% in 1996/97,7% in 1997198, and 8% in 1998199 and thereafter; (b) GVWC's
accounts will be audited annually and will be submitted to IDA within 6 months after year
end, and such accounts and audits will also include the project accounts, special account and
statement of expenditures; (c) it will revalue its assets annually beginning with its financial
year 1993/94; and (d) it will maintain a debt service coverage ratio of at least 1.5.
13.   Conditions of credit effectiveness are: (a) The Government will execute the
subsidiary loan agreement with GVWC which is satisfactory to IDA; (b) The Government will
establish a Project account with an initial deposit of Le 200 million; (c) SLRA will appoint
the Engineer/Procurement Specialist, the Project Accountant and the Assistant Project
Manager of the PMCUIFIRP; and (d) The Government and GVWC will execute the agreed
financial package involving debt restructuring and payment of arrears on water billings owed



$
by Government departments. The establishment of the Maintenance Unit and appointment of
the Municipal Engineer by FCC will be conditions for disbusemegnt against the equipment
and materials for the Unit.
14.   En!iYUM r 6speeSts. Since theproect consists ma6y of improving and
rehabilitating exisdn water supplies, roads, drins, solid waste management and domestic
staton, the gener environment impact will be positive. Since there are    etain conces
including the temporary disruptions during construction as well as the need to relocate some
dwellings in one of the six slum areas and in one of the six market areas, an environmental
impact assessment and a mitigation plan have been prepared.
15.   With respect to the relocation of persons affected by project implementation, the
Government policy is to ensure (i) that as few people as possible are displaced by Project
activities; (ii) that they should not be worse off as a result of Project implementation; and (iii)
that relocatees are able to share in Project benefits. The Government confirmed during
negotiations (i) that relocations wiUl be required in Kroo Bay and Bombay Street Market areas;
Ci) that the Government has set aside adequate funds to cover all anticipated costs of
relocation of affected dwellers (65) in Kroo Bay including compensation for loss of assets,
removal expenses and cost of provision of alternative accommodation; (Oil and that two areas
of Government land in the Kroo Bay area have been set aside for the relocatees which will
allow them to benefit from the Project. In addition, it confirmed that the FCC has discussed
with and made available to the affected persons (16) in the Bombay Street Market area the
options of (I) provision of rental accommodation to be rent-free for one year, (ii) allocation of
unit(s) at the Kissy low-cost housing project, and (iii) allocation of plot(s) of Government land
on a site and service basis, and that FCC has set aside adequate funds to cover any of the
above options. Ihe agreed action plans for the relocations at Kroo Bay and Bombay Street
Market wiUl be completed by October 31, 1993 to the satisfaction of IDA.
16.   Ergram QbJectiveCates: The project would help reduce urban poverty by
improving essential services which benefit the poor, and by creating lower-level construction
jobs. Improvement of markets would especially benefit low-income women who
predominandy patronize these facilities and services. Also, environmental improvements fcrm
the core of project design.
*             17.   Proiect Benefits. The project will provide essential infrastructure to support economic
growth in Greater Freetown and particularly to improve living conditions of low-income
households. The community/slum upgrading component will improve the health and living
conditions of some 96,000 residents in the six selected areas. The market upgrading
component will directly benefit the health and hygiene of all users, possibly 25% of the city
population, enhance the economic activities of market traders, and increase the revenue base
of FCC. The road component would provide urgently needed improvements to urba-i roads
and roadside drains, which will improve traffic circulation, reduce damage to vehicles,
improve pedestrian safety and circulation and reduce environmental degradation caused by
uncontrolled flows of surface water. The water supply component would improve the
operational efficiency of the existing system; strengthen the t3chnical and commercial
operations of GVWC; and ensure a supply or potable water to the residents of beneficiary
slum areas and upgraded markets, directly benefitting the poorest residents. Institutional
capacity to be developed within FCC will help sustain the infrastructure facilities in the City
including those provided under the project. The economic rate of return of the various



6
project components range from 13% for market improvement to 47% for road upgrading,
with a combined return of 34%.
18.   Prject Ris?ks. The main risk is associated with the capacity of the implementing
agencies to manage the implementation of a number of sectoral projects in paralel. While
GVWC, with its long history of capable technical performance, Is expected to manage well
the implementation of the water supply component, SLRA will require support to implement
the rest of the project. The recent establishment of the Project Management and Coordination
Unit and appointment of the Project Manager to be financed under the project would minimize
this risk. Another risk is related to the timely availability of counterpart funding, for which
the Government has agreed to make an initial deposit of Le 200 million and quarterly
disbursements into a project account to be established prior to credit effectiveness. Sensitivity
analyses of the impact of possible implementation delays on the econom-ic rate of return of the
project indicae that the combined return of 34% would be reduced to 28%, 24% and 21% if
project implemention is delayed by 1, 2 and 3 years, respectively.
19.   Reconumendio. I am satisfied tat the proposed Credit would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Association and recownmand that the Executive Directors
approve it.

implementation of Bank Projects
Between 1964 and 1987, there were 19 projects approved (5 Bank and 14 IDA) amountg
to US$128 million. Four partially disbursed Credits (amounting to a total of about US$46
million) were suspended in 1987 when Sierra Leone went into non accrual status. After the
Government cleared its arrears to the Bank in April 1992 and the Reconstruction Import Credit
(Cr. No. 2352-SL) became effective, suspension for all four projects was lifted and disbursements
under the projects have resumed. The Agricultural Sector Support Project has been modified in
consultation with the Government to address the changing prorities in the sector, in accordance
with the Bank's policies. Disbursements under a Power Sector Engineering Credit are being
made to support the emergency rehabilitation program assisted by EC and German aid as a
precursor to the IDA Power Sector Rehabilitation Project (Cr.No. 2356-SL). Disbursements and
implementation under the Reconstruction Import Credit (Cr.No. 2352-SL) have been ahead of
schedule and the Credit is likely to be fully disbursed by July 1993. There have been no
significant problems in starting procurement and disbursement under the ongoing projects since
the resumption of disbursements. Start up of the Public Sector Management Support Project and
the Road Rehabilitation and Maintenance Project approved at the end of 1992 has been smooth.
An implementation workshop for 60 senior officials, including all project managers and many
Secretaries of State, was held in January to explain the Bank procurement and disbursement
practices.
