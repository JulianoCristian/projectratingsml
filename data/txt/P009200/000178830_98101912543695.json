project will alleviate the\n            increasingly serious water shortage problems in the communes\n            of Pristina and Podujevo through reconstruction and\n            augmentation of the water supply system. The proposed\n            facilities would provide sufficient water for the rapidly\n            growing population as well as for the industries up to 1995.\n            The project consists of construction of a pipeline, water\n            treatment plant, pumping stations, reservoirs, and\n            distribution network for the two communes. It further\n            includes implementation of a leak detection program,\n            provision of water meters and a meter repair facility, and\n            construction and equipment of a technical operations\n            building. Technical assistance will be provided to RWB in\n            supervision of construction and in preparation of final\n            designs for sewage collection systems. A total of 345\n            man-months of consulting services at an estimated average\n            cost of US$7,900 per man-month is required."}, "docdt": "1981-09-30T00:00:00Z"}
