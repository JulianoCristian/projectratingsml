Major Loan conditions were met. However, instead of\n            using consultants to assist in project supervision, the\n            Borrower decided to do it with his own staff and did it\n            successfully. The major project objectives of eliminating\n            serious water shortages and strengthening the Borrower were\n            accomplished. The institutional objective of developing\n            Regional Waterworks Batlava (RWB) into a well run regional\n            water supply and sewerage organization was accomplished. An\n            excellent rapport existed between the Borrower and the Bank\n            which was facilitated by the high degree of motivation and\n            dynamism prevailing among RWB management and staff. The\n            project represents the least cost solution. It was well\n            conceived and well prepared. Major works were completed in a\n            timely fashion. The primary objectives of improving water\n            supply service in the project area and of developing RWB\n            were achieved. The project confirms the need to properly\n            factor the effect of price contingencies in cost estimates\n            when local and foreign inflation are projected to be\n            substantially different."}, "docdt": "1987-01-15T00:00:00Z"}
