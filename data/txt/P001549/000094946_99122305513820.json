sustainability is likely. The Bank took a\n            leading role in promoting essential sectoral adjustment, and\n            was flexible on project restructuring. While the\n            Borrower's performance is also rated satisfactory,\n            corrective actions were slow to be implemented. The key\n            lessons convey that, regarding the nature of the project,\n            policy reforms and investments, were appropriate measures to\n            achieve project objectives, which provided the suitable\n            incentives for private development. This success was highly\n            dependent upon the Government's commitment towards\n            divestiture, although the aid suspension from the Caisse\n            Centrale de Cooperation Economique (CCCE), affected the\n            whole sector, conducive in part, to insufficient local\n            budgets, since, adequate counterpart funding is critical for\n            project implementation. Furthermore, the absence of\n            effective project management, and accountability, also\n            affected the extensive beef production component, both\n            essential elements for a successful implementation. Although\n            the Mid-term review was effective in enabling corrective\n            actions, particularly in enhancing beneficiary\n            participation, severe constraints, such as creditworthiness,\n            and road accessibility, hindered both rural, and private\n            development. Bush fires remain a complex issue, to be\n            addressed on a multi-sectoral approach, outside the\n            project's scope."}, "docdt": "1999-12-03T00:00:00Z"}
