sustainability as unlikely, institutional development impact\n            as modest, bank performance as satisfactory, and borrower\n            performance as unsatisfactory. The lessons learned from this\n            project include: 1) Along with specific sector-level reforms\n            promoted by the federal government, the provincial efforts\n            benefited from a consistent system of fiscal incentives at\n            the national level that combined a hard budget constraint\n            and federal resistance to providing bailouts, with proactive\n            programs to support state reform. 2) Sequencing is important\n            and the PRL 2 approach is more successful and sustainable\n            for provinces that have already achieved a level of control\n            in their fiscal and debt situations. 3) Project preparation\n            should be informed by social and institutional assessment.\n            4) Participatory approaches can facilitate implementation\n            and support sustainability. 5) Emerging lessons from the\n            ongoing experience suggests that the loan design for a\n            direct relation between the Bank and the participating\n            province is important in enabling the Bank to bring to bear\n            its international experience and facilitating relations\n            between federal and provincial stakeholders. 6) The loans\n            were designed to fully disburse within 12-18 months of\n            effectiveness. Given such a time frame, it is more\n            appropriate for the programs to adopt a flexible instrument."}, "docdt": "2001-06-28T00:00:00Z"}
