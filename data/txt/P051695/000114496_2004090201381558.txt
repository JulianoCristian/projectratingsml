thereof;
(B)
the Borrower has indicated to the Bank that the actions and conditions 
set forth in the Program and in Schedule 3 to this Agreement, described therein as 
agreed between the Province and the Bank, are consistent with the Borrower’s national 
policy framework regarding provincial reforms, which policy (without mandating

ratio of provincial public sector personnel expenditures to provincial public sector 
net current revenues; (iii) maintain or decrease the ratio of provincial public sector 
debt stock to provincial public sector current revenues; (iv) not incur debt to 
finance provincial public sector current expenditures except under certain limited

Nacional de Inversión Pública); and (vii) in a manner consistent with national 
policies, achieve greater efficiency and effectiveness with regard to provincial 
public expenditures, particularly in the health and education sectors, all in an 
effort to widen the scope and increase the quality of provincial participation in said 
Page  2
sectors for the benefit of underprivileged segments of the population;
(C)
the Borrower has expressed its commitment to lend to and for use by the 
Province funds in local currency in amounts equivalent to the Loan amounts disbursed 
by the Bank; and
(D)
on the basis, inter alia, of the foregoing, the Bank has decided in
