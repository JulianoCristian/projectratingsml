MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDAnON OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE ITRNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THEEXECUIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE KINGDOM OF NEPAL
FORA
ROAD MAINTENANCE AND REHABITATONPROJECT
1.    I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed
credit to the Kingdom of Nepal for 36.6 million SDR (equivalent to US$50.5 million) to help finance
the Road Maintenance and Rehabilitation Project. The credit would be on IDA's standard terms with
40 years maurity including 10 years of grace. The beneficiary would be the Department of Roads
(DOR) in the Ministry of Works and Transport (MOWT). The Project would be cofinanced by the
United Kingdom Overseas Development Administration - ODA - (£ 9.6 million), Swiss Development
Cooperation - SDC - (SPR 4.3 million) and United Nations Development Program - UNDP - (US$1.0
million).
SECTOR BACKGROUND
2.    Nepal's transport system relies heavily on a relatively recent but modest road network which
serves low traffic volumes. Roads are complemented with trails and civil aviation facilities that provide
access to remote and sparsely populated areas. The transport network evolved from less than 650 km
of roads in the mid-fifties, mosdy motorable tracks, to a present network of 8,300 km of roads, 7,000
km of main trails, 400 modern suspension bridges and 43 airports including 20 short take-off and landing
StriPs.
3.    The Transport Sector and the Economy. During the early stages of transport development
between the 1950s and the 1970s, the transport sector absorbed 36% of total project aid and 28% of total
development expenditures. The share of project aid and development expenditures for transport projects
was reduced as the core roads, trails and airport networks were developed, declining to 17% and 16%,
respectively, in the eighdes, and to less than 12% and 7%, respectively, in the nineties. The transport
sector accounted for 4.3% of GDP in PY 1991, a decline from nearly 7% in FY 1981. This small share
does not take full account of transport and services by truck-operators wlich are often not reflected in
the GDP calculations. Road transport is the predominat sub-sector receing over 80 percent of total
transport public expenditures, followed by aviation with 15%.
4.    A core transport network is in place, but the Kingdom's difficult topography and severe monsoon
rains make inexpensive, reliable transport difficult, and some areas are not accessible by road. The lack
of transport links and pressure on agricultural land in the hill areas have prompted steady migration into
the Terai (pla) which is the country's primary agricultural resource and accounts for over a third of
the population. Road transport is predominat among transport modes and central to the Government's
development strategy. The Government considers the proposed Road Maintenance and Rehabilitation
Project a priority to help develop mtenance implementation capacities, safeguard past investments and
realize the benefits of substanial amounts of resources already dedicated to the road network.
5.    The Government has embarked on a program of economic reforms which have led to advances
in trade and industry liberalization including a unified exchange rate, freeing convertibility of the current
account and liberalizing foreign investment. The Government has taken initial steps to reform the civil
service and started privatization of public enterprises on a pilot scale and is formulating a major
reuuring program. The main problem, however, is that the fiscal situation remains tight, revenue
efforts are stll very poor and implementation capacities are constrained in most sectors.
6.    Road Sector. The road network's backbone is almost completed and comprises two main axes
including the East-West Highway in the Terai and the North-South road comnecting India with China



-2 -
through Katbmandu. The national road network comprises about 8,300 Iam, including some 3,000 km
of paved roads. With available resources and limited maintenance capabilities, the Government maintains
less than one-fourth of the total network, mostly highways and feeder roads. Moreover, every year
upgrading and extension projects add 200 km to the maintainable network.
7.    The network's rapid expansion has been at the expense of rapid road deterioration due to the lack
of maintenance funding and capabilities. In 1992, it was estimated that 75% of the total network was in
poor to fair condition, a high percentage compared to other low-incine countries where road networks
have been developed recently. The network's poor condition, compounded by Nepal's difficult geography
and weather, has resulted in high vehicle operating costs and annualized operation costs four to five times
higher than if maintenance were adequate. The resulting high transport costs are an important constraint
to Nepal's economy.
8.    The Government's present strategy emphasizev, network extensions to link all district centers with
the main road corridors, which has constrained the Government's ability for improving maintenance
capabilities. However, realizing the high costs of road deterioration, the Department of Roads (DOR)
and the Ministry of Finance (MOF) are gradually starting to focus on increasing institutional, financial
and private sector capacities for periodic and routine maintenance, starting with the strategic network
(4,000 km of highways and feeder roads) in a maintainable condition (1,500 km or 20% of the total road
network).
9.    Regarding necessary expansion of the road network, the Government's strategy still lacks
network-based planning and basic data which would allow new construction, upgrading and rehabilitation
to be prioritized comprehensively on the basis of economic criteria. However, significant progress has
been made to prioritize sector expenditures during Project preparation, including definition by DOR of
a strategic network, prioritization of maintenance activities in roads of the strategic network based on
economic criteria with available data, and development of a network analysis in each district to assemble
pre-feasibility level data on potentially viable new construction projects in each district. Addressing
piority maintenance of strattgic roads under the proposed Project by guaranteeing funding and expanding
implementation capaoilities during the next four years would be a major achievement in the prioritization
of sector expenditures. Second, a rolling first three-year program for FY 1993/94 prepared by IDA, to
be discussed with HMG in April 1994, is expected to suggest a prioritization of incomplete and on-going
new construction, rehabilitation and maintenance based on available data. The next step, to be undertaken
as part of the Project as agreed with the Govermnent and based on the district network analysis, would
be the development of a Priority Investment Plan and a review process as part of the Project, covering
construction and maintenance in the transport sector. The Government has indicated a strong preference
to follow a process that fosters the development of planning capabilities in DOR and the National
Planning Commission (NPC), involves participation of local groups and specialists.
10.   Aviation Sector. Aviation, second onlyto roads, is an important mode of transport in Nepal since
many areas are inaccessible. A network of 43 airports of varying standards serves Nepal and makes
many remote areas accessible. Since 1992, private operators entered the domestic market which was
previously dominmated by the national carrier Royal Nepal Airlines Corporation (RNAC).
11.   Aviation is important for Nepal to support the country's growing tourism industry and for intemal
communications, especially in the Hills and Mountains. Kathmandu's Tribhuvan Airport is the only
international airport, with 42 additional air-strips which include 26 short take-off and landing strips
located in the Hills and Mo1:ritains. In general, conditions at these domestic air-strips are poor, and
services, especially in the Hills and Mounins, are extremely unreliable. The Government focuses
aviation investments for upgrading facilities at Tribhuvan Airport, paving of runways and other
improvements to the domestic air-strips and some maintence. Large capital improvement projects have



-3 -
been considered in the past to upgrade Tribhuvan and Pokhara's airports, but these are unlikely to be
justifiable or feasible given the projected volumes of traffic.
12.   Revenues from civil aviation user charges are more than six times the current budgetary
allocations dedicated for recurrent expenditures in the sub-sector. There is a need to critically review the
priorities for aviation sector expenditures, particularly in the areas of navigation aids and other aviation
safety enhancements. Maintenance of aviation facilities is presently very poor due to a lack of funding,
and the present maintenance allocations need to be increased at least by ten-fold from the present level.
13.   Trails and Suspension Bridges. In the Hills and Mountains, the trail network is extensive and
well used, and for those areas not connected to the road network human porterage remains the only form
of transport. With the development of a road system, however, the nature of the trail network has
changed, with trails no longer providing long distance transport but feeding the hills from roadheads.
With 23 out of 75 districts having no road access and some 12 districts with a single earth road, many
villages are accessible only by porters travelling on foot. The overall length of these trails is estimated
to be around 15,000-20,000 km, including 7,000 km of main trails, out of which 5,000 km are
concentrated in the three western regions.
14.   Over time trails have been, and are continuing to be, improved by construction of pedestrian
suspension bridges over rivers and gorges, which improve accessibility and reduce distances. Some 2,500
trail bridges exist along various routes. Of these, around 400 are modern suspension bridges constructed
by the communities and the suspension bridge division of the Ministry of Works and Transport. The
condition of these bridges is highly variable, and the older bridges are generally in poor condition.
15.   IDA's Countrv Assistance Strategy.  IDA's country assistance strategy (CAS) for Nepal
(presented to the Board in March 1992), has four main areas of focus: (a) poverty alleviation through
productivity gains in agriculture, basic infrastructure, expansion in small scale industries and services,
and increased investments in human resources; (b) an improvement in absorption capacity through
strengthening the fnances and management of sectoral institutions; (c) population and human resources
development; and (d) the development of hydropower resources if Nepal's macroeconomic management
and institutional capacity improve. The Project is consistent with IDA's CAS for Nepal, which is
scheduled to be presented to the Board in April 1994.
16.   The Project would support broader reforms aimed at improving public resource management
which have been started by the Government and include: (a) allocating a greater share of development
resources to power, rural infrastructure, health, education and family planning, (b) strengthening
prioritization of expenditures with the formulation of a three-year rolling plan and an annual review
process, (c) completing on-going priority projects, and (d) improving the management of development
programs and supporting district level agencies to improve service delivery.
17.   IDA's Sector Experience and Strate v. The proposed Project would be the fifth IDA transport
sector operation in Nepal. In the past IDA has financed three road projects and one flood rehabilitation
project with emphasis on roads and bridges, in addition to financing a few irrigation roads as part of
agriculture projects. IDA's involvement in the transport sector has been successful in that the projects'
physical objectives have been generally met. Difficult economic conditions, political changes and limited
institutional capabilities, however, have often caused delays, and institutional strengthening has tended
to fall short of objectives.
18.   IDA's strategy in Nepal is to support expenditure prioritization to encourage optimal use of scarce
public resources. IDA's tiansport sector strategy is to support policies and investments that prioritize
scarce resources on programs which are central to the attainment of the main sectoral objectives of the
EFYP. The main focus of IDA's transport strategy would be to ensure that the highest prior v be given



-4 -
to the following investments: completing the East-West Highway, maintaining the strategic road network,
emphasizing the development of a farm-to-market network in support of agricultural development in the
Terai, and providing access to important itational development projects. IDA's strategy would also focus
on the following policy instruments: (a) prioritizing sector expenditures to contribute to the country's
strategy of expenditure prioritization through the development of a sector-wide priority investment plan
and review process bascd on network-based planning and basic data considering new construction,
upgrading and rehabilitation on the basis of economic criteria: (b) insuring funding for maintenance of
the strategic transport networks; and (c) establishing a sector expenditure ceiling based on the rolling
three-year budget review process that will start in FY 1993/94. The strategy, is elaborated in
"Expenditures in the Road Sector" (Report No. 10988) and the background papers of the "Selected Issues
for Infratructure Development Strategy" (Green cover report No. 11800-NEP).
19.   The institutional strengtening and human resource development strategy for the sector builds
upon an organization and management review prepared recently for the MOWT, and on-going training
initiatives. The strategy has two main components including: (a) supporting the development of strategic
planning in the road sector by strengthening NPC's transport unit and DOR's planning unit, and
completing the road maintenance information system in DOR and its expansicn to the field operational
umits; and (b) supporting institutional strengthening and on-the-job training to develop and establish
cental and regional level implementation capacities to manage and operate the road and bridge network.
SECTOR ISSUES
20. The report "Expenditures in the Road Sector" identified four main sector constraints including:
(a) lack of network-based planning, programming and budgeting, (b) inadequate allocations for
maintenance and constraints affecting fund release procedures, (c) institutional and human resource related
constraints, and (d) limited absorptive capacities affecting operations. The recommended sector strategy
accords the highest priority to: (i) shifting resource allocation in the sector to develop maintenance
capabilities; (ii) completing essential on-going new construction; (iii) developing farm-to-market roads
in the Terai; (iv) improving accessibility between Kathmandu and the Termi; and (e) improving trails and
suspension bridges in the hills. The increase in maintenance expenditures I i capabilities could be done
by developing a timely, reliable and adequate funding mechanism for road m. ntenance, and concentrating
DOR's capabilides on the trunk road network (i.e., highways and feeder roads) and DDCs'
responsibilities for district roads.
21.   Against this background, the sector strategy suggests actions on four areas including: (a)
developing network-based planning, improving collection and disbursement of funds and introducing
performance budgeting; (b) insuring adequate, timely funding for road maintenance; (c) increasing efforts
and coordinating initiatives that support institutional development and human resource development; and
(d) increasing the capacity of domestic contractors, improving maintenance contract management (e.g.,
adoption of appropriate standards, introduction of improved quality control mechanisms), and introducing
routine maintenance on contract (to replace force account).
22.   The institutional strengthening and human resource development strategy builds upon the O&M
report and on-going training initiatives and has four main components: (a) supporting the completion of
a road maintenance information system in DOR and its expansion to the field operational units; (b)
supporting the development of planning capabilities in NPC's transport unit and DOR; (c) establishing
regional level implementation capacities for periodic and routine road maintenance; and (d) developing
on-the job training, including: (i) training DOR's management on planning, programming and budgeting;
(ii) training DOR's engineers and contractors on road maintenance operations, contract management and
supervision, and monitoring; (iii) continue on-going training of equipment mechanics, operators and
laboratory technicians (DOR and private sector); and (iv) training DDCs' staff and contmctors on labor-
based methods for district road rehabilitation.

23.   The Govermnent has undertaken several measures to improve maintenance funding, prioritize
expenditures, promote the gradual development of maintenance capabilities, decentralize rural road
administration and ensure coordination among donors. During Project preparation the Government has
made progress on the following: (a) network-based planming: resource allocation in the road sector needs
to de-emphasize new construction and accord priority to safeguarding past investments and developing
institutional capabilities to manage the road network; the road section of the Eighth Five Year Plan
(EFYP) includes some positive developments in this direction according priority to maintenance; (b)
prioritization of expenditures: significant progress has been made to prioritize sector expenditures,
including definiton by DOR of a strategic network, prioritization of maintenance activities in roads of
the strategic network based on economic criteria with available data, and development of a network
analysis in each district to assetnble pre-feasibility level data on potentially viable new construction
projects in each district; a rolling first three-year program for FY 1994/95 would be discussed with IDA
before April 1994; the next step, during the Project, would be the development of a Priority Investment
Plan (PIP) and a review process, covering construction and maintenance in the road sector; (c) budIeting:
a funding mechanism for road mainenance has been established to ensure adequate funding of priority
maintenance activities, including funding and budgeting arrangemens which would channel a nuch
greater, timely flow of funds to support maintenance within sectoral allocation ceilings; and (d)
mantenance operations: a Strengthened Maintenance Division program has been started in FY 1993/94
to improve programming and implementation of maintenance throughout Nepal.
24.   Lessons from Previous IDA Operations. The proposed Project would be the fifth IDA road
operation in Nepal. The first two highway projects were satisfactorily completed but with considerable
delays due to material shortages and inefficiencies in administration. Upgrading DOR's maintenance
capabilities and its personnel skills and organizational practices were not as effective as the
implementation of physical components. The Third Highway - Credit 1515-NEP - (US$ 47.5 million of
August 1984) and Road Flood Rehabilitation Project - Credit 1922-NEP - (US$ 15.5 million of May
1988) have been delayed due to the 1989/90 trade and transit impasse with India and the subsequent
political changes in the country. Although overall implementation of the Third Highway Project has
fallen four years behind schedule, physical implementation has been generally good and quality high, and
the physical components of the project were completed in December, 1993, with remaining additional
works to address the July 1993 floods. Training of heavy equipment mechanics and other personnel
began under the Second Highway Project - Credit 730-NEP - and has continued satisfactorily during this
project. The Road Flood Rehabilitation Project is expected to meet its objectives with a two year
implementation delay. Past projects embodied a strategy of support for construction with less attention
to the follow-up maienance which resulted in the necessity of rehabilitation. Most projects highlighted
DOR's limited institutional capabilities. While construction and rehabilitation targets were achieved,
usually with delay, maintenace capacity was not increased. Other recurrent problems relate to the
ineffective project management and monitoring. The proposed Project aims at supporting institutional
strenhening and human resource development, by supportng an improved policy framework and
expanding the technical and managerial skills of counterpart staff through extensive training and technical
assistance. The increasing demands for maintenance funding resulting from IDA and other donor-
supported road projects indicate that a coordinated road policy framework is now necessary to ensure the
sustainability of past investments.
25.   Ratot_ale for IDA Involvement. IDA's involvement would support an overhaul of road
administration and maintenance, and contribute to the country's strategy of expenditure prioritization to
encourage optimal use of scarce public resources, as a logical follow up to IDA's sector strategy. IDA's
involvement would strengthen the process of institution building and sector policy reform and foster
broad-based donor support for a common program of maintenmce and rebabilitation. The Project would
be a departure from past projects where the core was a program of selected road investments,
complemented with attempts at institutional reforms that were incremental in nature. In contrast, the
Project would emphasize the development of permanent institutonal capacity (for planning, programming,



budgeting design, construction and maintenance), supplemented with support for essential investments
in physical works.
TE PROJECT
26.   Project Objectives. The Government has requested IDA's assistance to finance a proposed
Project that would address the development of road maintenance capabilities departing from the previous
projects which supported new construction and rehabilitation. The Project would support the sector
strategy developed in "Expenditures in the Road Sector" and would have five main objectives: (a) insure
adequate funding of priority maintenance activities by establishing funding and budgeting arrangemenits
which would channel a much greater, timnely flow of funds to support maintenance within sectoral
allocation ceilings based on a rolling three-year priority investment program to be revis.ed annually and
reviewed with IDA; (b) strengthen sectoral planning by introducing network-based planning, initially to
prioritize maintenance and thereafter to support the development of a Priority Investment Plan review
process during the Project; (c) improve public sec-tor implementation capacity to expand the coverage and
enhance the quality of maintenance with a program of institutional strengthening and human resource
development based primarily on training and technical assistance inputs (to complete the development of
a road maintenance information system, establish regional maintenance capabilities, coordinate and
develop a comprehensive training program for DOR's staff) and increasing incentives to DOR staff with
increased funding levels for road maintenance, enhanced quality control, and introduction of performance
targeting; (d) support development of private sector capabilities to do maintenance on contract by
suppordng on-the-job training, improving procurement of maintenance contracts, gradually developing
a critical mass of annual maimenance contracts, streamlining contract supervision and insuring timely and
regular funding and payments; and (d) use the pilot project to test ways to develop DDCs' road
masintenance capabilities for local access roads (i.e., district roads). In general, the Project would aim
at reducing vehicle operating costs and the delays associated with a deteriorated road system, and
generating much needed rural employment through adoption of labor-based technologies.
27.   Proiect Description and Financing Plan. The Project would include policy and institutional
development components and maintenance and rehabilitation programs. The policy components would
include: introduction of new maintnance funding mechanisms to ensure timely, adequate funding for
maintenance; and improvement of sectoral planning. The institutional development component would
include: institutional strengthening of the regional and divisional capacities of the Department of Roads
(DOR) and four District Development Committees (DDCs) to implement maintenance and rehabilitation
on contract; training of DOR and four DDCs; specialist inputs for -supervision of works; and studies.
The maintenance and rehabilitation programs to be financed by IDA would include: (a) support for a
backlog periodic maintenance program of roads and bridges of the strategic road network in the Central,
Western, Mid-Western and Far-Western regions including about 500 km of resealing, 150 km of
gravelling and sealing, and minor bridge repairs; (b) rehabilitation and overlays of 300 km of selected
highways and 105 km of feeder roads of the strategic road network; and (c) a pilot labor-based district
road rehabilitation and maidtenance component to support rehabilitation and maintenance of 140 lan in
4 selected districts and promotion of appropriate rural transport technology to encourage community
participation in road maintenance and related activities. The Government would fund the gradual
development of a comprehensive routine maintenance program by contract. Project cost is estimated at
US$81.1 million, including taxes and duties amounting to US$3.5 million. The foreign exchange
component is estimated at US$45.8 million (56%). Financing -would be provided by IDA (62% of project
cost), the Govermment (19%), contributions from ODA (15%) and SDC (3%) and a UNDP grant (1%).
Retroactive financing under the IDA credit would be available up to US$1.2 million for eligible
expenditures incurred after August 31, 1993, for civil works and consultant services for the road
rehabilitation component. A breakdown of costs and the financing plan is shown in Schedule A.
Amounts and methods of procurement and disbursements, and the disbursement schedule, are shown in
Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing events and the status of Bank Group operations in
Nepal are given in Schedule C and D, respectively. Mas no. 24777, 24778 and 24779 are also attached.

28.   Project implementation. The Project is expected to be fully implemented within six years. DOR
would be the main agency responsible for Project implementation; officials in different DOR units will
be responsible for individual components. The DOR would be responsible for implementation of
institutional strengthening; human resource development activities and training for trunk road maintenance
would be coordinated through DOR's Road Sector Skills Development Unit which will advise DOR's
Director General.
29.   The Project's road rehabilitation components would be under the control of the Deputy Director,
Foreign Coordination Section, while the periodic maintenance of roads and bridges would be under the
control of the Deputy Director, Maintenance Section, implemented by DOR's Regional and Divisional
Units. The Priority Investment Plan preparation and review process would be under the responsibility
of the Deputy Director, Planning Section, and close coordination would be sought with NPC's Transport
Unit. DOR would be assisted by the following core teanrs of experts and expatriate advisors: (a) field
implementation advisors as part of the periodic maintenance programs to provide advice and on-the-job
training to DOR staff and contractors on road and bridge maintenance, quality control, contract
management, and works programming, (b) road sector skills manager, (c) consultant teams for
supervision of phases I and 2 of the rehabilitationprograms, (d) advisors for the training and institutional
development components, and (e) consultant teams for the special studies. The field implementation
advisors team would review designs, conduct training activities, prepare tender documents, evaluate
tenders, ensure timely implementation of Project components and technical assistance studies, monitor
progress and costs and keep a tight control on the Project budget and accounts. A team of local and
foreign road experts is responsible for the preparation of phase 1 rehabilitation programs, considering
economic rates of return based on traffic counts, road condition surveys and desired levels of service.
One team of local and foreign road experts, to be selected every year of the Project, would prepare and
supervise the periodic mainteance program for that year; their services include updati9 the economic
rates of return based on traffic counts, road condition surveys and desired levels of  r 'r 2e, preparing
designs and tender documents, assisting DOR during tender evaluation and being .sponsible for
supervision. The maintenance information system would continue being implemented by DOR to ersure
prioritization of maintenance activities and increase accountability of maintenance operations.
30.   In the case of district roads, a newly created District Road Services Development Unit (DRSDU)
attached to the office of the Secretary, Ministry of Local Development (MLD), would support
decentralization of district road administration during the pilot phase and be responsible for the pilot
labor-based district road rehabilitation and maintenance component. The technical atsistance for this
Project component would be funded by UNDP through MLD, and executed by Helvetas (an Interational
NGO). The civil works would be financed from the Project, with the Project Manager of DRSDU
designated as a signatary to the Project's special account for this Project component only. The DDCs
would let contracts for rehabilitation and maintenance, employ consultants to design and supervise the
contracts under the guidance of the DRSDU, and monitor and evaluate this Project component. The
training for this Project component would be at DOR's training facilities at Butwal. The equipment sets
to be purchased would remain the property of the DOR, but would be for hire exclusively to the labor-
based contractors under this Project component. The rural transport component would be implemented
through DRSDU.
31.   Donor Coordination. Active donor coordination during Project preparation has resulted in one
of the first cofinanced Projects in the sector in Nepal. This coordination will be mantained through
arrangements set out in a Memorandum of Understanding to be signed by the cofinanciers. A draft of
the Memorandum of Understanding relating to cooperation, coordination and exchange of information
was prcpared during negotiations and is expected to be finalized by May 31, 1994. The coordinadon
would cover joint reviews of sector expenditure prioritization, maintenance programs and progress with
sector policy reform.

32.   Project Sustainability. In order to safeguard past and future investments, the Project would aim
at supporting sector policy reform to address the backlog of road maintenance and foster institutional
strengthening and human resource development. Th;'i Project aims at securing self-sustaining road sector
management through improvements in funding and effliciency of road maintenance operations. The
Project would support periodic and systematic reviews of road maintenance operations, to examine
Yconstruction and maintenance standards, efficiency and unit costs and recommend cost-efficient technical
approaches app;opriate to Nepal. The Project would emphasize training of DOR's staff and development
of small and medium-sized contractors for rehabilitation and maintenance operations, including the
development of labor-based capabilities. The development of labor-based contractors supplemented with
small appropriate equipment have proven to be a cost-effective alternative to capital-intensive methods
for district roads. The Government's emphasis on devolution of responsibilities to the local agencies
(DDCs) would be supported through the development of local implementation capacity.
33.   Agreed Actions. The key agreements reached with the Government include measures to improve
sector planning, road funding, institutional development and the development of maintenance and
rehabilitation programs for pre-determined road networks. More specifically, the Government agreed
to (a) prepare a priority investment plan and a related three year rolling investment plan, (b) to cap
overall road expenditures, but to reallocate funding for rehabilitation and maintenance of the strategic
road network, (c) implement a program of institutional strengthening of the key sectoral agencies by way
of technical assistance and staff reallocations, (d) with the help of supervising consultant engineers,
implement maintenance and rehabilitation programs for the strategic road network according to agreed
annual maintenance allocation and expenditure targets, and (e) prepare environmental action plans of the
road sector, for both new operations and the periodic, emergency and routine maintenance programs.
Agreements were also reached on appropriate counterpart funding for the rolling three year maintenance
programs.
34.   Environmental Aspects. The Project is not likely to have any significant adverse effects on the
environment. Existing road alignments will be followed to the extent technically feasible, and any
deviations are expected to be minor. A Sectoral Environmental Assessment (SEA) has been undertaken
to develop a simple, standard and practical screening of Project components, with a view to strengthen
environmental considerations in the design and construction stages of all DOR projects. DOR has agreed
to establish and staff an environmental unit within DOR's Planning Section by May 31, 1994. Provisions
will be incorporated in design and bidding documents. It was agreed during negotiations with HMG that
the SEA would be adopted by March 31, 1994, for purposes of screening the road programs of each
year's program. The environmental unit would screen each annual periodic road maintenance program,
according to the SEA Guidelines.
35.   Benefits. The Project's main benefit would be more efficient, cost effective administration of the
road transport system, prioritization of sector expenditures and reduction of transport costs.
Strengthening DOR would create a central focal point which will offer technical support and assistance
to local authorities in the future. The benefits of road rehabilitation and maintenance under the Project
consist of savings in vehicle operating costs and cost savings in maintenance. The economic benefits of
the Project indicate that the overall economic rate of return, as well as that of individual components,
would exceed the opportunity cost of capital. The benefits for the institutional strengthening and training
components are high but non-quantifiable.
36.   Risks. At the policy level, the main risks are that the Government will bow to political pressures
in developing it's Priority Investment Plan (PIP) and the related three year rolling sectoral funding
programs. To counter this possibility, the PIP must be satisfactory to IDA (and to the other Donors in
the sector), with annual agreement on the updated rolling investment/maintenance programs and
maintenance allocations. Additionally, the Government must establish a mechanism for funding periodic
emergency and routine maintenance of the road network.



- 9 -
37.   The main risks for the infrastructural aspects of the project are delays in implementation and a
failure to implement optimal comprehensive maintenance programs. To ensure a prompt start up of the
project, supervisory consultants will be appointed in May 1994, (as will key advisors and counterpart
stafl), for road maintenance and .ehabilitation, implementation of the sector environmental action plan
and for the mechanics and operators training programs. To mitigate against risks of implementing a sub-
optimal maintenance program, the supervising consultants will work closely with DOR's staff in
preparing, tendering and implementing the annual work programs. Relevant specialists will also be
available under the institutional development component to provide assistance, particularly on strategic
aspects of the rolling programs. By relating the project to the Government's PIP and annual development
plans with particular emphasis upon maintenance and rehabilitation, the scope of project works has the
flexibility to respond to the implementation experience gained during the early years of the project.
Through the process and planned periodic reviews, alternative approaches can be adopted if appropriate.
38.   On the institutional aspects of the project, the main risks are the Government's reluctance to give
DOR the autonomy to reorganize it's operations to focus only on trunk roads, overdependence upon the
consultants' providing technical assistance and a lack of accountability and motivation on the part of DOR
staff. To promote the development of local capabilities, DOR staff will be integral members of the
various technical assistance teams and one of the first task of consultants and advisors will be to prepare
detailed plans for the training of counterpart staff and the gradual transfer of responsibilities from the
consultant to the counterpart staff. Various safeguards, including criteria for counterpart selection, target
handover dates for key responsibilities, operational audits and planned periodic reviews have been
incorporated into the institutional development programs in an effort to monitor overall implementation.
Continued close cooperation among donurs in the sector and careful monitoring by IDA through project
supervision and an indepth mid-term project review with HMGtDOR in October 1995 will further help
to minimize the risks.
39.   Recommendation. I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the Articles of
Agreement of the Association and recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed credit.
