for Uruguay\n            were as follows: outcomes were satisfactory, Global\n            Environment Objective (GEO) outcomes were satisfactory, risk\n            to development outcome was low or negligible, risk to GEO\n            outcome was low or negligible, Bank performance was\n            moderately satisfactory, and Borrower performance was\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: a transparent\n            demand-driven approach is critical to success of Natural\n            Resources Management (NRM) projects. The integration of NRM\n            and biodiversity within the structure and mentality of a\n            traditionally structured, production-oriented ministry of\n            agriculture was a key factor in promoting green growth in\n            the agricultural sector. Ex-post reviews highlighted the\n            importance of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) with\n            outcome-focused indicators and targets, and Intermediate\n            Outcome Indicators (IOIs) with output focused indicators and\n            targets to more effectively measure project impacts. Within\n            a broad-based demand-driven approach, the design and\n            operational aspects of the subproject cycle, as well as the\n            frequency or timing or budget of calls for proposals should\n            be carefully addressed during preparation and validated\n            during the initial stages of project implementation to avoid\n            credibility issues and frustration within the beneficiary\n            community when delays occur or expectations are not met. In\n            non-irrigated areas or production systems, climate\n            variability and beneficiary vulnerability should be taken\n            into consideration at project design, as the benefits\n            accrued by producers from project-financed investments can\n            be easily lost as a result of droughts or other climate\n            related adversities. In order to maximize the dissemination,\n            visibility and perception of project actions and results,\n            the implementation of Integrated Natural Resource and\n            Biodiversity Management Project (PPR) demonstrated the\n            importance of including, within the structure of the Project\n            Executing Unit (PEU), a communications team staffed by\n            specialized professionals, responsible for the design and\n            implementation of a communication plan suited to the\n            features and needs of the project."}, "docdt": "2013-04-29T00:00:00Z"}
