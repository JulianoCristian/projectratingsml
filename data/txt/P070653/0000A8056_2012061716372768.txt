                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project has entered its final months of implementation, progressing satisfactorily both in financial and physical terms. This is demonstrated through the execution of both NRM
                         and biodiversity sub-projects, with over 3,500 approved, of which 2,429 have been completed and the remainder is in the final stages of implementation. In addition, a final round of
                         subprojects aimed at water supply alternatives for livestock production has been successfully launched. The project will close on August 31, 2012. The recommendations from the
                         previous mission have been carried out and the project is in full compliance with the Annual Operational Plan 2012, thus resulting in overall satisfactory project implementation.
