                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project is advancing satisfactorily both in financial and physical terms. This is demonstrated through the execution of both NRM and biodiversity sub-projects, with over 3,500
                         approved and under implementation and a total of 346 already closed, as well as the recent launch of a final round of subproject aimed at water supply alternatives for livestock
                         production. The project has been extended until August 31, 2012. The recommendations from the previous mission have been carried out and the project is in full compliance with the
                         Annual Operational Plan 2011, thus resulting in overall satisfactory project implementation.
