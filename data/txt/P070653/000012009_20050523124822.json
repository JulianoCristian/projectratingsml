objective of the\n            Integrated Natural Resources and Biodiversity Management\n            Project is to promote, particularly among groups of small\n            and medium-sized fanners, the adoption of economically and\n            environmentally viable integrated production systems, within\n            a context of holistic ecosystem and natural resources\n            management, while mainstreaming biodiversity. Likewise, the\n            global environment objective seeks to promote increased\n            understanding on the role of biodiversity in agricultural\n            landscapes, and the potential impact of various land use\n            practices upon biodiversity, and their economic and\n            ecological sustainability. Through the Natural Resources and\n            Biodiversity Management Component, demand-driven activities\n            will be financed to promote sustainable management of\n            natural resources and biodiversity. This will be\n            accomplished through financial and technical assistance\n            towards improving natural resources management practices in\n            livestock production systems, with special reference to\n            improved management of natural pastures and biodiversity.\n            The component will further adopt improved practices in\n            dryland agriculture; for natural resources management\n            systems in irrigated areas; and, in biodiversity\n            conservation. The second component, fully financed by the\n            Global Environment Facility (GEF) resources, will establish\n            demonstration areas within the selected areas of\n            GEF-interventions (grasslands and \"serranias\"),\n            for a sustainable use of natural resources in key\n            micro-catchments which are of importance for biodiversity,\n            combining sound practices for natural resources management,\n            and creating increased public awareness on the significance,\n            and socioeconomic importance of biodiversity. The main\n            objective under the third component is to develop support\n            services that would contribute to the efficient\n            implementation of sub-projects, financed under the previous\n            two components. It is divided in four sub-components:\n            institutional strengthening; natural resources management\n            instruments; training and technical assistance; and, studies\n            and applied research. The fourth component will guarantee a\n            sound and efficient management of the Project through three\n            sub-components: a project executing unit, encompassing staff\n            and operation costs; the establishment of a monitoring and\n            evaluation system; and, implementation of a public\n            information and dissemination program."}, "docdt": "2005-05-02T00:00:00Z"}
