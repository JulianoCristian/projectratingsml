                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project is within 60 days of closing and progressing to a satisfactory completion, both in financial and physical terms. Allrelevant project performance indicators have been met or
                         surpassed, including the implementation of over 5,000 NRM subprojectsthroughout the country, of which more than 1,500 included specific actions in support of biodiversity
                         conservation. Theimplementing agency (MGAP) is in the process of preparing the Borrower’s Completion Report, which will include a comprehensiveanalysis of project outcomes and
                         results, as well as the conclusions of the ongoing surveys on subproject sustainability andbeneficiary satisfaction. This report will provide valuable data and information for the
                         preparation of the Bank’s ImplementationCompletion Report.
