                         To promote, mainly among groups of small and medium-sized farmers, the adoption of economically and environmentally viable integrated production systems
                         within a context of holistic ecosystem and natural resources management, while mainstreaming biodiversity.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project is advancing satisfactorily both in financial and physical terms. This is demonstrated through the execution of both NRM and biodiversity sub-projects, with over 3,500
                         approved and under implementation and a total of 346 already closed. Additionally there has been important progress in the submission of "SOEs" (rendiciones) by beneficiaries of
                         sub-projects under execution, and the increased integration of biodiversity, natural resources and water management in subprojects. The recommendations from the previous
                         mission have been carried out and the project is in full compliance with the Annual Operational Plan 2010 and the advances in the implementation of sample assessments of project
                         impact (using the EIAR methodology), all amount to satisfactory project implementation.
