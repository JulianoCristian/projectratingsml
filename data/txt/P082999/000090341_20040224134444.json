teaching and learning throughout the school sector, while\n            continuing the push for equity by ensuring the inclusion of\n            all children at all levels of the basic education system.\n            Progress against this objective is measured by enrollment\n            and completion rates, disaggregated by gender. EQIP II\n            comprises four components and ten subcomponents. The first\n            two components focus directly on the issue of quality in the\n            classroom: Component A in basic education, and Component B\n            in secondary education. Component C aims at modernizing the\n            management of the school sector, at the central, regional\n            and school levels, in ways that improve schools'\n            abilities to deliver quality education. Component D seeks to\n            enhance the performance of the core systems - training, ICT,\n            assessment and infrastructure - that will enable the\n            Ministry of Education and Training (MET) to better implement\n            the kinds of activities included in the first three\n            components. Following are the Components, and\n            Sub-components: A: Inclusive Basic Education: A1 Teaching\n            for Improved Learning Outcomes; A2 Equal Schooling\n            Opportunities. B: Diversity in Secondary Education: B1\n            Diversifying the Secondary Education Curriculum; B2 Career\n            Information and Guidance. C: School Sector Management: C1\n            School-Level Management; C2 System-Level Management. D:\n            Strengthening Core Systems: D1 Staff Training and\n            Communications; D2 Information and Communication\n            Technologies; D3 Assessment and Evaluation; D4 School\n            Infrastructure. Project activities will include: technical\n            assistance; training for teachers, managers and education\n            specialists; purchase of equipment; and civil works (e.g.\n            construction of new schools, and rehabilitation of existing schools)."}, "docdt": "2004-01-23T00:00:00Z"}
