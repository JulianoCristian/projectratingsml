These changes will enable the Government to\n            complete remaining activities which cannot be completed\n            prior to the project's current closing date, and make\n            use of cost savings for additional rehabilitation works for\n            schools, purchase of income tax (IT) equipment and conduct\n            the relevant teacher training. Cost savings come from\n            savings on IT equipment purchases and appreciation of the\n            Euro in which the loan is denominated. The reallocation does\n            not imply changes in the components of the project, nor in\n            the activities to be carried out by the project. The school\n            rehabilitation has been an important part of component D of\n            the project (strengthening core system), and up until now,\n            1325 schools have been rehabilitated. This second extension\n            and reallocation of funds would allow the Government to\n            continue with the school rehabilitation, following the needs\n            assessment done on a yearly basis by the direction of\n            buildings and equipment. This will be supported through the\n            use of cost savings. The extension of the project closing\n            date will also allow the Government to complete the\n            procurement and distribution of IT equipment, and fully\n            execute a number of consultant contracts that will assist\n            the Ministry of Education in getting the best use of the IT\n            infrastructure procured by the project."}, "docdt": "2009-09-29T00:00:00Z"}
