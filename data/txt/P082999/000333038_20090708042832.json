The reallocation of funds is\n            consistent with the current completion rate of activities,\n            and project savings. Some activities initially planned to be\n            funded under the loan have been carried out using the\n            Borrower's own resources, leaving room for funding\n            additional equipment under the loan. The actual costs of the\n            civil works component have been lower than the estimated\n            costs at the time of project preparation, and savings have\n            been made due to appreciation of the Euro against the Dollar\n            and Dinar in which construction expenses are made. The\n            reallocation does not imply changes in the components of the\n            project, nor in the activities to be carried out by the\n            project. The new allocations reflect the need to increase\n            the scale of the information and communication technology\n            (ICT) program and hence the need to increase the number of\n            schools to be equipped with computers. Along the same lines,\n            in order to fully implement the language program in schools,\n            the equipment of language labs at the school level was\n            deemed necessary."}, "docdt": "2008-06-10T00:00:00Z"}
