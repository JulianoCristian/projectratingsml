"Ratings for the Second Phase of the\n            Education Quality Improvement Program Project for Tunisia\n            were as follows: outcomes were satisfactory; risk to\n            development outcome was moderate; Bank performance was\n            moderately satisfactory; and borrower performance was\n            moderately unsatisfactory. Some lessons learned includes:\n            timing of education reform. It is always a challenge to find\n            the best possible synchronization between planned project\n            implementation plans and the national 'rhythm' in\n            creating the conditions for education reform. A separate\n            political consensus process is needed, after reforms are\n            ready, to explicitly address political sensitivities and\n            develop political ownership. Technical and professional\n            consultations on reforms are necessary but not sufficient.\n            Clarity of monitoring and evaluation (M and E) roles and\n            linkages of M and E to policy development should be ensured.\n            The Bank should provide a clear design and continuous\n            technical support on the M&E practice. Capacity\n            building. Knowledge of Bank procedures cannot be\n            underestimated when looking at elements of success of an\n            investment project. Training on Bank operations is necessary\n            for counterpart staff and critical for new staff, and this\n            applies to procurement as well as financial management.\n            Raising learning outcomes in disadvantaged areas is a\n            challenge that developed and developing countries face\n            nowadays in a context of nearly universal primary and\n            secondary education. Project implementation and procurement.\n            Procurement delays were due to several factors some inherent\n            to the country procurement system and procedures and some\n            due to the capacity and skills in the implementing agency.\n            School rehabilitation: many cases where rehabilitation was\n            required were due to the lack of proper maintenance over\n            long periods of time."}, "docdt": "2011-03-28T00:00:00Z"}
