During construction, to\n            minimize air pollution, construction sites should be\n            regularly sprayed, and materials adequately stored; water\n            sources will be protected to avoid contamination, while oil\n            spills shall be disposed of in accordance with standard\n            regulations; adequate working schedules should minimize\n            noise disturbances; solid wastes shall be disposed of at\n            selected sites, or incinerated, and, - in collaboration with\n            local authorities - effluents will be controlled, and\n            treated per standard regulations, while septic tanks will be\n            installed as needed.
