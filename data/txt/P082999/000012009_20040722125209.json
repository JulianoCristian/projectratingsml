EQIP II\n            comprises four components and ten subcomponents. The first\n            two components focus directly on the issue of quality in the\n            classroom: Component A in basic education, and Component B\n            in secondary education. Component C aims at modernizing the\n            management of the school sector, at the central, regional\n            and school levels, in ways that improve schools'\n            abilities to deliver quality education. Component D seeks to\n            enhance the performance of the core systems - training, ICT,\n            assessment and infrastructure - that will enable the\n            Ministry of Education and Training (MET) to better implement\n            the kinds of activities included in the first three\n            components. Following are the Components, and\n            Sub-components: A: Inclusive Basic Education: A1 Teaching\n            for Improved Learning Outcomes; A2 Equal Schooling\n            Opportunities. B: Diversity in Secondary Education: B1\n            Diversifying the Secondary Education Curriculum; B2 Career\n            Information and Guidance. C: School Sector Management: C1\n            School-Level Management; C2 System-Level Management. D:\n            Strengthening Core Systems: D1 Staff Training and\n            Communications; D2 Information and Communication\n            Technologies; D3 Assessment and Evaluation; D4 School\n            Infrastructure. Project activities will include: technical\n            assistance; training for teachers, managers and education\n            specialists; purchase of equipment; and civil works (e.g.\n            construction of new schools, and rehabilitation of existing schools)."}, "docdt": "2004-01-23T00:00:00Z"}
