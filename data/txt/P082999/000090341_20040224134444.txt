Tunisia's education sector i s on track to meet its obligations under the Millennium Development Goals
(MDGs).' Already 98 percent o f 6- to 11-year-olds are enrolled in school.              All students will be
completing a full course o f primary schooling' by 2015, if grade promotion rates continue advancing at or
near the rate observed over the last ten years. To achieve this will be all the more difficult because
repetition will have to be reduced, and drop-out eliminated, amongst the most vulnerable students (i.e.
disabled children, children with behavioral problems, children in difficult family circumstances and
children living in extreme poverty). Gender imbalances in education are limited: female students are
slightly under-represented in lower basic education (LBE), but slightly over-represented in upper basic
education (UBE), secondary and higher education. Girls' under-representation in LBE i s the result o f
lower repetition rates, not lower enrollment rates.

Despite the overall positive correlation between education and employment in Tunisia, persistent
unemployment amongst young secondary education graduates points to a mismatch between the skills
acquired at school and those sought by employers. Moreover, women have not yet been able to benefit
fully from their improved educational status: in 2001, the labor force participation rate was 76.0 percent
for men andjust 25.8 percent for women.
Thirty-five years o f declining birthrates are now resulting in a reduction in the LBE student population,
while student numbers (and student diversity) in UBE and secondary education continue to grow in the
medium-term as a result o f increasing primary (LBE) completion rates.               The challenges for the
Government are therefore: to extend improvements aimed at better learning outcomes to the most
vulnerable children, so as to achieve full LBE completion by 2015; to respondto the increasing diversity
o f the secondary education population by widening the range o f education opportunities; to enable the
secondary school system to be attuned to, and then adapt to, the needs o f the Tunisian economy; and to
take advantage o f the "lull" in the size o f the LBE student population by focusing resources in cost-
effective ways on quality improvements.       These challenges have led the Govemment to place quality
improvement at the heart o f its education strategy for 2002-2007, entitled "Tomorrow's school^"^. The
Ministryo f Education and Training (MET)has operationalized this strategy inits EducationAction Plan4

for the period of the Tenth Development Plan (2002-2006). The current project i s designed to support
critical parts o f the Education Action Plan, and therefore to fit into the Government's overall education
strategy.

2. Rationalefor BankInvolvement

The Bank has a long tradition o f support for Tunisia's education sector, with Tunisia taking the Bank's
first ever education loan, in 1962. The most recent CAS (report number R2000-46 and discussed by the
Board o f Directors on April 27, 2000) proposed Bank support for the Government in three major
directions: (a) consolidating long-term development, mainly through human resource development,
natural resources management, transport, rural development and municipal development; (b) supporting
economic reform to enhance competitiveness and increase employment, and (c) promoting new initiatives
that strengthen local institutions, launch new development niches, and mobilize external finance. A new
CAS i s currently in preparation; it will likely emphasize the same elements for the Bank's continued
support o freform inTunisia, around the common theme of developinga knowledge-based economy. The
current project will contribute directly to (a), and indirectly to (b) through human resources development
activities that inter alia improve the quality o f the labor force.

Bank intervention in the area of quality and inclusion i s critical, as both issues are at the forefront o f the
Government's education agenda.         In the areas of introduction of new technologies, evaluation and
research, the Bank can share both years o f global experience with the introduction o f alternative models,
as well as access to expertise in these areas. In other areas, such as secondary education and career
information and guidance, the Bank i s undertaking institution-wide work that will benefit the project.
Finally, the Bank's long-term support through a two-phase, flexible APL i s particularly valuable given the
fiscal constraints, and particularly in light of the major investments needed as a result o f rapid enrollment
growth inupper basic and secondary education.

3. HigherLevel Objectivesto which the Project Contributes

Education i s at the center of the Government's development strategy.           Improved educational status,
particularly for women, correlates with improved health outcomes:           lower maternal mortality, lower
infant morbidity and improved reproductive health. The project will contribute not only directly to the
education MDGs, but indirectly to the health MDGs.

EQPI1will also contribute to a labor force better qualified, and as such, better able to compete in the
global economy, by (i)developing better links between secondary education, on the one hand, and
vocational training and higher education institutions, and the labor market, on the other hand, and (ii)
diversifyingthe secondary education curriculum in ways that make it more relevant to the needs o f the
Tunisian society and economy. A better education system i s a necessary but insufficient condition for
achieving these higher level objectives. Efforts to improve teaching and learning must be matched by
equivalent efforts in other areas (e.g. economic governance, private sector development, investment
climate, telecommunications, scientific research).


B.       PROJECTDESCRIPTION

4. LendingInstrument

Given the long-term vision which underpins changes in the sector, as well as the convergence o f the
Government's objectives with the Bank`s assistance strategy, the program i s being supported by an
Adaptable Program Lending (APL) instrument. This project i s the second phase o f the two-phase APL.

5. ProgramObjectiveand Phases

The purpose o f the Education Quality Improvement Program (EQIP) i s to support the Government's
objectives: to achieve near-universal completion o f basic education (Grades 1 through 9); to provide a
greater number o f students (from a wider range o f backgrounds) with opportunities for post-basic
education; and to modernize the sector in ways that improve the quality o f outputs and the efficiency
with which they are produced.

The first phase o f the two-phase program covers a four-year period (2001-2004), supporting the
implementation of the Government's basic education strategy to improve the quality o f basic education
(LnNo. 7028-TUN). The present project corresponds to the program's secondphase (2004-2007). This
second project (EQIP 11) continues to support education quality improvements, now focusing on:
completing the roll-out o f the child-centered, skills-based teaching methodology (approche par
compktences [APC])through to the end o f basic education; extending this approach to include vulnerable
children; and diversifyingthe secondary curriculum to ensure a better match between a more diverse set
o f students and the demands of the Tunisian economy.

All four measures set up to trigger the second phase o f the APL have been put in place and have been
found satisfactory to the Bank, the latest at the start o f the new school year, in September 2003: (i)             the
roll-out o f the APC program to Grades 3 and 4 inall primary schools; (ii) roll-out o f a "double grade"
                                                                                      the
system (degrds) in Grades 1 through 4 in all primary schools, whereby students are now promoted
automatically at the end o f Grades 1 and 3; (iii)            the application, in at least 25 percent o f schools, of a
system o f "self-assessment", whereby the school management evaluates its strengths and weaknesses, as
an input into the development o f a School Improvement Scheme (projet d'e`tablissement); and (iv) the
development o f a sector-wide strategy to manage student flows, covering the impact o f decreasing student
numbers at the lower basic level, and access to post-basic education whether general, vocational or
higher.

6. ProjectDevelopmentObjectiveand Key Indicators

The main objective o f EQIP I1i s to promote excellence in teaching and learning throughout the school
sector, while continuing the push for equity by ensuring the inclusion o f all children at all levels of the
basic education system. Progress against this objective i s measured by enrollment and completion rates,
disaggregated by gender. Intermediate objectives, each associated with a project component, are shown
inTable 1, alongwiththe corresponding indicators.

7. Project Components

EQIPI1comprises four components and ten subcomponents. The first two components focus directly on
the issue o f quality in the classroom: Component A inbasic education, and Component B in secondary
education. Component C aims at modernizing the management o f the school sector, at the central,
regional and school levels, in ways that improve schools' abilities to deliver quality education.
Component D seeks to enhance the performance o f the core systems - training, ICT, assessment and
infrastructure - that will enable the MET to better implement the kinds o f activities included in the first
three components.

Project activities will include: technical assistance; training for teachers, managers and education
specialists; purchase of equipment; and civil works (e.g. construction o f new schools, and rehabilitation
o f existing schools). For details o f component activities, see Annex 4.

8. Lessons Learned and Reflected inthe Project Design

MET has solid implementation capacity. Experience with EQIPI(and with the Bank's previous lending
operation) shows that the MET has the capacity to handle a large and complex project.                     EQIP I
supervision reports have consistently rated project implementation satisfactory, and the latest report rated
project management highly satisfactory.

Implementation benejk from including opportunities for capacity building in project management.
Project management training i s an essential part of successful implementation.              Existing staff need



                                                         4

opportunities to refresh their skills and knowledge, and to acquire new skills and knowledge. New staff
members need to learn the basics o f project management in the context o f Bank-financed operations.
With EQIPI,the Bankwas able to use non-project sources o f financingto offer limitedtraining, but more
i s needed. This dimension o f project implementationmust bebuilt into the project itself.

Long-term policy development benefits from mid-term knowledge transfer.         "Soft" activities (such as
assessment and research) are as important as the "hard" activities, although they represent a smaller part
than civil works and equipment in project costs. Technical assistance activities can have a significant
impact on policy decisions downstream, allowing dialogue to develop within the Government to ensure
both ownership and sustainability. It i s important therefore to include technical assistance that enables
Government to leam from others, collect information, analyze options and debate policies well in advance
o f policy decision timelines.

Even when the political backingfor education reform is strong, the Bank needs tofocus policy dialogue
on issues of fiscal sustainability. The education reform agenda enjoys strong support at the highest
echelons o f Government, and this support i s reflected in the substantial share o f public expenditure
allocated to the sector. New challenges however face the school system in particular and the education
sector in general: most importantly, rapid increase in student numbers at the higher levels. Education
expenditure as a share o f total public expenditure and GDP i s significant, and that share cannot be
expected to increase. Inorder for the Government to invest in quality improvements inthe sector, it will
have to look for cost-effective solutions that guarantee the fiscal sustainability o f its ambitious reform
program.

9. AlternativesConsidered and Reasonsfor Rejection

Post-Secondary Vocational Training. In2002, school education and vocational training were mergedinto
a single ministry. InJune 2003, the Bank-financed Second Employment and Training Project (Loan No.
4036-TUN) closed. These two events led the Government to consider designing a project that covered
boththe schools sector and the vocational training sector. The Bank team considered that the outcomes o f
the Government's vocational training strategy needed to be better evaluated before moving to the next
lending operation in the sector. In addition, while such a project would have offered the advantage o f
being able to focus on the articulation between the two sectors, the implementation challenge may be too
great even for the MET'Scapacity.

Trade Schools. In2002/03, 2.6 o f UBE students (2.0 percent o f female students and 3.3 percent o f male
students) were in enrolled in trade schools (&coles de mdtiers), stand-alone institutions that constitute a
parallel UBE track generally for the lowest achieving students. The Government i s currently looking to
reform these institutions, and the Bank remains available to discuss further this issue with the
Government.

Early Child Development. The advantages o f ECD in supporting education achievement, particularly for
poor communities, are becoming increasingly obvious. Although the Government has begun instituting a
kindergarten year in some schools, which the project i s supporting, it has been decided that inclusion o f
pre-school ECD inEQIP I1would add complexity to an already complex project.

Second-Phase Budget Support Approach. The Bank raised with the Government the possibility o f
adopting a budget support approach in the design o f EQIP 11. EQIP Iwas designed as a traditional
sectoral investment operation, where the full four-year program o f investment activities was agreed on at
appraisal. The Bank considered that the current situation in the school sector could lend itself to an
approach that involved financing a share of the MET annual investmentbudget against annual progress in
implementing an agreed results-based reform program. The Government indicated that it wished to


                                                     5

remain with the current approach for EQIP 11,because o f the project's tight preparation timeline and also
because o fthe rigor that the Bank's investment lendingprocedures bringto project implementation.

C.       IMPLEMENTATION

10. PartnershipArrangements

Like the first-phase project, EQIP I1 i s financed by the IBRD and the Tunisian Govemment.             The
Government has a broad reform program for education, to which a range o f donors contribute, notably the
European Commission and the African Development Bank (see Annex 2).                  The World Bank has
developed strong cooperative relationships with the EC and the AfDB, as well as with UNICEF, which
has been instrumental in helping the Government test and evaluate innovations in the education sector
(including the child-centered, skills-based teaching approach that EQIPi s now helping the Government to
roll out across the school system).

11. InstitutionalandImplementationArrangements

The project will be executed by the MET, which has decades o f implementation experience in Bank-
financed projects. As in the on-going EQIP I,the MET will integrate project implementation into the
day-to-day management activities o f existing departments. The relevant structures within the MET will be
responsible for the implementation o f the project activities within their mandate.    Each sub-component
will be assigned to a division within the MET structure, the head o f which will be designated the "lead"
for the activities to be implementedunder that sub-component.

EQIP I1will rely on the organizational structure put in place for EQIP I(see organizational chart in
Annex 6). This structure has proved its worth, with the latest PSR rating Project Management "highly
satisfactory". The General Administrator (directeur general des services communs) will be the Project
Director, in charge o f the day-to-day implementation o f the project.        The General Administration
Department (direction genirale des services communs [DGSC]) will be in charge o f all procurement (i.e.
civil works, equipment and services) and financial management. Inthis capacity, the DGSC will prepare
and implement procurement plans, and produce semi-annual financial monitoring reports.

As with EQIP I,civil works activities will be implemented at the regional level. In each region, the
MET'Sregional office (direction regionale de 1'&ducation [DRE]) will collaborate with the regional
office o f the Ministry o f Public Works and Housing (MPWH), under the control o f the regional
governor's office. The functional relationship between the two ministries i s well established both at
central and regional levels.

12. Monitoringand Evaluationof Results

As with EQIP I,an Adviser from the Minister's Office is designated Project Coordinator.                The
Coordinator will be responsible for coordinating activities across the different MET units, and for
monitoring and evaluating results. For the monitoring and evaluation functions, the Coordinator will
collect information from a range o f MET units,including the Statistics Department (bureau des etudes, de
la planiJication et de la programmation). The Coordinator will be responsible for producing an annual
Monitoring and Evaluation Report.

An oversight committee (comite depilotage), comprising the Minister (or hisrepresentative), the Project
Director, the Project Coordinator and all the relevant unit directors, will meet every quarter. An extended
oversight committee, broadened to include representation from the Ministry o f Development and
International Cooperation and the Ministry o f Finance will meet once a year, at a time when the budget i s


                                                     6

beingprepared. Inaddition, the Coordinator will meet on a regular basis with sub-component "leads" to
monitor project activities.

The indicators that will be used to monitor results are shown in Annex 3. The choice o f indicators was
based on a trade-off between four criteria: relevance (does the indicator measure progress towards the
objective?), measurability (is there a quantitative methodology to derive the result?), feasibility (do
reliable data exist or can they be collected in a straightforwardmanner?), and simplicity (is the indicator
easy to understand?). Completion rates (also known as attainment rates) are used as a proxy for student
learning achievement, since no indicator o f learning quality i s currently available. Results from
international comparative studies (e.g. TIMSS) are not available often enough, and do not measure a
country's later performance against its earlier performance; regional standardized tests used to evaluate
implementation o f the child-centered, skills based AFT are not reliable enough at a national level; and
the CNIPRE's national school quality monitoring system, which will test students' skills at the end o f
Grades 4, 6, 8 and 10 (by random sampling), will not produce its first national results in time to provide
baseline data. However, the national monitoring system will be piloted in Grade 4 at the end o f 2003104;
it was decided therefore to include this as an additional indicator, without target values at this stage, to
highlightthe importance o fmonitoring learningoutcomes directly.

13. Sustainability

As with other projects in the education sector in Tunisia (both past and ongoing), the Government
initiated the preparation process, and there i s a clear commitment to the project development objectives
articulated above.     The mainstreaming o f project activities into the MET'Score business, and the
consultative process followed thus far, ensure that the main activities (as well as their underlying
rationale) extend deep into the MET structure at central, regional and even local levels. Moreover, by
relying on the existing MET structures, EQIP I1does not create artificial, exogenous units, but rather
contributes to strengthening existing institutions and improving their implementation capacity. The risks
related to the institutional sustainability o f the project are therefore minimal.

As noted earlier, Tunisia devotes significant resources to basic and secondary education: in 2002, this
amounted to 13 percent o f total public expenditure (5.1 percent o f GDP), and 23 percent of total public
recurrent expenditure. Tunisia i s expected to show a solid economic performance in the mid-term, with
real GDP growth estimates ranging from 5.5 percent in 2003 to 6.6 percent in 2008.'               Total public
expenditure i s expected to increase by an annual average o f 4.5 percent over the same periodU6 Thirty
percent o f public school education investment expenditure was financed by extemal borrowing in 2002;
the share was 29 percent in 2003, and i s expected to be 25 percent in 2004. Given projections o f GDP
and total public expenditure, the project i s fiscally sustainable over the implementationperiod.

The level o f incremental recurrent costs that result from the project -- salaries o f additional staff in UBE
and secondary education, non-salary recurrent costs, maintenance o f infrastructure, maintenance o f
equipment - are shown in the following table.

D.       APPRAISALSUMMARY

16. EconomicandFinancialAnalyses

The economic analysis undertaken in November 2003, which appears as Annex 9, highlights important
mid-term risks for secondary education (given the anticipated increase in student numbers in that sub-
sector), if steps are not taken to shift resources from basic education (where student numbers are dropping
due to demographic decline).

Using MET data, the Bank team developed a financing model that measures the fiscal impact o f
Government policies aimed at universal education. Results suggest that, with a GDP growth rate o f 5.5
percent, the Government can attain full completion o f the nine years o f basic education by 2015, without
changing the current broad settings, by runninga deficit in recurrent expenditures equivalent to less than
0.2 percent o f its operating budget.

The same modeling however produced worrying results for secondary education, where increasing
student numbers would produce significant deficits. The decline in the demographics o f 6- to 11-year-
olds however offer the possibility o f meeting the fiscal challenge, by moving up to 10 percent resources
from basic to secondary education. Given that 98 percent o f recurrent expenditure in primary education
goes into salaries, transferring resources between sub-sectors constitutes a major challenge for the
Govemment. The Government i s acutely aware o f this challenge, and i s looking at measures that will
enable a transfer of resources between sub-sectors.          In particular, the Govemment is looking to the

project's communications strategy to improve dialogue with the teachers' union, inways that will enable
itto makeprogress aroundthis sensitive issue.

17. Technical

Experience in Tunisia under previous education projects, notably the Secondary Education Improvement
Project (LnNo. 3786-TUN) and E Q P I (Ln No. 7028-TUN), as well as experience in a range o f other
countries, suggests that the technical choices the Government has made for education policy have a sound
basis: the move to child-centered teaching; targeting resources to disadvantaged students; buildingup a
kindergarten program; and adapting the secondary education curriculum to a diversified student
population.

Each sub-component o fthe project was prepared by a high-caliber team o f MET officials. Supervision o f
the technical preparatory work has been entrusted to the Project Coordinator, overseeing the preparation
o f a Project Manual (covering the project's technical content), and to the Project Director, overseeing the
Operations Manual (covering operational procedures).

18. Fiduciary

The overall financial management risk i s very low in this project. The MET has implemented a number
o f projects including the ongoing EQIP I,  with the same project management structure and has performed
well. The current project i s progressing per schedule and poses no particular financial management
issues. The financial management assessment undertaken during the appraisal mission covered EQP I
accounting, its internal control system, financial management organization structure, audit arrangements
inplace, and the information and reporting system. The project uses the government public accounting
and financial management system. There has been no Country Financial Accountability Review yet for
Tunisia. The government system has, however, been assessed in the context o f various Bank projects in
the country and i s considered satisfactory and o f good standards.

The current project has an adequate staff capacity, accounting and internal control system inplace, as well
as satisfactory annual audit arrangements. The same arrangements will continue for the new project.
Overall these arrangements meet the Bank`s financial management requirements.               EQP Iproduces
satisfactory Project Management Reports (PMR) and will be able to produce the Financial Monitoring
Reports (FMR) for the new project given that these are a simplified form o f the PMR. A draft FMR has
been prepared and i s part o f the Operations Manual.

The only issue with the current financial management arrangements concerns the financial reporting.
While the project fulfils all the reporting requirements, there are potential efficiencies to be derived from
a more integrated comprehensive management information system. These have been discussed with the
project management team who are currently in the process o f contracting a software company to help
address the issue.

19. Social

A longitudinal study was undertaken ahead o f EQPI, on two sets o f data covering both learning
                                                           based
outcome and household factors, to determine the implications o f the highly selective promotion practices
o f the Tunisian education system for education efficiency and equity'. The first set o f data relates to 953

drop-outs randomly drawn from 100 public primary (LBE) schools, while the second set contains the
Grade 6 examination scores and school grade averages o f the full cohort o f almost 250,000 students. By
focusing on the reduction o f drop-out rates and concentrating on schools catering for the most
disadvantaged children (through the "Priority Schools Program"),              the project will benefit more
specifically the poor.

The consensus-building efforts of the Government have been in place consistently throughout the
preparatory phase o f the EQIP program and even prior to that with the discussions around the
"Tomorrow's Schools" strategy development. Initially, MET efforts centered on its own officials at
central, regional and local levels, with invitations extended to relevant ministries as needed. Then this
consultative process was expanded to include other Government actors, including all key ministries and
non-governmental entities (such as the Tunisian Organization for Education and Family).                   Finally,
consultations were held in every region, involving all the stakeholders (including parents, students,
teachers and community leaders), who were invitedto share their thoughts and air their concems.

20. Environment

No large scale or irreversible impacts are anticipated from this project. Experience with EQIP Ishows
that the impacts are limited to those that can occur during school construction (nuisance to neighborhood,
and hazards to children, workers andor the public), and those resulting from the operation o f the schools
(wastewater and solid waste management). The latest safeguards cluster mission to Tunisia, undertaken
inApril 2003, concluded that EQIPIshouldnotbe consideredan at-risk project.

For EQIP 11, the Government will build on experience gained during EQIP I. The MET will select
regions in which schools will be built, based on educational criteria and priorities, and the regional
govemors will make the final selection o f municipalities based on the school mapping exercise. Land
acquisition issues if any will be documented as part o f the environmental procedure included in the
operations manual. The MET includes in its operational manual a detailed environmental management
procedure, including screening, supervision and monitoring.

Environmental Assessment (OP 4.01). In order to comply with OP 4.01, an environmental assessment
review procedure was developed for EQP I,jointly with National Environmental Protection Agency
(Agence nationale pour la protection de I'environnement) and MET, to ensure adequate treatment o f
environmental concerns in the construction o f new schools under the project. This procedure will be
applied to EQP11, with some refinement resulting from lessons learned during the first phase. As a first
step, the MET will screen sites, to identify any that carry potential safeguard issues.       Each school
construction identified as carrying potential safeguard issues will then be subjected to an environmental
assessment which will include appropriate consultation with the affected people, if any. Inmost cases,
school sites have already been selected as part o f an urban planning and land use scheme. Inthose cases
where no scheme exists, the selection process will be initiated by local authorities, and its acceptability
validated through the environmental review procedure described above. The Bank will finance only those
schools cleared under the agreed environmental review procedures, as determined by the Bank through
regular review. During construction activities, compliance monitoring to ensure implementation o f the
recommended mitigation measures will be delegated by the MET to the supervision architects, with
oversight responsibility by the local representatives from the Ministry o f Public Works and Housing.

Land Acquisition. The recent expropriation law has introduced major improvements in land acquisition.
The Safeguards Cluster mission in April 2003 noted that if publicly owned land (terres domaniales ou
publiques) was not available for a school site, the Government either bought land at the going market
price through an open procedure, or accepted land as a voluntary donation from a private owner (who, for
personal or economic reasons, sees an advantage in donating land for educational purposes).           The
Government does not accept a donation o f land that could negatively impact an individual's livelihood.

A land acquisition assessment procedure (&valuation des conditions d'acquisition de terrains) was
developed for EQPI.Land acquisition assessments conducted duringthe first phase o f the project show
that there are no issues related to social safeguards, in particular involuntary resettlement and land
acquisition. The results o f applying this procedure to EQIPIshowed that private owners in fact benefited
from donating land for school construction, as a new school brings with it improvements to the
surrounding area (e.g. roads, water, and sewerage), which raise the value o f remaining land owned by the
donor. For this reason, OP/BP 4.12 will not be triggered. Duringimplementation, for each site acquired
via donation, a land acquisition assessmentbe conducted prior to construction to ascertain that acquisition
has not impactednegatively on any persons or groups and that there are no issues relatedto OPBP 4.12.

Disclosure. A description o f the environmental procedures has been disclosed in-country and in the
Bank's Infoshop (AC257 dated November 26, 2003); the site-specific environmental assessments will be
disclosed in-country.

22. PolicyExceptions and Readiness

No policy exceptions are anticipated.

Readiness was determined during the appraisal mission, using criteria developed during the most recent
CPPR mission, held inJuly 2003. Inaccordance with these criteria, the MET, amongst other things:
        organized a preparationworkshop;
        established an oversight committee;
        appointed a contact person to head project preparation;
        participated injoint project preparation;
    0   prepared the procurement plan for the first year of the project.

Countrv Background"

Tunisia has made the firm choice o f integrating more closely the international economy, a strategic move
that will lay the ground for faster growth by stimulating investment and improving efficiency. The
transition to greater integration into global markets will raise challenges however, due to competitive
pressures and exposure to volatility.

Thanks to a steady pace o f structural refoms and sound macroeconomic management, Tunisia's non-
agricultural GDP grew on average by 5.7 percent per year during the Ninth Development Plan (1997-
200l),  outpacing Middle East North Africa and lower middle-income countries' averages. Healthy
economic growth laid the groundwork for poverty reduction, with the poor and economically vulnerable
accounting for about 10 percent o f the population in 2000, down from 17 percent in 1995, and a
proportionate decline inthe number o f people inextreme poverty to about 4 percent.

During 1997-2001 inflation was cut to 2.9 percent on average, while fiscal deficits were kept at 3.2
percent o f GDP and the external current account deficit was maintained, on average, at 3.4 percent o f
GDP, despite a temporary widening in 2001. Prudent macro-economic policies have helped Tunisia
improve its access to intemational financial markets, allowing the country to borrow at long maturities
and under relatively favorable conditions.

On the downside, despite healthy employment growth at 2.7 percent per year, the number o fjobs created
was just enough to match the increase in labor supply. Unemployment thus remained sizeable, at about
15-16 percent. During the first two years o f the Tenth Development Plan (2002-06), non-agricultural
GDP growth slowedto a projected3.5 percent, below the 6.0 percent goal for the whole 2002-06 period.

Sector Background: Current Situation

Education Sector.      Education stands at the heart o f the Government's strategy for growth and
development, as it aims to build the kind o f human capital necessary to enable Tunisia to compete inthe
global knowledge-based economy.         In all sub-sectors of the education system - primary education,
secondary education, vocational training, and higher education -, the Government i s malung major
investments in an effort to cater for growing numbers and to improve the quality o f education outputs in
line with the needs o f the productive sector.

Millennium Development Goals. As a member State o f the United Nations, Tunisia committed itself in
2000 to achieve the MillenniumDevelopment Goals (MDGs)." Two o f the MDGs deal directly with
education: universal primary education and gender equality.

International Comparisons of Learning Achievement. As a participant in the 1999 Third International
Mathematics and Science Survey (TIMSS), Tunisia strengthened its learning achievement assessment
program. TIMSS compared achievement in mathematics and science in a sample o f Grade 8 students in
38 countries. Figures Al.3 and A l . 4 present the survey results as a function o f per capita GNP. Inboth
subject areas, the Tunisian students' average score fell on or near the trend line, and their individual
scores produced the smallest standard deviation in the survey.                            Whilst the results o f international
comparative studies should be interpreted with caution, it i s nevertheless o f concern that, at an
international level, no Tunisian students reached the top decile, and less than 5% featured in the top
quintile. As for gender differences, male students outstripped their female counterparts by a significant
margin inboth mathematics and science.

Labor Market Enty. Overall, technological change and globalization increase the relative demand for a
skilled workforce. In Tunisia, returns on education are positive, inasmuch as wages increase with age,
educational level and skill level.16 However, inthe area of employment, women have not yet been able to
benefit fully from their improved educational status: in 2001, the labor force participation rate was 76.0
percent for men and just 25.8 percent for women. The Middle East and North Africa region has the
greatest gender gap in labor force participation: in the East Asia and Pacific region, the female labor
force participationrate i s 75.0 per~ent.'~

Despite the overall positive correlation between
education and employment, persistent unemployment                                       Fig. A1.5: Unemployment Rate,

Demographic Change. Following a steady decline over the previous 35 years, the birthrate in Tunisia
reached 2.2 in 1998; at this level, a population stabilizes. The drop was dramatic: in 1970, the average
number o f children per woman was still above 6.0. The fall was the result o f social, cultural and legal
changes to women's status in Tunisia, changes that encouraged women to defer marriage and practice
birth control.'*          The population pyramids in Figures A1.6 and A1.7 show a "dip" passing behind a
"wave";      this dip is already having an impact on the school-age population.

Sector Background: Challenges

From the situation described briefly above, four major challenges emerge for the Tunisian school system:
(i)managing demographic change;                  (ii)integrating vulnerable children;                  (iii)managing secondary
students' diversity; and (iv) matching skills to the needs o f the economy.

Managing Demographic Change. Tunisia's lower birthrate will have an impact on the school-age
population throughout the period o f the project, and beyond. This demographic change interacts with an
improvement in school promotion rates to produce an increase in secondary education student numbers
and a decrease in basic education student numbers. According to MET projections covering the period
2000-2010, basic education student numbers will decrease by 40 percent (or 470,000 students) and
secondary education student number will increase by 80 percent (or 310,000 students).

Managing Secondary Students'Diversity. As an increasing proportion o f children graduate to UBE and
then to secondary education, the student population at these levels becomes more diverse. This diversity
i s not just socio-economic, but i s reflected also in the wide range o f experiences, tastes, abilities and
aptitudes. As a result, the role o f secondary education i s not simply to prepare students for higher
education, but to prepare them for a range o f post-secondary opportunities. It i s essential that the
diversification o f educational programs (i.e. subject tracks, teaching styles, etc.) be based on relevant
criteria, such as abilities and economic opportunities, and not on factors like gender, socio-economic
background or disability.

Matching Skills to the Needs of the Economy. Secondary education must be able to provide its graduates
with a set o f skills that are common to post-secondary activities, and with the basis for developing
specialized skills.    Given the rapidly changing economic context in which businesses function, the
secondary education system has to have the ability to listen to, and adapt itself to, the new needs of
employers. Likewise, students and employers require reliable and up-to-date information on education
programs and on the job opportunities they lead to, within a comprehensive career information and
guidance system.

Sector Background: Government Strategy

The Government has been implementing major education reform since 1991, and provided new impetus
to these reform efforts in 2002, with the passage o f the new Education Law (Loi d'orientation sur
1'&ducation et 1'enseignementscolaire). The law sets out the principles agreed on as part o f an extensive
consultation process, begun in 1998, that led to the development o f the Government's reform strategy,
known as "Tomorrow's                    Consideration o f the challenges outlined above led the Government
to articulate its reform around the improvement o f teaching and learning quality.

Indeed, the four challenges require the Government to
address issues o f quality (see Figure A1.9).        The
impact o f the declining birthrate gives the Government
room     to    direct   more     resources   to    quality
improvements;       integrating vulnerable children into
the school system requires teachers and managers to
extend their child-centered approach to these children
with special needs;      the growing diversity amongst
secondary education students calls on the MET to
diversify its educational offerings; and finally, the MET must make secondary education more relevant to
the needs of the economy, in order to correct the current skills mismatch between education output and
labor input.

education approaches universality, it i s the most                         `school-age   populations average HC
vulnerable children that are the last to be included.         5
These hardest-to-reach children are also the "hardest        I

to   teach",    inasmuch      as   their disadvantaged           1
backgrounds provide them with lower home-derived                                                 Time
human capital than other children. As a result, the
more children drawn into school, the lower the in-school population's average accumulation o f human
capital, but also the greater the dispersion of human capital "scores" amongst the in-school population.
More importantly, the more children drawn into school, the higher the average accumulation of human
capital o f the entire school-age population (whether inschool or out o f school).

Focusing on Quality in LBE. Inthe late 1990s, the MET piloted a new approach to teaching ina sample
o f schools, with a view to improving teaching and learning quality. The approach, now called "approche
par compktences" (APC), places the child at the center of the education enterprise and aims to ensure that
every child acquires the basic skills necessary to further study and work. A positive assessment o f the
pilot, undertaken with the help o f UNICEF, led the MET to take the decision to roll APC out through the
entire school sector, beginning with Grade 1 in2000/01. This emphasis on quality inLBE was reinforced
by two other programs: a priority schools program (programme d'dcoles a prioritd dducative), which
recognizes that schools catering for students whose achievements scores are typically lower than the
national average often require additional resources to raise their game;                    and the establishment o f a
kindergarten grade, financed by the State in schools catering for disadvantaged groups, in recognition of
the significant boost in later learning achievement that an early intervention can provide, particularly to
the poorest children. The MET has begun taking advantage o f the decline in the school-age population,
by redeploying some excess primary education teachers into the priority schools program (lowering
student-teacher ratios inparticipating schools) and into the kindergarten grade program.-

Integrating Disabled Children into Mainstream Schooling. In 1990, the Government established the
Institute for the Promotion o f Persons with Disabilities (Institut de promotion des handicapds). In the
same year, the Government launched the School Social Action Program (programme d`action sociale
scolaire), which was designed to reduce the risk o f poor learning achievement by screening the school
population for disabilities and by providing additional support to students with disabilities. Despite these
efforts, the integration o f children with disabilities in the Tunisian school system remains limited, in part
because o f the social perception o f persons with disabilities. The Government has recently indicated its
intention to work towards the complete integration of children with disabilities into the school system,
and has set up an inter-ministerial committee to develop a national school integration strategy. UNICEF
has been instrumental inmoving this aspect o f children's rights forward inTunisia.

Diverszfiing Secondaly Education Programs. The MET has opted for a strategy o f gradual specialization
for'secondary education students. All students will share a common curriculum in Grade 10, the first year
o f secondary education. In Grade 11, students will enter a broad subject "track", and will then narrow
their choices as the advance through Grade 12 and on to Grade 13, when they sit the baccalaurdat
examination. Other elements o f this secondary education strategy include: "taster courses" that allow
Grade 8 students to make informed choices later in their school career;                          the creation o f a career
information and guidance system; and the creation o f new subject tracks (Technology, Arts and Sport),




                                                        19

alongside the existing tracks, which will themselves be modernized (Language Arts, Social Sciences,
Basic and Applied Science).

Strengthening Links to Vocational Training. As part o f its strategy to diversify the post-basic education
curriculum, the MET i s introducing programs to strengthen links to pre-employment vocational training:
vocational training will be considered a subject track alongside secondary education;                 the secondary
education curriculum will involve courses in both secondary schools (lycdes) and in vocational training
centers (centres deformation professionnelle), particularly for students in the new Technology track; and
students will be able to transfer more easily between the vocational training track and the various
secondary education tracks.

                 TUNISIA: Education Quality Improvement Program(EQIP) Phase 2

Principles of Project Design. In designing EQIP 11, the MET applied the following principles: the
project should support the Government's reform program and, more specifically, correspond to parts o f
the MET's Education Action Plan2'; it should fit within the Bank's priorities for Tunisia, as set out inthe
Country Assistance Strategy; it should cover areas where the Bank can add real value; it should produce
measurable results; it should fit within the MET's implementation capacity and within the available
financial envelope; finally, it should strike a balance between activities that implement decisions taken as
apart o f the Tenth Development Plan, activities that provide analyses necessary for the preparation o f the
EleventhDevelopment Plan, and activities that reinforce the MET's institutional capacity.

Project Components. EQIP I1comprises four components, each with two to four subcomponents. The
first two components focus directly on the issue o f quality in the classroom: Component A in basic
education, and Component B in secondary education.                  Component C aims at modernizing the
management o f the school sector, at the central, regional and school levels, in ways that improve schools'
abilities to deliver quality education. Component D seeks to enhance the performance o f the core systems
-  training, communication, ICT, assessment and infrastructure          -that will enable the MET to better
implement the kindso f activities included inthe first three components.

  before December 31 o f each year, the objective o f which i s to assess past achievements, to present an
  action plan for the coming year and to analyze costs and financing for the preceding year and submit
  detailed budgets for the coming year. ,


  Project Implementation. The project's components and sub-components would be implemented by
  existing departments o f the MET. The DGSC will be responsible for the overall management o f all
  project-related activities and will be in charge o f all procurement process.               Implementation
  responsibilities for each sub-component o f the project are indicated in the organizational chart. The
  detailed responsibilities and implementation arrangements for each subcomponent are discussed in the
  Operations Manual.

  For sub-component D4, special implementation arrangements will be instituted. The direction des
  bStiments et de l'e'quipement (DBE) will play an advisory and resource management role for this
  component. As for EQIP I,all civil works will be fully delegated to the regions. The DBE, with the
  assistance o f decentralized units, such as the MET'S 23 regional offices (directions re'gionales de
  1'e'ducation [DFW]) and the 23 regional offices o f the Ministry o f Public Works and Housing (MPWH),
  would be responsible for all civil works activities. As for the equipment and supply foreseen under
  subcomponent school infrastructure, procurement will be done at the Central level, i.e. through the
  DGSC. For new schools, the DBE's responsibilities will include review and approval o f individual
  school designs prepared by local design firms, ad-hoc participation inbid review and award o f contracts,
  while the day-to-day construction monitoring will be carried out by the MPWH's regional offices.
  Activities aimed at strengthening the capacity for equipment maintenance would be under the
' responsibility o f the DBE.

Overall Financial Management Risk Assessment and Conclusion. The overall financial management risk
i s very low inthis project. The Ministry o f Education and Training (MET) has implementeda number of
projects including the ongoing EQIP I,     with the same project management structure and has performed
well. The current project i s progressing per schedule and poses no particular financial management
issues.   The financial management assessment undertaken during the appraisal mission covered the
current project (EQIP I)   accounting, its internal control system, its financial management organization
structure, the audit arrangements inplace, and the information and reporting system. The current system
has an adequate accounting and internal control system in place and satisfactory audit arrangements.
Overall it meets the Bank's financial managementrequirements and project board presentation conditions.
The only issue raised here i s with regard to the financial reporting. While, the project produces all the
reporting requirements, there are potential efficiencies to be derived from a more integrated
comprehensive management information system.

Brief Description ofthe Project. The main objective o f EQIP I1i s to promote excellence inteaching and
learning throughout the school sector, while continuing the push for equity by ensuring the inclusion o f
all children at all levels o f the basic education system. The project comprises four components, each
with two to four subcomponents. The first two components focus directly on the issue o f quality inthe
classroom: Component A in basic education, and Component B in secondary education. Component C
aims at modernizing the management o f the school sector, at the central, regional and school levels, in
ways that improve schools' abilities to deliver quality education. Component D seeks to enhance the
performance o f the core systems -training, ICT, assessment and infrastructure -that will enable the MET
to better implement the kinds o f activities included inthe first three components.

Country Issues. There has been no Country Financial Accountability Assessment done yet for Tunisia.
The government system has however been assessedinthe context of various Bankprojects inthe country
and i s considered satisfactory and o f good standards. The public sector group o f MNSED has reviewed
the overall budget management performance o f the public sector inTunisia and found it o f highstandards
(with the exception o f budget formulation, which is considered rather outdated and in need for reform).
EQIPIuses the government public accounting and financial management system. EQIPI1will use the
same system and organization staff and structure.

Risk Analysis. As stated above the risk i s very low inthis project given the performance o f the institution
implementing it with the current and prior Bank projects. Projects in general, are implemented according
to plan, on schedule and in line with the project procedures and objectives. Audit reports are issued
annually and in general on time and do not include any major issue. There are no risksto flag.

Financial Management: Organization Structure, Accounting, and Internal Control. For public sector
projects with external financing sources, the accounting function i s performed by two departments in the
MET : the Department o f Financial Affairs (direction des affaires Jinancieres [DAF]) and the
Disbursement Section (service charge' de de'caissement) o f the Department o f Buildings and Equipment
(direction des bdiments et de l'kquipement [DBE]). Two parallel systems o f cash-basis accounting are
maintained:    ADAJ3 is a computerized accounting system for the public expenditures reflecting the
Tunisian share of the budget, and SIADE (SystBme informatise' d'aide ci la dette exte'rieure [Information
System for Foreign Debt]) i s a computerized accounting system for all the foreign expenditures funded by
foreign funding. The latter aims at maintaining separate accounting records for the foreign debt
management and for donors reporting requirements. The system i s centralized but operated at the level o f




                                                      36

the MET (data entry and maintenance). Accounting records are entered into one or the other of the
systems once the payment takes place based on a set o f well definedprocedures.

For IBRD loans, accounting records are kept in the SIADE system and maintained by the disbursement
unit where payments also take place. Payments are prepared at this unit once the documentation is
received from technical departments after clearance. Accounting documentation i s then reviewed again at
the disbursement unit, and payment orders are prepared and submitted for approval to the Director
General in charge o f the project. These are then sent to the Banque centrale de Tunisie (BCT), where the
special account (SA) i s maintained for payments. The BCT reviews the supporting documentation, the
eligibility o f expenditures per the procedures and legal agreement then proceeds with the payment when
everything i s considered satisfactory.

The MET Disbursement Unit has been strengthened over the past two to three years by a number o f
qualified financial management staff    -two HEC graduates -, bringing to three the total number o f staff
with accounting and financial management background.

Loan proceeds flow from the Bank to the BCT, and disbursements are made based on payment orders
received from the Disbursement unit. Payments from the loan proceeds are centralized at the
Disbursement unit. Monthly reconciliation o f the SA i s made by the Disbursement unit. The special
account i s monitored and managed by the Central Bank. Replenishments into the SA are made based on
traditional disbursement methods, and are prepared and sent to the Bank by the BCT.                     These
arrangements have been considered satisfactory by the Bank.

The 2002 audit o f EQIP Ii s unqualified and does not include any major issue regarding project internal
controls.

Budgeting and Budgetary Control. The budgeting process starts annually in January o f the preceding
year, and covers budgets for the Bank-financed projects. The budget i s approved before December 31 o f
each year. All expenditures during the year are committed and paid for only if they are included in the
approved budget. Strict budgetary control i s in place through the computerized public sector budgetary
system. Once implementation o f an activity i s complete, this is reviewed and cleared by the technical
departments (regional and central) for payment. Payment takes place in two parts: the Government-
financed part i s processed by the direction des affaires JinanciBres (Finance Directorate), while the loan-
financed part i s processed by the MET'SDisbursement Unit through a payment order from the SA. No
comparisons are made between budgeted and actual expenditures. As part o f the management information
system o f the ongoing EQIP I,an integrated software was developed.                It needs however further
refinements to be fully operational (see below).        It is therefore, recommended that as part o f the
updatehevision o f the integrated software, the budgetary control/comparison information be incorporated
into the system andbereflectedinthe project financial monitoringreports (see below).

Reporting and Database Management. As stated earlier, for project accounting records, the two public
sector accounting software A D D and SIADE are used to maintain the accounting records o f the
Government contribution and the national debt financing respectively. These are used to make daily on-
line data entry. In addition, four other software applications are being used: Excel spreadsheet for
reporting purposes, and 4th Dimension (a Quattro database template) and an Access data base are being
used to monitor various types o f commitments and disbursements. A fourth software was developed as
part o f the preparation o f the ongoing EQIP I,  designed to integrate all the information, result in a single
data entry, reduce the number o f overlapping software applications and ensure comprehensive reporting.
The software has not been completely utilized due to various configuration problems and to a lack of
good upfront definition o f users needs. It i s used only partially to prepare some information for the PMR
requirements o f EQIP I. i s no interface between all existing applications, which results in a number
                          There


                                                      37

o f redundancies and inefficiency in the use o f staff time. The Unit personnel produces the required
reporting but with highlevel o f inefficiencies.

The project management are aware of these issues and are working on revising the reporting software to
take into consideration all users needs and avoid redundancies. It was agreed duringthe appraisal mission
that the consulting firm which developed the PMR software, be contacted again to upgrade the software
taking into account the various problems encounteredand revise the software accordingly.

The consultant will need to integrate the financial monitoring reporting (FMR) requirements as agreed
during the appraisal mission. The FMRs are due regularly. Periodicity will be determined during
appraisal. These reports should be prepared and submitted to the Bank at least semi-annually. They
should include: a statement o f sources and uses o f funds for the period and cumulatively including the
project accounts balances; a statement on the use o f funds by components and category of expenditures;
a report on the procurement activities not subject to the Bank's prior review; and a report on the activities
physical progress indicators.

Audit Arrangements. The annual audit i s performed by the Contrde ge`ne`ral des Jinances (CGF), an
entity o f the Ministry o f Finance, as i s the case for all the public sector implemented projects. The same
entity will be auditing EQIP 11. Auditors review mainly the work o f the disbursement unit and the DBE,
inadditionto the BCT'srecords of SA and replenishment requests. The audit should cover all aspects of
the project and all sources o f project revenues and expenditures. It should cover all the components o f the
project at all levels o f project implementation. Coverage should include the audit o f the financial
transactions and an assessment o f the financial management system including the internal controls and an
opinion on these. It should be carried out in accordance with acceptable auditing standards. Terms o f
reference o f the audit should be reviewed by the Bank. The annual audit report will be submitted no later
than six months following the end o f the fiscal year being audited.

The project i s also subject to the audit by the Cour des comptes from time to time based on
documentation received from the MET annually.

Flow of Funds. Government counterpart funding will be forthcoming as activities are implemented and
expenditures incurred. Payments are made directly through the government own budget system and are
made through the MET'Sexisting public sector system and handled by its Finance and Administration
Division following their existing internal control systems and procedures. Payments are made directly
from the govemment's accounts at the Treasury. Counterpart funding has been always forthcoming on
time as expenditures are incurred and payments placed into the system. The Bank team expects a smooth
counterpart funding for the activities o f the project as has been always the case.

Disbursement Arrangements. The proceeds o f the IBRD loan will be disbursed in accordance with the
Disbursement Guidelines outlined in the Disbursement Handbook, and will be used to finance project
activities through the disbursement procedures currently in use. As projected by Bank's standard
disbursement profiles, disbursements will be completed four months after project closure. Disbursements
will bemade against standard IBRDdocumentation.

Special Account. To facilitate disbursement o f eligible expenditures for works, goods and services, the
Government will open a Special Account (SA) inUS dollars at the B C T to cover part o f IBRD's share o f
eligible expenditures to be administered by the BCT. The authorized allocation o f the special account
would be the equivalent Euros7.O million covering an estimated four (4) months o f eligible expenditures
financed by IBRD. Initially the authorized allocationwill be limited to Euros3.0 million until cumulative
disbursement reach a level equivalent to Euros 8.0 million. The CBT will be responsible for submitting
monthly replenishment applications with appropriate supporting documentation for expenditures incurred

and will retain and make the documents available for review by IBRD supervision missions and project
auditors. To the extent possible, all o f IBRD's share o f expenditures will be paid through the special
account. All expenditures eligible for IBRD financing o f less than US$lOO,OOO equivalent will be paid
from the SA. The SA will be replenished through the submission o f Withdrawal Applications on a
monthly basis and will include reconciled bank statements and other documents as my be required .

Payments from the loan financing are centralized by the MET at the Disbursement Unit. Once services
are rendered and /or activities implemented, payment requests are reviewed by the technical departments
such as the DBE, the MIS, etc, for the technical aspects o f the activities completed. They are also
verified by the technical services for compliance with the procedures and regulations and supported by
proper documentation then forwarded to the Disbursement Unit for payment. The Disbursement Unit
proceeds then with the verification o f the eligibility o f the expenditure and submits the request either for
direct payment to the World Bank, in the case o f a direct payment, or to the BCT for expenditures to be
paid out o f the SA. Payment orders are sent for payments to the BCT with the supporting documentation.
The BCT reviews in its turn the documentation to ensure its compliance with the terms of the Loan
Agreement and project documentation and ensures the eligibility o f the expenditure then proceeds with
the payment, when eligible. Records, reconciliation, and documentation for withdrawal are gathered,
prepared and maintainedby the disbursement unit. The B C T monitors the levels o f the SA and prepares
and submits withdrawal applications to the Bank for replenishments. traditional disbursement methods o f
SOEs and SA replenishment will be used by the project.

The SA i s audited annually by the CGF. The BCT team in charge o f the Bank's special accounts for the
Bank's portfolio in Tunisia i s familiar with the Bank's disbursement and procurement rules and
procedures and its performance i s considered satisfactory.

Use of Statements of Expenditures. SOEs will be used for all expenditures for: (i) under contracts
                                                                                      works
costing less than USS2.0 million equivalent each and all other contracts for works not subject to prior
review ; (ii)  goods under contracts costing less than US$500,000; (iii)     services under consultant firms
contracts costing less than US$100,000 equivalent each and under individual consultant contracts costing
less than US$50,000 equivalent each. The supporting documentation would be maintainedby DGSC and
made available for review by Bank supervision missions. Documentation relating to SOEs would be
retained for up to one year from the date the Bank receives the audit report for the fiscal year inwhich the
last withdrawal from the loan account was made.

Retroactive Financing. Inorder to maintain school construction timelines that allow for the first batch o f
new schools to open for the 2004105 school year, the MET will begin construction ahead o f the loan
effectiveness date, scheduled for April 1, 2004. As a result, initial payments to construction firms will
likely be made ahead of that date.       No exceptions are sought on limits imposed by OP 12.10 on
Retroactive Financing: no payments will be made ahead o f the appraisal date o f November 21, 2003, and
the total amount o f such payments will not be more than 10 percent o f the loan amount. The Borrower
was notified during the appraisal mission that any such payments are made entirely at its option and
without commitment on the part o f the Bank. The Executive Directors were notified o f the likelihood o f
retroactive financing through the Monthly Operational Summary, and this information has also been
disclosed through the Project Information Document.

Conditions and Financial Covenants. None.

Financial Management Supervision Plan. Given the low risk this project represents in addition to desk
work on audits, FMRs and other matters an annual supervision mission o f the financial management i s
recommended. There will be also opportunities to visit with the project and review financial management
aspects, as needed, duringother country focused financial management activities as they take place.

                 TUNISIA: EducationQualityImprovementProgram(EQIP) Phase2

General

Decree No. 2002-3158 dated December 17, 2002, which amends Decree No. 99-2013 dated September
13, 1999), sets out the basic regulations governingthe public procurement systemin Tunisia. This Decree
i s supplemented by Decree No. 2003-1638 o f August 2003 which modifies and clarifies certain
provisions. Tunisia's current procurement system i s on the whole soundly configured, but contains
aspects that conflict with the Bank guidelines on procurement. The overall country procurement
architecture will be reviewed and the necessary reforms proposed as part o f the Country Procurement
Assessment Review scheduled for FY04.            In the meantime, National Competitive Bidding (NCB)
procedures will be carried out in accordance with Tunisia's procurement laws and regulations, acceptable
to the Bank, provided that: (i)bidsare advertised innationalnewspapers with wide circulation; (ii) bid  the
document clearly explains the bid evaluation, award criteria and bidder qualifications; (iii)bidders are
given adequate response time to prepare and submit bids (four weeks minimum); (iv) bidders are allowed
to deliver their bids in person if they so choose; (v) technical and financial bids are publicly and
simultaneously opened; (vi) contracts are awarded to the lowest evaluated bidprovided the bidder has the
capacity to execute the contract; (vii) no eligible bidder i s precluded from participation; (viii) no domestic
preference i s applicable to domestic manufacturers or suppliers; (ix) no foreign bidder i s forced to submit
a bid in association with domestic firms and (x) prior to issuing the first call for bids, a draft standard
biddingdocument to be usedunder NCB procurement is submitted to and found acceptable bythe Bank.

Use of Bank Guidelines. All Bank-financed civil works, equipment and materials would be procured in
accordance with the Bank`s Guidelines for Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits (January
1995, revised in January and August 1996, September 1997 and January 1999).                   Procurement o f
consultant services would follow the Bank`s Guidelines for the Selection and Employment o f Consultants
by World BankBorrowers (January 1997, revisedSeptember 1997, January 1999 and May 2002).

Use of Standard Documents. All procurement under international competitive bidding(ICB) will use the
Bank's Standard Bidding Documents (SBDs) and Standard Evaluation Report. The Bank's Standard
Request for Proposals (RFP) will be used for requesting proposals, and for selection and appointment o f
consulting firms. All consulting services will use standard forms for time-based or lump-sumcontracts as
appropriate for the type o f assignment. Simplified contracts may be used for short-term assignment (less
than 6 months). The following standard documents to be used under NCB have been transmitted formally
to the Bank and are under review for use throughout the project: (i)civil works under NCB; (ii)           small
works and (iii)  SBD for Goods.

Planning and Monitoring. To facilitate planning and monitoring o f activities, the MET has put inplace a
number o f measures. A computer network has been installed within various units o f the MET. This
program will be generalized to all units involved in EQIP I1by M a y 2004. The computer software
developed by a private firm incorporates only the financial analysis o f the project - it does not allow the
integration o f the information between procurement and contract management on one hand, and budgets
and payments on the other. The second phase o f the software package incorporating management tools to
report on procurement and monitoring and evaluation should be in place by September 2004.
Coordination mechanisms are defined in the project's Operations Manual and include: a definition o f
paper flows between departments;       quarterly meetings o f the monitoring group; and production o f a
periodic progress reports according to an agreed format.

NotiJication and Advertising.     A draft General Procurement Notice informing the public o f bidding
opportunities for the project hasbeen transmitted to the Bank            Once finalized, this notice will be
published in the Development Business and annual updates will be published throughout the life o f the
project. All ICB bids for equipment in an amount greater than US$500,000 and all services in an amount
greater than US$200,000 will be advertised inDevelopment Business.

Procurement Implementation Arrangements.             The General Administration Department "Direction
GCnCrale des Services Communs" (DGSC) o f the Ministry o f Education and Training (MET) i s
responsible for the overall project management but has delegated the coordination o f procurement to its
Department o f Building and Equipment (direction des bbtiments et de l'kquipement [DBE]). The DBE
will handle: (i) overall planning and the implementation o fprocurement o f goods and services through
                the
its Equipment and Services Section (sous-direction de 1'kquipement et des services) and (ii) planning
                                                                                                the
and monitoring o f civil works contracts through its Studies and Monitoring Section (sous-direction des
dudes et du suivi [SDES]). The responsibility for implementing all civil works procurement under sub-
components A.2 and D.4 (construction o f new schools, extension, maintenance o f existing schools) has
been delegated to the regions under the authority o f the Governors. The day-to-day civil works
procurement process (including selection o f contractors and construction supervision) will be carried out
by the provincial offices o f the Ministry o f Public Works and Housing (MPWH) on behalf of the regions.
However, for new schools, the DBE's responsibilities will include review and approval o f individual
school designs prepared by local design firms, ad-hoc participation in bid review and award o f contracts
managed by the MPWH.           The DBE will be assisted in this task by the MET'S23 regional offices
(directions rkgionales de 1'kducation [DRE]).

Procurement Capacity Assessment.        An assessment o f the capacity o f the DGSC (central level) and a
sample o f two provincial offices (Kairouan and Nabeul) o f the MPWH) was undertaken during appraisal.
This assessment concluded that DGSC/DBE's capacity to handle procurement i s adequate.                   The
satisfactory implementation o f EQIPIand the momentum created, sets the ground for EQIP I1to buildon
the organizational set-up that has proved efficient for the implementation o f the ongoing project. Within
DBE, the "sous direction des kquipements" has five qualified procurement specialists in charge o f the
procurement o f goods, and consultant services. The head o f this procurement unit has been trained in
World Bank procurement o f goods and services at CESAG institute in Dakar, Senegal. The assessment,
however, found that DBEneeded assistance inthe preparation o f technical specifications for pedagogical
equipment. The SDES, in charge o f monitoring the implementation o f civil works at the decentralized
level, has qualified staff dedicated exclusively to EQIP operations under the supervision o f the head o f the
division a qualified architect with fifteen years o f experience. The DBE has also recently strengthened
          -
its monitoring capacity at the decentralized level by hiring fifteen new civil works technicians
("techniciens supkrieurs") assigned to the provincial offices o f the MET.

The assessment also concluded that the MPWH's provincial offices are staffed with qualified civil works
engineers with years o f experience in the handling o f civil works procurement. However, they are mostly
familiar to national procurement procedures. To help minimize the relative risk o f non-adherence to the
agreed Bank procedures, the DGSC has prepared standard bidding documents for use by the M P W H in
the procurement o f civil works and has put in place a centralized oversight system on the procurement
activities at the regional level.,      The proposed action plan to further strengthen procurement
implementation arrangements include: (i)the strengthening o f the regional directorates for education to
reinforce their oversight capacity o f the procurement process at the regional level; (ii)  the development
and implementation o f a training program on Bank procurement policies and procedures for the newly
recruited civil works technicians ("techniciens supkrieurs") assigned to the DREs, and for the DBE staff
in charge of procurement; (iii)a clear definition in the procurement section o f the Operations Manual
(OM) o f the respective roles and responsibilities o f each actor in the procurement process and their
functional relationships and, a description o f the features o f the national procurement regulations that are


                                                      41

not applicable under NCB; (iv) the use o f qualified consultants as necessary to assist in the definition of
technical specifications for specialized (pedagogical) equipments. The detailed procurement capacity
assessment report i s available inthe project technical documents.

Procurement Plan. The Borrower has prepared the overall contract packaging for the entire project with
the estimated costs and the proposedprocurement methods to be usedunder EQIP 11. It has also prepared
a detailed procurement plan for the first year o f implementationwhich shows step-by-step procedures for
procurement with the estimated dates o f completion until contract execution. The proposed contract
packaging and procurement methods to be used under EQIP I1and the detailed procurement plan will be
finalized prior to Loan effectiveness.      The procurement plan will be updated every semester and
submitted to the Bank for review and approval and will be part o f the Operations Manual.

OperationsManual (OM), A draft O M for the Project describing the administrative, financial, accounting
procedures, and internal organization has been submitted to and reviewedby the Bank during appraisal.
It includes a specific procurement section which describes: (i)the internal organization for handling
supervision and quality control o f procurement and (ii)the procedures for calling for bids, selecting
consultants, vendors and contractors, and awarding contracts. The OM will be finalized prior to Loan
effectiveness.

Procurement methods

Civil Works. IBRD-financed civil works contracts estimated at a total o f US$136.64 million include the
construction o f new schools, expansion and rehabilitation o f existing schools.      These contracts are
expected to be scattered geographically (among 24 regions), and procurement would be carried out by the
regions. Experience has shown that Tunisian enterprises have sufficient capacity to handle contracts o f
this size and that international firms do not usuallyrespond to bidsbelow US$5.0 million. Bank-financed
civil works contracts estimated to cost less than the equivalent o f US$0.5 million each would be awarded
according to N C B procedures which are acceptable to the Bank. Contracts for rehabilitation o f existing
schools and expansion, estimated to cost US$0.5 million each or less would be procured under lump-sum
contracts awarded on the basis o f quotations obtained from three qualified domestic contractors invited in
writing to bid. The invitation shall include a detailed description o f the works, including basic
specifications, the required completion date, a basic form o f agreement acceptable to the Bank, and
relevant drawings where applicable. The awards will be made to the contractors who offer the lowest
price quotation for the required work, provided they demonstrate they have the experience and resources
to complete the contract successfully.

Goods. IBRD-financed contracts for goods estimated at a total o f US$68.07 million include pedagogic
equipment, computer equipment and peripherals, audiovisual and photocopying equipment.                Bank-
financed contracts for goods estimated to cost the equivalent o f USS0.5 million or more each would be
procured through ICB procedures based on Bank SBDs for the procurement o f goods. Bank-financed
contracts for office equipment, reproduction and audio-visual hardware and software and other contracts
for goods estimated to cost less than the equivalent o f US$0.5 million each would be awarded according
to N C B procedures acceptable to the Bank. Contracts for reference materials (periodicals, magazines,
books etc.) and those contracts for which there i s a limited number o f potential suppliers would be
awarded through Limited International Bidding (LIB) procedures. Smaller contracts below US$50,000
would be awarded according to internationalhational shopping procedures.

Consultant and Training Services. Architectural and engineering services for schools will be financed by
the Borrower. The IBRD-financed consulting services estimated at a total of US$3.24 million, will be
mostly for short-term consultancy for studies, technical assistance and training services. Complex
technical assistance and major studies as well as the development o f training modules and training o f

trainers (MET inspectors and administrators), carried out by firms, would be based on competition among
qualified short-listed firms through Quality- and Cost-Based Selection (QCBS).            Contracts for services
that meet criteria set out inpara.3.7 o f the guidelines, and estimated to cost less than US$lOO,OOO, may be
procured through Selection Based on Consultants' Qualifications (CQ). Services for simple tasks, such as
training, seminars, small studies and technical assistance that do not need team work or back-up support
services, will be procured through the selection o f individual consultants on the basis o f a comparison of
curriculum vitae and references o f at least three qualified individual consultants, in accordance with
Section 5 o f the Guidelines on the Selection and Employment o f Consultants by World Bank Borrowers.
Contracts for services which comply with the conditions set forth in paragraphs 3.8 through 3.11 o f the
Consultant Guidelines may be procured on a single source basis subject to the Bank's prior agreement.

The DGSC will widely publicize requests for expressions o f interest to get candidacy from consultants,
and maintain a list of consulting firms which will be used to establish short-lists. To ensure that priority i s
given to the identification o f suitable and qualified national consulting firms, short-list for contracts
estimated to cost under US$200,000 or equivalent, may comprised entirely o f national firms (in
accordance with the provisions o f paragraph 2.7 o f the Guidelines on the Selection and Employment o f
Consultants), provided that a sufficient number o f qualified firms (at least three) are available at
competitive costs. However, if foreign firms have expressed interest, they will not be excluded from
consideration.

The program elements by disbursement category, their estimated costs, and procurement methods are

Prior Review Thresholds

Bank prior review will include: (a) contracts for works above the threshold value o f US$2.0 million
equivalent, (b) the first six contracts for construction o f lycees without hostels (c) contracts for goods
above US$500,000 equivalent, and (d) the first two (2) LIB contracts. Draft standard biddingdocuments
for NCB and small works contracts will be reviewed and agreed upon with the Bank. Prior review will
apply to contracts for recruitment o f consulting firms estimated to cost US$lOO,OOO equivalent or more,
the first two (2) contracts under CQ and the contracts for the recruitment o f individual consultants above
US$50,000 equivalent. The exception to prior review will not apply to the Terms o f Reference o f such
contracts regardless of value, or to amendments o f contracts rising the contract value above the prior
review threshold.

The Bank review o f civil works and goods contracts would include: (i)   all biddingdocumentation prior to
bid advertising, including any changes to the standard documents agreed upon; (ii)evaluation and
selection reports prior to contract signing. Signed contracts would be transmitted with completed Form
384 prior to disbursement. It i s estimated that this review would cover 40 percent o f all Bank financed
contracts. For consultancy contracts, the Bank would review:           (i)TORS,short list of consultants,
Requests for Proposals (RFP); (ii)    evaluation and selection report; and (iii)draft negotiated contracts.
Contracts under these thresholds would be subject to selective post-award review during supervision
mission, or by the auditor. The DGSC will ensure adequate filing to maintain all procurement-related
documents for such ex-post reviews or reviews by auditors. The contract value thresholds above which
the Bank would review documentation prior to each further processing step are summarized inTable A8.3
below.

                 TUNISIA: Education Quality Improvement Program (EQIP) Phase 2

Introduction

One o f the principle challenges facing the Tunisia education system i s to improve its overall quality,
while increasing the percentage o f children completing each level o f the school system: f lower basic
education (LBE), upper basic education (UBE) and secondary education. Additional mobilization o f
resources would help in reaching the goal but has the potential to impact the entire budget. This annex
examines the fiscal impact o f expanding the education system using a model o f education finance,
developed in collobaration with the MET. The principal question that it seeks to answer i s whether the
reformcould be financed with internalresources with minimumneed for external financing.

The process for estimating the cost o f reform i s simple and i s done in three steps. First, targets are set for
quality, access and resources for the education sector. Second, the education finance model i s used to
determine the cost o f additional resources required to meet the targets. Finally, the impact o f additional
cost on government budget i s estimated and the financing gap (deficit or surplus) i s identified.

SimulationModel. The model simulates the LBE,UBE and secondary education sectors.26 It i s expected
that the demand for secondary education will rise sharply over the period requiring substantial internal
resources. Projections are made untilthe year 2015, the MDG target year, usinginformation available in
2002/03 as the baseline data. While simulations for LBE were done using a relatively sophisticated
model that allowed policy trade-offs, cost estimates for UBEand secondary education were obtained from
projections o f unit costs inthose sectors.

Resources in the model are determined based on the expected growth of the economy, total govemment
budget and the share o f education inthe budget. Expenditures pertaining to reforms are determined using
data on enrollment, efficiency parameters such as repetition and dropouts rates, and the rate o f transition
between education levels. Cost elements include teacher salaries and non-salary spending on materials
and overheads. Difference between the cost o f reform and the budget envelope provides the financing
deficit or surplus for each sub-sector.

Key Variables and Assumptions

Estimating the Budget Envelopefor Education. The simulations are done under the assumption that the
economy will grow at an average rate o f 5.5 percent (average o fpast five years) over the planning period,
2003-201527. The government budget as a share o f GDP i s assumed to remain constant at 29 percent
while the share o f education recurrent budget in government recurrent budget i s assumed to remain at
23.4 percent. The selected simulations produce a decline in LBEpopulation that would allow a reduction
in the share (recurrent) of LBE in total recurrent education budget and would enable a transfer of
resources to secondary education over the same period.

Targetsfor Student Flows. Specific        targets have been set in the model related to access and quality o f
education. These targets are set for all scenarios and are delineated in Table A9.1. LBE enrollments
change only as a result o f variation in the school-age population that declines by 25 percent in 2010 and
by 31 percent in 2015. With a target o f 95percent in UBE and 70percent in secondary education,
enrollments change significantly in the two sub-sectors. The target o f 83percent in secondary education



26Vocational training is not explicitly modeled.
21Additional low-case scenarios were done with a projected growth rate o f 3.0 percent for the economy.


                                                       47

implies transition rates o f 100 percent between LBE and UBE and between UBE and secondary
education. Consistent with high survival rates, repetition rates would come down to 1.6 percent. The
proportion o f students opting for public schools would remain at 4 percent in UBE and secondary
education, resulting in20 percent less students inUBEand 27 percent more in secondary by 2015.

Changes in Service Delivery Parameters. These targets, shown in Table A9.2, would be reached through
improvement inthe values o f parameters that determine the cost-effectiveness o f services delivered by the
education system. Teacher salaries inTunisia are projected to grow annually at 5.5 percent.

Three scenarios are examined for the three sub-sectors in education. The first scenario maintains the
current values o f the service delivery parameters and estimates the cost o f reaching the target completion
rate o f 97 percent29. There i s no new recruitment o f LBE teachers in this scenario; indeed, their numbers
decline annually by 400 due to retirement and voluntary separation3'.                 The second scenario seeks
improvement in efficiency (in addition to access) o f the system by lowering the repetition rate to 1.6
percent inLBE and to 2.0 percent inUBE and secondary.               There i s a hypothetical gain inunit cost o f 4.7
percent annually inUBEand secondary.

The final scenario sets targets for fiscal parameters by increasing the share o f education in total
government budget to 24.3 percent and reallocates spending between LBE (declines to 35.2 percent),
UBE (decreases to 16.7 percent) and secondary education (increases to 26.7 percent). The objective o f
this scenario is to estimate the level of additional education financing neededto reach the goals set out in
Table A9.1, taking into account all options aimed at improving cost-effectiveness.

Cost of Classroom Construction. An expansion o f the education system would require a substantial
amount o f construction related to schools. While no classroom construction i s envisioned for LBE and
UBE sub-sectors, the total capital costs o f providing fully equipped additional classrooms in secondary
education have not been estimated.

Simulation Results

The cost o f reforming the education system and reaching the targets described under the three scenarios i s
reported in Tables A9.3, A9.4 and A9.5 for LBE, UBE and secondary education respectively. In the
following, the results o f the simulation exercise are described for each education sub-sector:

Lower Basic Education. Table A9.3 suggests that ifthe present level o f financing i s maintained for LBE,
the sub-sector would run an annual surplus o f about TND 48 million due to a decline in school-age
population (baseline scenario).        An increase in efficiency (second scenario) through a reduction in
repetition rates does not change the surplus, since it i s assumed for the purposes o f these simulations that
the Government maintains the current number o f LBE teachers throughout the period. In the final
scenario, reducing the share o f LBE to 35.2 percent in total recurrent budget for education and
transferring it to secondary education eliminates the surplus. In conclusion, under the targets set for the
final scenario, the LBE sub-sector i s fiscally sustainable and, in future, would require less than its current
share o f resources inthe education budget.

the second scenario increases the annual surplus to TND 46 million. The surplus i s eliminated inthe final
scenario by reducing the share o f UBE34intotal education recurrent budget to 16.7percent.

The current policy o f the government i s to provide nine years o f basic education to all school-age children
in Tunisia.    The simulations in Tables A9.3 and A9.4 suggest that the government could provide
education to all these children if it (i)improves quality to improve the rate o f transition between LBE and
UBE, and (ii) efficiency through a reductioninrepetition rate and by maintaining the current class-
                raises
size in LBE. Both policies can be funded with current trends in education finance and require no
additionalresources.

Secondary Education. An enrollment o f 83 percent in secondary education would raise total enrollments
by 36 percent in2010 before the decline in student populationreduces this increase to 27 percent in2015.
The cost o f sending 83 percent o f children to high school at current levels o f efficiency (baseline
scenario) would result in a large annual financing gap o f TND 166 million. Improvement in efficiency
(second scenario) through a decline inrepetition rate has the potential to bring down the gap but it would
still be large at TND 132 million.

To reduce the financial gap, education budget is reallocated between the three sub-sectors in the final
scenario resulting in an increase in the share o f secondary education (in total recurrent education
spending) to 26.7 percent.       Combined with an increase in the share o f education budget in total
government budget to 24.3 percent (from 23.4 percent), this boost in the share o f secondary education
budget results in the elimination o f the annual financing gap. It is clear that, efficiency gains in all sub-

sectors would, by themselves, be not enough to cover the additional cost o f providing universal access to
secondary education unless the government decides to allocate even more resources to the education
sector.

Sensitivity Analysis. In recent times, Tunisia has experienced periods o f slow growth when the annual
growth in GDP was less than 4 percent. To account for that eventuality the above simulations have been
repeated with a projected annual growth rate o f 3.0 percent in order to gauge the impact on education
finance of such an economic slowdown. The results indicate that the current state of education financing
would not be able to sustain the sector under any o f the three scenarios, even if the sector operates with
maximum internal efficiency with negligible repetition rates.            The government would have to
significantly raise the share o f education in its budget to reach the goal o f universal secondary education.
These additional simulations show how vulnerable education financing i s when faced with variations in
the national economic situation. A decline of just 1 percent in the predicted growth rate would have a
marked impact on the financial viability o f the education reform process. The financing gaps are also
sensitive to variations in the annual salary increases, which are estimated at 5.5 percent in LBE. All the
simulations presentedassumed that all UBEgraduates will be absorbed into secondary education, and that
the completion rate will increase markedly, from 44 percent currently to 70 percent in 2015. This,
combined with the fact that the share o f students going into vocational training has not been taken into
account, suggests that a 1percent increase inthe share o f the budget going to education may be possible.

No large scale or irreversible impacts are anticipated from this project. Experience with EQIP Ishows
that the impacts are limited to those that can occur during school construction (nuisance to neighborhood,
and hazards to children, workers andor the public), and those resultingfrom the operation of the schools
(wastewater and solid waste management). The latest safeguards cluster mission to Tunisia, undertaken
inApril 2003, concludedthat EQIPIshouldnotbe consideredanat-risk project.

For EQIP 11, the Borrower will build on experience gained during EQIP I. The MET includes in its
operational manual a detailed environmental management procedure, including screening, supervision
and monitoring. The MET will select regions inwhich schools will be built, based on educational criteria
and priorities, and the regional governors will make the final selection o f municipalities based on the
school mapping exercise.

Environmental Assessment (OP 4.01). In order to comply with OP 4.01, an environmental assessment
review procedure was developed for EQIP I,          jointly with the National Environmental Protection Agency
(AWE) andthe MET, to ensure adequate treatment of environmental concerns inthe construction ofnew
schools under the project. This procedure will be applied to EQIP 11, with some refinement resulting
from lessons learned during the first phase. As a first step, the MET will screen sites, to identify any that
carry potential safeguard issues. Each school construction identified as carrying potential safeguard
issues will then be subjected to an environmental assessment which will include appropriate consultation
with the affected people, ifany. Inmost cases, school sites have already been selected as part o f an urban
planning and land use scheme.            In those cases where no scheme exists, the selection process will be
initiated by local authorities, and its acceptability validated through the environmental review procedure
described above. The Bank will finance only those schools cleared under the agreed environmental
review procedures, as determined by the Bank through regular ex-post review. During construction
activities, compliance monitoring to ensure implementation o f the recommended mitigation measures
will be delegated by the MET to the supervision architects, with oversight responsibility by the local
representatives from the Ministry o f Public Works and Housing.

Land Acquisition. The recent expropriation law has introduced major improvements in land acquisition.

publiques) was not available for a school site, the Government either bought land at the going market
price through an open procedure, or accepted land as a voluntary donation from a private owner (who, for
personal or economic reasons, sees an advantage in donate land for educational purposes).           The
Government does not accept a donation o f landthat could negatively impact an individual's livelihood.

A land acquisition assessment procedure (&valuation des conditions d 'acquisition de terrains) was
developed for EQIPI.Land acquisition assessments conducted during the first phase o f the project show
that there are no issues related to social safeguards, in particular involuntary resettlement and land
acquisition. Land for the construction o f school i s either acquired from the public patrimony with no
claims on it, or purchased from the public market, or voluntarily donated by the communities.        The
results o f applying this procedure to EQIP Ishowed that private owners in fact benefited from donating
land for school construction, as a new school brings with it improvements to the surrounding area (e.g.
roads, water, and sewerage), which raise the value o f remaining land owned by the donor. For this
reason, OP/BP 4.12 will not be triggered.     It is proposed that during implementation, for each site
acquired via donation, a land acquisition assessment be conducted prior to construction to ascertain that
acquisition has not impacted negatively on any persons or groups and that there are no issues related to
OP/BP 4.12.

Subject: Letterof SectoralPolicy

The Letter o f Sectoral Policy, sent to the IBRD in May 2000 in advance o f the signing o f the Loan
Agreement for the Tunisia Education Quality Improvement Project, set out the strategic framework for
the reforms that the Tunisian Government was implementing or planning to implement at that time, and
placed the full Project (Phases Iand 11) inthis context. The directions and choices taken at that time have
not been modified, although some clarification and refinement have taken place at the level o f
implementation arrangements, to facilitate the development o f operational measures to be carried out
under the Tenth Plan.

Since 1958, when the new Tunisian Education System was created, national policy on education and
human resource development has consistently followed the principles laid down by its initial sponsors, in
accordance with popular demand: principles o f universality, non-discrimination and equal opportunity,
which have allowed the school system to become a real instrument o f social advancement, enabling
young Tunisians from every region and every walk o f life to aspire to the position and role to which their
individual merit and the qualifications acquired in educational institutions entitle them.

These constants have not been shaken by the economic difficulties that the country has experienced from
time to time over the last forty years. The main reason for this i s that, in Tunisia, pro-active policies in
education have never constituted an ideological choice. For a country that i s relatively poor in natural
resources, the decision to allocate 7 percent o f GDP and around one third o f its annual budget to
developing its human resources i s in fact the only path open to ensuring a solid basis for the renewal o f
Tunisian society and achieving its aim of rapid integration into the family o f advanced nations.

The results of these policies are telling. Enrollment rates have risen constantly at all levels: in 2002/03,
they were 99 percent for 6-year-olds, male and female, at school entry; 97.2 percent for 6- to ll-year-
olds; 75.7 percent for 12- to 18-year-olds (compared with 50.2 percent in 1994/95); and 29% in tertiary
education (compared with 12 percent in 1994/95).

Such growth i s due in part to improved intra- and inter-level promotion rates, and in part to a range o f
institutional and educational measures that enabled the principle o f compulsory schooling for 6- to 16-
year-olds to be enforced, and, as a result, drop-out rates to be reduced: 1.8 percent drop-out in primary
education and 9.2 percent in secondary education (compared with 4.4 percent and 12.4 percent,
respectively, in 1994/95).




                                                    54

Inparallel with these advances in school access and school survival for young Tunisians, real progress
has been made in improving system efficiency. With a 74.21 percent pass rate in the 2003 baccalaureate
examinations (including 23.38 percent with an average score above 12/20), compared with a 47.15
percent pass rate in 1998, it i s easy to seejust how far our educational institutions have come.

While taking the full measure o f our successes to date, the quantitative and, more importantly, the
qualitative results achieved thus far fall short o f what i s required to meet the challenges that confront us.
These same challenges prompted the President of the Republic to state, in 1995, that we "must begin to
rethink the purposes of schooling, systematically and in depth, (...) in a world where major changes are
affecting how societies are organized, how knowledge is structured, how work is carried out and how
goods and services andproduced, so that we are wellpreparedfor thefuture".

Meetingthe Challengesto BuildSchoolsfor Tomorrow

The challenges are many. First, there are a number o f general challenges, structural innature, linkedto
the fundamental purposes o f schooling (to educate, to instruct, and to qualify). These general challenges
are particularly important at a time when the school sector has become a key instrument inthe process o f
upgrading the national production system, and ina context characterized by the gradual establishment o f a
free trade zone with the European Union and by our country's integration into a globalized economy that
equates international competitivity with the qualification level of human resources.

These challenges, along with the problems that give rise to them, were analyzed in depth during a period
o f reflection around the theme o f "Tomorrow's Schools", which ran from December 1998 to October
2000. At the end o f a process that culminated in a major national consultative conference, decisions were
taken that were then converted into specific action plans as part o f the New School EducationReform.

The strategy chosen   -  and implemented in part under Phase Io f EQIP - i s organized into five basic
dimensions:

(a)      Updating the content and methods used in teaching and learning, as well as the assessment
system, at all levels o f schooling, as a means o f improving students' learning achievement and set the
foundations for post-school training and life-long learning.

(b)      Creating education professionals, in particular: classroom teachers, whose pre- and in-service
training needs rethinking; school principals, who must now be managers, able to lead a team and to
develop and implement their school's improvement scheme in a participatory fashion; teaching
supervisors, whose role and skills must develop to matches the changes affecting teachers and schools.

(c)      Effecting major changes in the internal functioning o f the school system, through: (i)        greater
decentralization to the regional level; (ii)   increased status for the school as a teaching unit that enjoys
some degree o f autonomy;         and (iii)  improved linkages between educational institutions and their
immediate environment.

(d)      Giving effect to the principles o f inclusion and equity in education through programs o f support
for schools indifficulty and for students who are physically and/or socially vulnerable.

(e)      Modernizing the school sector in the various levels and aspects o f its management, through the
use of new information and communication technologies, which have become an essential tool for
teaching and administration.

Managing Transition

While laying the foundations o f the "Tomorrow's Schools" program and taking care not to preclude any
options that this program may require for its future success, we will have to carefully manage the
transition that the Tunisian school system i s currently undergoing.

1-Demographic Transition

Lower basic education enrollments have been in gradual decline since 1995/96. Enrollments in upper
basic and secondary education have been increasing over the same period, creating major pressures on
physical infrastructure and teaching capacity.        Fortunately, this situation i s short-lived, as students
numbers should first stabilize and then beginto decline: from 2008 for upper basic education, and from
2011 for secondary education.

The incidence on the Ministry's budget will however be considerable:
- as far as the investment budget is concerned, greater effort will be required inbuilding and equipping
new schools, as well as inextending existing schools and maintaining an aging infi-astructure stock; as for
the operating budget, expenditure will increase in proportion to the increase in student numbers, in
particular with respect to salaries.

Once expenditures associated with implementing the teaching quality dimensions of the reform are
factored into the equation, the size o f the fiscal impact becomes clear.           Nevertheless, despite the
constraints and difficulties that come with the requirement for fiscal discipline, the State will continue to
assume all its responsibilities in the education sector, while taking strong action to rationalize
expenditures and ensure optimal utilization o f the available human and physical resources.

In any event, it is wise to opt for fiscal scenarios that take account of the need to withstand temporary
pressures, maintaining inter alia the status o f certain indicators linkedto teachers' and students' workmg
conditions.

2 - Schools' New Responsibilities

Schools today are assigned responsibilities that require them not only to enroll students and provide them
with knowledge, but also to ensure they acquire a set of skills and know-how that will enable them to
continue learning and later to find ajob without too much difficulty.

This "accountability" extends to the quality o f what is learned, since learning is now measured not so
much on the basis o f how much knowledge one has acquired as how able one i s to learn on one's own:
these are cognitive and practical abilities, as well as competencies in communication and problem-
solving.

The Ministry is currently designing all its programs and projects with this end in mind. It is looking in
particular at the content, methods and organization o f learning, as well as modes o f assessing learning
achievement. Assessment i s being expanded on two qualitative fronts:            first, the gradual roll-out o f
formative assessment in both lower and upper basic education; and second, the organization o f external
assessments, with the introduction o f periodic testing from 2005, and regular participation in major
internationalcomparative assessments (TJMSS and PISA), begun in 1999.

The goal i s to raise the quality standards o f teaching and strengthen the internal and external efficiency o f
the school system.




                                                       56

3 - ParadigmChanges

 The fundamental "schooling" paradigm i s changing in the sense that the traditional notion o f instruction,
based on a hierarchical teacher-learner relationship, i s gradually giving way to notions o f education,
 facilitated learning and self-motivated/lifelong learning. It i s this change that allows us both to apply
 innovative pedagogical approaches, such as the skills-based approach and project-based teaching, and to
integrate new information and communicationtechnologies into learning.

The paradigmbased on a one-way supply o f schooling i s beingseriously challenged by the emergence o f
a client-oriented model that breaks with the tradition o f a self-sufficient school system that alone
determines the needs o f its "wards" and "sees to" those needs.

Externally,the school system mustberesponsive to society's expectations ingeneral, and inparticular to
the expectations o f those teaching and training institutions that take in school graduates. This requires a
clear articulation between the three sub-sectors and an adaptation o f the "education supply" to the needs
o f higher education and vocational training institutions. The reform makes provision for this.

Internally, the same logic requires that schools notify their needs (in staff training, teacher support
services, learning materials, etc.) through their School Improvement Schemes, rather than having the
Ministrypropose a uniformset o fstandard offeringsthat are notnecessarily what schools want.

The current institutional paradigm, based on a top-down approach, results inthe centralized management
o f every component of the school system. This paradigm must be turned around and gradually replaced
by a bottom-up approach that makes other players accountable and puts an end to the hierarchicalnature
o f relations between the Ministryand educational institutions. The School Improvement Scheme i s at the
center o f this approach, for it calls on the various education stakeholders to be more involved in school
management and obliges the school itself to open up to its surroundings.

The Tenth Plan furnishes answers to most o f the issues raised here, as it makes provision for the
implementation o f the new school reformprocesses. It constitutes a master plan that keeps apace with the
nation's ambitions for the near future, and in particular, its goal o f meeting the challenges linked to the
need to raise the level o f our economy's competitivity through significant improvements inthe quality o f
our human resources which necessarily come about through an overall upgrade o f our education and
training system.

Contributionofthe EducationQuality ImprovementProject

The Education Quality Improvement Project (EQIP) was designed at a time when the National
Commission on Tomorrow's Schools hadjust delivered its conclusions, which, in October 2000, were the
subject o f a nation-wide consultation process that resulted two years later in the new Education and
Training Law and inthe launch o fthe new reform.

The objectives of EQIPwere to: (i)    support policy decisions taken on the basis o fproposals coming out o f
the National Commission, as well as the efforts of the Tunisian Government aimed at providing core
answers to problems occurring at various levels o f the school system; and (ii)  contribute to strengthening
the capacity o f the school system to respond to ever increasing education needs, especially at.the upper
basic and secondary levels.

The achievements o f the first phase o f the project offer a solid basis for the reforms that are to be
introduced from now until 2008, in line with the directions outlined in the Education and Training Law

(July 2002) and the strategy developed inits wake, all within the framework o f the New School Education
Reform.

EQIPI1builds on the Educationand Training Ministry's Overall Action Plan, an operational version of
the TenthDevelopment Plan for Education. Its specific objectives are to: (i)   respond appropriately to the
diversity o f students inbasic education; (ii)provide Grade 9 graduates with a greater array o f leaming
pathways; and (iii)  develop a modem and decentralized systemo f school education management.

The project comprises four components and ten sub-components. The first two components deal with
issues o f teaching quality: Component A focuses on basic education and Component B on secondary
education. Component C aims at modernizing the management o f the school sector, at the central,
regional and local level, so as to improve school services. Finally, Component D i s designed to improve
the performance o f basic systems within the school sector  -  staff training, educational information and
communication technologies, and infrastructure - with a view to enabling the Education and Training
Ministryto better carry outhe activities programmed underthe three other components.

EQIP11, with an overall cost estimated at 266 million dollars (including Tunisian counterpart funding),
will be implemented over a four-year period, from January 2004 to December 2008 [sic].
