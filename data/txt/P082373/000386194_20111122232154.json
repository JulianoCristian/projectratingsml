The borrower has\n            requested a reallocation of credit proceeds among\n            disbursement categories and an 18 month extension of the\n            credit closing date, which would be the first extension. As\n            indicated in more detail below, the reallocation of funds is\n            necessary to cover underestimates in some categories from\n            the unallocated category and from other activities that have\n            funds in excess of the expected needs. The reallocation and\n            extension would allow the borrower to complete all the key\n            project activities. Good progress has been made in regard to\n            sanitation, storm drainage, community upgrading with most\n            investments completed or well advanced. The solid waste\n            component has progress very slowly but the contracts for the\n            construction of two of the three solid waste landfills (Tema\n            and Sekondi) are ready to be executed and are expected to be\n            completed within the requested 18-month extension. The\n            reallocation of funds is necessary to cover underestimates\n            in some categories from the unallocated category and from\n            other activities that have funds in excess of the expected\n            needs. The actions are: (i) a reallocation of funds among\n            disbursement categories as indicated on the table above; and\n            (ii) an extension of 18 months to the original closing date,\n            i.e. making December 31, 2011 the new closing date."}, "docdt": "2011-11-22T00:00:00Z"}
