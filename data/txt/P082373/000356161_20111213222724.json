The actions are: a reallocation of funds among\n            disbursement categories, and an extension of five months to\n            the closing date, i.e. making May 31, 2012 the new closing\n            date. The extension will allow for the completion of key\n            ongoing works at Tema, particularly the new storm drains and\n            the rehabilitation of the septage treatment plant. The\n            original closing date for the project was extended once for\n            eighteen months to December 31, 2011. This will be the\n            second extension of the project closing date. The cumulative\n            extension from the original closing date will remain below\n            two years."}, "docdt": "2011-12-05T00:00:00Z"}
