1.     Background. The IDA Credit of SDR 41.60 Million (US$62.87 million
equivalent) was approved by the Board on April 29, 2004 and became effective on
October 27, 2004. The original closing date for the Project was extended once for
eighteen months to December 31, 2011. As of December 5, 2011, the project has
disbursed SDR 27.6 million (US$ 42.84 million equivalent), or 66% of the credit
proceeds, hence leaving a remaining balance of SDR 14.0 million (US$21.7 million
equivalent).

2.     The remaining credit proceeds have already been committed by means of signed
contracts, or will be fully utilized by contracts that are ready to be executed when the
extension is granted.
3.      The project has five components: (a) Storm Drainage, (b) Sanitation, (c) Solid
Waste Management, (d) Community Infrastructure Upgrading, and (e) Institutional
Strengthening. The project development objective is to improve urban living conditions
in regard to environmental health, sanitation, drainage, vehicular access, and solid waste
management in a sustainable fashion, with special emphasis on the poor.

4.      Project Implementation Progress. As reported during the last supervision
mission held in July 2011, the Storm Drainage, Sanitation and Community Infrastructure
Upgrading Components were fully, or over 90%, completed in Accra, Kumasi, Sekondi-
Takoradi and Tamale. However, storm drain works in Tema were behind schedule, as
well as the Tema septage treatment plant rehabilitation. Works were progressing ahead of
or on schedule at the Tema sanitary landfill and the Sekondi-Takoradi sanitary landfills,
and the equipment for solid waste management was being procured and expected to be
received as planned. It was also reported that beneficiaries of community infrastructure
upgrading and drainage sub-projects were positively impacted by the project due to
enhancement of economic activities in the areas where community upgrading and
drainage works had been undertaken. As agreed with the Bank, the Coalition of NGOs in
Waste Management (CONWAM) is working at the community level to track project
investments and their impact.


Proposed Changes
5.       The proposed actions are: (i) a reallocation of funds among disbursement
categories as indicated on the table above; and (ii) an extension of 5 months to the closing
date, i.e. making May 31, 2012 the new closing date.

Rationale for Reallocation and Extension

6.      The proposed reallocation of funds is necessary to cover underestimates in some
categories and hence provide sufficient funds to complete the activities indicated below.
The five month extension is necessary as a result of unusual rainfall in southern Ghana
that has delayed ongoing works in Tema, Sekondi and Kumasi beyond their expected
completion dates.

      i.   Ongoing construction of sanitary landfills in Tema and Sekondi-Takoradi;
     ii.   Ongoing procurement of solid waste management equipment in the five
           participating cities;
    iii.   Ongoing construction of Tema storm drains and rehabilitation of septage
           treatment plant;
     iv.   Closure of old dumpsites in Sekondi-Takoradi, and Accra.

1.     The closing date for Error! Reference source not found.GH SECOND Urban
Environmental Sanitation PROJECTGH SECOND Urban Environmental Sanitation
PROJECT, Credit No. 3889-GH, Error! Reference source not found. will be extended
from December 31, 2011 until May 31, 2012 (i.e. 5 months).

2.      Good progress has been made with regard to the Storm Drainage, Sanitation and
Community Infrastructure Upgrading Components, which are fully, or over 90%,
completed in Accra, Kumasi, Sekondi-Takoradi and Tamale. The remaining key works
that are behind schedule, such as the Tema storm drains and the rehabilitation of the
septage treatment plant, as well as the construction of the sanitary landfills that was
delayed by the rains, are expected to be completed within the new closing date. With the
completion of the remaining activities, the project is expected to substantially achieve
and in some case exceed its development objectives.

3.       The proposed extension will allow for the completion of key ongoing works at
Tema, particularly the new storm drains and the rehabilitation of the septage treatment
plant. It will also allow for the completion of the Tema sanitary landfill and the Sekondi-
Takoradi sanitary landfill that were delayed by the rains. Procurement of equipment for
solid waste management is underway and is expected to be received in early 2012

4.     This will be the second extension of the project closing date. The cumulative
extension from the original closing date will remain below two years.
