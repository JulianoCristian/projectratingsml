      the metropolitan area of Dakar. This project includes two\n            main components: (1) Institutional development through\n            consultant's services and short-term technical\n            assistance, training and an awareness campaign to (a)\n            establish and manage a coordinating body, which will gather\n            the main actors of the sector; (b) privatize the Senegalese\n            bus company, including assisting the development of a\n            leasing scheme for urban transport operators, and revising\n            the regulatory framework for providing urban transport\n            services; (c) establish a sustainable financing mechanism\n            for the sector through an urban transport development fund;\n            and (d) implement a traffic management scheme and a road\n            safety action plan with users participation; and (2) Minor\n            civil works such as rehabilitating bus stops, bus lane\n            arrangements, fitting encroachments, and intermodal slots."}, "docdt": "1997-05-07T00:00:00Z"}
