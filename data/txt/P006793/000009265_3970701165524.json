institutions. The project objectives are\n            to: (a) increase crop production in six districts, through\n            rehabilitation and improved technical and extension services\n            leading to more intensive land use; (b) improve the incomes\n            of some 3,900 poor farmers located on the foothills of the\n            Andes and in the savannah country of Northern Colombia\n            through small-scale irrigation development; (c) partially\n            restore the agricultural production base in the area\n            affected by the recent volcanic disaster through\n            reconstruction and addition of irrigation facilities; and\n            (d) improve the sustainability and replicability of public\n            irrigation investments through full recovery of operation\n            and maintenance costs and the building up of water user\n            associations. The average beneficiary per capita income of\n            US$1,060 before the project is expected to rise to about\n            US$1,940 at full development."}, "docdt": "1986-02-28T00:00:00Z"}
