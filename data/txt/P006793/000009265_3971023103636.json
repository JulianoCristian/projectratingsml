The objectives were to: (a) increase crop\n            production in six districts through rehabilitation and\n            improved technical and extension services leading to more\n            intensive land use; (b) improve the incomes of 3,900 poor\n            farmers through small-scale irrigation development; (c)\n            partially restore agricultural production in the volcano\n            damaged Armero area through irrigation investments; and (d)\n            improve the sustainability of public irrigation investments\n            through full recovery of operation and maintenance (O&M)\n            costs. The Bank's performance was deficient\n            particularly during project design. Both the Government\n            (Guarantor) and INAT (Borrower) performed deficiently,\n            though in the later part of the project the Government\n            adopted policy reforms and the new law which may contribute\n            to a favorable outcome. Some key lessons of the project are\n            as follows: (a) it is better not to proceed with a lending\n            operation until fundamental agreement on strategy,\n            objectives and key sector policies has been reached; (b) the\n            scope and objectives of a follow-on project should be\n            carefully calibrated to the capacity of the implementing\n            agency as demonstrated in the project under implementation;\n            (c) project risks identified at appraisal should be closely\n            monitored and credible solutions found if the risk does\n            materialize; (d) to be successful, irrigation and drainage\n            projects must pay attention to agronomic, economic,\n            institutional and social issues in addition to engineering."}, "docdt": "1997-05-16T00:00:00Z"}
