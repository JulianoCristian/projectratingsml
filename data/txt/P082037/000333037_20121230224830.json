The Government has\n            focused the resources available in the additional financing\n            to reform the targeting instrument used for social programs,\n            including improving controls over fraud and error, as well\n            as supporting the design and implementation arrangements for\n            the proposed Ingreso Etico which builds on the experience of\n            Chile Solidario within the inter-institutional system of\n            social protection. Support also has been provided to the\n            evaluation of parental education activities which are part\n            of the early childhood development initiative of Chile Crece\n            Contigo. Project objectives continue to be achievable.\n            Although the Chileans authorities recently requested the\n            cancellation of US$1,398,000 of the grant, this has not\n            affected the activities being carried out as the Government\n            has compensated with the provision of national resources.\n            Performance of the borrower and the implementing agency is\n            satisfactory. There are no outstanding audit reports or\n            audit reports unsatisfactory to the Bank or financial or\n            procurement issues associated with the project. Neither this\n            loan in particular, nor Chile is under suspension of\n            disbursements. The extension is necessary to allow the\n            Government of Chile to complete an activity associated with\n            the assessment of a parental education intervention\n            undertaken as part of Chile Crece Contigo. The timetable for\n            the activity provided by the Borrower will allow completion\n            and review of the results of the work."}, "docdt": "2012-12-28T00:00:00Z"}
