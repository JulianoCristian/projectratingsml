The poor and vulnerable were exposed to a\n            wide range of risks and shocks that affected their current\n            wellbeing and their longer-term prospects for rising out of\n            poverty. To address these challenges, all countries need\n            social safety nets both to protect the vulnerable from\n            falling into poverty during crises and to help them\n            transition out of poverty in the absence of larger crises.\n            International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD)\n            has helped countries in Latin America and the Caribbean\n            pioneer conditional cash transfers (CCTs) as a proven\n            approach to helping people out of poverty. CCT programs have\n            implemented novel approaches to targeting the poor,\n            addressing gender issues, transferring funds, fostering\n            social accountability, building error and fraud control\n            systems, and strengthening governance. CCT programs have\n            also used new technologies such as bank cards to facilitate\n            payments and cell phones to send educational messages to\n            recipients. They have linked clients to social services,\n            helped obtain identity documents for marginalized groups,\n            and promoted savings as a medium-term strategy to help CCT\n            households out of poverty. CCTs supported by the IBRD in the\n            last decade benefitted about 21 million households annually\n            in Latin America and the Caribbean."}, "docdt": "2010-03-29T09:28:00Z"}
