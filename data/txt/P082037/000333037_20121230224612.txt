                                (P082037)
                               LOAN 7803

                                  Restructuring Paper


1.     The closing date for the Chile, Additional Financing for the Scaling-up of the
Social Protection Technical Assistance Project, Ln 7803-CL, P082037 will be extended
by one month from December 31, 2012 until January 31, 2013.

2.       Project implementation has been satisfactory. The Government has focused the
resources available in the Additional Financing to reform the targeting instrument used
for social programs, including improving controls over fraud and error, as well as
supporting the design and implementation arrangements for the proposed Ingreso Etico
which builds on the experience of Chile Solidario within the inter-institutional system of
social protection. Support also has been provided to the evaluation of parental education
activities which are part of the early childhood development initiative of Chile Crece
Contigo. Project objectives continue to be achievable. Although the Chileans authorities
recently requested the cancellation of US$1,398,000 of the grant, this has not affected the
activities being carried out as the Government has compensated with the provision of
national resources. Performance of the borrower and the implementing agency is
satisfactory. There are no outstanding audit reports or audit reports unsatisfactory to the
Bank or financial or procurement issues associated with the project. Neither this loan in
particular, nor Chile is under suspension of disbursements.

3.     The proposed extension is necessary to allow the Government of Chile to
complete an activity associated with the assessment of a parental education intervention
undertaken as part of Chile Crece Contigo. The timetable for the activity provided by the
Borrower would allow completion and review of the results of the work.

4.     This will be the second extension of the Additional Financing Loan.
