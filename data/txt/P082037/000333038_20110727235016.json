The closing date\n            for the project will be extended from August 31, 2011 until\n            December 31, 2012. The extension is necessary to allow the\n            Government of Chile sufficient time to complete\n            disbursements under the loan. Utilization of the resources\n            of the additional financing has been delayed due to the\n            change of Government, the major role that the executing\n            agency (Ministry of Planning) had in responding to the\n            emergency related to the earthquake early last year, as well\n            as initial unfamiliarity with the Bank and its procedures.\n            The ownership of the Government has been demonstrated by\n            their preparation of an action plan to fully utilize the\n            additional financing loan resources by the end of 2012. This\n            will be the first extension of the additional financing loan."}, "docdt": "2011-07-12T00:00:00Z"}
