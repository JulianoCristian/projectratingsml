                         THE SCALING-UP OF THE
             SOCIAL PROTECTION TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROJECT
                                (P114774)
                                LOAN 7803

                                   Restructuring Paper


1.      The closing date for Chile Additional Financing, Social Protection Technical
Assistance Project, Loan No. 7803, (P114774) will be extended from August 31, 2011
until December 31, 2012. The closing date of the original Loan was September 30, 2007.
Through a fourth extension of the closing date that was approved on September 29, 2009,
in order to allow time for AF approval, the closing date of the original Loan was
extended until December 31, 2009. The AF was approved on October 29, 2009. The
original closing date of the AF is August 31, 2011. The proposed extension would
represent an additional 3 years, relative to the closing date of the original loan at the time
of AF approval.

2.      Project implementation has been satisfactory. As of the end of 2010, about
400,000 families had been invited to participate in Chile Solidario, of which 95 percent
participated. Several public programs have been assessed in light of the demands of the
Chile Solidario Program. The Ministry of Planning (MIDEPLAN) has expanded the
reach of the social protection system to other vulnerable groups – older adults living
alone and the homeless, using key elements of the Chile Solidario model adapted to the
needs of these participants. The Integrated System of Social Information (SIIS) has
incorporated the necessary complementary data bases, and is an important platform not
only for Chile Solidario, but also for other services, most recently for the implementation
of pension reforms. The Borrower is committed to the Project, as evidenced by the
expansion of the Chile Solidario approach to lay the base for a comprehensive national
social protection system for young children. The development objectives of the
Additional Financing Loan remain achievable. Sufficient counterpart funds are available
and the performance of the borrower and the implementing agency is satisfactory. There
are no outstanding audit reports or audit reports unsatisfactory to the Bank or financial or
procurement issues associated with the project. Neither this loan in particular, nor Chile
is under suspension of disbursements.

3.      The proposed extension is necessary to allow the Government of Chile sufficient
time to complete disbursements under the Loan. Utilization of the resources of the
Additional Financing has been delayed due to the change of Government, the major role
that the executing agency (Ministry of Planning) had in responding to the emergency
related to the earthquake early last year, as well as initial unfamiliarity with the Bank and
its procedures. The ownership of the Government has been demonstrated by their
preparation of an action plan to fully utilize the Additional Financing Loan resources by
the end of 2012.

4.    This will be the first extension of the Additional Financing loan. The original loan
for              the                 Project                recently               closed.
