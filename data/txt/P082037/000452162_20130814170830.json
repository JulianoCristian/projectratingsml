outcome of the Social and Protection\n            Technical Assistance Project for Chile was satisfactory. The\n            risk to development outcome was low or negligible, and the\n            performance by both Bank and the borrower was satisfactory.\n            The following were few of the lessons learned: (1) single\n            initiative or program can serve as a practical and concrete\n            base for the installation of broader social protection\n            system which can be extended to cover other populations. (2)\n            Bank financing can play a role in financing activities which\n            once validated can be incorporated into the national budget;\n            (3) integrated information system is critical in order to\n            ensure that social programs reach those who need them the\n            most, and to guard the system from falling prey to abuse.\n            Without such a system social policies and interventions\n            cannot be effectively targeted, monitored or evaluated; (4)\n            the incorporation of the targeting instrument into the\n            integrated social information platform was a powerful tool\n            in the creation of a national registry of beneficiaries\n            which in turn became a valuable tool for managing a network\n            of social protection services; (5) high-quality\n            administrative data bases can be an important source of\n            information not only for the monitoring of social programs,\n            but also their impact evaluation, particularly if they can\n            be linked to survey data."}, "docdt": "2013-07-30T00:00:00Z"}
