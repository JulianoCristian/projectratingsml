Since 1950, road\n            rehabilitation, construction, and improvement has\n            contributed significantly to the development of the\n            Ethiopian economy. The project will promote this economic\n            development by: 1) constructing a 110 km road between\n            Lekempti and Ghimbi, a 104 km road between Agaro and\n            Bedelle, and six small bridges in the road section between\n            Bedelle and Gore; 2) asphalt surfacing 800 km of existing\n            roads; 3) mechanizing the Imperial Highway Authority's\n            accounting system; 4) employing foreign consultants to\n            advise on and assist in the management of the Imperial\n            Highway Authority, recruit qualified staff, and review the\n            designs and specifications of the roads to be constructed;\n            and 5) employing a consulting firm to carry out a\n            preliminary engineering survey and feasibility study of a\n            possible future road through the Ahwas Valley. These new\n            additions will improve the roads and highways in Ethiopia in\n            order to promote economic development."}, "docdt": "1963-02-28T00:00:00Z"}
