The Bank's performance was highly\n            satisfactory, primarily due to an outstanding supervision,\n            which provided corrective actions as needed, supplemented by\n            the findings of four technical assessments on project\n            impacts, and beneficiary satisfaction. The Borrower's\n            performance was satisfactory, with strong support at the\n            highest level, evidenced by the speedy creation of the\n            Social Fund Kingdom of Cambodia (SFKC), and effective\n            preparation, and appraisal activities. Lessons stress the\n            sustained efforts to ensure authentic community driven\n            demand for subprojects, a challenge that proved successful\n            in building partnerships with community organizations, and\n            nongovernmental organizations, and in strengthening the\n            participatory process. However, it would have been advisable\n            for SFKC to develop a higher level of technical, and\n            managerial skills, particularly as it regards counterpart\n            resources, and maintenance costs, including careful\n            selection of scale, and complexity of projects.\n            Notwithstanding improvement procedures SFKC has developed to\n            overcome delay problems, and quality of completed works,\n            monitoring is paramount to ensure adherence to standards;\n            thus, it would be useful for SFKC to implement a system of\n            incentives tied to staff performance indicators.\n            Furthermore, the issue of asset maintenance, is critical\n            given the poverty status of most communities, and it is\n            suggested that the role of local authorities be expanded to\n            ensure program sustainability."}, "docdt": "2001-02-28T00:00:00Z"}
