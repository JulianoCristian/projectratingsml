for\n            Indonesia aims to demonstrate that client-responsive\n            municipal service improvements can be stimulated through\n            small efforts selected and funded on a competitive basis;\n            and to promote institutional reform. The project has two\n            components. The first funds municipal innovation subprojects\n            of two kinds: efficiency-enhancing innovative service\n            delivery subprojects and pilots to improve the\n            administration, transparency in planning and implementation\n            of expenditures and disclosure of the performance of local\n            agencies. The second component funds technical assistance\n            and services for project implementation, mainly for\n            expenditures to be incurred as follows, strengthening the\n            project management unit, providing the cost of jurors and\n            awards for excellence, funding the cost of workshops and\n            dissemination of innovations, and providing training."}, "docdt": "1999-01-11T00:00:00Z"}
