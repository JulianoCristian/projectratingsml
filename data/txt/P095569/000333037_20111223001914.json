The\n            restructuring will trigger the following six safeguards\n            policies: natural habitats, forests, pest management,\n            physical cultural resources, indigenous peoples, and\n            involuntary resettlement. Additionally, by approval of the\n            Country Director, the restructuring: (i) supports a minor\n            reallocation of the loan proceeds; and (ii) extends by 18\n            months the closing date of the project, from December 31,\n            2011 to June 30, 2013, to allow for completion of planned\n            project activities."}, "docdt": "2011-12-20T00:00:00Z"}
