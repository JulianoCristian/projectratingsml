The reallocation is\n            necessary because some bidding processes (purchase of VC and\n            Weigh-in-Motion WIM equipment) could not take place because\n            of current conditions and restrictions in the country\n            regarding imported equipment. All funds allocated to goods\n            are therefore reallocated towards the Performance-based\n            Rehabilitation and Maintenance Contracts (CREMA) component\n            under category 1 (b). Another reallocation is the one\n            related to consultants' services. At project design it\n            was envisaged to hire consultants to design bridges, but\n            during project implementation it was decided that studies\n            will be carried out in-house. Proceeds were also reallocated\n            towards category 1(b). Finally, the pilot corridor for road\n            safety was delayed (mainly because of delays in reaching the\n            final design), it will be bid with local funds. Proceeds\n            were reallocated towards category 1(b). As a result, the\n            allocation to CREMAs (category 1 (b)) increased from\n            US$251.25 to US$281.5 million (12 percent increase)."}, "docdt": "2013-05-08T00:00:00Z"}
