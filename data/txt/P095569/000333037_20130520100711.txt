7a. Project Development Objectives/Outcomes
Original/Current Project Development Objectives/Outcomes
The overall purpose of the program is to further develop and implement an efficient road network
management strategy, bringing about the necessary resources to preserve the national road network in the
long term. This is a key condition towards increasing the competitiveness of the economy and supporting a
sustainable path of economic growth and poverty reduction: a.         Preserve the condition of vital road
assets, through the gradual expansion of performance-based contracts for the rehabilitation and
maintenance of the non-concessioned primary paved network; b. Strengthen road sector management
through carrying out a renewal program of DNV to revitalize its role in the sector by: (i) reinforcing its
human resource base, (ii) consolidating its transformation into a results-oriented organization accountable
for specific outputs; (iii) introducing a systematic approach to bridge management and (iv) enhancing road
safety.
