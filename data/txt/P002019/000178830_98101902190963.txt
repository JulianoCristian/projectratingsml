INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTlRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT TO
THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A
PROPOSED POWER LOAN TO
NATIONAL ELECTRIC POWER AUTHORITY
WITH THE GUARANTEE OF
THE FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF NIGERIA
1.       I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan to National Electric Power Authority (NEPA) with the guarantee of
the Federal Republic of Nigeria for the equivalent of US$76 million to
help finance a project for the expansion of the generation, transmission
and distribution system and for the improvement of management and oper-
ations. The loan would have a term of 25 years, including 5% years of
grace, with interest at 7¼ percent per annum.
PART I: THE ECONOMY
2.       Nigeria has a per capita income of about US$100 and a population
of approximately 68 million. In both respects, it compares with Pakistan
and Bangladesh and, in per capita income, with India and Indonesia. As in
these other countries, the main source of income and employment in Nigeria
is agriculture but the difficulties of agricultural development are con-
siderably more intractable, owing partly to patterns of land use and methods
of cultivation, which are less well developed and organized in Nigeria. The
distinguishing feature of Nigeria's economy in the short- and medium-term is
the rapid development of its oil-producing sector which is providing a con-
siderable degree of relief from balance-of-payments pressures and financial
constraints. The direct impact of the oil sector on the large population is
small, however, and the diffusion of the sector's growth-generating effects
to the bulk of the population will be particularly difficult.
3.       A Bank mission visited Nigeria in November 1971 and the report of
that mission (AW-35a dated June 9, 1972) is being circulated separately.
Country data are given in Annex II.
Current Position
4.       Nigeria has recovered substantially from the economic and social
consequences of the civil war that ended in January 1970 The rapid re-
integration of the Eastern States and their population into the economic,
political and social life of the nation attests to an atmosphere of re-
conciliation. The Federal Government has now established a strong central
position in the twelve-state federation, although many questions relating
to the future constitutional pattern of the nation remain to be resolved.



- 2 -
5.       The post-war increase of the national product and income
originated mainly in the petroleum and manufacturing sectors;  agri-
cultural growth continues to be slow and current output per capita
remains below the pre-war (1966) level. In contrast, output in the
oil sector is now about three times the maximum pre-war level and
income from the sector was further augmented by the world-wide revision
of petroleum price and tax arrangements in 1971. Outside the oil sector,
private investment activities are also being maintained at about double
the average pre-war level. In the current year, total investment is
estimated at about 21 percent of GNP, compared with an average of 1)4
percent in the first half of the 1960s. Current trends indicate that
GDP over the four years of the current Plan period (1970/71-1973/7)4)
will grow by an average rate slightly over 10 percent per annum in
real terms - about 4 percent higher than the rate envisaged in the
Plan - despite agriculture growth roughly in line with the 2.6 percent
per annum population growth rate only.
6.       Nigeria's investment program is being implemented within the
broad framework of its Second National Development Plan (1970/71-1973/7)4).
This Plan, concerned primarily with the requirements of reconstruction
and rehabilitation, served as the basis for the Bank's Rehabilitation
Program Loan approved in April 1971. The first progress report on Plan
implementation recently prepared by the Government indicates that there
has been some slippage during the first two years of the Plan, with an
overall shortfall of about 30 to 40 percent in public investment. Some
of this delay was expected, since the Plan was not launched until October
1970 and funds were not provided until the end of the first Plan year;
however, the scarcity of prepared projects and limited executive capacity
have contributed to the dela.y. Slippage is particularly marked in agri-
culture, industry and education. The performance of the different States
in implementing the Plan's investment program has also been uneven.
7.       In FY 1971/72, government revenues from the oil sector increased
to about £N320 million (US$920 million, or about $13 per capita) from
slightly less than £N100 million in the previous year. Owing largely
to further increases in revenues expected from the oil sector, the
Government's fiscal position is expected to be strong over the remainder
of the current Plan period if defense expenditures, which now represent
about 7 percent of GNP, are kept under control. The increase in foreign
exchange earnings attributable also to the oil sector has already enabled
the Government to liquidate the £N220 million of commercial arrears which
had accumulated during and immediately after the war. During the next two
years, the remaining import payment restrictions could be removed without
difficulty.  Imports, which increased rapidly over the last two years,
have apparently stabilized in recent months and balance-of-payments pros-
pects over the next few years appear to be favorable. Private and official
capital inflows should be sufficient to meet the small current account
deficit that is expected to persist. Rapid inflation in the urban areas
continues to be a matter of concern, however, and could adversely affect
the favorable short-term balance-of-payments and fiscal prospects.

Development Prospects and Policies
8.       As the immediate post-war economic and financial crisis is now
over, the Government is turning its attention increasingly to the country's
long-term prospects and development opportunities. The following table
gives some indicative orders of magnitude for projected growth rates for
the present Plan period and two subsequent five year periods:

recurrent expenditures and incremental capital-output ratios.
13   The last year before the civil war.
9.       Nigeria may well have the resources to double per capita income
within the next 12-15 years. As a large proportion of the additions to
national income over the next decade will accrue to the Government,
achievement of the economy's growth potential will depend to a large
extent on the Government's ability to maintain a rate of growth of current
public expenditures in line with development needs and on its capacity to
expand public sector investment over a broad range of sectors and geographical
regions. The rapid growth suggested will require a continued infusion of
technical, organizational and managerial skills from abroad to help increase
public and private investment in the short run and ensure further growth of
such investment in the long run. At the same time, incentives for private
investment outside the oil sector will be required, particularly in the



-h -
manufacLuring sector where a major revision of the tariff structure in
light of the recent changes in import regulations appears to be appro-
priate.
10.      The future trends in export earnings and government revenues
depend to a large extent on developments in the petroleur sector. Although
the oil industry is expected to account for about 85 percent of the country's
export earnings and over 50 percent of combined government. revenues from 1975
onwards, government revenues from petroleum in Nigeria on a per CaDita basis
are unlikely even under the most optimistic assumptions to approach those of,
say, Iran or Venezuela:
Nigeria     Iran     Venezuela
Oil revenue per capita
1970 (actual)         US$5        $37       $125
1975 (projected)      US$26       $80       $190
Because of the increases in oil revenues, combined Federal and States current
surpluses equivalent to some 8 percent of GNP might be realized from 1973/74
through the end of the decade, even assuming a fairly considerable increase
in current expenditures. While there is little doubt that, in addition to
the traditional development activities now being undertaken, adequate pro-
grams to increase employment and income opportunities in the rural sector
and to provide infrastructure for the rapidly growing urban areas will
require more financial resources than these surpluses will provide, it is
also clear that limited executive capacity rather than financial resources
will represent the major constraint on growth at least over the medium
term.
11.      For largely the same reason, the balance-of-payments position of
the country is expected to be strong through the current Plan period and
probably for some years to follow0 After the middle of the decade,however,
the growth rate of petroleum exports is likely to decline considerably,
while imports should continue to increase in line with the rapid increases
in consumption and investment expenditures.  A substantial resource gap may
therefore re-emerge in the early 1980s, again constraining economic growth
and development.
12.      These long-term trends clearly demonstrate the need for accelerated
developments in agriculture and manufacturing if the present moment.um of
growth generated by the oil sector is to be maintained. Despite the growing
importance of other sectors, agriculture will remain the key factor in
Nigeria's economic development as the largest employer of labor, the
principal source of food and raw materials for the increasing population
and an important earner of foreign exchange. The opportunities for growth
in the sector are considerable, based on the existence of expanding foreign
and, particularly, domestic markets for Nigeria's agricultural output; the
abundance of land and human resources whose diverse productive capacities
are presently under-utilized; and the availability of improved technology



-5-
which, if exploited, could increase productivity substantially. The con-
straints, on the other hand, are several: low producer incentives; trans-
port and distribution bottlenecks; inadequate machinery for planning,
coordinating and implementing a national policy for rural and agricultural
development; insufficient qualified manpower; and shortages of improved
seeds, fertilizers, chemicals, credit and other farm inputs.
13.      Unless a major effort to overcome these constraints and to increase
employment opportunities in the rural sector is initiated by the public
sector, income grbwth over the next 10-15 years will be confined mainly
to the urban areas. The already considerable gap between rural and urban
income would then widen sharply and the consequent migration of the pop-
ulation may result in a growth rate of urban population two or three times
the overall rate of 2.6 percent. The magnitude and structure of Nigeria's
employment problems are such that they will not respond easily to short-run
or narrowly conceived employment programs; improvements in income and
employment for most workers and, more particularly, for most new entrants
to the work force, will continue to depend largely on developments in the
agricultural, small industry and service sectors, where detailed planning
and administrative implementation present the most difficult problems.
Conclusions
14.      Despite these problems, the overriding conclusion with respect to
Nigeria's economic prospects is that the opportunity now exists to achieve
a significant increase in per capita incomne within the relatively short
time-span of 10-15 years.  To translate the country's potential resources
into a permanent improvement in the general standards of living, it is
essential that policies and strategies be adopted during the coming years
to improve the balance between urban and rural growth, between the develop-
ment of agriculture and the modern urban sectors, and between the different
regions of the country in terms of economic and social infrastructure. The
distribution of increased government resources between different uses and
claims can have a major impact on each of these and can, in the process of
planning and spending, contribute to the establishment of institutions
capable of carrying the main responsibility for development during the
1970s and thereafter. Foreign aid in the public and the private sectors,
both in the form of capital and technical assistance, can be of great
value in a period when the opportunities for development appear to be
in excess of the country's capacity, in terms of domestic organization
and skills, to make full use of these opportunities. Nigeria currently
enjoys a low debt-service ratio (about 3 percent in relation to gross
exports) and clearly could absorb a very substantial volume of additional
borrowing on conventional terms.

PART II: BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN NIGERIA
15.      Excluding the proposed loan, total Bank/IDA commitments to
Nigeria amount to $417.7 million (net of cancellations) of which $220.8
million was committed before, $31.1 million during and $165.8 million
after the civil war. Transport and power together account for about
two-thirds of this total. A summary statement of Bank loans, IDA credits
and IFC investments as of May 31, 1972 and notes on the execution of
on-going projects, is given at Annex I.
16.      Nigeria, having substantially completed its post-war reconstruction
and rehabilitation program, is now at a stage where a major development
effort is feasible. Given -the size of the country, its low level of
per capita income, its longer-term resource requirements and i-ts credit-
worthiness, substantial Bank lending would be well justified, particularly
in view of the increased development efforts that will be required of the
public sector in the coming decade. Moreover, in line with the development
priorities, the primary objective of future Bank activities should be to
increase the Government's capacity to expand investment over the broad
range of sectors and regions that is necessary for sustained and balanced
economic growth. Thus, in addition to transportation and power, where
the Bank is already established as a major lender, Bank lending should
be extended into agriculture, education and industry where increased public
investment is of high priority and where Bank assistance in identifying
and preparing projects and in creating new development agencies could
contribute substantially to the Government's own efforts.
17.      With a view towards increased support to the Government in agri-
culture, a sector mission visited Nigeria in 1971 to review agricultural
development prospects and to identify possible projects for external
financing. The mission's draft report is currently under review by the
Nigerian authorities. The next economic mission will also pay particular
attention to agriculture. In addition, a Bank sponsored and financed
Commonwealth Development Corporation mission reviewed the livestock sub-
sector in 1970 and the Bank is now assisting the Government in preparing
a project, which is scheduled for appraisal next month. I expect to
present a loan for this project to the Executive Directors in FY 1973.
18.      In industry, Bank lending has hitherto been confined to the
Nigerian Industrial Development Bank (NIDB), which will have committed
the full amount of the second Bank loan (705-UNI) towards the end of
1972. This loan is assisting NIDB to reorientate its activities and
increase its contribution to Nigeria's industrial sector in two important
respects: first, in line with the Government's indigenization policy, to
support more suitable projects sponisored by Nigerian private entrepreneurs,
and second, to help finance, within agreed limits, investment requirements
of Government companies, particularly those affected by the war. A mission
to appraise NIDB has just returned from the field, and a proposed third loan
may be ready for presentation in FY 1973. In view of the industrial sector's



increasing importance to Nigeria's development, the Bank is currently
examining the possibility of direct financial and technical assistance
to the sector as an addition to our continued support of NIDB. Priority
in the immediate future will be given to increasing the Bank's knowledge
of the sector and identifying areas where Bank assistance would be appro-
priate.
19.      A UNESCO Project Identification Mission visited Nigeria in 1971
and, following discussion of its report with the Government earlier this
year, a third education project has been identified, comprising mainly
secondary education and primary teacher training in the six Northern
States.  This project, which is currently being appraised, is expected
to result in a loan later in FY 1973. The Bank has also recently initiated
discussions with the Government on possible assistance to other areas such
as rural infrastructure, integrated rural development, water supply and
urban development.
20.      While power and transport are the relatively advanced sectors of
the economy, substantial investments are still necessary to support increas-
ing levels of economic activity. The Bank will therefore continue substantial
lending to both sectors, with priority given to projects in which technical
assistance can play a complementary role to lending, as it does, for example,
in the proposed loan to the power sector. I expect to recommend during the
next fiscal year substantial loans for a sixth highways project and a second
ports project. The proposed Lagos-Ibadan Expressway, connecting Nigeria's
two main cities, is expected to be the main component of the former and the
expansion of Lagos port the main item of the latter. Improvements in the
management and organization of the planning and administrative authorities
of these subsectors will be an important feature of both projects.
21.      While the Government and the Bank are currently engaged in substan-
tial project preparation work in some areas of agriculture, industry and
education, considerable efforts in further pre-investment studies and in
project identification are still necessary before a substantial lending
program in these sectors can be developed. Furthermore, executing institu-
tions in these sectors, which are concurrent Federal/State responsibilities
and where complicated organizational relationships exist, are relatively
weak. Therefore, I do not expect the major impact of the Bank's activities
in these areas to be felt before the middle of this decade, by which time
projects in agriculture, education and industry should represent a large
proportion of Bank lending to Nigeria.
PART III: THE ELECTRIC POWER SECTOR
22.      Demand for electric energy has grown rapidly since 1950. For the
period 1950 to 1967 growth averaged 19 percent per annum and, after a drop
during the civil war, resumed at an even higher rate, 26 percent in 1971 and
23 percent in 1972. Notwithstanding this rapid growth, only two million of
Nigeria's estimated sixtyeight million population use electricity and present
annual pe  capita consumption is only about 21 KWH, less than half of that in
East Africa. Some 400 townships with populations ranging from 3,000 to 100,000
have no electricity.



- 8 -
23.      The power sector in Nigeria has until recently been served
mainly by two statutory corporations, the Electricity Corporation of
Nigeria (ECN) with a total installed capacity of 440 MW, and Niger
Dams Authority (NDA) with a total installed capacity of 320 MW. A
third, the privately owned Nigerian Electricity Supply Corporation,
with a total installed capacity of only about 30 MW, supplies tin
mines in the Jos area.
24.      The Electricity Corporation of' Nigeria (ECN) was created
in 1951 to take over the operation and management of 17 small Govern-
ment and Native Authority undertakings. ECN was responsible for the
generation, transmission and distribution of electricity in all parts
of the country and distributed and retailed practically all electrical
energy. Until the Kainji Dam was commissioned in February 1969 ECN
also enjoyed a virtual monopoly over generation. ECN's plants were
exclusively thermal and consisted of 5 large interconnected power stations
with a capacity of 340 MW and a large number of widely scattered small
stations which produce about 100 MW.
25.      The Niger Dams Authority (NDA) was created in 1962, inter alia,
to construct and operate the 320 MW hydro plant at Kainji on the Niger
River; it has sold all its production to ECN.
26.      A 330/132 KV system stretching from Lagos to Kano in the north
and Aba in the south-east, connects Kainji and the major thermal stations
and supplies power to 76 urban centers. A further 29 centers are supplied
by small isolated stations. (See map attached).
27.      The Bank's first loan for power was made to ECN in 1964 for $30
million for the construction of transmission lines and distribution facil-
ities forming the initial stage of a nation wide power network. Later in
1964 the Bank made a loan of $82 million to NDA as part of a $208 million
financing plan to build the Kainji Dam and associated works on the Niger
River. Due partly to cost over-runs and partly to Nigeria's inability to
use entirely the bilateral loans which were tied to procurement, a gap arose
in external financing and in 1968 the Bank made a supplementary loan of $14.5
million to cover this shortfall. All three of these loans have been fully
disbursed and the projects successfuLly completed.
28.      However, the existence of two statutory agencies with overlapping
duties and functions created problems resulting in power failures, dupli-
cation of assets, administrative bottlenecks and delays in grid system
extension. These problems were aggravated by the civil war and growing
weaknesses in the management of both agencies. To correct the situation
and ensure proper coordination of policies in the power sector the Govern-
ment decided in 1969 that ECN and NDA should be merged. A Canadian
management consulting firm, Shawmont, was appointed to study the industry,
make recommendations to improve its management and prepare a plan for the
merger. Based upon this study the Federal Government has decided to create



by Decree the National Electric Power Authority (NEPA) which will assume
the functions, assets and liabilities of DMA and ECN, including the Bank's
three loans, with effect from June 1, 1972.  This Decree is expected to be
promulgated very shortly. The signing of the proposed loan is conditional
upon the promulgation of the Decree.
PART IV: THE PROJECT
29.      The first two years after the civil war were largely employed by
ECN and NDA in rehabilitation of war-damaged facilities, and neither was
able to prepare detailed plans for expansion. Bank pre-appraisal missions
in March, April and October 1971 and an appraisal mission in January/February
1972 helped them to prepare a 6-year (1973-78) investment program with an
estimated cost of £N126.6 million ($385 million). On the basis of economic
priority and urgency, 15 items were selected from this program for inclusion
in the project to be financed under the proposed loan. Negotiations were
conducted in Washington during the last half of May with a Nigerian Dele-
gation headed by Mr. Y.A. Dikko, acting Chief Executive Officer of NDA; the
Guarantor was represented by Mr. H. Osha of the Ministry of Finance.
The Project
30.      The project which would represent a substantial increase over past
investment levels, reflects the Government's determination to intensify the
electrification of the country. It consists of:
(i) The addition of two 100 MW generating units at Kainji to
be commissioned in October 1975 and April 1976, respectively;
(ii) The installation of additional transformers, capacitors and
related switchgear to reinforce and improve the reliability
of the major 330 KV substations of the system, to be completed
by March 1977;
(iii) The construction of a second 330 KV transmission line from
Kainji to Lagos and the extension of intermediate substations.
This line will increase the security of supply to Lagos and
is scheduled for completion by March 1977;
(iv)  The reinforcement of existing distribution systems in 43
cities and towns and the electrification of 41 sizeable
townships by connecting them to the Kainji grid during the
period FY72 through FY 77;
(v) Power development studies for the preparation of a long-
range expansion program, including feasibility studies for
the next stage of development and the design and specifi-
cations for the next generating plant; and
(vi) Management studies and technical assistance to complement
the expected Canadian technical assistance program.

Project Execution
31,      The project will be carried out under the general administration
of NEPA's construction division, with the major components being designed
and supervised by consulting firms acceptable to the Bank. Except for
small distribution system extensions wrhich will be carried out by NEPA's
personnel, all major construction work will be executed by contractors.
The successful execution of the project calls for particular attention
to management and training. The Government is also well aware that the
great potential benefits of consolidation in the power sector will be
realized only if NEPA is provided with strong and capable management.
The initial appointments to the positions of Chief Executive Officer,
Assistant General Manager (Planning) and Assistant General Manager
(Finance) would be persons acceptable to the Bank employed under terms
and conditions satisfactory to the Bank. The Government recognizes that
it wiU be necessary to recruit internationall,y for these positions.   In
addition, NEPA will employ a team of experts from a consulting firm or
public utility, satisfactory to the Bank, to assist and train Nigerian
staff. These appointments, which may take some months to effect, are
conditions of effectiveness of the proposed loan.
Cost Estimates and Financing Plan
32.      The total cost of the project is estimated at $126 million
(including contingencies). The estimated foreign exchange cost would be
financed by the proposed loan of $76 million and a grant of US$0.94 million
equivalent from the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA) for
the engineering and design services for the Kainji extension. The cost
estimates by major items are summarized in Annex III. Cost estimates,
which include duties and taxes of about 0N3.5 million, are based on the
latest information available in Nigeria but substantial contingency
allowances, ranging from 22 percent to 27 percent, have been included
in view of the lack of recent construction of transmission lines in the
country and the fact that engineering of the transmission and distribution
lines has not been completed. If any savings are realized on the foreign
cost of the project, theyg would be used, subject to Bank approval, to finance
the electrification of more townships. All local currency costs of the pro-
ject are expected to be financed by NEPA from internally generated funds,
which would be supplemented if necessary by the Government.
33.      NEPA's cash requirements over the six year period ending in 1978
are estimated at £N137.2 million ($h17.2 million), of which ZN73.4 million
($223.1 miUion) would be derived from internal cash generation and £N65.5
million ($199.3 million) from borrowings. In addition to the proposed Bank
loan, other borrowings already arranged or under negotiation include financ-
ing from Kreditanstalt fur "Wiederaufbau amounting to $3.95 million towards
the cost of on-going extensions and reinforcements of existing high and low
voltage systems and $6.51 million for rehabilitation of the war-damaged
system in the East and the repair of the Ijora power station. CIDA is



considering financing the foreign exchange cost ($6.75 million) of a
132 KV transmission line from Kainji to the Niger border, to supply
power to Niamey under an agreement recently concluded between the
Governments of Nigeria and Niger. It is expected that CIDA will also
be requested to provide financing for the foreign exchange cost ($12.2
million) of a 132 KV line from Kainji to supply Jos, Bauchi and Maiduguri,
and may be requested to make a grant of about $3 million towards the cost
of providing the team of experts to be hired to advise and train NEPA's
staff.
Financial position
34.      The most recent audited accounts available, as of March 31, 1970
for ECN and March 31, 1971 for NDA, reflect the unsatisfactory financial
performance of these two bodies resulting largely from the effects of the
civil war and management weaknesses. ECN's accounts receivable represented
about six months revenue, resulting in long delays in payments to suppliers
and a poor credit rating. Agreement has been reached on the measures re-
quired to establish NEPA's accounts and records on a sound basis, applying
modern accounting and management techniques. Prior to the proposed loan
being made effective, NEPA will provide the Bank with the audited consolidated
balance sheet of NDA and ECN as of March 31, 1972. Thereafter, consultants
acceptable to the Bank will revalue the consolidated plant and other assets
so as to establish replacement costs and realistic depreciation.
35.      The combined net operating income of NDA and ECN for the year ending
March 31, 1972 was £N7.5 million ($22.8 million) which represented a return
of about 6.7 percent on estimated average net fixed assets in operation.
Under the terms of previous loan agreements with the Bank, ECN was required
to earn 8 percent and NDA about 6.4 percent on net fixed assets in operation,
giving a composite rate of about 6e9 percent. Financial projections for NEPA
based upon conservative assumptions of load growth and anticipating some
tariff reductions, indicate a healthy financial future. The return on net
fixed assets is likely to be about 8-10 percent in FYs 1973 and 1974 and
about 9 percent thereafter, based on current valuation of fixed assets.
The proposed Loan Agreement provides that promptly upon completion of the
revaluation of its assets NEPA will agree with the Bank on a minimum annual
rate of return of not less than 8 percent to be earned on net fixed assets
in operation. Pending such agreement NEPA will not, without the prior
approval of the Bank, make any changes in its current tariffs which will
result in the reduction of the level of its gross revenues.
Procurement
36.      All procurement under the proposed loan will be made through
international competitive bidding in accordance with the Bank's guide-
lines for procurement, except for some control and communication equip-
ment amounting to less than $0.5 million equivalent, where direct com-
patibility with existing installations is essential. This equipment will
be purchased from the original supplier, who was selected after inter-
national competitive bidding. Contracts for an amount estimated at $150,000
equivalent or more will be subject to the prior approval of the Bank. Bids
will be evaluated on the basis of c.i.f. prices. The contract for the



- 12 -
Oshogbo-Akure transmission line was signed in November 1971 and bid
dociuments for other urban transmission lines and equipment have been
issued. The Bank has agreed with the proposed award of the contracts
for the two additional hydro units at Kainji.
Disbursement
37.      The proposed loan would be disbursed against the direct foreign
cost of imported equipment and materials, engineering and management ser-
vices and the estimated foreign exchange component of civil works contracts,
and of any locally procured goods and services.  It is proposed that expend-
itures incurred under the Oshogbo-Akure contract and for consulting services
after January 1, 1972 be reimbursed out of the loan. The amount of retro-
active financing would not exceed $1 million.
Economic Justification
38.      The project will contribute substantially to the Government's
objectives of firming up existing supplies extending power supply in
industrial areas and accelerating the supply of electricity to major
population sectors where there is presently no supply. The addition of
the two generating units at Kainji will show an economic rate of return
of about 23 percent. The second 330 KV Kainji-Lagos transmission line
is justified by the increased reliability of supply to Lagos reflected
in an econcomic return conservatively estimated at 12 percent. The
connection to the Kainji network of the townships to be electrified
under the project is the least cost solution and the proposed extension
will increase from 2 to 3 million, the number of people supplied with
electricity. In addition, the number of people in potential reach of
electric service will increase by about 40 percent, from 5 to'7 million.
The overall economic return of the ten distribution system reinforcement
schemes and township electrification schemes is at least 22 percent. In
calculating this return it has not been possible to quantify the benefits
which will arise from industrial development in the areas, from the savings
on existing and future captive diesel power generation and from the slow-
down in urban migration which is likely to result.
PART V:  LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
39.      The draft Loan Agreement between the Bank and the National Electric
Power Authority, the draft Guarantee Agreement between the Federal Republic
of Nigeria and the Bank, the Report of the Committee provided for in Article
III, Section 4 (iii) of the Articles of Agreement and the text of a resolu-
tion approving the proposed loan are being distributed to the Executive
Directors separately. The draft agreements conform to the normal pattern
for loans for power projects. Provision is made in Section 9.01(a) of the
Loan Agreement to the effect that the proposed loan will not become effective
until all the conditions precedent to the effectiveness of a loan assumption
agreement to be entered into between the Bank and NEPA in respect of previous



- 13 -
Bank loans to ECN and NDA and the guarantee of such loan assumption by
the Federal Republic of Nigeria shall have been duly authorized and
ratified by all necessary corporate and governmental action.
4O.      I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI: RECOMMENDATION
41.      I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
loan.

C. Projects in Execution
1.        The revision of the portion of the First Education Project (Credit
72-UNI) relating to the three Eastern States was described in my memorandum
of March 3, 1972 (IDA/R72-26). Following approval of the amendments to the
Credit Agreement, project implementation is proceeding satisfactorily. Total
disbursements have now risen to $5.1 million of which approximately $2 million
were disbursed this year and the rate of disbursement is now expected to in-
crease rapidly. The entire project is expected to be conpleted by the revised
Closing Date of June 30, 1974.
2.        The problems affecting the implementation of the Apapa Road project
financed under loan 426-UNI were reported to the Executive Directors in a
memorandum from the Secretary dated June 10, 1970 (SecM 70-271) and in my
report on the Rehabilitation Program Loan (P-911, dated April 2, 1971). The
revised construction contract has now been signed, work has continued and the
project is now expected to be completed by about mid-1973. Withdrawal appli-
cations in respect of payments made for construction since March 1970 are
expected shortly.
3.        Disbursement of the Highway Rehabilitation (640-UNI) and Transport
Rehabilitation (694-UNI) loans was originally slow owing to delays in tendering
(640-UNI) and the time taken to reach an understanding with the Government on
the items to be included in the project (694-UNI). Both loans have now been
fully committed, disbursements amounting to $2.1 million (640-UNI) and $4.7
million (694-UNI) have been made and the rate of disbursement is expected to
accelerate shortly as construction proceeds and delivery of equipment already
on order is made.
4.        The final disbursement against the Rehabilitation Program Loan
(732-UNI) was made in early April 1972, approximately 9 months before the
scheduled Closing Date.
5.        The first loan to the Nigerian Industrial Development Bank (588-UNI)
is now almost completely disbursed and disbursements have started against the
second loan (705-UNI) which is almost fully committed. Implementation of the
Western Cocoa loan (76h-UNI) is proceeding satisfactorily and the first small
disbursements have been made.
6.        The Second Education Loan (814-UNI) is expected to become effective
in July and the $26.3 million Roads V loan approved by the Executive Directors
in April is expected to be signed before the end of the fiscal year.
