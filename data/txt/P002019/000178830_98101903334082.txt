APPRAISAL OF THE FOURTH POWER PROJECT
NATIONAL ELECTRIC POWER AUTHORTrY
NJERIA
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        This report appraises a project to be carried out by the
National Electric Power Authority (NEPA), a new authority being created
by the merger of the two former government bodies, the Electricity
Corporation of Nigeria (ECN) and the Niger Dams Authority (NDA). The
project, for which a loan of US$76 million is proposed, would help
Nigeria meet the rapid growth in the demand for power experienced since
the cessation of the civil war in 1970, and would also help inprove the
management of the power sector, which has appreciably worsened since the
first power loan to ECN in 1964.
ii.       The main problem facing the power sector is the physical and
financial deterioration that has been taking place for some years now.
In an effort to ameliorate the present condition of the sector, the
Government is creating NEPA by merging ECN and NDA, and will appoint
top management personnel acceptable to the Bank and engage a team of
highly qualified advisers to assist the Nigerian staff. These appoint-
meents are conditions of effectiveness.
iii.      The proposed project, consisting of about one third of NEPA's
six-year program, would comprise: two additional generating units of about
100 IVW each at the existing Kainji hydroelectric station; a 330 kV trans-
mission line about 300 miles long from Kainji to Lagos: reinforcement of four
330 kV substations; distribution system reinforcement in 43 cities and
major towns; electrification of 41 townships presently without electric-
ity; future power development studies; and management studies. The esti-
mated cost of the project is US$126 million, of which the foreign currency
component is US$76 million - the amount proposed for Bank financing. The
local currency would be financed by internal cash generation. The remain-
der of NEPA's total program for the six years to March 31, 1978 would
amount to US$260 million, of which US$30 million is expected to be financed
by Kreditanstalt fur Wiederaufbau (KFW) and the Canadian International
Developnent Agency (CIDA); US$93 million by a future foreign loan and the
balance of US$137 million from internal sources.
iv.       The proposed loan would be the fourth to the power sector. The
first one, US$30 million, was made to ECN in 1964 to finance transmission
and distribution works. The second and third loans, US$82 million and
US$14.5 million, were made in 1964 and 1968 to NDA, to finance the Kainji
multipurpose project and a 330 kV transmission network. Despite the cost



- ii -
overrun, which was the basis for the second loan to NDA, thle execution
of both previous Bank projects was successfully completed; however,
the institutional objectives of these projects were not achieved.
v.        ECN's and NDA's past financial performance has been poor.
Both have been in default on the existing loans under the rate of
return covenants, and the Government on occasions during the civil war
had to service both loans on behalf of the borrowers. Their accounting
is seriously in arrears (ECN's last audited balance sheet is dated
March 31, 1970), and their records are inaccurate. As a result it has
been impossible to gather any financial information which can be
considered up-to-date or accurate. NEPA will completely reorganize
its accounts and institute modern accounting and management techniques.
vi.       NEPA's future financial situation looks considerably brighter.
Rapidly growing sales at relatively high tariffs will yield sufficient
revenues to enable NEPA to reach a minimum rate of return of 8% on the
net fixed assets in operation in FY 1973, generate enough funds to finance
about 53% of its expansion program, and also contemplate reductions in
existing tariffs in a few years.
vii.      Except for one minor item (US$0.5 million) to allow for standard-
ization of control and communications equipment, all procurement under the
proposed loan would be made through international competitive bidding in
accordance with the Bank's Guidelines for Procurement. Retroactive financ-
ing of up to US$1.0 million is recommended to cover costs EGN and NDA have
had to incur on the project.
viii.     The economic return of the Kainji units is at least 23%; that
of the 330 kV transmission line at least 12%; and that of the distribu-
tion system reinforcement and township electrification at least 22%.
ix.       A loan of US$76 million equivalent to NEPA for a term  of 25
years, including a grace period of about 5½ years is proposed.



APPRAISAL OF THE FOURTH POWER PROJECT
NATIONAL ELECTRIC POWER AUTHORITY
NIGERIA
1. INTRODUCTION
1.01      This report covers the appraisal of a power project expected
to be carried out by the National Electric Power Authority (NEPA), an
Authority being created as a result of the merger of the Electricity
Corporation of Nigeria (ECN) and the Niger Dams Authority (NDA), to
whom the Bank has lent a total of US$126.5 million.
1.02      The first Bank loan to the power sector, 372-UNI for US$30
million was made to ECN in 1964 to finance transmission and distribution
facilities. The second loan, 383-UNI for US$82 million, was made to NDA
in 1964 to finance the Kainji multipurpose project and a 330 kV trans-
mission network; the third Bank loan 572-UNI for US$14.5 million was a
supplemental loan made to NDA in 1968 to complete the Kainji project.
The three loans are completely disbursed and the projects are operating
sati sfactorily.
1.03      ECN, the older of the two Government agencies in the power
sector, had shown a steady deterioration in its management and operation
for some years now. NDA has also been facing a similar predicament.
Formed primarily to construct the Kainji deyelopment, NDA has been en-
gaged in operating both the hydro station and the national high voltage
network -- without a chief executive and with only a handful of trained
managers. This deterioration of both entities, which was accelerated by
the civil war (1967-69), resulted from an increasing shortage of competent
people in the top management positions,as experienced management personnel
were prematurely replaced. Coordination of planning, design, construction
and operations between the two en,ities has been practically non-existent,
with neither agency doing very much to bring about an improvement.
1.04       hen making the power loans during the 1960's, the Bank had
expected to see a large increase in net income leading to tariff reductions
during the 1970's which have so far not materialized because of the war and
the loss of substantial load in the East. Wth the rehabilitation of the
system in the Eastern States and the resulting resumption of power sales,
together with the general economic recovery of the country, the sector's
revenue position should improve considerably. Moreover, the merger of ECN
and NDA into a single authority, NEPA, together with other actions to be
taken before the loan is made effective, including the recruitment of top
management personnel and the engagement of a team of highly qualified
advisers to assist and train the Nigerian staff, will permit much needed
improvement in operations.



- 2 -
1.05      The project proposed for Bank financing consists of:  two addi-
tional 100 MW generating units at the existing Kainji hydroelectric sta-
tion; a 330 kV transmission line from Kainji to Lagos, the capital, and
reinforcement of four 330 kV substations; a program designed to increase
from two to three million the population served by electricity and com-
prising (i) distribution system reinforcement in 43 cities and major
towns, and (ii) electrification of 41 townships; future power develop-
ment studies, and management services. The project would constitute
about a third of NEPA's six-year program and is estimated to cost JS$126
million of which US$76 million is the foreign currency component proposed
for Bank financing.
1.06      Because of the fragmented condition of the sector and the
dearth of competent personnel, much of the basic work involved in the
definition of the project, the preparation of cost estimates and load
forecasts, the establishment of the project's justification, and the
preparation of a financing plan was done by Bank staff during pre-
appraisal missions to Nigeria in March/April and October, 1971. This
report reflects the results of these missions, and of the appraisal
mission comprising Messrs. A. Bouhaouala, A.A.M. Onslow, and J. Martinez
who visited Nigeria in January/February 1972.



2. THE POWER SECTOR
The Economic Environment
2.01      Nigeria, with an approximate area of 356,000 square miles,
has a population of 68 million growing at an annual rate of about 2.6%
with a marked tendency to concentrate around large cities; the annual
rate of urban population growth is estimated at about 5%.
2.02      Nigeria's GNP is currently estimated at about US$100 per
capita but important petroleum resources and a dynamic manufacturing
sector indicate that the country now has the potential to perhaps double
per capita income over the next 12-15 years. While the expansion of
the oil sector will also provide a considerable degree of relief from
financial difficulties, limited executive capacity in all sectors of
the economy will represent a major constraint on economic growth for
several years to come.
2.03      Only two million Nigerians use electricity.  Annual per capita
consumption was about 20 kWh in FY 1972 and will not exceed 80 kWh in
FY 1981 despite an ambitious electrification program.  About 400 town-
ships each with a population ranging from 3,000 to 100,000 people are
without electric service. The Government, under strong pressure from
the public, has decided to accelerate the electrification of the country.
Organization of the Sector
2.04      Apart from ECN and NDA, the only electric power utility presently
operating in Nigeria is the Nigerian Electricity Supply Corporation Limited
(NESCO), which will not be touched by the creation of NEPA. NESCO is a
private company operating in the Jos Plateau area under a ten-year renewable
license from the Ministry of Mines and Power. It supplies the tin mining
industry, a number of small isolated establishments, and ECN's distribution
network with power generated by several small hydro stations totalling 30 MW.
Generating Facilities
2.05      The Nigerian power utilities have an installed capacity of about
790 Md. It consists of 350 NW of hydro capacity and about 440 MW thermal
capacity. The hydro capacity is composed of 320 MW at Kainji (see
Annex 1) and 30 MW spread over several small hydro stations operated
by NESCO. Of the 440 MW thermal capacity belonging to ECN, 340 MW is
installed in five large interconnected power stations: Ijora, Ughelli,
Afam/Trans Amadi, Oji River, and Kaduna. The rest, about 100 Md, represents
the total capacity of a large number of small power stations which are
scattered all, over the country, and of which there is no accurate inventory.



- 4 -
2.06      Whereas the hydro capacity is in good operating condition,
the thermal capacity has suffered from lack of maintenance and careless
operation during the late 1960's.  Much of it, some 120 M4, should be
scrapped as obsolete, undependable, and uneconomic to run.  The remain-
ing 320 M4 consists of (i) 300 MW representing the capacity to be re-
tained in the five interconnected stations mentioned in paragraph 2.05,
and (ii) 20 MW representing the capacity of the isolated stations that
is understood to be in good condition.
2.07      In the past, whenever an area  was connected to the national
grid, ECN continued to maintain the power station which had been supply-
ing the area before the connection, instead of redeploying personnel and
equipment elsewhere.  This wasteful practice is being ended.  During
negotiations, assurances were given that within 18 months of the comple-
tion of the connection to the national grid of an area formerly served
by a diesel station, NEPA would consult with the Bank to determine the
future of such station.  It is expected that in this way, more than ten
diesel stations, such as those now in operation in Zaria, Kano, Funtua,
Benin, etc., will soon be moved to serve other isolated areas or scrapped
to save maintenance and personnel costs, if the equipment is in bad con-
dition.
2.08      ECN has been in dispute with a supplier about one of its power
stations, the Ughelli (Delta) station. This station was purchased under
a supplier credit arrangement from Stal Laval/Asea (Sweden). The two
36 MW gas turbine units of the station, which were commissioned in early
1967, suffered heavy damage to the high pressure compressor blading three
times. The first incident occurred after only a few thousand running
hours. Shortly after being repaired, the two units experienced the same
trouble again. The third breakdown happened in 1969 during the civil war,
causing the station to be shut down for 15 months. Late in 1970 the sup-
plier modified the high pressure compressor and the units became operable.
But in the meantime ECN, which could not reach an agreement on compensation
from the supplier, refused to honor the promissory notes given in payment
of the contract price.  In April 1971 ECN, still unable to reach satisfactory
agreement, decided to shut down the power station and submit the case to
arbitration. During negotiations for the proposed loan, the Nigerian dele-
gation indicated that an amicable agreement was about to be reached with
the supplier.
The National Grid
2.09      The Nigerian power transmission grid consists of a 330/132 kV
system stretching from Lagos in the southwest,to Aba in the southeast,
and to Kano in the north. The system connects Kainji and the major power
stations to the consumption centers. From the 330 kV substations, 132
and 33 kV transmission and distribution lines supply 76 urban centers
with electricity, most of it generated at Kainji. The remaining 29
electrified centers of Nigeria are supplied by small, isolated hydro or
diesel stations. The three maps at the end of the report show most of
the existing and future facilities.



-5-
Electric Power Tariffs
2.10      With the Government's approval ECN introduced a new tariff
schedule in September 1969. The schedule simplified the method of
billing electric power, and brought about substantial uniformity in
the prices charged throughout the country. A major effect of the new
schedule was to reduce or maintain the price of electricity in outlying
areas and increase it in the south, with the highest increase in Lagos.
This increase, however, did not hinder the fast growth of the load in
Lagos. A feature of the new schedule is the minimum monthly charge of
one Nigerian pound (Us$3.o4) designed to prevent subsidizing of small
customers by large ones. The present average revenue (US¢4.69 per kWh),
which is relatively high for a power market of this size, is adequate to
provide NEPA with the funds it requires and there is no immediate need
to make any substantial revision of the tariffs (see paragraph 6.21).

3. THE BORROWER
3.01      The Borrower would be the National Electric Power Authority
(NEPA), a new Authority being created by the merger of the Electricity Corp-
oration of Nigeria (ECN) and the Niger Dams Authority (NDA).  In order to
improve the physical and administrative performance of the sector, the
Federal Government decided to merge ECN and NDA into one authority, and in
early 1970, commissioned a management consulting firm, Shawmont (Canada),
paid for by CIDA, to study the power supply industry, analyze its problems
and make recommendations for the merger and improvement of management.
3.02      In JuLy 1971 Shawmont issued a report in which it outlined
proposals for a new Government power authority to be set up in Nigeria.
These proposals were based on the merger of ECN and NDA into one authority,
with a modern and decentralized organizational structure.
3.03      The Bank discussed the proposals with the Government and Shawmont
and it was agreed that the proposed new organization would have the
following characteristics:
a.   The Chief Executive (President) would be assisted by two
senior advisers: the Director of Planning, and the
Management Auditor.
b.   The line responsibilities would be spread over eight
Divisions, each headed by a Vice-President: Engineering,
Operation, Finance, Commercial, Districts, Administration,
Personnel, and Purchasing.
c.   Large autonomy would be given to the Districts, whose number
would still be determined.
3.04      Shawmont pointed out the scarcity of competent staff within ECN
and NDA and stressed the need for recruiting several highly qualified persons
uo implement the merger and run the new Authority. To solve this problem,
the Bank and the Government on several occasions discussed how best to provide
a core around which a strong Nigerian management could be developed. As a
result of these discussions, it was agreed during negotiations tWhat as conditior!s
of effectiveness of the proposed loan:
a.   The Government would appoint duly qualified and competent
persons, acceptable to the Bank, for the positions of
Chief Executive Officer, Assistant General Manager
(Planning) and Assistant General Manager (Finance); and
b.   NEPA would sign an agreement satisfactory to the Bank with a
large power utility or management consulting firm for the provision
of a team of experts to assist and train senior Nigerian staff
during the construction period of the project. The team members
would not have line authority.



legislation
3 G5      The Ic-rernment will i3sue a decree establishing NEP.A a, . body
corporate to deivelop and mainta:i an efficient, coo-dinated and  ni *caL
system of electricity supply for all. parts of the Fdere.aJion. NE.`k? -w11
have a Board of nine direrlt.cors,, the Chairman being  the Permanert Sc7rntoary
of the Ministry of Mines and Power4 The other members will be represertat
tives of the Federal Ministries of Finance, Industry,- and Econom:-P ievop-
ment, the Chief Inspecting Engineerj NEPA's General MYanager sntd three non-
Government members appotinted by the Comizissioner of ltms and Pcrnr   The
General Manager will be appointed by the Federal Exscutive Council on the
recomendation of the Conn.ssioner of Mines and Power, Assistant General
Nanagers will be appointed by the Board of Directors on the recm-moendation
of the General Manager. The General Menager will be responsible for ',he
day to dey operations of NEPA under the general direction of the Board.
3.o6 NEPA will be granted sufficient authority to operate effectivel,
and will not be subject to the Statutory Corporations Service Camission,
which regulates employment and conditions of staff, nor to the Corpcrations
Standing Tenders Board, which controls the awarding of tenders,  ECN has
been subJected to these two controls, which have resulted in difficulties
in recruitment and stbaff allocation, and in delays in the procurexaent of
eq,uiipment .
3.07      The non-power functions of the Kainji project, such as navi ga-
tion, irrigation, pisciculture, etc., so far exercised by NDA5, will event-
ually be transferred to new Statutory corporations, thus relieving }EPA
from the responsibility for activities cepletely extraneous to its pri-
mary objectives.
3.08      NEPA will assume all the assets, liabi-lities, rights and duties
of ECN and NDA as of June 1, 1972.  It will be able to borrow money with
approval of the Federal Executive Council, and acquire other electricity
authorities with the Conmaissioner of Mines and Power. The Com.nrissioner
ImIst also approve the price of electricity sales of the A-uthority or any
charges for the use of its facilities or services.
Organization
3.09      None of NEPA's senior management has yet been appointed.
Apart from the Uhree key men who are to be appointed before the loan
becones effective (paragra-ph 3.0L4), it is expected that all senior
appointments to the positions of division heads would be held by
Nigerians, who will be assisted by the team of expatriate experts.
3.10      The total number of NEPA's employees is likely to be about
9,000, which is excessive by a few thousand considering the number of
customers and kWh sold (about 250,000 consumers and 1X8OO GWh in FY 1972).
However, the expected rapid growth of the power market should allow I'EPk
to eventually improve this situation without having to resort to massive
dismissals, provided further recruitment is drastically restricted and

existing training programs intensified. ECN which is already operating
a training center for junior staff, is building a second one near Lagos.
Furthermore, the team mentioned in paragraph 3.04 is expected to devote
a large amount of its time to training Nigerian personnel.  Solving the
overstaffing problem, in view of all the other sector problems, is not
the most immediate issue.
3.11      The existing management reporting systems are generally ineffec-
tive and cumbersome. Systems and procedures are poorly designed, not
automated to any degree, and misunderstood by the staff. Management does
not receive feed-back information and nor does it have the means of control.
To correct this deficiency, Shawmont, in a further report recently sub-
mitted to the Government, recommends detailed practices and procedures for
planning, engineering, operation, accounting, administration and personnel.
To help implement these recommendations will be part of the responsibilities
of the management consultants.
Insurance
3.12      Both NDA and ECN were insured locally against normal risks
encountered in electricity undertakings, with the exception of machinery
breakdown. In view of ECN's poor maintenance record, no insurance company
was willing to provide coverage against this risk without charging a pro-
hibitive premium. For this reason, a special provision has been included
in the financial forecasts to cover any additional cost of repairs which
would normally be paid by insurance (see Annex 14). During negotiations
it was agreed that NEPA would maintain adequate insurance caverageo



4. THE PROJECT
The Six-Year Investment Program
4.01      Neither ECN nor NDA had prepared a detailed investment program
by the time of the appraisal. The Second National Development Plan (FY
1971-74) gives some indications about the capital expenditures of ECN and
NDA. Additional information is provided by four reports prepared by con-
sultants, covering parts of the program, with some duplication and many
contradictions. Three of these reports, which were prepared by Merz and
McLellan (U.K.), concern distribution system reinforcement in Lagos and
in several major towns and electrification of 225 townships. The fourth
report, prepared by T. Ingledow and Associates, Ltd. (Canada), covers the
electrification of about 140 townships most of which were already included
in Merz and McLellan's study. But feasibility studies have not been made
for the largest items of the program: the first Kainji extension and second
330 kV Kainji-Lagos transmission line.
4.02      Feasibility studies would have helped improve the quality of the
load forecast, ascertain the accuracy of the cost estimates, establish with
a higher precision priorities among all the possible electrification schemes,
select the best routes for transmission lines, and determine the optimum
timing of the various items composing the project. However, despite the
absence of feasibility studies and despite the approximations that had to
be made to prepare an investment program (see paragraph 4.03), the proposed
project warrants the Bank's assistance (see Chapter 5)0
4.03      The appraisal team, with the help of ECN and NDA prepared a
six-year (FY 1973-78) investment program.  The program, described in
Annex 2, provides for a substantial increase over past investment levels,
thus reflecting the Government's determination to intensify the elec-
trification of the country. However, it will be very difficult for NEPA
to implement the program without hiring consultants and without securing
the services of several qualified engineers (see paragraph 4.13).
The Project
4.04      The project proposed for Bank financing represents about one
third of the six-year program and consists of 15 items selected on the
basis of economic priority and urgency. These items, which are described
in Annex 2, paragraphs Al, B2 and B3, Dl through DlO, J2 and K2, are the
following:
a.   First Kainji Extension consisting of the addition of two 100 SW
generating units and associated switchgear, and a 330/132 kV
substation at Kainji. The units, which are expected to be commis-
sioned in October 1975, and April 1976, respectively, will bring
the installed capacity of Kainji to 520 NW. The engineering and
design cost of this item, £NO.31 million (US$o.94 million), is
being financed by CIDA, and Montreal Engineering Company has
been assigned to this task.



- 10 -
b.   Installation of additional transformers, capacitors, reactors,
and related switchgear at the 330 kV substations of Akangba,
Oshogbo, Onitsha, and Kaduna. This item, called reinforcement
of existing 330 kV substations, and designed to improve the
reliability of the major substations of the system, will be
completed by March 1977.
c.   Construction of a second 330 kV transmission line about 300
miles long from Kainji to Lagos and extension of Kainji., Jebba,
Oshogbo, and Akangba substations. These facilities, which are
expected to be completed by March 1977, will greatly increase
the security of the power supply to Lagos.
d.   Reinforcement of the existing distribution systems in 43 cities
and towns, and electrification of 41 sizeable townships by
connecting them to the Kainji grid. The works will be grouped
into ten different schemes shown in Annex 2 under the heading
Grid System Extension, Stage 1A. They are to be carried out
during FY 1972 though FY 1977.
e.   Power development studies consisting of a review of Kainji
hydrology; preparation of a long-range (15 years) sector
expansion program, including feasibility studies of the pro-
jects for the next stage development; and design and specifica-
tions for the next generating plant.
f.   Management studies and technical assistance.  This item, which
complements the expected Canadian technical assistance program,
includes management studies by consultants, and advisory ser-
vices.
Cost Estimate
4.o5      The cost estimate of the proposed project, detailed in Annex 3
and summarized in the table below, has been established on the basis of
the information provided by ECN, NDA, and their consultants.  Because
there has been no recent construction of transmission lines in Nigeria,
and because the exact scope of the transmission and distribution schemes
is still being defined, contingency allowances in total are high: 22 to
27% depending on the item considered. Allowances for price escalation
have been provided at about 12%, corresponding to an annual rate of price
increase of about 3% for both local and foreign currency expenditures.
Contingency allowances for variation in quantity of goods and services
range from 10 to 15%: 10% for the First Kainji Extension and the 330 kV
Substation Reinforcement, and 15% for most of the remaining items. These
physical allowances have been included in the individual cost estimate of
each item and are not shown separately in the table below. The local
currency components of the cost estimates include customs duties and
taxes evaluated at about 20% of the CIF costs.

Proposed Bank Loan
h.o6      The proposed Bank loan of US$76 million equivalent would finance
the project's estimated foreign cost with the exception of the engineering
and design services for the first Kainji extension, which will be financed
by a US$o.94 million equivalent grant from the Canadian International
Development Agency. The project's local currency cost will be financed
by NEPA from internally generated funds, and, if required, by the Govern-
ment (see paragraph 6.17).
4.07      If savings are realized on the foreign cost of the project the
excess loan funds would be used, after consultation with the Bank, to
finance additional works similar to those included in the proposed loan:
namely, electrification of more townships of the same type. Conversely,
if costs should exceed the estimated amounts including contingencies, the
electrification program would be phased over a longer period.
Procurement
4.08      All procurement of goods and services under the proposed loan
would be made through international competitive bidding in accordance
with the Bank's Guidelines for Procurement, except for consulting services
and for some control and communication equipment amounting to less than
US$0.5 million equivalent. This equipment, which would be used for
extending existing installations where direct compatibility is essential,
would be purchased from Cogelex, France, supplier of the existing equipment
and originally selected as a result of international competitive bidding.
4.09      ECN and NDA had always evaluated bids for imported goods on the
basis of CIF prices regardless of any customs duties and taxes that might
apply. During negotiations, NEPA's representatives confirmed their inten-
tion in this regard.
4.1o      Disbursements from the proposed loan would be made for the items
listed in Annex 4 to cover the following:
a.   CIF costs of imported equipment and materials;
b.   foreign exchange costs of civil, sub-transmission, and
distribution works;
c.   foreign exchange costs of services, erection, and consultants'
contracts; and
d.   foreign exchange cost of assistance to NEPA's staff.



- 13 -
4.11      Contracts for urgent transmission facilities and supply of equip-
ment amounting to about US$1 million, and proposed for Bank financing, have
been awarded since November 1971. It is suggested that the Bank reimburse
NEPA for the foreign currency expenditures made or incurred after January
1, 1972, for these contracts, and for consulting services related to the
proposed project. The amount of these retroactive expenditures would not
exceed US$1.0 million equivalent. Since February 1972, the Board has been
kept informed, through the Monthly Operational Summary, that retroactive
financing would be recommended.
4.12      Bids for the Kainji turbines and generators, estimated at about
US$12 million, have been received and analyzed. On June 14, 1972 the Bank
agreed with the proposed award of contracts. Other bids, amounting to about
US$4 million, for some transmission lines, power transformers, and switch-
gear have been invited, but not yet received.
Project EKecution
4.13      The project will be carried out under the general administration
of NEPA's Engineering and 'Jonstruction Division. As stated in paragraph
4.03 the Division will not have enough experienced engineers to adequately
control the execution of the project, nor could it easily recruit them
within Nigeria. These engineers, who should have proven knowledge of plan-
ning, engineering, design, and construction of transmission and distribution
systems, will be seconded to NEPA-by the large power utility or consulting
firm mentioned in paragraph 3.04(b).
4.14      The major components of the project will be designed and super-
vised by consulting firms. Four of these have already been appointed:
i)   Montreal Engineering Company Ltd. (Canada) for the first Kainji
Extension;
ii)   Merz and McLellan (UK) for four items of the proposed project:
330 kV Kainji - Lagos transmission line, distribution system
reinforcement in major towns, 132 kV Oshogbo-Akure transmission
line, and 132 kV Zaria-Funtua-Gusau transmission line and sub-
stations;
iii)   Motor-Columbus (Switzerland) for the extension of the distribu-
tion system in Lagos; and
iv)   Nedeco(NetherLands) to review the hydrology of Kainji and
up-date previous recommendations for reservoir operation.



- 14 -
4.15      During appraisal, ECN's officials were not clear about the number
of additional consulting firms to be hired for the execution of the rest
of the project. They originally thought of using a large number of
firms to benefit from a diversity of origins, methods, and prices;
however, because the project involves a great deal of sub-transmission
and distribution work where standardization, bulk purchasing, and coord-
ination are essential, such a policy would do more harm than good. It was
accordingly agreed during negotiations that the total number as well as
the qualifications of the consulting firms to be hired for the grid sys-
tem extensions included in the proposed project would be subject to Bank
approval.
4.16      All construction work will be executed by contractors, except
small distribution system extensions which will be carried out by NEPA's
personnel under the supervision of consulting firms.
Project Supervision
4.17      The magnitude of the proposed project and the difficulties
expected in its implementation are such that close Bank supervision
will be necessary. Supervision visits would be made at least three
times a year to review, inter alia: the improvement in NEPA's manage-
ment, the adequacy of the services provided by the management consult-
ants, the physical execution of the project, possible changes in the
scope of the electrification schemes, the accuracy of the cost estimates,
progress of the studies for further power development, and NEPA's plans
to dispose of the diesel power stations made redundant by the extension
of the national grid.

5. JUST IF iAT ION OF THE PROJECT
The Power Market
5.01      Before the civil war the national demand for electrical energy
grew at a very high rate: 19% a year on average from FY 1950 to FY 1967.
The civil war caused a decrease in sales in FY 1967, but by the end of
the war the growth resumed at an even higher level than before the outbreak.
The annual rate of growth was 26% in FY 1971 and 23.3% in FY 1972.
5.02      For the future, studies made by ECN and two consulting firms
predict that the annual rate of growth, while still remaining very high,
18% on average, will gradually decrease from the 23.3% of FY 1972 to 13.9%
in FY 1981. To substantiate the 18% average growth rate account was taken
in the studies of such factors ass the existing huge backlog of about 60 MW
of industrial load due to delay in system extension; the expected 13% rate
of growth of industrial production, which is likely to cause the power con-
sumption of the industrial sector to increase by about 20% a year; the impact
of the imposing electrification program; the rapid recovery of the load in
the war-damaged areas; and the export of power to the Niger Republic, start-
ing in FY 1976.
5.03      The anticipated industrial development, especially that of three-
shift factories, and the growing use of air conditioning will cause the
system load factor, which is already high, to further increase from 65% in
FY 1972 to 68% in FY 1981.
5.04      Better system expansion planning and improved metering and billing
methods are expected to reduce system losses from the high 20% in FY 1972 to
an acceptable 15.5% in FY 1981.
5.05      Annex 6 summarizes the forecast of sales for the ten fiscal years
ending March 31, 1981. It gives a breakdown of the sales by area, the ex-
port to Niger Republic, and the sales of the isolated undertakings. The
annex also shows the peak demand and the load factor of the interconnected
system, system losses, the energy to be generated by NEPA and that to be
purchased from NESCO, and sales growth rates.
First Kainji Extension
5.o6      The least cost method of meeting the fast growing power require-
ments is to proceed, as soon as possible, with the addition of two genera-
ting units of about 100 MW each at Kainji; with an estimated cost of
US$100/kW this scheme is cheaper than any possible alternative. The units
could be one of two possible types: fixed-blade propeller or Kaplan type.
Fixed-blade propeller units would have a lower initial cost, but Kaplan
units provide greater operating flexibility and efficiency. Although the
fixed-blade propeller alternative would have been a somewhat better solu-
tion, NDA requested tendera for Kaplan units in November 1971. A reversal
of the decision to install Kaplan unita at the time of the appraisal would
have resulted in a delay of four months and a corresponding loss which would
have been greater than the potential saving.



- 16 -
5.07      The new units will generate 1,350 GWh a year, of which 650 GWh
will be used by non-industrial consumers, 430 GWh will be used by the
industrial sector, and the rest, 270 GWh, will represent system losses.
The economic benefit of the first category of GWh can be regarded as at
least equal to the price that non-industrial consumers are willing to pay
for them. The economic benefit of the second category of GWh, which will
be consumed by the industrial sector, is at least equal to the cost of
generating these GWh by means of captive power plants.
5.o8      On this basis the economic return of the first Kainji extension
is at least 23%. This is the discount rate equalizing the streams of
costs and benefits attributable to the first Kainji extension, after
shadow-pricing costs to reflect economic scarcities (see Annex 7).
330 kV Kainji-Lagos Transmission Line
5.09      Previous studies by consultants (Preece, Cardew and Rider, June
1964) indicated that the existing 330 kV Kainji-Lagos transmission line
would be capable of conveying Kainji power to the load centers at an
acceptable reliability standard until the end of FY 1980. Beyond this
time the load would be such that a second line would be needed to ensure
an adequate electrical stability.
5.10      However, actual experience has shown that the existing trans-
mission line has a lower reliability than assumed by the consultants,
who did not anticipate a special type of fault due to the local practice
of burning the grass on the right-of-way. To reduce interruption in the
power supply, NDA decided to advance the commissioning of the second
line by three years, from late FY 1980 to late FY 1977.
5.11      Advancing the commissioning of the line by three years would
practically eliminate power interruptions and thereby increase the bene-
fits to consumers. The most important of these benefits accrues to the
industrial consumers because their production will not be disturbed by
power shortages. This benefit is at least equal to the labor costs owing
to the extra working hours to make up for the time lost. On this basis
the economic return of the 330 kV line is at least 12% (see Annex 8).
Grid System Extension Program
5.12      The proposed grid system extension program, which is to be
executed under ten separate schemes, will permit an increase in the
number of electricity consumers from two to three million. In addition,
the program will increase the number of people in potential reach of
electric service from five to seven million. The least-cost means of
electrifying the townships included in the program is to connect them
to the Kainji power network as projected. Ignoring external benefits,
the minimum economic return of this program is 22% (see Annex 9).

6. F  AN,  c
6.01      The past financial performance o' both EON and NDA ha a been
ext,rmely poor, in part due to the civil war AnAd inr part due to t,he
lack of  competent  tatff. The entities ha-m bean in default on 
loans unar their revenue covenants and the 5nver,ent has had to

Post. Ranord
6.02      Tp-tuo-date or accurate financial infornation is not arailable.
in the case of EGN, the last audited accounts were those to March 3.1,
1070. They wera forvarded to the Bank 17 monthls after the end o-. ECN's
fiscal year', with a very critical aniditor's report , which noted aong
other things .that the balance sheet does not properly reflect ths
Corporat4on's true financial position: it is probable that both assets
and liabilit±es are overstated. NDA was in r. better position,, blu the
auditors again reported inaccuracies in the sl±ocation of fixed asnnts
and the oearstating of inventories.
6.03      Annex 10 shows the balance sheets of EON for FY 1969-72 arnd
of NDA for F' 1970-72. While NDA's 1971 balance sheet has been auedited,
that for ECN camnot yet be considered final, the balance sheetus as at
March 31, 1972 have been estimated on informaticn supplied by the two
undertakings.
6.04      ECN in recent years was short of workeng capital (in the order
of several million pounds) which resulted in ECGr failing to pay its
creditors when payment was due, thus giving the Corporation a poor
credit rating both in Nigeria and overseas. The position improved some-
whiat over the last 12 months, but some suppliers have been waiting for
over two years for payment. It is difficult to know exactly how .much
ECN's current liabilities are; but, excluding the current portion of
long-term debt and amounts due to the Government, they are probably
about N6 million. Accounts receivable include about LN700,000 due
from Government and its agencies, and the total accounts receivable
represent about six months revenue.  Owing to difficulties in billing,
there has been a deterioration in recent months, and in January 1972
collections had dropped to about 82% of billings.
6.05      Annex 11 shows income statements for FY 196Q-72. These
reflect the stagnation of the electricity industry during the civil
war, but, with the cessation of hostilities, the revenues of ECN,
other than in the Eastern States, improved eubstantially. They also
reflect the fact tha'.,, contrary to original expectations, there has
been no conmmercial shipping on the upper Niger Pdiver,, no revenue
has ever been received from NDA's navigation activities, and it is



- 18 -
unlikely that any will be received in the foreseeable future. At the
time of the Kainji appraisal in 1963, NDA estimated its lock revenues
would be £N143,000 in 1970, rising to £N241,000 in 1978, although at
the time of the supplementary loan NDA reduced these estimates to an
annual gross revenue of £N30,000.
6.o6      Since EON was NDA's 8ole customer, and since ECN had not
been paying NDA for the full. cost of Kainji power, it would be inappro-
priate to consider each entity separately. Taking them as a combined
unit, their net operating income increased from £N2.5 million in 1970
to an estimated £N7.5 million in 1972. This net operating income in
1972 represents a return of about 6.7% on estimated average net fixed
assets in operation. Under the terms of the existing loan agreements,
ECN is recuired to earn 8% and NDA about 6.4% on their net fixed assets
in operation in 1972, which would give a composite rate of about 6.9%.
Based on assets at their current valuation, it is likely that ECN and
NDA will have come close to meeting their rate covenants for the first
time in FY 1972. Operating expenses are high, reflecting ECN's ineffic-
iency and surplus staff.  NDA's expenses also increased substantially in
1972 due principally to wage increases and additional staff, although it
is possible that too much is being charged to income instead of to capi-
tal. Denreciation on ECNts assets may seem high (the average rate is
about 6%); however taking into account the lack of adequate maintenance
(e.g. the Ijora plant), the depreciation charges are not excessive.

6.08      The Federal Nigerian Government will convert LN61 million of
its existing investment in ECN and NDA to equity. Other existing loans
will be taken over on existing terms, giving an overall debt/equity
ratio of 147/53.
6.09      Long-term debt as at March 31, 1972, can be summarized as follows:
Thousands of Nigerian Pounds

372-UNI to ECN                                     7,859

Promissory Notes to Suppliers and Others (ECN)                      2,975
59,423
The loans from foreign governments are from Italy, the Netherlands, United
Kingdom and United States. Interest rates average about 5t and the final
amortization payments fall due between 1988 and 1991. The loans from the
State Governments were made to ECN for the supply of electricity in unuer-
developed areas. The loans are interest free, and repayments, spread over
twenty equal annual installments, commence five years after drawdown.
Additionally, any operating losses in the areas to be supplied would be
reimbursed by the State Government.



- 20 -
6.10      Accurate information about ECN's accounts payable is not
available; it appears that some balances may have been partly or wholly
paid.  The March 1970 balance sheet for ECN shows an asset of "Unallocated
Payments to Creditors LN46,662" (1969-bN139,767) and further amounts are
included in Deferred Debits.
6.11      ECN's gross fixed assets are shown at LN57 million as at March
31, 1970. There is no accurate plant record and it is unlikely that the
assets are properly valued. The auditors report that some fixed assets
in NDA have been incorrectly allocated and valued (e.g. fixed assets
handed over by the joint consultants and Operational Training Team). In
order that NEPA may accurately record and value its assets, it was agreed
during negotiations that NEPA will engage consultants satisfactory to the
Bank to compile a plant record from physical inspection, value the cost
of replacing such plant and establish the amount of depreciation. This
will then form the base for the rate of return.
6.12      ECN's and NDA's inventories, including fuel stocks, are inaccur-
ate, as are ECN's accounts receivable and other current assets. The ex-
ternal auditors have been unable to verify or reconcile many accounts. In
order to see the true financial position of the borrower, it was agreed
during negotiations that, before the loan is made effective, NEPA will sub-
mit to the Bank the consolidated balance sheet of ECN and NDA as at March 31,
1972, audited by independent external auditors.
External Audit
6.13      Both ECN's and NDA's accounts have in the past been audited by
a Nigerian firm of chartered accountants, Akintola Williams and Co., who
are acceptable to the Bank. During negotiations, it was agreed that NEPA
will have its accounts audited annually by external auditors acceptable
to the Bank, who would be appointed within four months of the commencement
of NEPA's financial year, and that copies of the accounts and report there-
on would be forwarded to the Bank within four months of the end of NEPA's
financial year.
Financing Plan
6.14      A forecast of sources and applications of funds for FY 1973-78
is shown in Annex 13. The projections are based on the forecast income
statements presented in Annex 14 and on the capital expenditure program
for the same period (Annex 2, page 7). Due to unreliable past financial
data and the absence of sound planning and financial control, the margin
of error in these estimates is considerable.  Additionally, all of NEPA's
ambitious construction program may not be achieved. hEth these reserva-
tions, the financing for the six years to March 31, 1978, can be summarized
as follows:

- 22 -
6.15      Cash generation, net of debt service and dividends. would finance
53% of requirements for the six years. This high percentage reflects
the large expansion in sales following a period of stagnation as well as
the full use of Kainji power and the high tariffs.
6.16      CIDA is expected to finance US$22.4 million.  The terms of any
loan which CIDA may agree to make to NEPA have not been finalized; however,
it is assumed that the loan will carry interest at 2% per annum, and be for
50 years, including a grace period of 10 years. KFW is presently negotiat-
ing the terms of its loan to ECN; it is expected that the loan will be for
a period of 25 years, including a grace period of 7 years; interest being
at 3%.
6.17      The proposed Bank loan of US$76 million equivalent (LN25 million)
would be for a period of 25 years, with amortization commencing in December
1977 after a grace period of about 5½ years. NEPA should be able to provide
the balance of finance for the project and for its FY 1973-78 cash require-
ments without any Government contributions. Nevertheleas, during negotia-
tions, the Government agreed to provide NEPA, on terms and conditions
acceptable to the Bank, with any funds necessary to complete the project.
The proposed loan would be guaranteed by the Federal Government of Nigeria.
6.18      The conditions of effectiveness proposed for this loan, such as
the appointment of a Chief Executive Officer and the management team, are
unlikely to be fulfilled in less than six months; it has therefore been
assumed that the loan will not become effective until the first quarter of
calendar 1973. Quarterly disbursements from the proposed loan are shown
in Annex 5.
Finacial Forecasts
6.19      Estimated balance sheets are shown in Annex 12.  The forecasts
have been based on NEPA carrying out its proposed capital expansion program
in full.  Moreover, no account has been made for revaluation of assets.
Non-power fixed assets have been excluded, since the Government has indica-
ted that a new statutory body will be set up to take over non-power functions
of NDA, and that such functions will be separately financed.
6.20      Over the period of six years to March 31, 1978, it is estimated
that gross fixed assets in operation will increase by about 78% from
LN143.7 million to RN255.7 million. Work in progress is estimated at
pN37.3 million at the end of this period.  The dlbt/equity ratio is estimated
at 52/48 (Annex 15), which is acceptable. NEPA's working capital position
would be satisfactory, assuming that it cam overcome its collection problems
(paragraph 6.04), which it should be able to do with the proper controls and
policies expected of the new management team.



- 23 -
6.21      NEPA's estimated income accounts for the six years to March 31,
1978, are shown in Annex 14.  The assumptions which have been made when
preparing these estimates are explained in the Annex; for the reasons
noted earlier, the margin of error could be quite large. Revenues have
been reduced from 3.7 d to 2.7 d per kWh (27%), reflecting an increase in
the proportion of industrial sales and also anticipating tariff reductions.
However, if net operating revenues should not be as high as estimated
(due to lower sales, higher operating expenses, etc.), it should still
be possible to earn a reasonable return by making smaller reductions in
tariffs, or even none at all.
6.22      LN61 million of NEPA's equity will be in the form of stock held
by the Government (see paragraph 6.08). The dividend on this stock has
not been fixed and there is no maximum. Variable interest stock previously
issued by ECN carried a maximum interest rate of LJ4, which was non-cumula-
tive and only to be paid if revenue was available. In the income forecasts
it has been assumed that dividends would commence only in FY 1974 and would
be at the rate of 94. However, in view of there being no maximum rate
specified, it was agreed during negotiations that, to protect NEPA's financ-
ing plan, no dividend would be paid on the stock except as the Government
and the Bank shall otherwise agree.
6.23      In the absence of a proper valuation of net fixed assets it has
been difficult to define a rate covenant on the lines normally adopted for
power projects. It was therefore agreed during negotiations that after the
fixed assets have been revalued, NEPA should review its financial situation
with the Bank, and set its tariffs so as to earn future returns at a level
acceptable to NEPA and the Bank, which in any case would not be lower than
8% on n t fixed assets in operation. It was also agreed that no alterations
would be made in the tariffs so as to reduce the level of gross revenues
until the future level of earnings has been agreed.
6.24      The forecasts show that cash balances would start to build up in
FY 1978.  If, at this time, NEPA does in fact have surplus funds, it could:
i)   make further tariff reductions, still keeping within the rate
covenant; and/or
ii)   rely less on future borrowing than is shown in the forecasts.
6.25      NEPA's financial ratios are shown in Annex 15.  They show a
healthy financial future, which will however, depend very much on improved
management. In order to help conserve the sound position which it is hoped
to attain, it was agreed during negotiations that, unless the Bank other-
wise agrees, NEPA will not enter into any further commitments for long-
term debt unless its annual net revenue is more than 1.5 times the maximum
debt service requirement for any succeeding fiscal year.

7. AGRKEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
7.01      During loan negotiations, agreement was reached on the follow-
ing principal points:
a.  NEPA will consult with the Bank to determine the future of
isolated diesel power stations, when the area they serve is
connected to the National Grid (paragraph 2.07);
b.  NEPA will employ consultants acceptable to the Bank, both in
number and in qualification for the purpose of carrying out
the project (paragraph 4.155;
c.   NEPA will engage consultants to compile a plant register and
value such plant and establish the amount of depreciation
(paragraph 6.11). This will form the base on which NEPA will
earn a rate of return to be agreed with the Bank but which
a-hall not be less than 8% (paragraph 6.23). Until such rate
of return is agreed NEPA will not, except as the Bank may
otherwise agree, lower the level of its tariffs (paragraph
6.23);
d.   The Government will provide NEPA with any funds necessary to
complete the Project (paragraph 6.17);
e.   No dividend will be paid on equity, except as the Bank and the
Government shall otherwise agree (paragraph 6.22); and
f.  NEPA will not borrow without Bank approval unless it can meet
a 1.5 debt service coverage test (paragraph 6.25).
7.02      Principal conditions of effectiveness of the loan are:
a.   The appointment of three persons, acceptable to the Bank, to
the positions of General Manager, Assistant General Manager
(Planning) and Assistant Gsneral Manager (Finance) (para-
graph 3.045;
b.   The signing of an agreement, satisfactory to the Bank, with a
management consulting firm or a large public utility to provide
NEPA with a team of experts to assist and train NEPA's Nigerian
staff (paragraph 3.04); and
c.   The furnishing of ECN and NDA's consolidated audited balance
sheets as of March 31, 1972 (paragraph 6.12).
7.03      The proposed project constitutes a suitable basis for a Bank loan
of US$76 million, for a term of 25 years, including a 5½ year grace period.

FOURTH POWER PROJECT
NATIONAL ELECTRIC POWER AUTHORITY
KAINJI DEVELOPMENT
Description
1.        The Kainji development, located on the Niger River some 270 miles
north of Lagos is a multipurpose project constructed by NDA with the Bank's
financial assistance (Loans 383-UNI of US$82 million in 196i4, and 572-UNI
of US$14.5 million in 1968). The benefits originally expected from the
development were in the fields of power, flood control, navigation, fisheries,
and agriculture. However, as of now only the power and flood control benefits
have materialized substantially.
2.        The development wihich was completed in February 1969 camprises the
following major items:
(i) The Dam: The dam is in three sections: a concrete gravity
section 1,800 feet long including the intake and spillway;
an earthfill section 8,ooo feet long on the right side of
the river; and a second earthfill section 4,000 feet long
on the left side.
(ii) The Power House: The power house is in two sections separated
by the service bay and administrative block. The first section
of the power house, completed under the previous loans, is
designed to contain six generating units numbered 7 through 12.
The second section, of which only the substructure has been
completed under the previous loans, will house six other units
numbered 1 through 6.
(iii)  Installed Ca acity:  The project was designed for an ultimate
capacity of 960 W  consisting of twelve 80 NW generating units.
Only four units of Kaplan type were installed during the first
stage.
(iv)  Navigation W,;orks:  These consist of a two-stage navigation lock
and canal system built during the first stage of the development.
(v)  Nem Bussa Township:  To relocate some 40,000 persons displaced
by the creation of the reservoir, a township, New Bussa, had
to be built.



ANNEX 1

Hydrolo2y
3.        The reservoir has a gross storage capacity of about 15 billion
cubic meters, and a useable storage of about 12 billion.  These figures
compare with the average annual run-off at Kainji of about 62 billion.
f~.       The tiiing of the river flow is very regular.  The hydrological
year starts in September with the White Flood, which lasts until the end
of October; the flow is then about 4,000 cubic meters per second on average.
After the White Flood the river flow decreases to about 1,500 cubic meters
per second during the months of November and December. From January to
March is the Black Flood period with a flow between 1,700 and 2,000 cubic
meters per second. During the rest of the hydrological year, April through
August, the flow is at its lowest level, decreasing to less than 500 cubic
meters per second.
Reservoir Operation
50        No attempt has been made to determine, in the light of actual
experience, the best reservoir operation. The reservoir is now operated
within the following constraints:
(i)  Downstream flow should be less than 4,000/5,000 cubic meters per
second to avoid flood damage, and more than 1,200/1,400 cubic
meters per second to meet navigation requirements. It can be
seen that the figures are very approximate.
(ii) In June, July and August of each year the reservoir should be
drawn down to make room for the White Flood.
Power Generation
6.        The preceding constraints have not affected Kainji generation
very much up to now. The installed capacity and the energy available have
been higher than the system load would require; and Kainji generation has
been determined much more by the system requirements than by the hydrolog-
ical conditions. However, the generation of the future units will be
affected by the hydrological conditions. This question is discussed in
Annex 7.

FOURTH POWER PROJECT
NATIONAL ELECTRIC POWER AUTHORITY
THE SIX-YEAR INIESTMENT PROGRAM
The following is a description of all the projects included in
the six-year (FY1973-78) investment program of NEPA. The table on page 7
of this annex gives the cost estimates of the projects including contingencies.
A.  MAJOR GENERATING PLANT
This part of the program consists of two items:
1.    First Kainji Extension.  The project, proposed for Bank financing,
comprises the installation of two additional generating units
at Kainji. The units of Kaplan type are rated 100 MW each with
a unit output of 100 MW during the high-water-level period and
80 MW during low-water-level period (see paragraph 2 of Annex 7).
The first unit is scheduled to be commissioned in October 1975,
and the second one in April 1976. The total cost of this project
is estimated at LN6.93 million (US$21.07 million) of which
MN5.53 million (US$16.81 million) is in foreign currency.
The engineering and design cost, 40.31 million (US$0.94 million),
is being financed by CIDA, and Montreal Engineering Company has
been assigned to this task. The Bank has been requested to
finance the rest of the off-shore cost of IN5.22 million (US$15.87
million).
2.    Future Pro4ects.  These projects consist of the second Kainji
Extension (two additional units), three thermal units of 100 MW
each, and a generating plant of 200 MW which could be either a
thermal plant or the first stage of Jebba hydro power development.
The total cost of these projects is estimated at LN37 million
(US$112.5 million) of which LN31.6 million (US$96.1 million) is
in foreign currency. The projects will be committed in two or
three stages between FY1975 and FY1978 and their financing will
be sought when necessary.
B.  330 kV TRANSMISSION SYSTEM
This part of the program consists of four items:
1.    Work in Progress.  This work comprises mainly the completion of
Benin and Onitsha substations, construction of which has been
considerably delayed by the civil war. But since the end of
the war NDA has resumed the construction work which is now
expected to be finished by the end of FY1974. The total cost
of the remaining work is estimated at i1.53 million (uS$4.65
million) and will be financed by NEPA.



ANNEX 2
Page 2 of 7 pages
2.    Reinforcement of Existing Substations.  To meet the expected demand
of the power system and improve its reliability it will be necessary
to install additional transformers, capacitors, reactors, and related
switchgear in the existing 330 kV substations. The works include
the addition of: one 90 MVA 330/132 kV transformer and switchgear
at Kaduna substation; one 90 MVA 330/132 kV transformer, one 30 MVAR
reactor, and switchgear at Onitsha substation; one 90 MVA 330/132 kV
transformer at Oshogbo; and one 90 MVA, two 20 MVAR capacitors, and
switchgear at Akangba substation (Lagos). The total cost of this
project, which is expected to be completed by the end of FY1977 is
estimated at LN1.26 million (US$3.83 million) of which MNO.94 million
(US$2.86 million) is the foreign currency component proposed for
Bank financing.
3.    Kainji - Lagos 330 kV Transmission Line.  This line will greatly
improve the reliability of the power supply to the major sub-
stations, especially, that of Lagos. The project which would be
completed late in FY1977 includes about 300 miles of 330 kV line
and the extension of the substations at Kainji, Jebba, Oshogbo and
Lagos. The project cost is estimated at 58.48 million (US$25.78
million) of which &N5.64 million (US$17.15 million) is the foreign
currency component proposed for Bank financing.
4.    Future Projects.  These projects, which will be committed in FY1975
and thereafter, involve the extension of the 330 kV transmission
system to connect future thermal generating plants to the Kainji grid.
C. GRID SYSTEM EXTENSION, WORK IN PROGRESS
This item concerns the completion of various on-going extensions
and reinforcement of the existing high and low voltage systems. The total
cost of these projects is WN3.5 million (US$10.64 million) of which KFW is
financing LN1.3 million (US.$3.95 million).
D. GRID SYSTEM EXTENSION STAGE 1A
Under this heading are grouped the ten grid system extension
schemes proposed for Bank financing. These schemes comprise the reinforce-
ment of the distribution system in h3 towns, and the electrification of 41
townships through the extensions of the Kainji grid. The total cost is
LN21.95 million (US$66.73 million) of which Ln11.24 million (UT`%34.17
million) is the foreign currency component proposed for Bank financing.
The schemes, which will be implemented in FY1973 through FY1978, are listed
by geographical area as follows:
1.    Lagos Scheme.  This project comprises the reinforcement of the
sub-transmission and distribution system in Lagos where more
than 50% of Nigeria's power is consumed; its total cost is
LN5.09 million (US$15.47 million) of which LN2.54 million
(US$7.72 million) is in foreign currency.
2.    Major 'Town Scheme.  The project covers the reinforcement of the
power supply systems in 9 major Nigerian towns: Benin, Enugu,
Ifo, Ilaro, Kaduna, Otta, Port Harcourt, Sokoto and Warri. The
project cost is estimated at IN2.L8 million (US$6.93 million) of
which LN1.17 million (US&3.56 million) is in foreign currency.



ANNEX 2
Page 3 of 7 pages
3. Aba-Calabar Scheme. The project comprises a 132 kV line from
Aba to Calabar, which is the capital of the South-Eastern State,
and distribution system reinforcement in both cities. The project
cost is INl.33 million (US$h.o4 million) of which 16NO.72 million
(US$2.19 million) is in foreign currency.
A      *4.  Onitsha Scheme.  The project comprises distribution reinforcement
in Onitsha and Agbor and transmission and distribution facilities
for 10 townships:  Umunede, Uburu, Issele-Uku, Ogwashi-Uku.,
Ibussa, Ihiala, Uli, Oguta, Obaku, and Awomama. The project cost

E. GRID SYSTEM EXTENSION, STAGE 1B
Under this heading have been grouped the grid system extension
projects which are likely to be financed by the Canadian International
Development Agency (CIDA); they consist of:
1.  Supply to Sokoto and Niamey (Niger).  A 132 kV transmission line
will be built from Kainji to the border near Bernin-Kebbi, with
a spur to Sokoto. The Niger Republic will build a 132 kV trans-
mission line from Niamey to the border under a separate project.
The works in the Nigerian territory are scheduled for completion
in FY1976; their cost is estimated at WN3.25 million (US$9.88
million) of which bN2.22 million (US$6.75 million) is in foreign
currency to be financed by CIDA.
2. Kaduna - Jos - Maiduguri Scheme. This project comprises a 132 kV
transmission system to supply Jos, Bauchi, Gombe and .Kaiduguri
with Kainji power.  The project, which will be completed in FY1978,
will cost bN6.15 million (US$18.70 million) of which INh.02 million
(US$12.22 million) will be in foreign currency to be provided by
CIDA.
F. GRID SY_STEM EXTENSION, STAGE 1C
In a report entitled Nigeria Rural Electrification Study,
T. Ingledow and Associates Ltd. (Canada) recommended the electrification
of about 140 townships in 8 years. The Government endorsed this program
and decided to implement it in five or six years instead of eight. During
the appraisal mission it was decided that the program be split, according
to the proposed sources of financing, into three parts called Stage 1A,
1B and 1C. Stages 1A and 1B, which have been discussed above, cover the
most urgent projects proposed by Ingledow. Stage 1C, which will be financed
by NEPA and the Government if necessary, covers the rest of the projects
included in the consultants' recommendations. It comprises the electrifica-
tion of about 100 townships in the relatively short period of six years,
which is not realistic. The total cost of Stage 1C is estimated at RTl6.75
million (US$50.92 million) of which LN8.88 million (US-P26.99 million) is in
foreign currency.
G.  GRID SYSTEM EXTENSION, STAGE 2
This heading covers a future electrification program to be started
in FY1976. The cost of the program is very approximately estimated at
WN28 million (US$85 million) of which LNl.8 million (US$46 million) will be
in foreign currency.

H. REHABILITATION PROGRAM
This program comprises the rehabilitation of the war-damaged power
system in Easterm Nigeria, and the repair of Ijora power station. The total
cost of the program is LN5.20 million (US$15.81 million) of which N2.14
Aiillion (us$6.51 million) representing part of the foreign currency cost of
the rehabilitation of the EDstern power system, is being financed by KFW.
I. MISCELLANEOUS PROJECTS
These projects comprise the construction of various training
centers, warehouses, office buildings and houses. Their total cost is
estimated at :N8.0 million (US$24.32 million) of which RN3.0 miillion
(US$9.12 million) is in foreign currency.
J. ENGINEERING STUDIES
Three items are included in this group:
1.    Gongola River.  This is a feasibility study for an irrigation
project which would include a generating capacity of about 80 Md. Following
the Government instructions, NDA has selected Nedeco (Netherlands) for the
feasibility study. The cost of the study is estimated at bN2.0 million
(US$6.1 million) of which LN1.3 million (US$3.95 million) is in foreign
currency likely to be financed by the Netherlands.
2.    Power Development Studies.  These studies wfill involve a review
of the hydrology of Kainji, determination of the best generating plant
addition, identification and feasibility of a further township electrifica-
tion program, and preliminary design of the next generating plant. The
total cost of the studies is estimated at LNI.5 million (US$4.56 million)
of which JNl.0 million (US$3.04 million) is in foreign currency proposed
for Bank financing.
3.  Future Studies.  In F`f1975 studies similar to the preceding ones
will have to be initiated. Their total cost is estimated at iNl.0 million
(US$3.04 million) of which 6NO.6 million (U111.82 million) will be in
foreign currency.
K. MANAGEMENT STUDIES
This group consists of two items:
1.    Canadian Program.  For about two years CIDA has been assisting the
Government in reviewing the management of the power sector.  A consulting
firm, Shawmont, financed by CIDA has prepared two reports making recommenda-
tions to merge ECN and NDA, and to improve their management. Shawmont
estimated that NEPA would require the services of several expatriates whose
foreign cost, estimated at nN1.25 million (US$3.80 million) would be partially
covered by a INl million (US-53.0> million) grant from CIDA.

2. Other Program. This program is designed to supplement the Canadian
Program. It would include technical assistance to implement the proposed
investment program, and studies such as the evaluation of assets. The total
cost of the program is estimated at LN1.34 million (US$4.o7 million) of
which LN.96 million (US$2.92 million) is in foreign currency proposed for
Bank financing.

NIGERIA
FOURTH POWER PROJECT
NATIONAL ELECTRIC POWER AUTHORITY
JUSTIFICATION OF THE FIRST KAINJI EXTENSION
Kainji Energy and Capacity Resources
1.          The hydrological year (September 1 - August 31) should be divided
into two periods: high water level period, September 1 - June 30, and low
water level period, July and August (see Annex 1).  During these periods
energy resources and hydraulic heads are estimated as follows:
a.   High water level period:  the average hydraulic head is 120 feet,
and the energy available is 3,100 GWh for a critical year (proba-
bility 5%) and 3,210 GWh for the mean year (probability of about
70%).
b.   Low water level period:  the average hydraulic head is 97 feet,
and the energy available is 560 GWh for a critical year, and
580 GWh for the mean year.
2.          Whereas the total energy output is little affected by the type
of the turbines, power capability depends very much on both the type and
the rating of the units.  The existing units are of Kaplan type rated 80 MW
but can be overloaded up to 9QMW; those planned for the first extension
are also of Kaplan type but rated 100 MW; and those planned for the second
extension would be of fixed-blade propeller type rated 120 Ms. Accordingly,
for the period under study, which does not go beyond the second extension,
Kainji capacity resources would be as follows:
a.   Existing Units
Number and Type:                         4 Kaplan units
Nameplate Capacity:                      4 x 80 mN
Maximum Canacity:
high water level period:           4 x 90 MS
low water level period:            4 x 80 MW
b.   First Extension
Number and Type:                         2 Kaplan units
Nameplate Capacity:                      2 x 100 MW
Maximum Capacity:
high water level period:           2 x 100 SiW
low water level period:            2 x  90 'W
C.   Second Extension
Number and Type:                         2 Fixed-blade propeller units
Nameplate Capacity:                      2 x 120 MW
Maximum Capacity:
high water level period:           2 x 120 Mel
low water level period:            2 x  90 MW






ANNEX 7
Page 2 of 7 pages
Thermal Capacity Resources
3.          The installed thermal capacity which now amounts to 300 MW is
expected to increase by at least 300 MW to be located in the south of
Nigeria and commissioned in three stages: 100 MW in January 1979, 100 MW
in July 1979 and 100 MW in January 1980. In January 1981, another 200 MW
of thermal capacity would have to be commissioned should the Jebba hydro
power development be postponed until after 1981.
Mechanical Reliability of the Generating Equipment
4.          In view of the poor maintenance of the generating plant, and in
the absence of an accurate assessment of the capacity of the existing
units, it is reasonable to assume that the reserve capacity should be
at least 20% of the capacity resources, or the capacity of the largest
unit, whichever is the highest.
System Planning
5.          On 'he basis of the foregoing data and approximate load duration
curves, a program of installation of generating units has been established
for the decade FY1972-81. The program, without being necessarily optimal
because of the lack of infor-mation (see paragraph 9) meets the requirements
of the system.
6.          The table of page 5 of this annex shows that the capacity
resources will be adequate during both high and low water level periods.
Beginning in Hydrological Year 1976 reserve capacity during both periods
(lines All4 and B1O) is around 20% of the installed capacity and always
larger than the capacity of the largest unit of the system. Lines k15
and Bll show that without the Kainji first extension, reserve capacity
would be either too low, or negative, from Hydrological Year 1976 onward.
7.          The table of page 6 of this annex shows that energy resources,
for both high and low water level periods, are sufficient to meet the
requirements of the system should a critical dry year occur during the
FY1972-81 decade.
8.          Finally the table of page 7 shows how peak demand and energy
requirements will most likely be met. rhe figures given refer to fiscal
years and assume mean hydrology. The chart following page 7 shows
graphically the installed capacity and peak demand.
Least-Cost Solution
9.          There is no guarantee that the proposed generation exoansion
program is the best.  To determine the least-cost development program it
would have been necessary to consider several alternatives, which, to be
comparable, should provide the same degree of reliability while adequately
rmeeting the system requirements.  But without conducting suzh studies NEPA
decide,d to -o ahead with the installation of two Kaplan units at Kainji.






ANNEX 7
Page 3 of 7 pages
While it is certain that the alternative adopted is cheaper in total present
cost than any thermal alternative, it was not, in 1971, the cheapest hydro
alternative. The least-cost solution would have been the installation of
two fixed-blade propeller units instead of Kaplan units. For a slightly
cheaper cost, fixed-blade propeller units have higher capacity than Kaplan
units, but they are a little less efficient and flexible in operation. It
was for their efficiency and flexibility that NDA preferred the Kaplan units,
thus giving away a financial advantage estimated at US$2 million in present
value. However, in view of the fact that much work has already been done
on the Kaplan solution, a reversal of NDA's position would cost much more
than US$2 million. Such a reversal would entail a delay of at least four
months in the completion of the project, during which more than 300 GWh
would have to be generated by the existing thermal stations at an incre-
mental cost of about US$4 million.
Economic Benefits of the First Kainji Extension
10.       The first Kainji extension will generate 1,350 GWh a year, of
which 650 GWh will be used by non-industrial consumers, 430 GWh will be
used by the industrial sector, and the rest, 270 GWh will represent system
losses.
11.       The economic benefits of the first category of GWh can be regarded
as at least equal to the price consumers are now paying for energy (IN0.012
per kWh or LN7.8 million a year).  As for the GWh consumed by the industrial
sector they will permit an increase in the industrial value added of about
LN132 million according to the recent Bank's Economic Report on Nigeria.
If the project is not implemented, either this value added would be forgone,
or it would have to be produced by means of captive generation. The first
assumption is unrealistic and should be ruled out because the cost of captive
generation, although high, is not so high as to discourage industrial develop-
ment. But the second assumption could form a reasonable basis for evaluating
the economic benefits of the project. The cost of generating these 430 GWh
by captive power plants would amount to at least LN6.9 million (LN0.016 per
kWh).
12.       While generation costs are fairly well known, transmission and
distribution costs have to be estimated. ECN's income statement for FY 1970
shows an incremental transmission and distribution cost, including deprecia-
tion of LNO.0o6 per kWh sold. To be or. the safe side a cost of LNO.008 per
kWh sold was used.
130       To evaluate the economic rate of return of the project, shadow
prices reflecting economic scarcities were used instead of actual costs.
Costs were broken down into five basic components: (i) taxes and subsidies,
(ii) land cost, (iii) imported goods and services, (iv) local qualified
manpower, and (v) local labor. The first item was eliminated from all
costs but not from revenues; the second is negligible; the third was ex-
pressed in Nigerian pounds at the prevailing rate of exchange because
Nigeria is not expected to experience balance of payments problems for the
next decade (see the Bank's Economic Report on Nigeria); the fourth being
the real bottleneck in the Nigerian economic development was shadow-priced






ANEX 7
Page 4 of 7 pages
at 400% of actual costs (this is the average ratio between the salaries of
foreign and local management personnel); and the fifth was valued at actual
costs, because, although there is some unemployment in Nigeria, the power
sector, which requires a relatively qualified manpower, will draw most of
the labor force needed for the first Kainji extension from other sectors
of the economy, and not from the presently unemployed population.
14.       On the basis of the above, capital costs were decreased by about
5%; operating costs were increased by about 40%; and revenues and savings
on captive power generation were valued at actual costs.
15.       Finally the streams of economic costs and benefits attributable
to the project are as follows, in LN (million):
COSTS                        EENEFITS
Revenue fron      Savings on

1972      0.4
1973      0.9
1974      2.0
1975      1.8
1976      1.5
1977-2006           0.4          12.1                7.8             6.9
16.       The equalizing rate of the streams of costs and benefits, which is
the economic return of the project, is about 23%.

FOURTH POWER PROJEGT
NATIONAL ELECTRIC POWER AUTHORITY
JUSTIFICATION OF THE SECOND
330 kV KAINJI-LAGOS TRANSMISSION LINE
The Existing 330 kV Line
1.        With the growth of the demand for power the electrical stability
of the existing single circuit 330 kV Kainji-Lagos transmission line, and
consequently its reliability, will gradually decrease. Previous studies
(Preece, Cardew and Rider, June 1964) recommended that a second 330 kV line
be built when the load reaches the level now expected to be reached in early
FY 1981. According to the same studies, if the line is not built by that
time, it would become impossible to convey Kainji power to the load centers
at an acceptable reliability standard.
2.        However, actual experience has shown that the existing transmission
line has a lower reliability standard than assumed by the consultants, who
did not anticipate a special indigenous type of fault due to bush fires. It
is current practice in Nigeria to burn the grass on the right-of-way. The
resulting heat ionizes the air around the conductors thus causing flash over
and line tripping. High speed restoration of supply is impossible because
it takes about five minutes for the air to de-ionize. Because of this
phenomenon there is an average of 17 temporary faults per year causing
interruptions to some or all of the load. In addition there is always the
risk of permanent faults (broken conductor or insulator, tower failure)
that could cause much longer interruptions, probably a few days each time.
Economic Benefits
3.        To improve the continuity of the power supply NDA has decided to
advance by about three years the construction of the second 330 kV Kainji-
Lagos line. Although a study has not been made to determine the optimum
timing, nor the staging of the construction, the best route, or an accurate
cost estimate, advancing the construction of the line is likely to yield a
high economic return (see paragraph 9 of this annex).
4.        Advancing the commissioning of the line from late FY 1980 to late
FY 1977 will increase the standard of reliability of the power supply to the
major load centers during FY 1978 through FY 1980. For practical purposes it
can be assumed that with the second line, there will be no interruptions of
the power supply during these three years. Elimination of power interruption
will increase the benefits derived by the consumers from electric power.
These benefits are threefold.

a. benefits derived by non-industrial consumers, which can be
valued at the price these consumers are willing to pay for
electric power; these benefits being very small, can be neglected;
b. decrease in power losses whic13 being small, could be neglected;
c.  benefits derived by industrial consumers which can be assumed to
be at least equal to the shadow-priced salaries to pay workers
to mnake up at other times the production lost during power inter-
ruption.
5.        The cost of improved reliability will be the annual charges of
advancing the investment by three years plus operating costs duringthe same
period.
6.        Using available statistics and assuming that, with a single-line,
in addition to the temporary faults there will be a permanent five-day fault
every 10 years for each 100 miles of line, it has been found statistically
that the length of power interruptions during working hours is very likely
to be as follows, if the second line is not built:
Outage Time in Hours
Section of the 330 kV System           FY 1978    FY 1979    FY 1980
Kainji-Jebba                           2.48        2.57        2.66

Jebba-Kaduna                               negligible
7.        Assuming that 4o% of the Nigerian industry is located in the Lagos
area, 20% in the North, 20% in the East, and 20% in areas not connected to the
330 kV system, and using the data provided by the Bank's Economic Report on
Nigeria, the value added of the industrial production corresponding to the above
power interruptions can be determined. It has been found to be as follows:
FY 1978    FY 1979    FY 1980
LN (Million)                            2.7        3.2         3.8
8.        Assuming that 25% of the above value added represents the cost of
labor and 5% represents the cost of management personnel, and evaluating
these costs at the shadow prices given in paragraph 1h of Annex 7, the
economic benefits of the project would be:
FY 1978    F?Y 1979    FY 1980
LN (Million)                            1.2        1.)4        1.7
9.        Finally the equalizing discount rate of the following streams of
economic costs and benefits, is 12%. This figure can be regarded as a reasonable
approximation of the internal economic return of the second 330 kV Kainji-Lagos
transmission line.

FOURTH POWER PROJECT
NATIONAL ELECTRIC POWER AUTHORITY
JUSTIFICATION OF THE GRID SYSTEM
EXTENSION PROGRAM
Population Served
1.        Once the proposed grid system extension program is completed
the number of people supplied with electricity will increase by about
50%, from two to three million. In addition the number of people in
potential reach of electric service will increase by about 40%, from
five to seven million.
Least-Cost Solution
2.        It is reasonably certain that the least-cost means of electrify-
ing the townships included in the program is to connect them to the Kainji
power grid. No detailed analysis has been made to determine whether, at
the opportunity cost of capital, it would be cheaper, in present worth, to
connect the townships to the Kainji system rather than to generate power
locally by small captive diesel generating units. There are, however,
strong reasons in judgment to believe that connection to the network is
the most economic solution; incremental cost of Kainji power is very low,
and due to high transportation costs, poor maintenance, and small unit size,
captive diesel power generation is very expensive.
Economnic Return
3.        The economic returns of the ten schemes composing the program have
been calculated after shadow pricing costs on the basis given in paragraph 14
of Annex 7. The calculated returns are at least as follows:
a.   between 20% and 30% for four schemes:  Lagos, Kano, Major
Towns, and Other Distribution;
b.   between 10%; and 20% for taree scihemes:  Jebba-Bacita-Pategi,
Ibadan, and Zaria-Funtua-Gusau;
c.   between 8% and 10% for two schemes:  Onitsha and Oshogbo-
Ilorin-Akure; and
d.   6.4% for a relatively minor schneme:  Aba-Cal3bar.
The overall economic return of the whiole program is at least 22%.






ANNEX 9
Page 2 of 2 pages
4.        These economic returns would have been higher had all the
external benefits of the projects been taken into account. Unfortunately,
these are impossible to express quantitatively with any confidence; they
consist of:
a. The projects will make possible some industrial development
giving rise to employment and value added benefits. Many
industries are likely to be set-up in the townships to be
electrified: sugar refineries, breweries and other food
processing plants, pulpnills, wood plants, textile mills, etc.
b.   The connection of the townships to the Kainji grid will result
in savings on existing and alternative future captive power
generation. It is estimated that about 20% of the load to be
served by the proposed projects would, in the absence of these
projects, be supplied with power by very expensive captive
diesel units.
c.   The program may help contribute to a slowdown in the migration
of rural population to urban centers.

ANNEX 14

NOTES ON FINANCIAL FORECASTS
Revenues
1.        See paragraphs 5.01 to 5.06 for the basis on which the sales of
electricity in millions of krsJh is made.
2.        The average selling price of 3.70 d per kWh used in 1973 is based
on the existing tariffs. It has been reduced from 3.75 d per klvh in 1972
in order to allow for an expected change in the incidence of sales from
domestic to industrial. After 1973 the average selling price is reduced
on the assumption that industrial sales will continue to increase their
share of total sales, and also that NEPA will be able to reduce its present
tariffs and still be able to earn the agreed rate of return on its net fixed
assets in operation.
3.        Other operating revenue is increased annually by a nominal amount.
Operating Expenses
4.        Fuel and energy purchased has been based on a plan of generation
prepared by members of the mission, based on information supplied to them
by NDA and ECN. The cost of purchased power has been based on existing
tariffs, and fuel cost has been based on a price of L7.9.7 per long ton
for Bunker C at Ijora; Llv.3.9 per long ton for diesel at Kaduna; L5 per
long ton of coal of Oji River and 15 d per 1000 cu ft of natural gas at
Afam and Ughelli.  A contingency allowance of 10C  has then been added to
the total cost.
5.        Other operating expenses have been estimated as follows:
a.   Transmission:  Existing expenses have been projected with a
cumulative annual cost increase of 7%.  Additions h-ave been
included at an operating cost of 2'0 of capital cost, to which
has been added a cumula;ive annual increase of 7 v6.
b.   Distribution expenses are based on a cost of L5.00 per consumer
for 1972 which cost has been incraased cumulatively at 7%' per
annum. The number of consumers is based on the estimated increases
in the individual areas already on supply, rivin- a total average
increase of about 8.3% per annum, and on the capital expansion
program for new areas.
c.   Generation expenses:  1572 estimated expenses have been increased
cumulatively at the rate of 7,% per annlzi.  An allo-wance of 5S% of
capital cost has been made in 1976 for the two neii units at
Kainji, and the additional expenses increased thereafter at 7%
per annum.






ANNEX 14
Page 3 of 3 pages
6.        Since it has not been feasible to obtain insurance coverage for
machinery breakdown, a charge of one half of one percent of gross fixed
assets in operation has been made to allow for extraordinary repairs which
may follow poor maintenance. It may be thought more appropriate to fund
this amount outside NEPA; however, this is not recommended as it is considered
that the funds would better be employed in NEPA, and it is also unlikely that
NEPA would be willing to accept such a suggestion, and there are more important
matters of contention to press with NEPA.
7.        The components of the administrative and general expenses have
been projected at various annual increases based on 1971 estimates, as
follows:
a.   Headquarters               -             7
b.   Kainji                      -           10
c.   Area District Offices      -            12%
d.   Training                   -            15e
e.   Consumer services, meter reading and bad dabts have been based
on a consumer charge of 13.13 in 1971, which rate has then been
increased at 3% per annum.
8.        Depreciation is based on the rates presently used by ECN and NDA.
Rehabilitation costs for assets in the East have been written off over a
period of three years.  Tnis follows ECN's practice for its "Betterment
Account", where "on occasions, alterations are made to assets whichl do
not appreciably alter their overall value.  'vAqilst such alterations cannot
be regarded as maintenance, again they are not precisely of a capital nature.
The costs are, however, accounted for through the normal capital procedure
for the purpose of exercising financial control.  The use of this procedure
should never be interpreted as an indication that an improvement of enhanced
intrinsic value has been effected. The imnrovement is one regarded as adding
to general convenience, temporary or otherwise.  In order, howaver, that
assets values are not unduly inflated thereby, the costs of such alterations
are debited to Betterments Account and are as a matter of prudence depreciated
over 3 years."
9.        It is assumed that N4EPA's capital allowances for income tax will
exceed its assessable profit and no income tax will be payable dl_riniyl tne
period.
10.       Dividend has been nrovided for at g-2i. correncLng in FY 1974.
