         Grant for Tajikistan is the first programmatic operation of\n            the Bank in Tajikistan to support the government's\n            reform program outlined in the PRSP. The operation will\n            support a strategic set of policy reforms in private sector\n            development, public sector management and social service\n            delivery. The operation will also provide continuity of the\n            reform initiated by the Bank's previous adjustment\n            operations (SAC 1 and 2). Policy measures supported by this\n            operation have a strong cross cutting emphasis on improving\n            governance. The program is divided into two pillars with the\n            following components: Pillar 1, Promoting Private Sector\n            Development, is comprised of: Component 1, maintaining\n            macroeconomic stability; Component 2, improve investment\n            climate through reform of licensing and inspections,\n            increasing transparency of the privatization process and\n            promoting market competition; and Component 3, reforming\n            regulatory frameworks through separating policy making and\n            regulation function in key strategic sectors (i.e. aviation,\n            cotton and energy). Pillar 2, Improving Public Sector\n            Management and Public Service Delivery, is comprised of\n            Component 1, public sector management reform through\n            restructuring core public institutions, reforming civil\n            service management and the wage system, strengthening the\n            medium-term expenditure framework; and Component 2,\n            improving social service delivery in health and education."}, "docdt": "2006-05-15T00:00:00Z"}
