Negative measures include: water pollution, dust, air\n            pollution, noise pollution, waste management, soil erosion,\n            and pest management. Mitigation measures include: a) minimum\n            tillage technique should be adopted in the catchment area as\n            against deep ploughing. The use of animal drawn ploughs\n            noticed during the time of visit is a step in the right\n            direction; b) use of insect hormones, hormone analogue or\n            other chemicals that can mimic the action of insect hormones\n            to alter hormone-regulated processes like moulting,\n            metamorphosis, reproduction etc; c) biological control of\n            pests is the use of pest parasites and predators to wipe out\n            unwanted species or populations of pests; d) where\n            water-borne sanitation becomes inevitable because of rapid\n            urbanization as is expected here, the framework for the\n            treatment of sewage should be laid down; and e) water\n            pollution control legislation should be reviewed and\n            institutional arrangements for enforcement should be established."}, "docdt": "1994-04-29T00:00:00Z"}
