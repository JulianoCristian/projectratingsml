These projects represent a clear\n            evolution in the scope of World Bank lending: the first\n            project was nationwide and concentrated on procurement and\n            installation of equipment in selected water systems in each\n            of the 36 Nigerian states and the National Federal\n            Territory; the second project was restricted to two states\n            (Kaduna and Katsina); and the third project directly\n            assisted 16 small towns. This assessment rated the outcome\n            of the National Water Rehabilitation Project as highly\n            unsatisfactory, sustainability highly unlikely, negligible\n            institutional development Impact, and unsatisfactory\n            performances by both the Bank and Borrower.  For the First\n            Multi-State Water Supply Project, the assessment concurred\n            with the completion report, except that the PPAR rated the\n            outcome as moderately satisfactory. The PPAR rated the\n            outcome of the Small Towns Water Supply and Sanitation\n            Project as satisfactory with likely sustainability,\n            substantial institutional development impact and\n            satisfactory performances by both the Bank and Borrower.\n            There are three principal lessons: First, the targets under\n            the MDGs for water supply and sanitation, focusing only on\n            service coverage and access, need to be expanded to include\n            the reliability and quality of water supplies.  Second,\n            effective coordination between central, state and local\n            governments requires demand-driven approaches where the\n            consumers have the initiative. Third, maintenance merits\n            priority over new works."}, "docdt": "2006-06-13T00:00:00Z"}
