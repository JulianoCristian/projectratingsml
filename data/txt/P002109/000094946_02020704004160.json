development impacts. The following lessons\n            reflect in part, an increased awareness on the need for\n            major institutional reforms. The commercialization of public\n            institutions was hindered namely by the Government's\n            unwillingness to give autonomy, without which sustainable,\n            commercial institutional arrangements do not succeed. This\n            was further exacerbated by the disparity of water demand\n            estimates as related to the prices charged: it shows water\n            being sold very cheaply, highly subsidized, with a large\n            over-capacity. Regrettably, the Bank failed to pursue this\n            issue further. Dependence on external factors should be\n            carefully assessed, for while the project did provide\n            standby generators, electricity Boards were unable to pay\n            for the additional, operational fuel costs, which indicates\n            particular attention should be given to supporting sectors\n            of the economy when same are not thriving. Moreover,\n            institutional development by and large, must be viewed as a\n            continuum, based on a programmed approach, where\n            institutional changes demand more radical interventions from\n            both the utility in question, and the state government.\n            Finally, resettlement issues require a pragmatic assessment\n            by the Bank, rather than the purist approach of\n            environmental assessment, and, regardless of supervision\n            budgets constraints, technical staff can help review, and\n            resolve lagging implementation activities."}, "docdt": "2001-05-03T00:00:00Z"}
