Nigeria aims to support economic growth by\n            enhancing health and productivity of urban areas, helping to\n            alleviate poverty by improving health standards of the\n            lowest income urban households and the living conditions of\n            women. Negative measures include: water pollution, dust, air\n            pollution, noise pollution, waste management, soil erosion,\n            and pest management. Mitigation measures include: a) minimum\n            tillage technique should be adopted in the catchment area as\n            against deep ploughing. The use of animal drawn ploughs\n            noticed during the time of visit is a step in the right\n            direction; b) use of insect hormones, hormone analogue or\n            other chemicals that can mimic the action of insect hormones\n            to alter hormone-regulated processes like moulting,\n            metamorphosis, reproduction etc; c) biological control of\n            pests is the use of pest parasites and predators to wipe out\n            unwanted species or populations of pests; d) where\n            water-borne sanitation becomes inevitable because of rapid\n            urbanization as is expected here, the framework for the\n            treatment of sewage should be laid down; and e) water\n            pollution control legislation should be reviewed and\n            institutional arrangements for enforcement should be established."}, "docdt": "1991-06-01T00:00:00Z"}
