                                 SUMMARY
           preliminary analyses of the design for the proposed water
     supply reservoir at Gwaigwaye near Funtua in Katsina State of
     Nigeria, indicated that there would be 5 negative impacts of the
     reservoir on the health of people in surrounding areas, and at
     least 3 positive impacts. It should be possible to reduce the
     effect of the negative impacts so that the overall health impact
     of the reservoir would be positive.
           The negative health impacts would be introduction of a new
     focus of River Blindness due to blackfly breeding on the dam
     spillway, extension of the normal malaria transmission season by
     an additional two months, and additional bilharzia transmission of
     both the urinary and the intestinal kind. There would be a slight
     risk of introducing Rift Valley Fever. Filariasis transmission
     might increase in villages supplied with domestic water.
          The most important positive health impact from the proposed
     Gwaigwaye Reservoir would be the reduction in diarrheal disease in
     the populations served with safe water from the reservoir. The
     number of deaths among children would be reduced from about 42
     deaths per year to about 4 deaths per year.
           Other diseases which would be reduced in importance are
     Yellow Fever and Guinea worm. Field studies are needed to
     evaluate health risks from contamination of the drinking water
     with biocides and industrial chemicals.
           In addition to recommending field studies to be conducted in
     OCtober, recommendations were made for sustainable and feasible
     methods to reduce the negative health impacts of the proposed
     reservoir, depending primarily on manipulations of the reservoir
     water level. Fluctuations of the water level at critical times of
     the year will interrupt breeding of the insect and snail vectors
     of disease. A detailed study of the operational feasibility of
     these proposed water level manipulations should be conducted, and
     the necessary structures and design features should be included in
     the final design of the dam.
          The spillway should be designed to avoid blackfly breeding,
     with water velocities above 2.5 meters per second, or by
     interrupting the flow about every 5 days, for a short period of a
     few hours.
          Malaria mosquito populations in the reservoir should be
     reduced by making the eastern shoreline straighter and steeper.
     Also the water level should be fluctuated during the months of
     November and December to kill larvae of the malaria mosquitos.
          Bilharzia transmission should be minimized by delivering safe
     water to the populations within 2 kilometers of the reservoir
     shore and the river downstream of the dam. Bilharzia transmission
     should also be reduced by snail control in the reservoir and
     river, using weekly fluctuation of the water level to strand the
     eggs of the bilharzia snails, and to flush snails out of the river
     bed.
          pit latrines and adequate drainage of waste water should be
~I   provided in the same communities where water supply is delivered
     from the new system, in order to minimize filariasis transmission.

I.   INTRODUCTION
     This is Volume Two of a series of reports on a health
opportunities assessment for the proposed Gwaigwaye Reservoir in
the northern state of Katsina in Nigeria. The reservoir is
proposed by the Katsina State Water Board, to serve rural
populations in southern Katsina.
     As part of the design procedure, this health assessment was
conducted to determine the existence of serious health risks
around the reservoir, and to develop sustainable and feasible
methods to reduce those health risks.
     Delivery of Volumes One and Two in this assessment completed
Phase I of the health assessment. They were developed entirely
from design proposals and published literature on ecology and
public health. They report preliminary analyses prior to field
investigations which will be conducted during Phase II. Final
analyses will be conducted after the field investigations are
completed, and hopefully before the final design of the dams and
related structures are completed.
     Volume One was a summary of the literature survey, and
published in March 1994, and is referred to as (BRA, Vol I).
                                                                          6


     II.   HUMAN POPULATIONS IN EACH HEALTH IMPACT ZONE

          The basic first step in assessment of health risks was
     estimation of the nunIDer of people within various zones of
     potential health hazards. For completeness these estimations were
     made several generations into the future, for often the long-term
     sustainability of the proposed project has a major influence in
     future health risks. Short projections of only 15 or 20 years
     into the future can lead to major errors in balancing construction
     costs with costs of maintaining the health of the affected
     populations.
          For the preferable long-term projections we used computer
     simulations to organize the analysis. Despite their apparent
     precision however, it should be recognized that they are extremely
"I   sensitive to assumptions, and that they do not predict unexpected
     changes in political, economic or environmental conditions.
          Computer models simulating human populations were developed
     on simple spreadsheets used in business and accounting_ Both for
     population projections and in projecting the impact of the
     proposed water supplies on disease and death, simple models were
     developed for the project areas. These models divided the
     populations by age groups, then applied age specific birth and
     death rates, as well as migration rates. Migration into the
     project area is assumed to occur at an equal rate in all age
     groups, simulating family migration.
          The basic computation step in the model for each subset of
     people (ethnic or geographical group, and age) is based on the
     following summation, applied repetitively for each subset for each
     year, starting with 1990:
     begin with previous population for this group and previous age-set
          deaths from this subset
     +    immigrants
     =======================================================
           new population
          A typical population projection shows the number of children
     in one cohort as the cohort ages over five years (Table 1). The
     models used in this health assessment however were constructed
     with five-year time intervals, not one-year intervals. The
     example portrayed here was based on one-year time intervals solely
     for clarity_
                                                                    7


Table 1. Illustrative population projections of a
portion of a stable population from 1990 to 1994.
This projection was conducted using a simple spreadsheet based on
a one-year time interval. Migration was omitted for clarity.
Also for simplicity, annual survival was assumed to 0.8 for
children aged 0-2 years and 0.9 for children older than 2 years.
Bold numbers follow cohort of children born in 1990, as part of
arbitrary initial population.

          A human population model based on these simple concepts was
     made for conditions in the area of Katsina and Kaduna states,
     using demographic data from Malumfashi (Tomkins et al, 1991)
     and from the World Bank (World Bank 1992). The fertility rate
     was adjusted upward to 9 births per woman, and the death rates
     were adjusted slightly to give a long term population increase
     similar to the 2.9% per year reported for Nigeria (Table 2).

     model of typical human population of one million people,
     for conditions in northern Nigeria, 1990 to 2090.
     This population would have a doubling period of 25 years with the
••   low rate of 1% per year in-migration. With no migration the
     doubling period would be almost 30 years, but with 10% in­
     migration the doubling period would be only 15 years.

     rise in a model population of one million people in 1990 to five
     million by 2050 and ten million by 2075, assuming no migration
     (Figure 1).

     With the assumption of a 1% migration rate into the area due
to the attractiveness of improved water-supply, slightly higher
populations were calculated. From one million in 1990, the second
prediction was five million people by 2045 and twenty million by
2070 (Figure 2). It is possible that migration rates could
seriously exceed 1% per year, causing much larger population
increases. If the in-migration rate were 10% per year, the
projected population by 2045 was almost eleven million, more than
twice the number predicted with a 1% per year migration rate
(Table   3).

      projections for each of the 9 sub-populations at risk for the
proposed projects were made for the years 1990, 1995, 2020, and
2090, assuming an in-migration rate of 1% per year crable 4 and
Figure 2). These were based on the meager information from the
first Environmental Impact Assessment (EHPLAH, 1991). According
to this report the rural population density in 1990 was 42,000
people in the catchment area of 120 square kilometers, or 350
persons per square kilometer. Of this group, 12,000 people were
semi-nomadic Fulani herders.
      In addition it was arbitrarily assumed, in the absence of
census figures, that the population in the rest of the area was at
the same density of 350 persons per square kilometer, outside of
the town of Funtua.
      It was also arbitrarily assumed that the population of Funtua
was 50,000 people, and that the number of people involved in
building the dam will be 1,000, present in the site for one year,
about 1995. For the various zones of health impact, the 1990
population was estimated from the area of the zone, the average
population density and the population of Funtua, if the town fell
within the impact zone under consideration.
      The initial populations for 1990, and the predicted
population for the labor force involved in dam construction, were
very approximate and need to be refined with more recent data for
the final report.
      From a population of 42,000 in the catchment area in 1990,
the long term population rose to about 100,000 by 2020, and was
projected to rise eventually to 728,000 by 2090, after five
generations crable 4, group 4). This projection was made with
the assumption of a constant in-migration rate of about 1% per
year. Without migration the population in 2090 was estimated at
612,000 in the catchment area of 120 square kilometers.
     The largest population group at risk is the million people
within the 30 kilometer radius of the dam who will be at risk of
infection with the parasites causing River Blindness due to the
bite of the blackflies which might breed on the dam spillway.
This is designated as Group 1 and includes the population of
Funtua(Tab1e 4). By the year 2020 this group may exceed 2
million people, and by 2090 it could exceed 18 million.
     Although a large number of people will be at risk from this
disease, the expected death rates would be low, and the rate of
transmission and thus prevalence of blindness would also be low.
     The population Group 2 is located within 5 kilometers of the
reservoir shores and is thus at risk of malaria transmission from
anopheline mosquitos breeding in the reservoir. Malaria will
probably be the most important negative health impact of this
proposed reservoir. Group 2 includes the residents of Funtua and
could reach 180,000 by the year 2020. Other groups at risk
include those within 2 kilometers of the reservoir shores, those
downstream of the dam in the reach hydrologically, the Fulani
pastoralists, and smaller groups displaced by the dam or active in
the construction of the dam (Table 4).
     The other population groups and their risk of disease will be
discussed individually in following chapters.

III.   GEOMETRY OF PROPOSED RESERVOIR
     Topography of the proposed reservoir was taken from a small
map of 1:50,000 scale, and from a more recent survey of several
cross-sections by Parkman Engineers. It was assumed that the dam
site furthest downstream would be used for the Gwaigwaye
Reservoir, at site 2-2 (Parkaan, January 1994). At site 2-2
the length of the earthen dam will be 650 meters. The maximum
height of the dam will be 11.5 meters and the maximum depth of
water at the Full Service Level (FSL) of 109.0 meters, will be 9.0
meters. The FSL of 109 meters would include a maximum crest
height of the dam of 111.5 meters which is 0.5 meters lower than
the lowest point of the nearby Biri Village on the western shore.
The maximum storage capacity will be 5.5 million cubic meters at
FSL of 109 meters (ParkaaD, January 1994).
     The reservoir will be long and narrow with its long axis in a
North-South direction, roughly perpendicular to the proposed dam
which will have an East-west orientation. The eastern shore of
the reservoir at FSL will contain many indentations related to
about a dozen small tributaries entering on that side. In
comparison the western shore will be relatively straight with only
four tributaries (Figure 3).
     The geometry analyzed in this chapter was derived from a
small map with a scale of 1:50,000. More accurate topographic
data have since been collected by the planners in January 1994.
When their data are transformed into topographical maps, this
geometric analysis should be revised. The revision is especially
important for planning the recommended control measures.
     The river channel should also be accurately mapped for at
least 6 kilometers downstream of the dam, to assist in planning
snail control measures in the affected portions of the river.

     The gradient of the Gwaigwaye River is relatively flat as it
enters the southern end of the reservoir 7 kilometers upstream of
the dam, with a slope in the river channel of 1 meter fall in 2.5
kilometers (Figure 3). Thus the shore slope in this upper sector
is quite flat also, approximately 1 meter fall in 400 meters, for
the southern or upstream two-thirds of the reservoir, sectors B
and C (Figure 4 and Table 5). This flat slope is between
contour lines 109 and 107 meters.
     In contrast the channel slope at the dam site is
significantly steeper, with a fall of 1 meter in 600. The eastern
shore slope near the dam has a fall of 1 meter in 87 and the
western shore is slightly steeper with a fall of 1 meter in 76
(Table 5). This steeper slope is at the deepest portion of the
proposed reservoir, where the river channel is between 100 and 102
meters.

              Slope Calculations for Proposed Reservoir near Funtua 

                                                                          18



           From the original small map of 1:50,000 scale, contour lines
     were estimated in a very approximate fashion, to derive the
     relation of reservoir surface area and perimeter with elevation.
     From this approximate method it was estimated that the reservoir
     would have a surface area of 700 hectares at elevation 109 meters,
     and a shoreline about 25 kilometers long. At 108 meter elevation
     the surface area would be 300 hectares and the shoreline would be
     15 kilometers long.
          Estimating the volume of the reservoir from this same small
     map gave larger numbers than those calculated from the detailed
     cross-sections taken by Parkman in 1994. Our estimates indicated
     a total volume of 10 million cubic meters at elevation 109 meters,
     and 5.5 million cubic meters volume at 108 meter elevation·
     (Figure 5). When a revised contour map is made of the proposed
~.   reservoir site, these figures should be reconciled with Parkman's
     estimate of 5.5 million cubic meters at 109 meter elevation.
          The estimated surface area of the reservoir will be 700
     hectares when the water level is at the FSL of 109 meters
     elevation, and the length of the shoreline perimeter will be 25
     kilometers (Figure 6). At the lower water level of 107 meters
     the surface area will be sharply reduced to 115 hectares and the
     perimeter will be only 6 kilometers.
          Potential of a reservoir for mosquito breeding can be
     estimated by calculating the Vector Habitat Potential and the
     Marsh Potential (BRA, volume 1, p52). Calculations indicated
     that the proposed reservoir has very high potential as a mosquito
     habitat when the reservoir level is between 108 and 109 meters, or
     higher ( Figure 7 ) •
          By inspection of the contour map it can be seen that the
     greatest potential for mosquito breeding which requires flat
     shores, due strictly to geometry of the reservoir, is on the
     eastern shore of Sector B and towards the southern (upstream) end
     of the reservoir, the entire Sector C (Pigure 4).

     IV.   MEAN ANNUAL FLOWS AND RESERVOIR WATER LEVELS

           Based on the normal rainfall patterns and thus the expected
     stream flow into the reservoir, and assuming a constant withdrawal
     for domestic water supplies, it was estimated that the reservoir
     would be full and overflowing from July to October (Figure 8).
     The level would decrease from November to May when it will reach
     its lowest point. Thereafter it would fill gradually until
     overflow again in July, at a rate depending on rainfall.
          The seasonal changes in the reservoir volume will cause
     corresponding seasonal changes in the parameters related to insect
     and snail breeding. The highest Vector Habitat potential (VBP)
     for malaria mosquitos will occur during the months when the
     reservoir is full, from July to November (Figure 8).
~"        The amount of potential habitat for bilharzia snails is
     indicated by the volume of Illuminated Shore Zone. This parameter
     - the ISZ - is influenced by the depth of light penetration, as
     measured by the depth at which one can see a Secchi Disk as it is
     lowered into the water. Based on the estimated annual phosphate
     loading of 0.3 kilograms per hectare (BRA, Vol 1, p58) coming
     into the reservoir, it was estimated that the mean Secchi Disk
     reading would be 1.6 meters, with a maximum of about 2 meters from
     October to February and a low value of about 1 from July to
     September when the rains bring in suspended matter in runoff
     (Figure 8). Thus the Illuminated Shore Zone is also expected to
     vary seasonally, with the highest values in October and November
     and the lowest values from December to June.
          An important concept in understanding the ecology of a lake
     is the mixing depth, the depth of the well mixed surface layer in
     which concentrations of oxygen, nutrients, and other substances
     are maintained fairly uniform and favorable for aquatic life.
     Mixing is caused by normal wind friction on the lake surface, and
     temperature changes due to changes in solar radiation daily and
     seasonally. Two separate methods were used to estimate this
     mixing depth for Gwaigwaye Reservoir. Based on maximum wind
     fetch, the depth was estimated between 10 and 20 meters, for wind
     fetches between 2 and 7 kilometers (Pigure 9). The other
     estimate was based on lake area, indicating a mixing depth of
     about 12 meters for surface area between 3 and 7 square kilometers
     (Figure 10). Both of these estimates indicated that the lake

V.   RIVER BLINDNESS
     The largest population at risk from a health hazard created
by the proposed reservoir is the 2 million people within the 30
kilometer flight range of the blackflies (Figure 11 and Table
4). These flies will breed on the dam spillway if the velocities
are appropriate. The spillway will be overflowing from July to
OCtober, about 100 days, giving adequate time for large numbers of
flies to develop and transmit the parasite which causes River
Blindness.
     Optimum velocities for breeding of the blackflies occurs at 1
to 2 meter per second velocities, and water temperatures between
17 and 33 degrees C (BRA, Vol 1, P 46).
     From generalized data on tropical reservoirs it is estimated
that the surface water temperatures in Gwaigwaye Reservoir between
July and OCtober will be between 24 and 25 degrees C, highly
favorable for blackfly breeding (BHA, Vol 1, P 57).
     Recommendation: It is thus very important that the
spillway be designed to avoid velocities in the favorable range
for blackfly breeding. For extra safety, the velocities should be
less than 0.5 meters per second or more than 2.5 meters per
second. If these velocities cannot be ensured, then flow
interruptions of a few hours every 5 days during the breeding
season would also prevent successful development of the blackfly
larvae.
      Prevention of blackfly breeding at the dam is an important
health requirement for two reasons. The first is that the
population of Funtua is at high risk from the blackflies due to
the short distance to the spillway of about 20 kilometers,
compared to the normal flight range for the blackflies of 30
kilometers. The second reason is that this dam spillway will be
the only breeding site in Katsina State - thus introducing
transmission of a new disease - and breeding could last for over
100 days each year, causing serious transmission, and eventually
some blindness in this area.
      For the propoSed interruptions in spillway flow to prevent
breeding of the blackflies, special control features need to be
included in the spillway deSign, and the interruptions must be
coordinated with other vector control measures. The flow
interruptions will produce some fluctuations in water level in the
reservoir, and flushing of the river downstream of the dam. These
fluctuations will have important effects on breeding of malaria
mosquitos and bilharzia snails in the reservoir and the river.

VI.   MALARIA

     Because of prolonged mosquito breeding along the shores of
the proposed reservoir, nearby human populations will have malaria
for at least an additional two months of year. Fortunately this
zone of malaria risk will not cover the town of Funtua.
     Maximum breeding potential will occur from July to December.
winds are from SW April to October, then NE November to April.
Thus the western shore will be protected from July to October and
breeding will be relatively limited as this is a straight, steep
shore (Figure 3). This is the normal period of malaria
transmission in Katsina, thus the additional transmission caused
by the reservoir will hardly be noticed.
     However from November to December the eastern shore will be
protected as wind direction is from the HE during these months.
This shore has many indentations and flat sites which will be
favorable for mosquito breeding (Figure 12). Thus additional
malaria transmission will occur during November and December when
it otherwise would decline to a low level.
      RecolIIID.endations:  There are two possible remedies which
can be applied in this case. One is to straighten and make the
eastern shoreline more steep in order to reduce potential mosquito
breeding habitats.   The second remedy is to fluctuate the
reservoir level during this period in order to flush the mosquito
larvae out into the lake or strand them on the shoreline.
     Both of these recommendations require more detailed
topographical investigations of the eastern shore of the reservoir
between elevations 101 and 110 meters. These data should be used
in an investigation of the earthwork costs involved, as well as in
evaluation of the operational feasibility of fluctuating the water
level during the mosquito breeding season.
     OVer fifty years of experience with both of the proposed
remedies has resulted in successful mosquito control in the sub­
tropical Tennessee River valley in the USA. The amplitude of the
fluctuations used in Tennessee is 30 centimeters, with a period of
one week. Also a flood surcharge is used at the beginning of the
rainy season to strand floating material and reduce vegetation in
the reservoirs.
     Provisions should be made in the dam design to allow water
manipulation to produce these kinds of fluctuations. After
careful study of their operational feasibility for the proposed
Gwaigwaye Reservoir, the fluctuations should be tested when excess
water is available, especially during the early years of reservoir
operation, and during the rainy season when river flows are high.
     For control of local malaria mosquitos it is likely that
shorter periods of fluctuation will be more effective. Thus
periods of 3 to 5 days should be tested initially. with
experience, these manipulations can be extended into the months of
November and December, especially in wet years.
     The fluctuation patterns should be coordinated with those
recommended for blackfly and snail control.

VII.        BILHARZIA
     The risk of bilharzia transmission was evaluated around the
proposed reservoir, and also downstream in the reaches of the
Gwaigwaye and Sokoto Rivers where ecological changes due to the
dam may increase snail populations. These two zones of risk
involve 10,000 people and 50,000 people respectively, according to
population predictions for the year 2020 (Table ').
       A.    Around the proposed Reservoir
     The population at risk from bilharzia around the reservoir is
Group 3, projected to reach 10,000 people by the year 2020 (Table
'). These people would include residents of the small communities
nearby, and also wandering Fulani herders.
     Seasonal ecological conditions in the proposed reservoir were
projected from previous summaries of the geographical factors and
observed conditions in similar or nearby reservoirs. The
principal parameters estimated for the proposed reservoir were the
habitat volume, the water temperature and the amount of food for
the snails   These are portrayed for Scenario G4, the most likely
conditions predicted to occur during an average year in the
proposed Gwaigwaye Reservoir (Pigure 13 ) •
     Habitat volume was calculated as the volume of Illuminated
Shore Zone, estimated to range from 3 million cubic meters in
October and November when the reservoir was full and the water was
quite clear, to a minimum of 0.25 million cubic meters in February
when the reservoir level was receding and intense algae growth
reduced light penetration (Pigure 13).
     Water temperature was predicted to fluctuate only slightly,
between a maximum of 30 degrees C in June, and a minimum of 22
degrees C in January (BIIA Vol 1 p57). The high temperatures in
May and June would curtail egg laying as they approached 30
degrees C, the upper limit. However the rest of the year .would be
highly favorable for egg laying.
     The most difficult parameter to predict was the amount of
food for the snails. They use both microscopic algae and some
species of submerged or floating vegetation. The basis of the
prediction was the estimated phosphorus concentration in the
reservoir, based on the expected phosphorus contributions in
surface runoff coming from the catchment area. This was estimated
as a mean annual concentration of 0.06 milligrams per Liter of
total phosphorus in the reservoir, based on a normalized
phosphorus loading of 75 milligrams per square meter per year.
This normalized loading rate was calculated from the
characteristics of the catchment area which was mixed farming with
a medium animal density, and with medium loam texture of the
surface soil (BRA Vol 1 p58; and Ryding and Rast., 1989 p97).

      with an estimated concentration of phosphorus in the lake of
0.06 milligrams per liter, one would expect a mass of algae 115
times that amount, according to the ratio of phosphorus to total
algal mass (St.WII1Il and Morgan, 1970). As an approximation, the
amount of food was assumed to vary between 10 and 100 milligrams
per liter in the reservoir, assuming some food would be
contributed by emergent vegetation. The higher amount of food was
assumed to occur from February to September, based on observations
in nearby local reservoirs (pigure 13).
      Computer simulations of bilharzia snails in the proposed
reservoir indicated that the reservoir would be favorable for both
kinds of bilharzia snails, Bulinus and Biomphalaria, and thus
transmission of both urinary and intestinal bilharzia could be
expected around the reservoir, affecting as many as 10,000 people
by the year 2020 (pigures 14 and 15). Because Bulinus globosus
was able to survive in this reservoir, it was assumed that Bulinus
senegalensis, another transmitter of urinary bilharzia, would also
survive.
      These simulations of snail populations in the proposed
reservoir were conducted for Scenario G2 with 100 milligrams per
liter of food, and Scenario G4 and 10 milligrams per liter. If
the amount of food were reduced by one more order of magnitude to
1 milligram per liter, the computer simulations indicated that the
reservoirs could not support the snail populations because their
reproduction rate would be too low to offset the normal death
rates. The amount of snail food in the reservoir was difficult to
predict precisely. Thus field measurements on similar reservoirs
should be made to improve the precision of the food data.
      It will be very difficult to eliminate these snails from the
reservoir with conventional control methods. Chemical control is
not recommended because of the large sustained expense which would
be required.
      Prevention of human contamination and contact with the
reservoir is a possible way of preventing disease transmission,
even though the snails are present. This is most simply
accomplished by providing sufficient safe water to everyone in the
2 kilometer zone around the reservoir, an estimated 10,000 people
by the year 2020. Biri village near the western end of the dam is
perhaps the closest settlement to the reservoir, and should thus
be provided not only with adequate domestic water supply, but also
with pit latrines or septic systems to avoid contamination of the
reservoir.
     Snail control through periodic fluctuation of the water level
in the reservoir during the snail breeding season is also a
possibility, if it is feasible from the design and operational
viewpoint. In addition to killing the snail eggs and temporarily
stranding adult snails, the fluctuations can be scheduled to
strand floating vegetation, thus reducing the food supply for the
snails.

            Previous field studies showed that fluctuations with
       amplitudes between 20 and 50 centimeters and periods between 3 and
       10 days can be used to control Biomphalaria, the snail vector of
       the intestinal and more severe form of bilharzia (Jobin, 1970).
       It is likely that this rate of fluctuation will also control
       Bulinus snail populations which transmit the urinary form of
       bilharzia. However it is important to avoid fluctuation periods
       as short as 1 or 2 days because this will stimulate egg production
       by the snails.

       small rivers, and because seepage from the dam and also backwash
       flow from the filtration plant at Mairua will provide a steady
       base flow in the river during the dry season, it is predicted that
       bilharzia snail populations will increase in the reaches of the
       river downstream of the dam. This will include the rest of the
       Gwaigwaye River to its confluence with the Sokoto River coming
       from the Mairua Reservoir, and also probably down to the next
       confluence with the River Kadabo near Nasarawa, a total distance
       of about 6 kilometers from the proposed dam (Figure 16).
             It is estimated that this will affect about 50,000 people by
       the year 2020, within the 5 kilometer zone of malaria mosquito
       range. However malaria mosquitos are not likely to be found in
       the river environment, thus only the 2 kilometer zone for
       bilharzia transmission need be considered. In this zone there
       would be about 20,000 people by the year 2020.
            Again, snail control would be difficult with chemicals, but
       could be disrupted near villages by channelling of the dry-season
       streambed, and also be constructing small flushing siphons to
       periodically flush the channel and then leave it dry. This
       technique is effective against bilharzia snails, and also'against
       malaria mosquitos in certain instances.
            An alternative preventive measure is to supply the population
       at risk with adequate safe water so they will not go to the river.
            Reco. .endationl The design engineers should establish
       whether it is possible and financially feasible to fluctuate the
       water level in Gwaigwaye reservoir periodically during the
       breeding season of the snails, which is July through February. If
       this is at all feasible, computer simulations can be run for the
       possible range of fluctuations. In Puerto Rico fluctuation
       schedules of 50 cm height and one week periods were successful in
       controlling Biomphalaria snail populations. Such fluctuations
       would also control the malaria mosquitos and interrupt breeding of
       blackflies on the spillway. However more precise field data on
       snails and mosquitos, as well as topography is needed before the
       simulations can be conducted with sufficient precision.
            If Gwaigwaye reservoir is operated with periodic water level
       fluctuations for snail control, it would also reduce snail
                                                                     36

populations downstream. If this is a feasible solution, detailed
analyses of the downstream impact of periodic flushing and drying
should be conducted, based on more precise measurement of the
river reaches downstream of the proposed dam.
     Measurements on Mairua Reservoir and other nearby reservoirs
should be made during the rainy season to refine the environmental
data used in the prediction of snail populations. OCtober would
be the ideal time to make these measurements, when snail and
mosquito populations should be at their maxima.

VIII.     RIFT VALLEY FEVER
      The most likely time for an outbreak of Rift Valley Fever
would be during the first rainy season after the dam is completed.
At this time a large outbreak of the floodplain mosquitos of the
species Aedes macintoshi might occur because the unusually high
water level created as the dam filled would force hatching of the
eggs accumulated at high water marks over the previous decade, if
this species of mosquito is found in the area.
      If sheep or goats carrying the virus of Rift Valley Fever are
present in the area at the time of this mosquito hatching, the
mosquito could transmit the virus from the sheep to people, and
thus people could become infected with this highly fatal virus,
within the 5-kilometer mosquito zone around the reservoir.
     The eggs of the mosquito vector of Rift Valley Fever are laid
in the soil at the high water line during high water levels in the
flood plain each year. When water levels reach unusually high
elevations, especially after several years with low floods, all of
the accumulated eggs hatch at the same time. This would most
likely occur during the first filling of the proposed reservoir.
      It is not certain that there would be epidemics of Rift
Valley Fever around the proposed Gwaigwaye Reservoir. The disease
has never been reported from Nigeria. Furthermore it has not
occurred around the many reservoirs constructed in northern
Nigeria in the last decade. Also this reservoir is quite small
and is unlikely to affect more than a few people who might
congregate or live around the reservoir during the rainy season.
     If the disease did not have such a high fatality rate, it
would not be important enough to consider. However it has turned
up unexpectedly in the Senegal River Basin in the last decade, and
has occurred twice near Aswan Dam along the Nile in the last 15
years, including an epidemic in November 1993. Thus the
consequences of an epidemic in a new site should be monitored.
Three different methods could be used for monitoring the risk of a
potential epidemic, and there are a number of possible
interventions which could be used to prevent transmission of the
disease, if a risk were discovered.
     A.   Monitoring the risk of transmission
      There are at least three ways to monitor this problem. One
is to monitor viral antibodies in the local sheep populations, and
if the virus is circulating in the area at the time the dam is
finished, to take extreme measures during the rainy season to
prevent transmission. This is an expensive process unless a
virology laboratory is already functioning in the area.
      Another way to monitor the potential for transmission is to
sample the soil at appropriate locations and determine if viable
Aedes eggs are present, and at what locations within the area to
be flooded by the reservoir. This process is simple and
inexpensive.
      A third way to monitor the potential for transmission is to
search for Aedes larvae along the shores of the reservoir during
                                                                     39

the period after the reservoir starts filling.   This is also a
simple process.
     B.   preventing transmission
     In the event that these surveys indicate a potential for
transmission, preventive measures could be implemented. These
preventive measures could include:
     1. Move all sheep, goats and cattle out of the 5 kilometer
zone during the rainy season (July through December).
     2. Eliminate the mosquito eggs by special treatment of the
area to be flooded when the reservoir fills. This could include
plowing the soil, mowing or burning of vegetation in the area, or
spraying with larvicides.
     3. Control the mosquitos hatching in the lake by larviciding
or space spraying.
     4. Vaccinate the human population at risk, about 90,000
people in the 5 kilometer zone in 1995.

     Recommendation: Although the likelihood of Rift Valley
Fever occurring around Gwaigwaye Reservoir is small, it is
recommended that monitoring be conducted of the floodplain soil
for Aedes mosquito eggs in the soil prior to filling of the
reservoir, and it is also recommended that the shoreline of the
reservoir be monitored for hatching larvae during the rainy
seasons of the first three years after the reservoir is
constructed. If viable eggs are found in the soil, the vegetation
should be burned and then the soil ploughed in the infested areas,
before the reservoir fills. If larvae of the mosquito vector are
nonetheless found in the reservoir as it fills, animal herds
should be moved out of the 5 kilometer flight range of the
mosquitos until the mosquitos die off, probably from the time the
reservoir fills until December when cold weather kills off the
mosquitos.
     If there are no mosquitos and no epidemic the first three
years after the reservoir fills, and weather conditions are
normal, then there is little likelihood that the disease will
occur in subsequent years.
     If substantial numbers of viable eggs are found, or if
breeding of the mosquito vector did take place however, then a
virological study should be conducted among the local herds, and
constant vigilance maintained, with appropriate preventive
measures undertaken when there is threat of an epidemic. The
highly fatal course of this disease gives it high local
importance, although the small size of the reservoir reduces its
importance as a regional health problem.
                                                                      40

IX.   OTHER HEALTH RISKS
     There are a number of other health risks around the
reservoir, including diarrheal diseases caused by contamination of
the reservoir with feces of infected persons, as well as
contamination of the reservoir with various salts and chemicals
coming from the large population within the catchment area
(Pigure 17    and Table 4).

      A.   Diarrheal diseases
      Because Nigeria has lately been subject to cholera epidemics,
and because diarrheal diseases are generally high, the water from
the reservoir could contain pathogens and should be treated by
standard sand filtration before it is used for human consumption.
      Conversely, the supply of sufficient quantities of water to
the population served by the new system will reduce diarrheal
disease in proportion to the amount of water made available per
person. This will be one of the major health benefits of the
proposed water supply system.
      The normal Child Mortality Rate of about 100 deaths per 1,000
children per year in populations without safe water would be
lowered to about 10 deaths per 1,000 per year, if the children
were supplied with safe drinking water at the rate of 100
liters/capita/day (8RA, Vol 1, p21). In the population expected
to be served with the water supply from Gwaigwaye Reservoir of
30,000 people, 14% are children, about 4,200 (Table 4). Thus the
normal number of deaths of children in the group to be served is
42 per year, if they presently lack a safe water supply.
      It was estimated that provision of water at 100
liters/cap/day would reduce the annual number of deaths of
children in this group to 4 per year, a saving of 38 lives per
year. This is probably the single largest positive impact of the
construction of the proposed Gwaigwaye Reservoir.
      B.   Filariasis
     If adequate drainage systems are not constructed in the
communities to which the treated water is delivered, consequent
accumulations of waste water will encourage the breeding of Culex
and other mosquitos which can transmit the worm parasite causing
Filariasis.

     Recommendation: An adequate drainage system leading to
septic tanks with underground filtration systems, or to well
designed sewage oxidation ponds, should be constructed in each
community served with the treated water supply. This drainage
system should be constructed as part of the water supply system,
at the same time and by the same authority. Otherwise the
coordination and other problems will inevitably result in
considerable standing waters in the village, a sure recipe for
transmission of this parasitic disease.

     C.   Contamination with industrial chemicals
     It is hard to estimate and will be almost impossible to
monitor the possible new industries moving into Funtua and the 120
square kilometers of the catchment area, as the water supply
becomes more reliable, due to construction of Gwaigwaye Reservoir
(Figure 17). Such industries may discharge untreated wastewaters
which could flow into the reservoir. Prevention of such
industrial discharges is very difficult, and adequate treatment is
often found to be even more of a problem.

     Recommendation: A walking survey should be conducted of
potential areas of industrial discharges in the catchment area of
the proposed Gwaigwaye Reservoir, as well as the existing Mairua
Reservoir, and water quality measurements taken as needed. Within
the entire catchment area, no industrial discharges should be
permitted. The governments of Funtua and other communities should
be requested to adopt general policies of IJno discharge" and these
policies should be actively promoted by the communities, to
protect their own health.
     D.   Contamination with biocides
     Because of intensive agricultural activity in the catchment
area of 120 square kilometers, there is a high likelihood of
contamination of the reservoir with biocides used for weed and
pest control. Previous inventories in the general Environmental
Impact Assessment conducted for the reservoir, indicated the
application of a large variety of these biocides in the area
(Table 6, ERPLAR, 1991). These include biocides harmful to
human health.
     A more detailed study of the timing and application of these
biocides is needed to assess their potential health hazards.
Because many of them have long-term effects due to low
concentrations, it is probably impossible to measure them in
water. Thus theoretical calculations must be made to estimate
their concentrations in the drinking water. These calculations
require more detailed field data which can probably be obtained
from agricultural extension workers and from farmers in the
catchment area.
     RECOMMENDATION: A more detailed study of the use of biocides
in the catchment area should be carried out, based on interviews
with local agricultural agents and with farmers.
     As outlined in the general Environmental Impact Assessment,
use of these biocides should be actively discouraged by local
authorities (BRPLAN, 1991). The agricultural extension services
should be utilized for this purpose. Also the local governments
should adopt regulations prohibiting the use of toxic biocides in
the catchment area.
                                                                     43

     E.   Nitrates and Sodium
     The generally observed concentrations of nitrates and sodium
salts in the local waters indicated that the potential health risk
from water in Gwaigwaye Reservoir will be small. However there is
inadequate data for Gwaigwaye River in the catchment area, and
field sampling is needed for certainty.
     F.   Prevention of Yellow Fever and Guinea Worm Disease
     As reliable water is provided to a community, there will be a
noticeable drop in the risk from two diseases, Yellow Fever and
Guinea Worm. Yellow Fever is transmitted by a mosquito which
breeds in the artificial containers used to store water in and
around households. As the need for these containers diminishes,
so will the number of the mosquito vectors, and thus the risk of
transmission.
     Guinea Worm is transmitted by people going into stagnant
ponds to take water for domestic use. This will stop in
households supplied with reliable water supplies.
                                                                     44

x.   PROPOSED FIELD SURVEYS AND SPECIAL STUDIES
     Because of several potential health problems related to
construction of Gwaigwaye Reservoir, there is a need for
additional and more precise field data, and for a special study on
the operational feasibility of manipulating the reservoir water
level. This special study should also focus on the flow in the
river channel during the dry season, for 5 to 10 kilometers
downstream of the dam.
     A.   Field Surveys
     Field surveys are needed, preferably in October when
conditions are optimum for detecting insect and snail vectors of
the various diseases. Several items should be measured in the
field during the proposed OCtober survey. These include:
     1. Presence of viable Aedes macintoshi eggs in the soil of
floodplains within the reservoir area.
     2. Monitoring of water temperatures, nutrient, algae and
suspended solid concentrations, and Secchi Disk readings, in
Mairua Reservoir as well as other nearby and similar ponds.
     3. Detailed study of topography along the eastern shore of
the proposed Gwaigwaye Reservoir between elevations 107 and 110
meters.
     4. Sampling of Mairua reservoir and nearby streams for
general water quality, biocides, nutrients and industrial
chemicals. This should be preceded by a walking survey of
potential areas of industrial discharges.
     5. A detailed survey of agricultural agents and farmers
should be conducted to develop more precise estimates of the
possible long term effects of biocide use on the people who drink
water from the proposed reservoir.
                                                                         45

     B.     Special studies on Water Level Manipulations
     A joint exploration by the design engineers and the health
consultant should investigate the operational feasibility of the
recommended manipulation of the water level in the reservoir, for
vector control. These manipulations should be used to control
blackflies, malaria mosquitos and bilharzia snails. The required
water manipulations have already been specified for each insect
and snail species (Table 7.) It is recommended that this joint
exploration be conducted in October when the health consultant
will be in Nigeria to supervise field studies.
     After revising the topographical map of the reservoir with
recent and more precise data, a seasonal pattern of fluctuations
should be developed for use in years when excess water is
available, combining techniques for control of blackflies, malaria
mosquitos and bilharzia snails. The required water manipulations
are slightly different for each vector, but it should be possible
to combine them both seasonally and in terms of their impact on
the reservoir, the spillway, and the river channel downstream.
