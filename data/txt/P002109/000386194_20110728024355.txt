                                                                      3

                             SUMMARY 

      preliminary analyses of the two proposed water supply systems
near zonkwa and Kwoi in Kaduna State of Nigeria indicated that the
Kajim Spring system proposed near Zonkwa should be easy to protect
from health risks by withdrawing the water from shallow
underground wells or galleries. Thus the water supply would have
natural protection from contamination and would not need
treatment.
      For the water supply system near Kwoi there would be some
health hazards related to the proposed reservoir on the Chori
River. There would be two negative health impacts related to the
reservoir, and three positive impacts.
      The populations utilizing the water from both the Kajim
Spring source near Zonkwa and from the reservoir on the Chori
River should receive considerable health benefit from lower rates
of diarrheal disease. It is estimated that the Annual Mortality
Rate among children will drop from 100 per 1,000 children to about
10 per 1,000, if the design rate of 100 Liters per person per day
is delivered to their homes. These are normally observed
decreases in mortality in the Tropics among children from
diarrheal diseases, when safe water is supplied to their homes at
this rate.
     Using preliminary design data and topographical information
for the surface water reservoir proposed on the Chori River, it
was estimated that the health risks from bilharzia would increase
around the reservoir and in the 9 kilometer reach of the river
downstream of the dam. The relatively low amount of nutrients
expected to accumulate in the reservoir would make it difficult
for most species of the bilharzia snails to survive. Only one
species would be likely to colonize the reservoir, that which
transmits urinary bilharzia. Thus it is unlikely that intestinal
bilharzia would occur around the reservoir.
     Downstream of the dam however, the change in river ecology
would make it likely that bilharzia of both intestinal and urinary
forms would be transmitted to the human population within a 2
kilometer strip on both sides of the river.
     with minor structural features on the spillway it should be
possible to fluctuate the water level in the reservoir during the
early part of the rainy season, and thus minimize snail
populations in the reservoir. Downstream, the snails should be
controlled by channel straightening and maintenance, and by
construction of small dams with siphons for automatic flushing of
the channel during the dry season.
     In addition to these snail control measures, bilharzia
transmission should be further reduced by providing domestic water
supplies to the communities within 2 kilometers of the reservoir
shoreline and of the downstream portion of the river, for a
distance of 9 kilometers below the proposed dam.
     These recommended bilharzia control measures should be
developed in detail by a planning session involving both the
reservoir planners and the health consultant. In addition, data
should be collected on nutrient concentrations and other aspects
                                                                     4

of aquatic ecology around the reservoir. The optimum time for
both of these exercises is OCtober.
     River Blindness and malaria would not increase significantly,
according to the preliminary analyses. The water velocities on
the dam spillway would be too high for breeding of the blackflies
which spread River Blindness. The steep shoreline of the
reservoir would not create many breeding sites for malaria
mosquitos.
     Drinking water to be extracted from the proposed reservoir is
not likely to be contaminated with industrial chemicals, nor with
significant amounts of agricultural chemicals. General salt
content of the surface water is also satisfactory.
     However the large and growing number of people in the
watershed indicate that contamination with human excreta is
likely, and thus standard sand filtration will be necessary for
prevention of cholera, typhoid fever and other diarrheal diseases
which are health hazards in northern Nigeria.
     These proposed environmental measures should make it possible
to reduce transmission of bilharzia and diarrheal diseases in a
sustainable manner, insuring a net health benefit due to the
proposed water supply systems.

I.   INTRODUCTION
     This is Volume Two of a series of reports on a health
opportunity assessment of proposed water supply systems in Kaduna
State of Nigeria.
     Delivery of Volumes One and Two in this assessment completed
Phase I of the health assessment. They were developed entirely
from design proposals and published literature on ecology and
public health. They report preliminary analyses prior to field
investigations which will be conducted during Phase II. Final
analyses will be conducted after the field investigations are
completed, and hopefully before the final design of the dams and
related structures are completed.
     Volume One was a summary of the literature survey, and
published in March 1994, and is referred to as (BHA, Vol X).
                                                                       7

II.   HUMAN POPULATIONS IN EACH HEALTH IMPACT ZONE

     The basic first step in assessment of health risks was
estimation of the number of people within various zones of
potential health hazards. For completeness these estimations were
made several generations into the future, for often the long-term
sustainability of the proposed project has a major influence in
future health risks. Short projections of only 15 or 20 years
into the future can lead to major errors in balancing construction
costs with costs of maintaining the health of the affected
populations.
      For the preferable long-term projections we used computer
simulations to organize the analysis. Despite their apparent
precision however, it should be recognized that they are extremely
sensitive to assumptions, and that they do not predict unexpected
changes in political, economic or environmental conditions.
     Computer models simulating human populations were developed
on simple spreadsheets used in business and accounting. Both for
population projections and in projecting the impact of the
proposed water supplies on disease and death, simple models were
developed for the project areas. These models divided the
populations by age groups, then applied age specific birth and
death rates, as well as migration rates. Migration into the
project area is assumed to occur at an equal rate in all age
groups, simulating family migration.
     The basic computation step in the model for eacb subset of
people (ethnic or geographical group, and age) is based on the
following summation, applied repetitively for each subset for each
year, starting with 1990:
begin with previous population for this group and previous age-set
     deaths from this subset
+    immigrants
=========--=============================================
      new population
      A typical population projection shows the number of children
in one cohort as the cohort ages over five years (Table    1).   The
models used in this health assessment however were constructed
with five-year time intervals, not one-year intervals. The
example portrayed here was based on one-year time intervals solely
for clarity.

Table 1. Illustrative population projections of a
portion of a stable population from 1990 to 1994.
This projection was conducted using a simple spreadsheet based on
a one-year time interval. Migration was omitted for clarity.
Also for simplicity, annual survival was assumed to 0.8 for
children aged 0-2 years and 0.9 for children older than 2 years.
Bold nwabers follow cohort of children born in 1990, as part of
arbitrary initial population.

     A human population model based on these simple concepts was
made for conditions in the area of Katsina and Kaduna states,
using demographic data from Malumfashi (TOmkins e~ aI, 1991)
and from the World Bank (World Bank 1992). The fertility rate
was adjusted upward to 9 births per woman, and the death rates
were adjusted slightly to give a long term population increase
similar to the 2.9% per year reported for Nigeria (Table 2).
     The spreadsheet model using Lotus software predicted a rapid
rise in a model population of one million people in 1990 to five
million by 2050 and ten million by 2075, assuming no migration
(Pigure 1).

model of typical human population of one million people,
for conditions in northern Nigeria, 1990 to 2090.
This population would have a doubling period of 25 years with the
low rate of 1% per year in-migration. With no migration the
doubling period would be almost 30 years, but with 10% in­
migration the doubling period would be only 15 years.

     with the assumption of a 1% migration rate into the area due
to the attractiveness of improved water-supply, slightly higher
populations were calculated. From one million in 1990, the second
prediction was five million people by 2045 and twenty million by
2070 (Figure 2). It is possible that migration rates could
seriously exceed 1% per year, causing much larger population
increases. If the in-migration rate were 10% per year, the
projected population by 2045 was almost eleven million, more than
twice the number predicted with a 1% per year migration rate
(Table   3).

      projections for the population to be served by the Kajim
Spring supply could go as high as 170,000 people if each received
100 liters per per person per day. Within a 5 kilometer radius of
the spring, which could be the impact of malaria mosquitos if the
spring had marshy margins, it was estimated that the population
could reach 78,000 people by the year 2020, and over half a
million by the year 2090 crable 4 and Pigure 3).
     Projections for each of the 9 sub-populations at risk for the
Chori Reservoir included 42,000 people who could be at risk from
bilharzia in the reservoir itself, and an additional 19,000
downstream, by the year 2020.
     The estimated population which could be served by the
reservoir was 51,000 people, based on calculations by WAPDECO.
There was a small population of construction workers expected for
the year in which the dam would be built, arbitrarily estimated at
1,000 people.
     All of these numbers are tentative and should be revised in
the light of more recent design and census figures before the
final estimates of health impact are completed.

III.   HEALTH RISKS FOR KAJIM SPRING SYSTEM

     preliminary analyses of the two proposed water supply systems
near Zonkwa and Kwoi in Kaduna State of Nigeria indicated that the
Kajim Spring system proposed near Zonkwa should be easy to protect
from health risks by withdrawing the water from shallow
underground wells or galleries. Thus the water supply would have
natural protection from contamination and would not need
treatment.
      If the supply is taken from the existing open waterbodies
below the spring, the entire area should be protected from human
access, and the intake pipe should be screened or otherwise
protected from taking in bilharzia snails or the small copepods
which transmit the parasite which causes Guinea Worm infection.
     Guinea Worm is transmitted when people with mature worm
infections walk into a waterbody and the female worms release
parasite eggs into the water, through the broken skin of the
infected person. The larval stages of the parasite enter common
copepods, very small organisms common in polluted waters. When
parasitized copepods are then ingested by another person while
drinking water from this site, the parasites develop in the
person, eventually becoming adult worms and continuing the cycle.
      In a slightly different fashion, eggs of the bilharzia
parasites reach fresh water via contamination with feces or urine
from infected persons. -The eggs hatch in the water and penetrate
certain species of aquatic snails. After the parasite matures in
the snail, it returns to the water and seeks a human host,
penetrating the human skin, to then develop into adult worms in
the parasitized person. people can also become infected by
drinking water which contains the bilharzia larvae, although the
most common mode of infection is through immersion in the
waterbody containing the snails.
     The recommended mesh size for screening out the copepods is
0.1 millimeter. The bilharzia parasite cannot be excluded with
screens because it is microscopic. For exclusion of bilharzia
snails an opening of 1 millimeter or smaller would be sufficient.
Screens of this size would cause considerable loss of hydraulic
head under normal operating conditions.
     An alternative to the screens might be to locate the intake
pipe in a deep place in the reservoir, with a sufficiently large
excavation around the intake to lower velocities to minimal
values, thus decreasing the possibility of hydraulic transport of
the copepods or juvenile snails toward the the intake. These
organisms would normally be found in the upper sunlit layers of
water in a reservoir, at less than 2 or 3 meters depth.
     However the most secure and sustainable method of protecting
the water supply is by the abstraction of water from the aquifer
before it reaches the surface.

IV.   GEOMETRY OF PROPOSED RESERVOIR ON CHORI RIVER

     The proposed reservoir site on the Chari River near the town
of Kuryas would create a reservoir with a FSL of 731.8 meters,
Nigerian datum. The reservoir would be long and narrow with its
long axis running about 5 kilometers ESE from the dam (Figure 4).
The maximum width of the reservoir would be about 1 kilometer with
an average width of 0.5 kilometers.
     At FSL of 732 meters the proposed reservoir would have a
gross storage volume of 9.4 million cubic meters (Figure 5), a
water surface area of 2,5 million square meters and a shoreline
perimeter of 12 kilometers. At the expected low water level of
730 meters the storage volume would be 5 million cubic meters, the
surface area 1.5 million square meters and the shoreline 9
kilometers.

V.   MEAN ANNUAL FLOWS AND RESERVOIR WATER LEVELS
     Based on the normal rainfall patterns and thus the expected
stream flow into the reservoir, and assuming a constant withdrawal
for domestic water supplies, it was estimated that the reservoir
would be full and overflowing from July to OCtober, assuming a
monthly extraction rate of 800,000 cubic meters (Figure 6).
     Because of the shallow nature of the proposed reservoir, the
water would be fully mixed due to winds and currents, and thus
stratification and anoxic conditions at the bottom of the
reservoir would not occur.

VI •   RIVER BLINDNESS

      The largest population at risk from a health hazard created
by the proposed reservoir would be the population within 30
kilometers of the spillway where blackfly breeding could occur
during the periods when the spillway is overflowing. Blackflies
transmit the blinding parasitic diseases known as River Blindness.
The population "at risk would include the towns of Kwoi and
Kafanchan, as well as many small villages (Pigure 3).
      Blackflies lay their eggs in fast flowing "white" water.
Adult flies emerge after about a week, if the flow is not
interrupted. The spillway will be flowing fairly steadily during
the rain season, from about July to OCtober. Water temperatures
and air temperatures are favorable for the blackflies during these
months, thus there will be significant breeding if the water
velocities on the spillways are in the required range for the
blackflies.
      The preferred velocities of blackflies in west Africa are
between O. 7 and 2.5 meters per second (aRA vol 1 p'6). Design
figures for the spillway indicated that the expected velocities on
the spillway should be much higher than this (Table 5). The
minimum design velocity for flow of 10 centimeter depth and
discharge of 16 cubic meters per second would be 6.7 meters per
second, far in excess of the preferred velocities by the
blackflies. If these velocities are prevalent throughout the
spillway structure, then blackfly breeding should not be a
problem, and there should be no risk to the surrounding
communities •

VI I •   MALARIA 


      Because of prolonged mosquito breeding along the shores of
the proposed reservoir at Kuryas, it is predicted that there will
be an extension of the existing malaria transmission period, by a
few months. The existing period of transmission is from July to
November, dependent on the rains. If there were no other factors
affecting mosquito breeding in the margins of the proposed
reservoir, it would be expected that the mosquitos would breed
year round and thus extend the transmission season significantly,
within the 5 kilometer flight zone from the reservoir shores
 (Figure 7). This flight zone covers roughly 12 by 16 kilometers
and thus includes a projected population of 185,000 people by the
year 2020 (Table 4).
      strong winds create waves which may erode the shoreline and
limit vegetation and calm water necessary for mosquito larvae to
develop. The harmattan winds blow at a mean velocity of 5
kilometers from the North East during the months from November to
mid April. Thus .the southern shore of the reservoir would be
subject to steady wave action during that time and would probably
not support mosquito breeding. However the northern shore would
be sheltered from the wind and would be a fairly good habitat,
although it is relatively straight with steep slopes.
      During the rainy season the winds would be from the South
West at velocities of 7.4 kilometers per hour, impinging on the
northern shore from mid April through October. During this period
malaria mosquitos could breed on the southern shore. The southern
shore is more favorable for mosquito breeding than is the northern
shore, because of the two major indentations on the southern shore
which offer additional protection against waves, and also larger
expanses of flat slopes.
      The various indices of suitability for malaria mosquito
breeding indicate that the proposed reservoir would not be a
favorable site. The Marsh Potential for the reservoir at FSL is
2.0, quite a bit lower than the values of 18 to 20 for good
breeding sites.
      Based on the recent topographical survey of the site by
Parkman samaila Engineers in 1993, the shore slopes and other
geometry of the proposed reservoir were determined. In Sector A,
nearest the dam, the shore slope to the South varies from a
maximum of 9 meters fall in 780 meters (1: 86) to a minimum of 6
meters in 180 (1:30). The northern shore in Sector A is generally
steeper, a mean of 8 meters in 330 or 1:42 (Table 6).
      In Sector B, the upstream sector starting about 2 kilometers
upstream of the dam, the average slope of the southern shore is
1:28 and the northern shore is 1:55.
      Another measure of habitat suitability for malaria mosquitos
is the Vector Habitat potential, the area of reservoir shore where
the water depth is less than 2 meters. At FSL the proposed
reservoir will have an area about 100 meters wide around the
perimeter which will be the Vector Habitat Potential, about 110
hectares, compared to 80 hectares at the expected low level of 730
meters (Table 6). The high VHP of 110 hectares will occur from
                                                                      24


July to October doing the rainy season, and the low value of 80
hectares will occur during April and May at the end of the dry
season. This indicates that there there will be no great seasonal
variation in potential for mosquito production related to the
reservoir geometry.
     In summary the proposed reservoir would not cause a marked
increase in malaria transmission in the area. It does not appear
to be a good habitat for malaria mosquito breeding, based on its
geometry.

VIII.     BILHARZIA
     The risk of bilharzia transmission was evaluated for the
reservoir proposed near Kuryas. Although the site further
downstream may be selected eventually, the predictions for the
Kuryas site were robust and should not change substantially with
the small shift in the location of the dam.
     The principal parameters involved in predicting the risk of
bilharzia transmission are the likelihood of bilharzia snail
populations in the reservoir, and the number of people coming into
contact with the reservoir. The number of people at risk can be
estimated as the number inside the 2 kilometer zone around the
reservoir shoreline (Figure 8). From the local population
density of 430 persons per square kilometer, the population at
risk of increased bilharzia transmission would be 42,000 by the
year 2020 (Table 4).
     A.   Prediction of bilharzia snail populations
     It is difficult to make precise predictions for a reservoir
which has not yet been constructed, but sufficient data on similar
reservoirs and on the basic ecological and biological processes
are available for rough estimates. The data required include the
geometry of the reservoir, the climate and ecological nature of
the catchment area which-supplies water to the reservoir, and the
innate biological characteristics of the various species of
snails.

      using ecological parameters derived from studies on similar
reservoirs in the tropics and on reservoirs and climatic
conditions in Kaduna and nearby regions, it was estimated that the
mean Seechi Disk reading in the proposed reservoir would be 2.7
meters. This was derived from the description of the 63 square
kilometer catchment area, for which the mean phosphorus runoff was
estimated to be 0.1 kilograms per hectare per year (BRA Vol 1,
p40 and p58). Combining this measure of lake transparency with
the geometrical characteristics and the estimated water level
fluctuations, the monthly variation in the volume of potential
snail habitat was calculated. This volume, the Illuminated Shore
Zone, was estimated to vary between a maximum of 3 million cubic
meters in April, May and June as well as in OCtober and November,
to a minimum of 1.6 million cubic meters in January and February
(Figure 9).
      From the predicted phosphorus concentrations in the reservoir
it was then estimated that the mean algal density would be 1.3
milligrams per Liter, using the ratio of algal biomass to
phosphorus of 115 (St~ and wagner, 1970).         Surface water
temperatures were estimated to reach a maximum of 30 degrees C in
June and a minimum of 22 degrees C in January, based on analysis
of similar tropical reservoirs (BRA Vol 1 p57). These estimated
parameters were summarized by month for an average year, in order
to predict the likelihood that the reservoir would be colonized by
bilharzia snails (Figure 9).

      The three species of snails which were evaluated for
colonization of the proposed reservoir were Biomphalaria
pfeifferi, the snail which transmits intestinal bilharzia, as well
as Bulinus globosus and Bulinus senegalensis, the snails which
transmit urinary bilharzia. If the first two species can inhabit
a reservoir in northern Nigeria, then the third species, Bulinus
senegalensis, could also inhabit the reservoir. However Bulinus
senegalensis is a Fragile Spire snail and thus very susceptible to
 fish predation in reservoirs which do not dry out completely every
year. There is insufficient data to estimate the likelihood of
 fish predation, but an estimate of the likelihood of colonization
by Bulinus senegalensis was made on the assumption that fish
predation would be minor.
      Biomphalaria snails are Fragile Disk snails with short
lifespans, egg-laying rates proportional to food density, and are
reasonably resistant to drying (BRA Vol 1 p37). Bulinus
globosus is a Fragile Globe snail, slightly more tolerant to high
temperatures and slightly more resistant to drying than is
Biomphalaria but with the same egg-laying rates dependent on food
density. Bulinus globosus has roughly similar characteristics as
Bulinus truncatus rohlfsi, and both may transmit urinary bilharzia
in Nigeria.
      Bulinus senegalensis is a tiny Fragile Spire snail with high
resistance to drying and high temperatures. It also lays eggs in
a burst, immediately after reviving due to flooding of a dry
waterbody. This gives the population a decided advantage over the
Fragile Disks and Fragile Globes because the Fragile Spire snails
build up their numbers quickly, even when the breeding season is
short. The other distinguishing characteristic noted for Bulinus
senegalensis which gives it an advantage in the climate of
northern Nigeria is that it deliberately goes into the water's
edge in a pond which is drying up, as compared to the other snails
which move toward the deepest place. Thus the Bulinus
senegalensis will be revived only when the habitat has been
completely filled, giving it the maximum possible breeding" season.
The other snails will be revived even with light rainfall,
exposing them to a potentially disastrous second stranding if the
light rainfall came early, before the main rainy season. Thus in
several ways the Fragile Spire snails, especially Bulinus
senegalensis, have the advantage in unstable waterbodies in
northern Nigeria.
      Computer simulations of conditions during an average year in
the proposed reservoir indicated that neither Biomphalaria
pfeifferi nor Bulinus globosus populations could establish
themselves. The principal reason seemed to be the low amount of
food, due to the expected low rate of phosphorus accumulation in
the reservoir (Pigures 10 and 11).
      These simulations indicated that the other Fragile Globe
snail, Bulinus truncatus rohlfsi, would probably not colonize the
reservoir either.

     Although the Fragile Disk and Fragile Globe snails would not
survive in the proposed reservoir, predictions with the snail
model indicated that the Fragile Spire snail, Bulinus
senegalensis, would be able to populate it (Pigure 12). It was
clear from the egg laying predictions, that the initial burst of
eggs which followed revival of the adult snails stranded during
the dry season, gave this species sufficient numbers to survive to
the next rainy season.
     Low food density was thus not an impediment to population of
the reservoir by bilharzia snails. Bulinus senegalensis is an
efficient transmitter of urinary bilharzia in Nigeria, and with
the large number of people living within 2 kilometers of the
reservoir it is likely that this form of the disease would
increase in the area.
     However the predictions with the snail model indicated that
intestinal bilharzia, the more severe form of the disease would
not be likely around this reservoir. This prediction depends
directly on the amount of algae and other vegetation which
develops in the reservoir. Thus it is recommended that field
studies be conducted on nutrient, algal and vegetation
concentrations in nearby and similar habitats, to refine the
precision of the estimated food density.
     Control of bilharzia around the reservoir due to these
Fragile spire snails will be difficult. Chemical application of
biocides is not economically feasible, and infected persons would
have to be repeatedly treated with expensive drugs. The reservoir
shores are fairly steep and the water will be fairly clear, so it
would be quite expensive to make the shores steeper in order to
reduce the potential habitat zone.
     The most likely method to be economically sustainable for
snail control is periodic fluctuation of the water level, by
manipulation the discharge over the spillway. If the level is
fluctuated during the breeding season with a period of 3-10 days
and an amplitude of 25 to 50 centimeters, the eggs of the snails
will die, and the population will probably not survive.
     The computer simulation indicated that the most effective
month to do this would be at the beginning of the rainy season.
Our estimate of the water budget indicated that the reservoir
would be full and overflowing by July. Thus fluctuations in the
early months of the rainy season should be quite practical as
water would be wasted over the spillway in any event.

RECOMMENDATION:     The spillway should be designed to allow for
fluctuation of the water level on a weekly basis with alternating
surcharges and drawdowns of roughly 0.5 meters. Operation of the
spillway to produce such drawdowns should be conducted in the
early months of the rainy season when there is excess flow coming
into the reservoir. The fluctuations can be stopped as soon as
the reservoir level falls below the spillway, at the beginning of
the dry season.
      The expected impact due on survival of bilharzia snail eggs
due to these fluctuations should be evaluated jointly with the
planners for both its operational and biological feasibility,
using the more recent geometry of the final reservoir design.
This should be accomplished in OCtober after additional field data
is gathered to refine the computer predictions of the snail
populations. At that time more detailed estimates of the optimum
fluctuation schedules can be developed.
                                                                     36

     B.   Downstream reaches of river.
     Because the dam will reduce the flushing effect of the rainy
season on the normal river ecology, and because seepage will
probably occur downstream of the dam throughout the year and thus
provide a base flow through the dry season, the river downstream
of the dam will become more favorable as a habitat for bilharzia
snails. The length of river so affected will be at least 9
kilometers long, down to the confluence with the mainstem of the
Gurara River.
     The impact zone for bilharzia transmission along the river
will be 2 kilometers on either side of the river, thus creating an
area of 36 square kilometers with significantly higher risk of
bilharzia transmission (Pigure 13). with a population density of
430 persons per square kilometer in 1990, this will place about
19,000 people at increased risk of bilharzia transmission by the
year 2020 (Table 4).
     There is the possibility of reducing the favorability of the
downstream reach of the river by channelization and by periodic
flushing and drying of the channel. Channelization is a matter of
earthwork and channel maintenance which could be carried out the
by the State Water Board. Periodic flushing could be accomplished
with a series of small dams and automatic siphon spillways, such
as those used traditionally for mosquito control, or the small
dams could be fitted with removable gates and the flushing done
manually by the same crews responsible for channel maintenance.
     The economic feasibility of these methods will require more
detailed topographical information on the existing river channel
in the 9 kilometer reach downstream of the proposed dam.
     RBCOMMBRDATIOR: A detailed profile and topographical map
of the river channel downstream of the dam should be prepared in
order to design and make cost estimates for improved
channelization and for a series of small dams to be used in
periodic flushing of the dry weather flow in the channel.
     Although the river will be flushed during the early rainy
season if the reservoir level is fluctuated, the time for growth
of snail populations in the river, and thus the transmission
period for bilharzia along the river, will be during the dry
season. Thus the river flushing will have to be independent of
the reservoir fluctuations.
     The proposed channelization and fluctuation of the river will
also make it highly unsuitable for breeding of malaria mosquitos,
as long as the river banks are smoothly sloping toward the
channel, and the flushing wave does not flood flat areas above the
river channel. Design of the flushing program should thus be
conducted with fairly accurate topographical maps.

IX.   RIFT VALLEY FEVER

     The most likely time for an outbreak of Rift Valley Fever
would be during the first rainy season after the dam is completed.
At this time a large outbreak of the floodplain mosquitos of the
species Aedes macintoshi might occur because the unusually high
water level created as the dam filled would force hatching of the
eggs accumulated at high water marks over the previous decade, if
this species of mosquito is found in the area.
      If sheep or goats carrying the virus of Rift valley Fever are
present in the area at the time of this mosquito hatching, the
mosquito could transmit the virus from the sheep to people, and
thus people could become infected with this highly fatal virus,
within the 5-kilometer mosquito zone around the reservoir.
     The eggs of the mosquito vector of Rift Valley Fever are laid
in the soil at the high water line during high water levels in the
flood plain each year. When water levels reach unusually high
elevations, especially after several years with low floods, all of
the accumulated eggs hatch at the same time. This would most
likely occur during the first filling of the proposed reservoir.
     It is not certain that there would be epidemics of Rift
Valley Fever around the proposed reservoir. No epidemics have
occurred around similar reservoirs built nearby during the last
decade. Although the virus has been moving around West Africa,
epidemics have occurred to date only in the Senegal River Basin.
     Three different methods could be used for monitoring the risk
of a potential epidemic, and there are a number of possible
interventions which could be used to prevent transmission of the
disease, if a risk were discovered.
      A.   Monitoring the risk of transmission
      There are at least three ways to monitor this problem. One
is to monitor viral antibodies in the local sheep populations, and
if the virus is circulating in the area at the time the dam is
finished, to take extreme measures during the rainy season to
prevent transmission. This is an expensive process unless a
virology laboratory is already functioning in the area.
     Another way to monitor the potential for transmission is to
sample the soil at appropriate locations and determine if viable
Aedes eggs are present, and at what locations within the area to
be flooded by the reservoir. This process is simple and
inexpensive.
     A third way to monitor the potential for transmission is to
search for Aedes larvae along the shores of the reservoir during
the period after the reservoir starts filling. This is also a
simple process.
                                                                     39

     B.   preventing transmission
     In the event that these surveys indicate a potential for
transmission, preventive measures could be implemented. These
preventive measures could include:
     1. Move all sheep, goats and cattle out of the 5 kilometer
zone during the rainy season (July through December).
     2. Eliminate the mosquito eggs by special treatment of the
area to be flooded when the reservoir fills. This could include
plowing the soil, mowing or burning of vegetation in the area, or
spraying with larvicides.
     3. Control the mosquitos hatching in the lake by larviciding
or space spraying.
     4. Vaccinate the human population at risk, about 90,000
people in the 5 kilometer zone in 1995.

     Reo oDlllle nda tion : Although the likelihood of Rift Valley
Fever occurring around the reservoir is small, it is recommended
that monitoring be conducted of the floodplain soil for Aedes
mosquito eggs in the soil prior to filling of the reservoir, and
it is also recommended that the shoreline of the reservoir be
monitored for hatching larvae during the rainy seasons of the
first three years after the reservoir is constructed. If viable
eggs are found in the soil, the vegetation should be burned and
then the soil ploughed in the infested areas, before the reservoir
fills. If larvae of the mosquito vector are nonetheless found in
the reservoir as it fills, animal herds should be moved out of the
5 kilometer flight range of the mosquitos until the mosquitos die
off, probably from the time the reservoir fills until December
when cold weather kills off the mosquitos.
     If there are no mosquitos and no epidemic the first three
years after the reservoir fills, and weather conditions are
normal, then there is little likelihood that the disease will
occur in subsequent years.
     If substantial numbers of viable eggs are found, or if
breeding of the mosquito vector did take place however, then a
virological study should be conducted among the local herds, and
constant vigilance maintained, with appropriate preventive
measures undertaken when there is threat of an epidemic. The
highly fatal course of this disease gives it high local
importance, although the small size of the reservoir reduces its
importance as a regional health problem.
                                                                             40

       X.   OTHER HEALTH RISKS

            There are a number of other potential health risks around the
       reservoir, including diarrheal diseases caused by contamination of
       the reservoir with feces of infected persons, as well as
       contamination of the reservoir with various salts and chemicals
       coming from the large population within the catchment area
       (Figure 8 and    ~able   4)_
            A.   Diarrheal diseases
             Because Nigeria has lately been subject to cholera epidemics,
       and because diarrheal diseases are generally high, the water from
       the reservoir could contain pathogens and should be treated by
,'"    standard sand filtration before it is used for human consumption.
             Conversely, the supply of sufficient quantities of water to
       the population served by the new system will reduce diarrheal
       disease in proportion to the amount of water made available per
       person. This will be one of the major health benefits of the
       proposed water supply system.
             The normal Child Mortality Rate of about 100 deaths per 1,000
       children per year in populations without safe water would be
       lowered to about 10 deaths per 1,000 per year, if the children
       were supplied with safe drinking water at the rate of 100
       liters/capita/day (BRA, Vol 1, p21). In the population expected
            B.   Filariasis
            If adequate drainage systems are not constructed in the
       communities to which the treated water is delivered, consequent
       accumulations of waste water will encourage the breeding of Culex
~i 	   and other mosquitos which can transmit the worm parasite causing
       Filariasis.

            RecolDlllendation: An adequate drainage system leading to
       septic tanks with underground filtration systems, or to well
       designed sewage oxidation ponds, should be constructed in each
       community served with the treated water supply. This drainage
       system should be constructed as part of the water supply system,
       at the same time and by the same authority_ Otherwise the
       coordination and other problems will inevitably result in
       considerable standing waters in the village, a sure recipe for
       transmission of this parasitic disease.

            c.   Contamination with industrial chemicals
            It is not expected that industrial development will occur
       around the reservoir and thus contamination with industrial
       chemicals is not likely. Nonetheless local prohibitions against
       any industrial discharge into the catchment area should be adopted
       by the local community and government organizations.
                                                                     4 1




     D.   Contamination with biocides
     The catchment area is not highly developed agriculturally and
it is not expected that agricultural or other biocide use will
cause important contamination of the reservoir. This assumption
should be re-evaluated every 10 or 20 years to monitor changing
conditions.
     E.   Nitrates and Sodium
     samples of local water quality indicate that there is little
health risk from high nitrate or sodium concentrations in the
drinking water.

     F.   Prevention of Yellow Fever and Guinea Worm Disease
     As reliable water is provided to a community, there will be a
noticeable drop in the risk from two diseases, Yellow Fever and
Guinea Worm. Yellow Fever is transmitted by a mosquito which
breeds in the artificial containers used to store water in and
around households. As the need for these containers diminishes,
so will the number of the mosquito vectors, and thus the risk of
transmission.
     Guinea Worm is transmitted by people going into stagnant
ponds to take water for domestic use. This will stop in
households supplied with reliable water supplies.

XI.   PROPOSED FIELD SURVEYS AND SPECIAL STUDIES

     Because of potential health problems related to Rift Valley
Fever and bilharzia around the proposed reservoir on the Chori
River, field data should be collected on a number of items, to
refine the precision of the estimates made in this report.
     Field surveys are needed, preferably in OCtober when
conditions are optimum for detecting insect and snail vectors of
the various diseases. Items to be measured in the field during
the proposed OCtober survey include:
     1. Presence of viable Aedes mecintosbi eggs in the soil of
floodplains within the reservoir area.
     2. Monitoring of water temperatures, nutrient, algae and
suspended solid concentrations, and Secchi Disk readings, in
nearby and similar reservoirs.
      3.   Channel geometry of the river reach downstream of the

     Also a special planning study should be conducted jointly
between the dam designers and the health consultant to examine the
economic feasibility of the proposals recommended in this
preliminary report for snail control by fluctuation of the water
level in the reservoir, and by periodic flushing of the river
downstream of the dam. This could take place in October in
conjunction with the field studies of Phase Two.
