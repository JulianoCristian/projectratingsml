Lessons learned from the\n            project: While carrying out studies of this kind, it is\n            important to have a realistic timeframe for reviewing the\n            numerous draft reports; back and forth exchange of views\n            among the consultants, the Bank, and the Borrower; and for\n            incorporating the comments. Regular consultation with the\n            donors, participation of all donor agencies right from the\n            early stages of project preparation, and establishing\n            coordination mechanism are essential for the successful\n            implementation of a project in Kosovo. It is important for\n            the Bank to mobilize the required inter-disciplinary skills.\n            For example, the involvement of the Bank's mining\n            specialists in the project was useful in resolving mining\n            issues and also in developing the framework for private\n            sector participation. In post-conflict situations such as in\n            Kosovo, it is essential to focus more on capacity building,\n            right from the beginning of the project."}, "docdt": "2006-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
