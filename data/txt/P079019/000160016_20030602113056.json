Technical\n            Assistance Project for Kosovo aims to assist in (i)\n            developing capacity for a commercially sustainable exchange\n            of power with the regional system, and optimizing\n            utilization of existing generation capacity through economic\n            dispatch; and (ii) developing a framework for attracting\n            private sector investment in the energy sector. There are\n            three project components identified on the basis of the\n            ESTAP-I Energy Sector Study (December, 2002) and discussions\n            with the Government. Component 1 prepares a detailed\n            feasibility report for a 400 kV transmission interconnection\n            between Kosovo and Albania taking into account regional\n            perspective, and developing an approach for commercially\n            sustainable terms of exchange of power with the neighboring\n            systems. The feasibility study will be conducted in\n            coordination with Albania. Component 2 prepares a bankable\n            project for establishment of a dispatch center in Kosovo.\n            Component 3  assists in developing a policy, legal,\n            regulatory, and institutional framework for private\n            investment in the energy sector. The Terms of Reference for\n            Component 3 are currently being developed. The TORS will\n            include, inter alia, a review from the perspective of\n            foreign private investors of issues such as applicable\n            commercial law, business registration, currency regime and\n            profit repatriation; access to international finance and\n            guarantees; applicable investment protection treaties;\n            ownership of property laws relating to securing of\n            obligations, concessions, leases and mortgages; energy\n            sector regulation, licensing, energy trading, regulatory\n            institution; labor laws affecting foreign private\n            investment; dispute resolution systems; taxation (export and\n            import duties, value-added taxes, presumptive and profit\n            taxes, personal income tax etc., municipal taxes,\n            royalties); and applicable environmental regulation, etc."}, "docdt": "2003-05-08T00:00:00Z"}
