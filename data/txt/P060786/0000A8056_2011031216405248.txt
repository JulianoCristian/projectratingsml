                         Due to strong project ownership, the implementation of e-government components went far beyond the original piloting plans in three public administration bodies as electronic

                         document flow system (EDMS) was rolled-out to the whole central administration (ministries, regional administration offices and commissions). EDMS was further equipped with
                         additional modules to support a staff performance management system for civil servants, on-line tracking of correspondence between citizens and government agencies, electronic
                         filing of tax reports, etc. Transparency of government operation was further enhanced through introduction of a module called Interactive Budget which reflects the real time progress
                         of state budget implementation based on information imported from the Treasury's database. Project also supported development of software which automated HR management
                         (HRMIS) in all civil service agencies and linked them to the database of Civil Service Council. Another management information system (MGIS) has been developed for local
                         governments and introduced in over 200 communities. E-tendering (procurement) and e-Licensing systems are currently being introduced. The project also supported government
                         agencies procuring hardware and furnishing necessary for deployment of e-government systems.

                         Institutional reforms and capacity building activities were especially successful on part of civil service reforms, where in addition to strengthening merit based selection mechanisms, a
                         robust performance appraisal and work planning mechanism was introduced and automated through EDMS and HRMIS. Capacity building efforts addressed also challenges of
                         external control, internal audit, a Budgetary Training Center, business processes for electronic procurement, standardization and certification, and municipal administration.
