     piloting innovations in selected institutions; and (b)\n            improving transparency in government decision-making and\n            policy implementation. The project consists o f six\n            components, which in combination will fund key innovations\n            in horizontal management processes and capacity building in\n            specific institutions in the Armenian Public Administration.\n            The ministry and agency-specific interventions aim to have a\n            demonstrative effect and are expected to generate further\n            reforms in other ministries. The components related to\n            horizontal management processes focus on strengthening Civil\n            Service Management, introducing e-Procurement, Financial\n            Oversight by strengthening the Chamber of Control (the\n            supreme audit institution), Policy Management and local\n            level policy implementation. Ministry and Agency specific\n            components focus on the Office o f the Government, the\n            Ministry of Finance and Economy, the Ministry o f Economic\n            Development and Trade and four selected agencies working in\n            the area o f standardization, certification and Metrology.\n            These components assist the government in addressing\n            weaknesses in the policy formulation and implementation\n            process in the central state administration, in particular\n            through the development of electronic document management\n            systems and systems for tracking policy implementation. In\n            addition the project will pilot other public management\n            innovations to enhance transparency and accountability and\n            address priority capacity building needs in selected\n            institutions (the Ministry of Finance and Economy, the\n            Ministry of Economic Development and Trade, and the Office\n            of the Government)."}, "docdt": "2004-04-08T00:00:00Z"}
