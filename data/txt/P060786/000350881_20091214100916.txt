The project will consist o f six components, which in combination will fund key innovations both in horizontal
management processes and capacity building in specific institutions in the Armenian Public Administration. The
ministry and agency-specific interventions aim to have a demonstration effect and are expected to generate further
reforms in other ministries.

The components related to policy management processes focus on Civil Service Management, Procurement,
Financial Oversight, Policy Management and local level policy implementation. Ministry and Agency specific
components focus on the Office o f the Government, the Ministry of Finance and Economy, the Ministry of
Economic Development and Trade and four selected agencies working in the area o f standardization, certification

A. STRATEGIC CONTEXT AND RATIONALE

1. Country and sector issues

1.1     Country Background

The Armenian economy has faced significant shocks in the recent past, including the 1988
earthquake; the Nagomo-Karabakh conflict; the 1998 financial crisis; the severe drought in 2000
and the harsh frost in the spring of 2002. Furthermore, the 1999 assassination o f the Prime
Minister, some key government officials and members of Parliament posed a severe political
shock. Notwithstanding these events, the economy has been remarkably resilient, as can be seen
from the key macro-economic indicators in Table 1 below. Economic growth accelerated from 6
percent in 2000 to 9.6 percent in 2001, 12.9 percent in 2002 and 13.9 percent in 2003.

Despite considerable progress, the sustainability of broad-based economic growth remains a key
challenge. Growth has been concentrated mainly in sectors with limited employment
opportunities, especially between 1995 and 1999. Since then, the entrepreneurial climate has
improved resulting in a better functioning of the real sector. More than 70 percent o f GDP was
generated b y the private sector. During the past two years the economic growth was driven by
export expansion. Manufacturing exports grew b y more than 50 percent in two years, with a
positive impact on employment and household incomes.

Strengthening accountability, effectiveness and transparency in public sector management i s a
further condition for achieving sustainability in economic growth. The development of strong
and stable governance institutions i s therefore a priority for Armenia, as recognized in the PRSP.
The next section provides an overview of the remaining institution building issues in the country.

1.2 Public Sector Management Issues

Armenia has in recent years made significant progress in reforming the governance system. The
pace o f reforms over the last four years has been impressive, especially in administrative
reorganization and Civil Service Development. However, regardless of the progress made, a
large agenda remains in order to create to put the building blocks for the creation o f an effective,
efficient and transparent system of governance in place, capacity building requirements remain
high, in particular at the local government level.

Armenia carried out a comprehensive reorganization of the central state administration between
1999-2002. The structure of the central government was rationalized, including a reduction in the
number o f ministries from 21 to 16 and functions were re-allocated. Ministries now mainly fulfill
policy formulation, monitoring and coordination functions, while service delivery and inspection
functions have been transferred to subordinated agencies and inspectorates. Whereas i t i s s t i l l
early to determine whether these reforms have led to tangible improvements in the quality of
governance, the rationalization o f structures has eliminated some of the considerable duplication
of functions that had previously characterized the Armenian administration. Reforms have also
been started in the Civil Service system, based on the adoption of the Civil Service Law and the
related law on Civil Service Remuneration in 2002.

Whereas progress has been made in reorganizing administrative structures, weaknesses in
governance capacities remain. Line ministries lack the capacity to formulate effective policies
and serious problems remain with the timely and effective implementation o f adopted policies
and legislation. Cross-ministerial coordination systems are not functioning adequately, leading to
blockages in the decision-making system. Furthermore, business processes such as procurement,
are s t i l l viewed as inefficient and lacking transparency. This negatively affects the perceived
predictability and reliability o f government institutions.

The adoption of the Civil Service Law and related secondary legislation are only the first steps in
building a professional civil service. A cross-governmental Human Resource Management
system has not yet been established and personnel management capacities in ministries remain
weak. This l i m i t s the ability of the Civil Service Council to effectively apply the C i v i l Service
law and impedes the creation of a professional, merit-based civil service. Furthermore, the wage
system and wage levels are not conducive to retaining qualified staff, regardless of recent
increases in salary levels. The government has in the context o f the PRSP committed itself to
increasing the proportion o f civil service wages as a percentage o f GDP, which should lead to an
improvement of the competitiveness o f civil service wages in a medium term time perspective.
However, in addition to increasing salaries in real terms, the Government also needs to address
the structure of civil service wages, in particular b y strengtheningthe performance-based
element in civil service salaries




                                                    2
There i s also a need to reform the systems of external and internal audit and financial control.
Supervision, Audit and Financial control are s t i l l exercised by the Chamber of Control under the
National Assembly, and three institutions in the executive: the Supervision Service o f the
President, the Supervision Service of the Prime Minister and the Financial Supervision
Department of the Ministry o f Finance. The division o f labor between these institutions needs to
be clarified and their professional capacity to conduct financial control and audit according to
internationally accepted standards needs to be strengthened.

Finally, strengthening capacities at local government level has become a key public sector
management issue. The Law on Local Self-Government was adopted in M a y 2002, increasing
the functions and responsibilities of local authorities. However, administrative fragmentation and
the low level of administrative capacity at the local level make local authorities ineffective in
fulfilling their new mandatory and delegated functions. There i s therefore a large agenda in the
area o f developing local government capacities for effective service delivery, which i s only now
being addressed.

Armenia i s receiving significant donor support for i t s reform efforts on governance issues.
Annex 2 contains a summary o f the main support provided. The underlying project w i l l work in
close partnership with other donors in addressing priority investment and capacity building needs
to enhance the quality o f governance in Armenia. In particular, partnerships have been developed
with Deutsche Gesellschaft fur Technische Zusammenarbeit (GTZ) on local governance and
external audit, with European Union's TACIS program and the United National Development
Program (UNDP) on local governance, with the United States Agency for International
Development (US AID) on procurement reform, local governance and internal audit and with the
Department for International Development (DFID) on reforming central government agencies.

2. Rationale for Bank involvement

Public Sector Modernization remains a key priority in Armenia. The implementation o f the
reform program (including the PRSP) requires strong administrative capacities, both at central
and at local government level.

The first phase o f reform o f the governance system in Armenia has been largely completed.
However, the next stage o f reforms requires the implementation of `second generation'
institutional reforms, which generally are more complex and difficult to complete. Nevertheless,
without the introduction o f `second generation' reforms, the benefits of the ongoing reform effort
w i l l remain limited. The project w i l l provide support for the design and implementation o f a
selected number of planned reforms, in particular those that aim to strengthen management
systems in state institutions and those that have a direct impact on improving the business
climate.

As stated above, Armenia i s receiving significant donor support in the area o f governance from
bilateral donors. However, other donor support focuses on individual institutions, without taking
a holistic approach to governance. The Public Sector Modernization project w i l l add value to
ongoing donor activities by supporting the development o f cross-governmental management
systems and by addressing capacity building needs in a small number o f priority institutions as



                                                  3
pilot activities, and act as a catalyst for further reforms. The project w i l l also serve as an
umbrella facility for other donor support.

The project builds on the conclusions of previous analytical work, in particular the Civil Service
Assessment (1998), the Institutional and Governance Review (2000), the Public Expenditure
Review (2003), the Country Procurement Assessment Report (2003) and the Country Financial
Accountability Assessment (2003). The project w i l l also support specific investments linked to
policy measures adopted under Bank adjustment operations.

3. Higher level objectives to which the project contributes

A key goal o f the current CAS (April, 2001) i s improving governance and public services. This
i s in line with broader country goals, as articulated in the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper
(PRSP). The new four-year CAS, also highlights the need for improvement o f public sector
management, and establishes a linkage between the PSMP and the planned PRSC.

The project w i l l contribute to one o f the key goals of the current CAS b y increasing
transparency, accountability, effectiveness and efficiency in public sector management. Project
activities w i l l contribute to increased levels o f effectiveness and efficiency by providing support
to the development and introduction of a select number of targeted public management
innovations, such as cross-governmental management information systems, and the provision o f
training to enhance the quality and effectiveness of policy management, personnel management
and local government service delivery. Capacity building support for audit and financial control
institutions as well as the development of interactive public information facilities in government
institutions w i l l enhance transparency and accountability in governance processes.

The improvements in the governance system to be achieved by the project w i l l also contribute to
enhancing the reliability of government institutions and thus contribute to an improved
investment climate in Armenia.

B. PROJECT D E S C R I P T I O N

1. Lending instrument

The operation was developed as a specific investment loan. The project i s to support specific
innovations in core public sector institutions, which should become a catalyst for further
modernization efforts. The operation i s linked to the PRSC, which w i l l support the government
in achieving future benchmarks related to improvements in the governance system.

2. Project development objective and key indicators

The Project Development Objective i s to enhance efficiency in public sector management
through: (a) piloting innovations in selected institutions; and (b) improving transparency in
government decision-making and policy implementation.




                                                    4
The main project monitoring indicators are:

        The proportion o f c i v i l service appointments made through merit-based open
        competitions increases by 50 Percent annually;
        Where e-Procurement i s applied, time taken for an average procurement exercise i s
        reduced by 25 Percent by the end o f the project.
        The number o f sole source contracts in public procurement i s reduced by 25 Percent b y
        the end o f the project.
        Audit standards on 10 subject areas, one o f which should be ethical standards, are
        developed and approved by the Chairman o f the COC and effectively applied, as verified
        by independent local audit experts.
        Level o f satisfaction o f the Business Community with the appropriateness and timeliness
        o f certification and standardization services i s increased by 50 Percent over project
        duration as measured by surveys;
        Improved citizens' perception on local government management capacity, as well as on
        the quantity and quality o f public services locally delivered, in the pilot Communities and
        ICUs as compared to the pre-project situation.

Baseline indicators w i l l be defined as a result o f the baseline household and officials survey to be
conducted at the start o f the project, or the prevailing situation at the start o f the activities under
the project component concerned w i l l be taken as the baseline value.

3. Project components

The project will consist o f six components, which in combination will fund key innovations in
horizontal management processes and capacity building in specific institutions in the Armenian
Public Administration. The ministry and agency-specific interventions a i m to have a
demonstrative effect and are expected to generate further reforms in other ministries.

The components related t o horizontal management processes focus on Civil Service
Management, Procurement, Financial Oversight, Policy Management and local level policy
implementation. Ministry and Agency specific components focus on the Office o f the
Government, the Ministry of Finance and Economy, the Ministry o f Economic Development and
Trade and four selected agencies working in the area o f standardization, certification and
metrology. The selection o f Ministries and Agencies favored those agencies that fulfill key
functions in defining the business and investment climate.

      Component 1: Strengthening Civil Service Management (US$2.62 Million, IDA
                            contribution US$2.52 Million)

The activities under Component 1 w i l l support the development o f a merit-based c i v i l service
system. The main emphasis i s o n the development o f systems and capacities to ensure a
consistent application of merit-based recruitment and promotion processes across all institutions
under the C i v i l Service Law.




                                                    5
Activities under Subcomponent 1A w i l l support the drafting o f a Civil Service Development
Strategy and the completion o f remaining elements o f the Regulatory Framework for Civil
Service Management. The activities under Subcomponent 1B aim to strengthen the Civil Service
Council, which oversees the recruitment process for senior positions in the state administration,
coordinates the implementation of the Civil Service Law and manages the overall civil service
system. The Council i s a new institution, and has extensive capacity building needs. In order to
meet these needs, the project w i l l support activities to improve the testing and attestation
instruments to further the introduction of merit based recruitment and promotion practices; equip
the Council's offices to better carry out the Council's core functions; assist the Council to
develop and implement a Civil Service Training Strategy and help develop a Communications
and Public Relations Strategy and establish a Public Information Center.

Subcomponent I C w i l l support the introduction o f cross-ministerial systems for Human
Resource Management and AssessmentjAttestation. The introduction of government-wide IT
systems for Human Resource Management and Assessment and Attestation w i l l enable the CSC
to monitor the consistent application o f merit based procedures and develop a pro-active career
management policy that would reward professional excellence through accelerated career
growth.

                          D
Finally, Subcomponent 1 w i l l assist the Government in improving the quality of the training
programs o f the Academy of Public Administration (AAPA), as the main provider of Civil
Service Training. Targeted and integrated training, at the central as well as regional levels, i s a
pressing need of the Armenian civil service. Whereas the previous subcomponents w i l l support
the implementation of a merit-based recruitment and promotion process, the activities under this
subcomponent w i l l enhance the professional development opportunities of civil servants. I t w i l l
do this by strengthening the Academy's ability to develop and implement training programs, b y
upgrading the Academy's training facilities in Yerevan and equipping the to-be-created regional
branches in Vanadzor and Goris.

  Project Component 2: Introducing E-Procurement (US$0.92 million, I D A contribution
                                  US$0.62 million)

Component 2 w i l l help address some o f the systemic weaknesses in the procurement system
identified in the CPAR (May 2003), in particular the prevalence o f non-competitive practices and
over-reliance on single source methods. T o this end, the component w i l l support the
establishment o f information technology infrastructure for e-Procurement and establish the basis
for the development of a full-fledged e-Procurement System.

Subcomponent 2 A w i l l assist the Government in creating the material base for the development
of the e-procurement system that would include the Central Authorized Body, the State
Procurement Agency as well as sixty state agencies, forty-four local Treasury units and the
information centers in ten Marz administrations and Yerevan region.

Subcomponent 2B w i l l finance the acquisition, adaptation, installation, configuration' and testing
of e-Procurement application software, including (i) automated internal procurement
                                                     an
administration system, covering planning, budgeting and recording o f contract awards; (ii)     a



                                                  6
contract management system for the generation and management of contractual documentation
and the procurement process, and (iii) system-controlled requisitions, purchase orders, and
receipt and payment document, including e-catalogues for framework contracts. Finally,
Subcomponent 2B w i l l finance a public awarenesdoutreach program to maximize the awareness
and utilization of the e-Procurement System.

Parallel financing for this component i s earmarked at US$0.25 Million through USAID, which
w i l l be providing additional advisory services and training to set up the e-Procurement system in
the context o f the Commercial Law and Economic Regulation (CLERP) program.

   Project Component 3: Strengthening the Chamber of Control (US$0.74 million, I D A
                            contribution US$0.29 Million)

Component 3 w i l l provide limited and focused support to the Chamber of Control (COC), which
i s the supreme audit institution in Armenia. Key institutional development needs of the COC
include the development of audit standards and manuals, which would enhance i t s ability to
provide professional audit reports to the National Assembly. The project w i l l therefore assist the
COC in developing these auditing standards and the related manual, as well as support the
provision of related training. Limited support for the provision o f essential equipment i s also
foreseen.

Parallel financing up to the amount of US$0.43 million i s expected through GTZ, which w i l l
provide additional advisory services and training to the COC for the design and implementation
of audit standards.

    Project Component 4: Improving Policy Formulation and Implementation through
         Capacity Building (US$3.55 million, I D A contribution US$3.42 million)

Support provided under Component 4 w i l l assist the government in addressing weaknesses in the
policy formulation and implementation process in the central state administration, in particular
through the development o f electronic document management systems and systems for tracking
policy implementation. In addition the project w i l l pilot other public management innovations to
enhance transparency and accountability and address priority capacity building needs in selected
institutions (the Ministry o f Finance and Economy, the Ministry o f Economic Development and
Trade, and the Office o f the Government).

Subcomponent 4 A w i l l support the improvement o f policy process management in the core state
administration, in particular document flow. Based on a diagnostic study o f the policy process,
the project w i l l support the introduction o f an integrated document management system to
enhance the effectiveness o f policy development and implementation across the state
administration.

The activities under Subcomponent 4B w i l l enhance the capacity of the Ministry o f Finance and
Economy in the areas o f revenue policy, internal audit, and the Budget and Financial
Management Training Center. While the structure o f the Ministry of Finance and Economy has
recently been redefined, a number o f structural issues remain, including the clarification o f the



                                                  7
division o f labor between the Ministry and the Tax and Customs Services and weaknesses in
cross-ministerial management o f the budget process. A further key issue i s the rationalization of
the internal audit and financial control functions of the Ministry to introduce appropriate
international standards and international best practice, and the development of effective linkages
between the Supervision Service o f the Ministry and other key institutions involved in financial
control and policy evaluation, such as the Supervision Services o f the President's
Administration, the Office o f the Government and the Chamber o f Control. Activities under the
project w i l l include the provision o f training to strengthen policy development in the area o f
revenue policy, including coordination systems with the Tax and Customs Services;
strengthening the Ministry's internal audit mechanisms through training and upgrading
equipment; providing equipment to effectively link the Supervision Service of the Ministry o f
Finance, the Supervision Service of the President's Administration and the Supervision Service
of the Office of the Government, and enhancing the capacity o f the Budget and Financial
Management Training Center to effectively train staff members o f budget departments across the
public sector.

Subcomponent 4C w i l l support the Ministry of Economic Development and Trade (MEDT) to
enhance i t s capacities in the areas of regulatory policy-making and external communications.
The MEDT underwent a comprehensive restructuring process. The size and functions of the core
ministry were reduced and specialized agencies were created to manage policy implementation.
However, a substantial capacity-building agenda remains, in particular in the areas of
standardization, certification and metrology (WTO). The activities under this subcomponent
strengthen policy-making capacity in the area of standardization and certification; and strengthen
the Ministry's capacity to communicate and coordinate with external interlocutors, domestic and
international, public and non-governmental.

The Office of the Government was re-organized under the DFID-funded functional review. As a
result, the Office i s better positioned to focus on i t s core task, namely to support the Prime
Minister and the Government in the management of the government decision-making process.
Notwithstanding the improved focus, a substantial institutional development agenda remains for
the Office. Building capacity for effective communication o f the Government's program i s a key
priority for the Office and Subcomponent 4D w i l l therefore focus on strengthening i t s capacity in
external communications and outreach.

In the context of W T O accession, the administration of standardization, metrological and
certification functions takes on special significance for the Government. The Government plans
to enhance the legislative and institutional framework in this area as well as to invest in the
institutional development o f key agencies. Subcomponent 4E w i l l therefore help improve the
regulatory framework and related technical standards; improve access to international technical
standards and standards procedures; and address essential hardware needs through the provision
o f equipment for testing laboratories.




                                                  8
Project Component 5: Developing Capacity in Local Governments (US$2.85 million, IDA
                           contribution US$2.76 million)

The project activities under component 5 aim to improve local self-government capacity to
deliver public services, which i s one o f the main priorities of the Armenian government in the
context o f the PRSP implementation. The project w i l l help address four related issues: i t w i l l
mitigate the consequences of administrative fragmentation; enhance revenue mobilization
capacity at the local level mainly b y building the professional capacity of local staff and create a
data management system to support an effective delivery of municipal services.

Subcomponent 5A w i l l support the development o f the legal and policy framework for Inter-
community Unions to mitigate the impact o f administrative fragmentation. The Law on Local
Self-government, adopted in 2002, assigns significant responsibilities to the local governments.
However, the implementation of the Law has been difficult since local capacities to provide
quality public services to the citizens are uneven and, mostly, limited. The Government sees the
voluntary formation of Inter-Community Unions as the best way to circumvent the hurdles of
administrative fragmentation represented b y the Communities' weak capacity and resource base.

The development of capacities to effectively raise revenues at the local level i s a key government
priority to improve local governance. The Law on Local Self-government has also assigned local
governments with additional revenue raising powers, including the right to collect property and
land taxes. The local collection of property and land tax i s a major challenge, in particular in
rural areas. Subcomponent 5B w i l l finance international and local technical assistance and
trainers to advise the Ministry of Territorial Administration and Infrastructure Coordination on
building local capacity to properly implement local tax administration.

The development o f a professional cadre of local government officials i s a necessary condition
for enhancing the quality of service delivery at the local level. The draft Law on Municipal Civil
Service aims to create more attractive employment conditions and introduce career development
based on merit principles for local government staff. The Law, once adopted, w i l l require
significant implementation support. Subcomponent 5C w i l l help design and implement a human
resource management system for the municipal civil service to facilitate the introduction o f the
new system.

Subcomponent 5D focuses on strengthening municipal data management to improve local
governance. This w i l l be carried out through the development and deployment of an integrated,
computer-based Management Information System, and by the strengthening of the national
center for technical support and systems development in Charenstsevan.


    Project Component 6 Project Management, Surveys and Communication (US$0.59
                      million, IDA contribution US$0.54 million)

Components 1-5 above represent a set of complementary but distinct public sector management
reform initiatives. Each needs to be managed as a specific undertaking. Yet, each must be
orchestrated in the overall country context and within unified project governance and




                                                   9
administrative arrangements. Monitoring of the overall project outcomes and impact i s essential
to proper management of the Project. In order to achieve this, Component 6 w i l l support project
management and surveys and outreach.

Project Management arrangements are detailed in Annex 6. The funds provided under
Subcomponent 6 A w i l l provide funding for the Project Manager and essential support staff, as
well as for incremental costs incurred b y the Foreign Financial Projects Management Center
(FFPMC) of the Ministry of Finance, which w i l l perform the project's financial management and
procurement functions.

Subcomponent 6B w i l l finance periodic surveys of households, firms, NGOs and public officials
to collect data on key performance indicators and obtain stakeholders' feedback on the reform
process. I t w i l l also finance a communication campaign to explain project objectives and
activities to managers, staff and other stakeholders. This w i l l be important to build and maintain
support and ownership for the reforms.

4. Lessons learned and reflected in the project design

The proposed project design has drawn upon the lessons learned from previous projects, as set
out in OED and Q A G evaluation documents. Some important lessons incorporated into the
project design are the following:

   0   To build political commitment and ownership for reform, i t i s essential that project
       activities correspond to the strategic priorities of the country and the government. For this
       reason, the project has been designed to support the goals articulated in the Government's
       reform program (including the PRSP);
   0   I t i s important to understand the specific context of the country in designing reform
       activities because a one-size-fits-all approach does not work. For this purpose extensive
       diagnostic studies and surveys have been undertaken and the findings have been used to
       identify project activities;
   0   Projects providing technical assistance and investments in capacity building often require
       policy reforms in order to make these interventions successful. Therefore, i t i s necessary
       to link such projects to policy conditionality in adjustment operations. The project w i l l
       therefore be linked to the PRSC, which i s currently under development;
   e   Donor coordination i s essential to ensure that reforms pursued by different development
       agencies are mutually complementary. For this purpose, extensive discussions have been
       held with other donor agencies and project activities have been chosen after taking into
       account their ongoing and planned initiatives, and where possible an integrated approach
       to the delivery of TA has been agreed.

5. Alternatives considered and reasons for rejection

Initially a sector-specific Adjustment Credit was considered the most appropriate instrument to
support the reforms o f the public sector. However, considering that SAC V would provide
support for policy reforms in different public sector management areas, including the civil
service, public procurement, external and internal audit and anti-corruption, i t was decided to



                                                 10
design this project as a complementary investment credit that would provide targeted
institutional development assistance to the relevant public entities over a sustained period of
time.

The possibility o f designing the PSMP as an Adaptable Program Loan (APL) instrument, instead
of a Specific Investment Loan (SIL) was also considered. However, in view of the nature o f the
project, which does not required phased implementation, i t was decided that a S I L was a more
appropriate instrument

C. IMPLEMENTATION

1. Partnership arrangements

Several initiatives supported by other donors or non-governmental organizations directly
contribute to achieving key project objectives, in particular GTZ funded activities in the area o f
External Audit and U SAID funded activities in e-Procurement. These initiatives are reflected in
the project financing tables as parallel contributions. Other relevant donor support related to
project components i s documented in Annex 2.

2. Institutionaland implementation arrangements

2.1 Executing agencies:

The Public Sector Reform Commission w i l l serve as the Project Management Board. Together
with selected pilot ministries and agencies, i t w i l l be the responsible agency for implementation
of project activities.

2.2 Project management:

Project management w i l l be the responsibility of a Project Manager who w i l l report to the inter-
ministerial Public Sector Reform Commission. The Project Manager w i l l be supported b y an IT
expert and a lawyer. The Project Manager and her/his team w i l l oversee project implementation,
provide advice and support to the agencies participating in the project and report to the Public
Sector Reform Commission on project implementation. The implementation of the different
project components i s the responsibility of the different government agencies involved in the
project. Each agency w i l l create an internal working-group that w i l l coordinate the
implementation of i t s project activities. Financial management and procurement for the project
w i l l be carried out b y the FFPMC at the Ministry of Finance and Economy.

3. Monitoringand evaluation of outcomeshesults

The project provides for special mechanisms to be put in place to monitor and evaluate progress
in implementingand operating the project. The principal mechanisms during project
implementation w i l l be: (i)
                             annual household surveys and surveys o f officials to track impact o f
the project; and (ii)quarterly reports from the Project Manager on progress or impediments in
implementing the various elements of the project. Progress w i l l also be measured against



                                                  11
indicators established as a result of baseline surveys. The Project Manager w i l l closely
collaborate with the Public Sector Reform Commission, the implementing body o f the project,
which w i l l provide input into the quarterly reports on project activities.

4. Sustainability

The critical factors for the sustainability o f the project include: continuing demand pressures for
improvements in governance and quality of public services; sustained commitment o f the
Government at the political, managerial and technical levels to project objectives and activities;
observance of the institutional rules promoted by the project; regular updating o f information
systems as designed in the project; and ability of the public sector to attract and retain skilled
staff.

D. APPRAISAL SUMMARY

     .
    1 Economic and financial analyses

The project introduces a number of IT-based innovations that have the potential to significantly
enhance the efficiency o f the use o f public resources in Armenia. However, the introduction o f
I T systems also has financial implications. IT systems are introduced in a selected set of
institutions. The expansion o f these systems to all government institutions w i l l have budgetary
implications. This applies in particular to the e-Procurement system and, to a lesser degree, to the
electronic document management system under Component 4. However, since the design and
licensing cost are covered by the project, the extension of the new systems w i l l come at marginal
cost. The replacement and maintenance cost of the new systems w i l l have to be funded b y the




                                                              13
government's budget as w i l l the associated telecommunications cost. Maintenance and software
licensing cost are estimated at approximately 5 % o f the total investment. However, these costs
w i l l be offset at least in part by efficiency gains in procurement and a more efficient, better-
informed policy development process.

The rationalization of the civil service system should also bring some resource savings and
contribute to improvements in the efficiency and effectiveness o f public administration.
However, the problem of attracting and retaining good quality civil servants under the present
salary structures w i l l remain. Resolution of this problem would, of course, have a significant
budget impact. Armenia has opted for a gradual increase in civil service wages to mitigate the
immediate impact of wage increases on the budget. According to the PRSP the government
intends to gradually increase the salaries o f public servants, from 1.00 percent of GDP in 2003 to
 1.81 percent in 2009 and to 2.71 percent in 2015. The Project would support further
rationalization and optimization of the whole public service system, which would allow more
savings o f public resources, which can be used for introducing additional salary increases. The
Civil Service Development strategy to be designed under this project i s expected to address these
important long-term issues.

2. Technical

A significant amount o f analytical and diagnostic work has been carried out during the
preparation stage. There i s a strong emphasis on the introduction of modern information
technologies and e-Government tools, which would significantly improve the effectiveness and
transparency o f the project entities. The project team has taken into account the country's
readiness for introduction of these types o f new systems in the Government.

3. Fiduciary

3.1 Procurement issues:

The capacity o f the FFPMC has been assessed and the project was given an overall medium risk
rating. Details of the assessment and an agreed plan of actions and findings are included in
Annex 8.

3.2 Financial management issues:

As o f December 2003 FFPMC has acceptable financial management arrangements in place to
meet the current Bank requirements in respect o f the quality of accounting, reporting and internal
controls system and also in respect o f the audit arrangements, and i s ready to start project
implementation. A detailed Financial Management Assessment i s included in Annex 7.

4. Social

The project component on strengthening local governments focuses on improving capacities for
public service delivery, in particular in disadvantaged rural communities. The project aims to
contribute to the improvement of small rural municipalities to deliver services by supporting




                                                 14
institutionalized mechanisms for joint service delivery b y small municipalities through the
creation of Inter-Community Unions. Through this component the project therefore seeks to
contribute to the reduction of the developmental disparities between rural communities and cities
in Armenia. The project would also contribute to strengthening these rural communities to
realize various social programs.

The project w i l l fund regular household and stakeholder surveys to monitor the impact of the
project in terms of transparency and accountability of government institutions and the quality of
service delivery.

5. Environment

The project focuses on institutional reforms in public administration and reform o f the civil
service. I t has no direct environmental impact and the project does not include any major
physical rehabilitation or civil works. The project i s therefore rated as `C'. The minor
refurbishments o f office space required for the installation of equipment that are foreseen under
the project w i l l be executed in line with prevailing national legislation and all bidding documents
w i l l make reference to the need to carry out any works in line with prevailing environmental
standards and safety regulations.

I.Country Background

The Armenian economy has faced significant shocks in the recent past, including the 1988
earthquake; the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict; the 1998 Russia financial crisis; the severe drought
in 2000 and the harsh frost in Spring 2002. Furthermore, the 1999 assassination of the Prime
Minister, some key government officials and members of Parliament posed a severe political
shock. Notwithstanding these events, the economy has been remarkably resilient, as can be seen
from the key macro-economic indicators in Table 1below.

Since 1994, the Government has been carrying out a comprehensive reform program, aimed at
establishing a liberal economic regime, improving the business environment and building
capacity for export and investment promotion. The reform effort has been supported by
generous official development assistance that, in the late 1990s, amounted to around 10 percent
of GDP annually. Sustained output growth, accompanied by low inflation, has positively
impacted poverty indicators. The share of the population living in poverty declined from 55
percent in 1998/99 to 48 percent in 2001. During the same period, the proportion o f the
population in extreme poverty declined from 27 to 18 percent.

Despite considerable progress, the sustainability of broad-based economic growth i s one of the
key challenges. Growth, especially from 1995-99, has been concentrated mainly in sectors with
limited employment opportunities. Since then, the entrepreneurial climate has improved resulting
in a better functioning of the real sector. More than 70 percent o f GDP was generated by the
private sector. Economic growth accelerated from 6 percent in 2000 to 9.6 percent in 2001, 12.9
percent in 2002 and 13.9 percent in 2003. During the past two years economic growth was driven
by a high rate of export expansion. Manufacturing exports grew by more than 50 percent in two
years, with a positive impact on employment and household incomes. The cross-sectoral analysis
o f real GDP growth clearly indicates that since 1994 construction and trade drove economic
growth. While the donors and the Armenian Diaspora financed much of the construction through
grants, investment in tradable goods and exports have increasingly contributed to growth in
recent years. Investment and net exports accounted for 1.7 percent and 4 percent o f growth
during 200 1-2002.

Public Sector Management

According to the Constitution (1995) the Republic o f Armenia i s a democratic, sovereign State
headed by a directly elected President, who i s also the head o f the Executive Branch. The
Government i s comprised of the Prime Minister and sixteen Ministers. The policies of the
Government in 10 regions (Murzes) and in the city of Yerevan are implemented through
appointed Regional Governors or Marpets (Mayor of Yerevan). The country i s divided into 930
urban and rural communities, which are led b y directly elected Heads o f Communities. The
legislative branch consists of a unicameral National Assembly, with 13 1 members elected for 4
years. The Constitutional Court, the Court of Cassation, Courts of Appeals, and First Instance
Courts constitute the Judiciary.

A number of diagnostic studies, including a Civil Service Assessment (1998), an Institutional
and Governance Review (2000), a FIAS study on Administrative Barriers to Investment (2000),
and a study aimed at developing an Anti-Corruption Strategy, have been carried out to analyze
the weaknesses in public sector performance. In addition, a Public Expenditure Review (PER)
and a Country Procurement Assessment Report (CPAR) have recently been completed. A
Country Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA) i s under preparation and w i l l be finalized
by the end of M a y 2004. Some o f the main areas o f deficiency emerging from the diagnoses are
discussed below.

Comprehensive surveys of households and f i r m s were commissioned in late 2001. These are the
latest available survey reports, which provide useful data about the public's perception on quality
and accessibility of various public services and indicate consequences o f government
ineffectiveness (Report o f The Sociological Survey on Public Sector Reforms (For Households) -
2001; and Report of the Sociological Survey on Public Sector Reforms (For Enterprises) - 2001,
the Armenia Democratic Forum). The Business Environment and Enterprise Performance Survey
(BEEPS) carried out in 2002 also provides valuable insights.

The surveys referred to above show that even though public sector performance i s not altogether
disheartening, there continue to be serious problems. The poverty reduction agenda faced b y
Armenia imposes a heavy responsibility on the Government to develop workable, pro-poor




                                                17
policies, mobilize resources, and implement policies effectively to achieve the targeted
outcomes. Further, to achieve sustainable growth, the public sector needs to facilitate private
sector activities and minimize the difficulties i t s own activities create for businesses.

The following sections review key issues to be addressed in the structure of government and in
individual government institutions if the government i s to be able to effectively deal with the
above tasks. These include weaknesses in the policy formulation and implementation process,
public financial management and the accountability system.

(a)     Structure o f Government:

The structure o f the Armenian public administration suffered from many o f the problems that
have affected all states in the former Soviet Union; institutional fragmentation, duplication of
functions and a highly centralized system of control and supervision.

The first phase o f institutional reform in Armenia therefore aimed to rationalize the structure of
the central public administration, and included the conduct of finctional reviews of all executive
bodies at the central level, supported by DFID. Based on these reviews, conducted in 2000-2002,
new charters and organizational structures o f most ministries and agencies have been approved
and implemented. Furthermore a large number of agencies were moved from direct
subordination to the government to subordination under ministries, which clarified accountability
lines and strengthened oversight over these agencies. The first phase o f the restructuring process
can therefore be considered completed even though i t i s too early yet to assess the extent to
which the implemented reforms have enhanced the quality of governance.

Despite the above efforts to rationalize the organization o f the public administration, there i s s t i l l
a certain degree of overlap and duplication of functions between the Office of the Government
and sector ministries, and between and within ministries and agencies. This leads to operational
inefficiencies, weak accountability for results, coordination problems and sub-optimal use of
resources, Most public entities lack clearly articulated mission and strategic objectives. Often,
their organizational structures, core functions and regulations are changed in an ad hoc manner,
creating considerable confusion and inefficiency. Subordinate structures do not have approved
charters or effective monitoring and performance evaluation systems. The division of
responsibilities between the Central government and the regional and local administrations i s
also unclear. The next stage o f institutional reform i s expected to address these deficiencies.

(b)     Policy formulation, monitoring and evaluation:

The capacity of ministries to formulate sector policies and of the Office o f the Government to
harmonize and integrate these policies into policies of the government as a whole i s highly
constrained. A number of factors are responsible for this weakness. Mainly, line ministries lack
the capacity to formulate effective policies and serious problems remain with the timely and
effective implementation o f adopted policies and legislation. Cross-ministerial coordination
systems are not functioning adequately, leading to blockages in the decision-making system.
Furthermore, business processes, such as procurement, are s t i l l viewed as inefficient and lacking




                                                     18
transparency. This negatively affects the perceived predictability and reliability of government
institutions

Systems for monitoring implementation of policies by subordinate agencies and evaluating
policy impacts are s t i l l inadequate. Therefore, policies are often either not carried out effectively
or are implemented in an arbitrary and inconsistent manner that reduces their credibility and
creates opportunities for corruption. The absence of regular evaluation makes i t difficult to
improve or amend policies that are not delivering the desired results.

(c)     Civil Service:

Armenia inherited the nomenklatura system, where the distinction between political and
administrative roles of c i v i l servants was blurred. The terms `Civil Service' or `Civil Servant'
refer to permanent public employees, exercising state authority as managers and staff in
Ministries, State Agencies, State Committees, State Commissions, Regional Administrations.
However, the distinction between this category and political appointees, holders of discretionary
positions, support staff, teachers, healthcare workers, uniformed services, workers in State-
Owned Enterprises and the l i k e was not clear. The system was non-transparent, discretionary,
and open to abuses. The lack o f a proper regulatory framework for the c i v i l service, until
recently, encouraged patronage, instability and corruption. As a result, the c i v i l service suffers
from an absence of emphasis on merit in recruitment and promotion; lack o f objective and
effective performance evaluation systems; low pay; inadequate skills; low morale; high turnover;
inadequate disciplinary mechanisms; and ineffective institutional arrangements for personnel
management.
A L a w on the C i v i l Service was enacted in December 2001. Similar laws have also been passed
for the Diplomatic Service, the Tax Service, the Customs Service and the Police Service. A C i v i l
Service Council (CSC) has been established to implement the Civil Service L a w and oversee
c i v i l service management in line agencies. In addition, the L a w on Remuneration of Civil
Servants was passed in July 2002. The implementation of the new institutional framework has
just begun and needs considerable support.
One particular issue that needs to be addressed urgently i s the development of cross-
governmental processes and capacities to effectively manage the c i v i l service. This includes the
improvement of capacities in personnel management units in a l l core government institutions and
the development of an effective network between these units. Without effective horizontal
management structures the development of an integrated c i v i l service system will remain a
highly complicated task. A further issue that needs urgent attention i s the improvement o f the
professional development system for c i v i l servants, and the development of a link between
professional development and career advancement.
Personnel management reforms in other areas of the public service (health, education, social
welfare) are addressed through relevant sector legislation, implemented by the relevant
govemment ministries. The status of local government staff i s regulated through a new L a w on
Municipal (civil) Service, which i s in the process of being finalized.

(d)    Public Expenditure Management:

Reforms in public expenditure management have been undertaken since 1997. These have
resulted in changes in the promulgation of new budget legislation, improved presentation and
coverage of the budget broadly in line with GFS 1986, the introduction of the Treasury system,
separation of the budget preparation function from i t s execution and reporting. Improvements in
budget management, accounting and financial management systems were supported b y SAC-111.
Technical assistance for improving budget formulation has been provided b y U SAID and DFID.
The I F and an IDF grant have provided TA for strengthening budget execution. However,
     M
Progress has, however, been uneven. While there has been substantial progress in developing
the Treasury system (establishment of Central Treasury with local offices, a functional double
entry Treasury General Ledger and a Treasury Single Account, which serves both the central and
local government's budget institutions as well as extra-budgetary funds), problems persist in
accelerating the reform process and carrying forward the reforms

In relation to the budget formulation process, the Medium-Term Expenditure Framework
(MTEF) has become the basis for expenditure planning, and the Government w i l l derive more
benefits from this process as i t i s used to strengthen the link between budgetary allocations and
policies. Similarly, the budget process w i l l benefit from more direct involvement of the sector
ministries in the development of sector strategies. Although the coverage of the budget has been
widened in recent years, the budget s t i l l does not cover many externally-financed grants and
extra-budgetary funds.

In the area of budget execution, commitment controls b y budget entities are not made, which
leads to the accumulation o f budget arrears. There are delays in information flows to the Central
Treasury due to the paper-based systems used for recording, accounting and reporting. There i s a
lack of proper reporting b y State Non-Commercial Organizations (NCO) on the utilization of
budget resources. The internal audit o f budgetary transactions i s confused and weak. Therefore,
there i s a need to accelerate the reform process and to implement accounting standards in the
public sector, to transit from the existing budget classification to the new one based on GFS 2001
(for cash budgeting), to develop the principles o f GFS 2001-compliant new chart o f accounts, to
ensure that institutional arrangements for establishing a well functioning internal audit are in
place, and to establish a financial reporting and monitoring framework for NCOs. The
Government currently implements an Action Plan, agreed under SAC V, to deal with many of
the continuing problems. In particular, as part o f the Action Plan the Government initiated and
amended the Organic Budget Law to make the MTEF process an initial, integral part of the
budget cycle, and approved the MTEF for 2004-2006 with the comprehensive coverage o f all
sectors. In addition, the Government has improved the budget reporting system for the NCOs,
developed a database for inventory registry for the budgetary organizations, improved the
classification of multi-sector donor programs in the state budget, introduced an output/outcome
based program classification and piloted i t for social sectors within the framework o f 2004 State
budget.




                                                20
(e)     Public Procurement:

A new Law on Procurement was adopted in 2000, setting up the framework for the regulation o f
public procurement in Armenia. A range of new procedural measures were approved by the
Government in 2001. The system that has been set up as a result i s comprehensive. However,
unlike other procurement systems in the region, i t i s heavily centralized in the sense that all
procurement above the relevant thresholds i s coordinated through the State Procurement Agency
(SPA). Besides centralizing procurement, the new Law on Procurement also lays emphasis on
the consolidation o f the procurement needs of various purchasing entities, with a view to
benefiting from likely economies of scale. The e-Procurement system, which i s to be introduced
with the support o f the PSMP and USAID, aims to enhance transparency in the public
procurement system. Whereas the centralization of the procurement system has clear benefits in
terms of the rationalization o f the process, i t also entails risks o f reduced transparency and
capture. The e-Procurement system w i l l increase access to information for all potential bidders,
and stimulate competition between potential bidders and therefore mitigate some of the risks of
posed by the centralization o f the process.

(f)    Business Regulation:

In order to spur growth, Armenia needs to attract investment into the productive sectors. FDI
inflows into Armenia have been improving gradually, but s t i l l remain low. FDI per capita in
1994-2002, according to the National Statistical Service, was nearly US$27 per capita, and for
the period o f 2000-2002 i t was almost US$32. This i s partly attributable to continuing
improvements in the public sector's business regulation activities. In the recent past, the
Government has taken several measures to reduce the burden imposed b y these activities. Policy
reforms, supported by SAC-IV and aimed at improving the legal and regulatory framework,
business registration and licensing have been implemented with some positive results. However,
in most o f the regulatory processes, f i r m s either need to resort to paying bribes or using informal
channels either to speed up bureaucratic processes or to protect themselves from abuse of office
by officials. Laws and regulations change frequently, without consultation with the private
sector, leading to uncertainty and high compliance costs.

During 2003, under a SAC V supported action plan, the Government made significant progress
in improving the business and investment environment through (i)      improvement in the
functioning of the High Business Council; (ii)  establishment o f a movable property registry and
improvement of registration o f movable properties; and (iii) simplification o f authorization
procedures and reduction o f the required documents for exporters; etc. In addition, recent
surveys of the Armenian entrepreneurs during 2002 and 2003, suggest that these efforts have
already resulted in a more positive private sector perception o f the business and investment
environment. For instance, the average time necessary to get construction and building
renovation permits was reduced from 310 days in 2001 to 76 days by November 1,2003. The
number of goods subject to mandatory certification at the border was reduced from 80 in 2001 to
60 b y November 1,2003. The number o f registered joint ventures increased by 25 percent from
January 1,2002 to November 1,2003, and the FDI (outside the energy sector) increased by 44
percent in the first nine months o f 2003 compared with a similar period in 2002.




                                                  21
While the Government has recently harmonized product standardization and certification
procedures with GATT and WTO requirements, too narrow an interpretation o f the laws by
standardization officials impedes trade flows. In addition, businesses also have significant
problems with tax and customs administration and the judiciary.

(g)     Tax and Customs Administration:

The aggregate level o f tax and customs revenues and social security (pension) contributions as a
percentage o f the nominal gross domestic product in Armenia rose substantially to the level of
 16.2 % o f GDP, in 2002, compared to 13.5 Percent in 1996. This was achieved through
improved tax and customs administration, simplification of the tax structure and broadening of
the tax base. Yet, the level of tax collection remains among the lowest in transition economies.
This i s partly due to the fact that a large proportion of construction i s financed by grants and i s
not taxed. However, Armenia faces a major challenge in increasing revenue collections since i t s
poor performance represents the weakest element of the Armenian macroeconomic and fiscal
framework. While the structure of the tax system and the prevailing tax rates and tax legislation
are generally in line with international practice (with the exception of high rates of payroll taxes),
serious problems in customs and tax administration persist.

The major institutional and organizational deficiencies include complex procedures; too much
official discretion; perverse incentives encouraging tax officials to levy penalties; excessive, but
ineffectual, inspections and audits due to a lack o f a risk-based enforcement strategy; inadequate
computer systems and information sharing between tax and customs and other government
bodies; lack of staff training; ineffective appellate procedures; and absence o f client-orientation.
Efforts to improve tax and customs administration have been supported b y the Association's
SAC-IV as well as b y the IMF and USAID. SAC V i s supporting the implementation of an
Action Plan to further improve tax and customs policy and administration. Within that Action
Plan the Government has made progress in improving administration of personal income and
payroll taxes; made legislative amendments to move towards market valuation of properties;
strengthened the operation of the Internal Audit Units in the State Tax Service, as well as
strengthenedthe legislation for criminal responsibility for tax evasion. The Government has also
developed websites for both tax and customs administrations, broadened the Customs
Committee's Advisory Board of business representatives, as well as reduced the required
documentation for export and simplified procedures, which are important steps towards overall
improvement in functioning of tax and customs administration.

(h)     Judiciary:

The key institutional and legal framework of the court system in Armenia has only been
established in 1998-99. The Economic Court, as a specialized first instance and appeals court for
hearing only economic cases, has an even shorter history. The Council of Court Chairman
(CCC), consisting of all the chairmen o f the courts, i s the consultative body for the judiciary. I t i s
mainly responsible for overall judicial governance, court administration, budgeting, training and
development of ethical standards for the judges.




                                                   22
A significant amount of work has been undertaken over the past few years to improve the overall
functioning of the court system. However, the judiciary i s not yet fully and effectively
undertaking the genuine roles and functions that w i l l contribute to the overall reform and
development processes in Armenia. Issues related to significant indirect influence o f the
executive, budgetary and financial independence, low transparency and accountability, and
corruption, are s t i l l major problems for the system that need to be addressed.

Since 2001, the Government, with the support o f a World Bank project, has launched a reform
program which i s aimed at strengthening judicial governance, reforming case management and
court administration systems, improving legal information, strengthening the bailiffs' department
and establishing effective training mechanisms. In addition, the credit supports the rehabilitation
and refurbishment of some court houses. The Government i s currently reconsidering some of the
elements o f the reform program, particularly in the areas o f judicial training and governance.
These changes, if implemented, could remove the existing legal and institutional problems
constraining further improvement of the judicial system

(i)    Accountability Systems:

Constitutional Checks and Balances: Although the Constitution establishes a system o f
separation of powers between the three organs of the State, the balance of power i s heavily tilted
in favor o f the President.

Chamber of Control: The Chamber o f Control (COC) i s the main instrument o f the National
Assembly in overseeing the execution of the national budget as well as the use o f foreign loans
and grants. The Chairman and members o f the COC are appointed and dismissed by the National
Assembly. The transparency o f the appointment and dismissal process needs improvement. The
focus o f the Chamber o f Control i s on financial accountability (which i s necessary given that
internal control systems are not fully effective), however this means that the Chamber does not
enforce accountability for value for money or for performance. In any event, the COC suffers
from deficiencies in organizational capacity, audit methodologies and financial and human
resources. While the reports o f the COC are placed before Parliament, in many cases discussion
on them b y the Finance and Budget Committee i s very late or not at all.

Internal Control Systems: Beside the Chamber of Control there are three important control
agencies: the Supervision Service of the President (SSP), the Supervision Service o f the Prime
Minister (SSPM), the Supervision Service o f the Ministry of Finance and Economy (MOFE).
The SSP supervises the enforcement o f Presidential and Prime Ministerial decrees and laws by
the line agencies. The SSPM focuses on enforcement o f the decrees o f the PM. The control
agency of the MOFE looks into financial matters.

There i s considerable overlap and duplication between these control agencies and between them
and the Chamber of Control. At the same time, there i s little exchange o f information among
them and there i s no coordination of their activities and this leads to multiple and superfluous
checks. Sector ministries in the past had their own control agencies. Ministries have now been
prohibited by law to have such units, in order to reduce the number of controls and minimize the
scope for abuse of power. While the Ministries have now regained very small units for internal



                                                23
control, the result o f this policy has been that the internal audit function in line ministries and
agencies has become extremely weak. Thus, there i s no systematic effort to develop and maintain
effective internal control systems that would give assurance to ministers and agency managers
that the business o f their organizations i s being conducted in accordance with relevant laws and
rules and financial propriety i s being maintained.

Voice and Participation: Elections are regularly held and serve to enforce accountability over
the President and the Parliament. Although the country has a number o f NGOs, the ability of
civil society to enforce accountability on part o f the public sector i s quite restricted. This i s a
result o f the lack o f a tradition of regular consultation o f the civil society and the public by the
State, inadequate dissemination of information on the functioning of the public sector, and the
absence o f effective mechanisms to address public grievances. Many of the NGOs are heavily
dependent on Western donors and the diaspora, which also somewhat reduces their credibility.

(i)     Local Self-Government:

A new Law on Local Self Government was approved in May, 2002. I t provides the basis for
functioning of the local governments, which are led by directly elected Heads of Communities.
The tenure for the Heads o f the Communities i s three years. A three -year term also applies to
the members o f the Council of Elders who have some important overseeing and decision making
authority on key issues related to the community.

There are 930 communities in Armenia of which 48 are urban and the rest rural. Yerevan city
itself consists o f 12 communities, which are also the largest communities. However, small
villages in remote mountainous areas and big communities in Yerevan have the same legal
status; such a large number of communities with very diverse sizes and geographical locations
tends to hinder effective local government management. The new Law also delegates
responsibility for the collection o f property and land taxes to local government units. The income
from property and land tax remains with the local governments and i s expected to increase their
resource base. The Law also reassigns some other important functions from the central
government down to the local governments. However, the communities are currently struggling
to cope effectively with the newly delegated functions and responsibilities. This i s especially so
in the smaller communities which are required to deal with an increasing number o f functions
and responsibilities, but have not received appropriate increases in the level of resources needed
to deliver and meet those functions and responsibilities. The Law on Local Self Government
provides the possibility for the establishment of unions o f local communities that would allow
small villages to unite in solving of some of the key issues affecting their communities.

Heads o f the Communities have the authority to recruit and dismiss the staff o f the local
government offices. However, due to the absence o f legislation that regulates human resource
management at local level, this has led to an increase in levels o f politicization of local
government administration, and has created instability in local authorities. A new Law on
Municipal (Civil) Service i s currently being developed, with the aim to provide the legal
framework for the development of a professional cadre o f local government officials. The
implementation of the Municipal Service Law w i l l require significant support for capacity
building in personnel management at municipal level.

                      A R M E N I A : Public Sector Modernization Project

1. Description of ongoing donor support

DFID i s the main donor that has provided support to public administration reform in Armenia.
Over the past years, under i t s first Public Sector Reform Project, the DFID supported the
government to: (i)  carry out the first phase of functional and organizational reforms in the central
government; (ii)  develop the civil service law and regulations; and (iii) reform the financial
management system. DFID's second Public Sector Reform Program i s a three year project
launched in March 2003, with objectives: (i) rationalize organizational structures: central and
                                                to
regional; (ii) enhance accountability, independence and effectiveness o f civil service (short
              to
term assistance before the start of the PSMF'); ( i ) strengthen the linkages between the civil
                                                   i ito
society and the government (to ensure citizens access to information and to increase their
participation in policy debates); (iv) to improve capacity of GOA to co-ordinate the donor
support, through providing assistance to the Public Sector Reform Commission (PSRC). Based
on earlier agreements the primary beneficiary for the DFID's project are the Ministries of Health,
Labor and Social Affairs, and Education and Science. At this stage, the assistance program of
the DFID i s most advanced in the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs. The civil society
component of the project i s new and i t i s looking at the links between civil society and the
Government.

DFID' s other ongoing program, Regional Development, focuses on 149 local communities of
Gegharqunik and Tavush Marzes. The objective o f the program i s to increase the regional
administrations' capacity to develop and implement poverty reduction programs (Marz
Development Plans) and to influence national policy in the pilot regions. The program covers
S M E development, rural livelihood, community development and local social services (mainly
health and education).

DFID has been also providing technical assistance to the government to develop and implement
the Medium Term Expenditure Framework. The purpose i s to strengthen the strategic
capability of the Ministry o f Finance and Economy to plan and manage public expenditure. The
project also aims to improve the ability o f the Ministry o f Social Security to plan public
expenditure on the basis of policy priorities and cost benefits. The project started in April 2002
and w i l l be implemented over three years. DFID also contributes to the Social Investment
Fund project of the World Bank.

U S A I D has a broad program of assistance in Armenia, which also supports reforms in various
parts of the public sector. The Tax, Fiscal and Customs Reform Program i s a follow up
program for the previous Tax and Fiscal program. I t i s a three year program ending in September
2004, focusing on the following areas: Tax and Customs administration reforms; Tax policy and
Revenue analysis, Macroeconomic analysis and Budget reform in the Ministry of Finance and
Economy; Property Tax reform and Administrative Decentralization, as well as
Intergovernmental Finance reform.




                                                 25
USAID's Armenia Legislative Strengthening Program (ALSP) i s a two year project that has
been designed to provide technical assistance to the National Assembly o f RA, in the areas of
legislative process, constituency relations, and public outreach. The ALSP w i l l contribute to
U SAID'S Strategic Objective o f creating a more transparent, accountable, and responsive system
o f governance in Armenia b y providing assistance for a more responsive and effective
parliament.

Another U S A I D program (Commercial L a w and Economic Regulation-CLEW) i s designed
for 3-5 years. The program has started on November 1,2003, and i t s objective i s to promote the
development o f commercial law and to facilitate the reform process o f Armenia's legal,
regulatory, and administrative entities. This program i s intended to provide technical assistance
to the Republic o f Armenia in the areas o f commercial law (Bankruptcy, Collateral, Public
Procurement, Company, Public Auction, Registration o f Legal Entities and Licensing laws),
trade policies (WTO post accession obligations), and economic regulation (Competition and
Telecommunication areas). CLERP w i l l provide technical assistance, training, and limited
hardware to selected counterparts, including the Ministry of Finance and Economy (MFE), the
Ministry of Justice (MOJ), the Ministry o f Trade and Economic Development (MTED), the State
Procurement Agency (SPA), the Economic Courts, the State Commission on the Protection of
Economic Competition (SCPEC), and the Multi-Utility Regulator (MUR).

There was a specific reference in the RFP for the CLERP program to assist the development o f
an e-procurement system.

The Local Government Program implemented b y the Urban Institute i s another USAID
                                                             1
funded program, which entered into i t s second phase, LGP 1 , to support the reforms in the local
self-government during the period o f 2003-2005. The Armenia Local Government Program
Phase Two i s designed to meet U SAID'Sstrategic objective of "More Transparent, Accountable
and Responsive Democratic Governance". LGP-I1 w i l l support twelve pilot urban communities
to increase the capacity o f these local governments. The Phase I1program w i l l cover several
topics of municipal capacity building in much more detail than Phase I  covered. The program has
five main components: (i)    Municipal Management Systems; (ii)  Citizen Participation; (iii)
Community Based Economic Development Strategy (CBED) with a grant component that allows
up to $10,000 for each city to support economic development activities; (iv) Apartment Building
Management; and (v) Policy Reform and Association Strengthening.

USAID i s supporting the Government o f Armenia's efforts in p r e & post WTO accession,
largely in the area of international trade, and more specifically in standards and technical
regulations. U SAID assistance w i l l help to bring Armenian standards governing product
conformity in line with those of the West so as to generate further trade and investment. In
responding to WTO obligations, the Government has issued a directive to rid itself, by December
2004, of unnecessary standards and regulations which act as technical barriers to trade. To this
end, the Government has been receiving assistance from U S A I D in helping to identify and retain
technical regulations which are most applicable for the Armenian economy. The World Bank
has also been asked for assistance in this area, and i s collaborating with the Government and
USAID to identify those areas not addressed already by other donors.

million)

The implementation of the 2002 C i v i l Service L a w required the adoption of a complex set of
secondary legislative acts. I t also required the development and implementation of new rules
and procedures for human resource management. M o s t of these rules and procedures have
already been adopted by the C i v i l Service Council. The adoption of a n e w legal framework is,
however, only the starting point for the development of a merit-based c i v i l service system.

Subcomponent 1A will:

    0   H e l p improve and complete the legislative and regulatory framework for c i v i l service
        management. This activity w i l l finance international and local technical assistance (TA)
        to review and finalize secondary legal acts, rules and procedures and to conduct a regular
        evaluation of key rules and procedures for c i v i l service management.
    0   Develop a long term vision for the c i v i l service system, including possible
        rationalization of the whole public service. This activity w i l l finance international and
        local TA.

Among other things, the TA will focus on the creation of a fair and transparent rewards system.
This w i l l entail further improvement of the existing grading and remuneration schemes. I t will
also develop instruments to help retain talented staff in the administration.

Subcomponent 1B: Strengthening the Civil Service Council (US$ 0.71 million)

The Civil Service Council oversees recruitment to the senior levels of the state administration. I t
also coordinates the implementation of the Civil Service L a w and manages the overall c i v i l
service system. Since i t s establishment in January 2002, the Council has significantly developed
its capacity to conduct recruitment processes and to guide line ministry and agency HR units in
the area of career planning. Nevertheless, the Council lacks the capacity to effectively carry out
the full range of i t s broad array of responsible functions. There i s no effective network of
personnel units, which prevents the Council from exercising effective oversight over recruitment
and career management practices and the Council itself lacks the facilities to disseminate
information on available vacancies.


                                                 44
Subcomponent 1B will:

    0   Provide local consulting services to assist the Council in improving i t s testing and
        attestation instruments for recruitment and promotion exercises;
    0   Equip the Council's offices with computer hardware and software to manage the
        Council's internal procedures more effectively;

        enhance the Council's web site.

Subcomponent 1C: Introducing Systemsfor Human Resource Management and
Assessment/Attestation for the Civil Service Council (US$1.12 million)

The introduction of a merit-based civil service i s a major priority for the Government. T o help
realize this goal, Subcomponent 1C will:

   0    Introduce a civil service wide system Human Resource Management Information System,
        including financing a package of information technologies, training for personnel units in
        the ministries and agencies that w i l l operate the new system, and application
        development services. In particular, the system w i l l support one workstation in the HR
        departments of each o f the forty-one public agencies that operate under the Civil Service
        Law and nine workstations at the Council. Among other things, the system w i l l make
        information about openings and selection procedures readily available to the civil service
        cadre and to the public at large;

   0    Introduce a civil service wide system for Assessment and Attestation, b y providing a
        package of information technologies, training, and application development services to
        create and deploy the attestation and assessment system. In particular, the system w i l l
        support five workstations for the HR departments o f each o f the forty-one public agencies
        that operate under the Civil Service law and five workstations at the Council. As an
        additional integrity-control measure, the system w i l l provide simple web-based, video-
        conferencing technologies to allow remote monitoring of the administration o f exams and
        tests conducted in the assessment centers o f the institutions referred to above.

(US$0.59 million)

The c i v i l service training system in Armenia includes the Academy o f Public Administration (the
main provider of training to the government), and training institutes subordinated t o several
sector ministries, which provide specialized training in areas such as budgeting and financial
management. The Academy has developed and carried out the basic training program for c i v i l
servants. However, training provided by the various training institutions i s relatively ad hoc and
not well integrated with career management. Moreover, the Academy does not have regional
branches. Thus, training activities have limited impact beyond Yerevan and are not accessible to
the staff o f the Murzes. Targeted and integrated training, at the central as well as regional levels,
is a pressing need o f the Armenian c i v i l service.

Subcomponent ID will:

   0   Strengthen the Academy's capacity to develop and implement training programs, t o
       respond to the new training requirements set out b y the C i v i l Service Council, and to
       integrate training with career planning, by financing the preparation of training materials,
       acquisition of publications and library supplies, international and local trainers. The
       trainers w i l l implement train-the-trainers programs aimed at the Academy and i t s
       Vanadzor and Goris branches;
       Upgrade the Academy's training facilities in Yerevan by providing information
       technologies (hardware, software, network, etc.) and related training, and equip the to-be-
       created regional branches in Vanadzor and Goris;
   e   Provide advisory support to the Academy.

      US$0.92 million (IDA contribution US$0.62 million, expected parallel financing
                                   (US$0.25 Million)

The M a y 2003 Country Procurement Assessment Review (CPAR) found that, in a short space of
time, the Armenian authorities had specified a procurement system that i s sophisticated and well
thought out. In particular, the Procurement Law's provisions are compatible with the
UNCITRAL Model Law. Minor changes w i l l bring i t into acceptable approximation with EU
directives and the GPA. However, a sound law and compatibility with EU and WTO procedures
are not enough to ensure a well-functioning procurement system. In practice, the coverage o f the
procurement system in Armenia i s far from comprehensive. The procuring agencies make far
greater use o f single-source methods than envisaged under the Law or compatible with
transparency or good value for money. As a result, Armenia i s not receiving the benefits o f a
well-functioning procurement system, namely: discipline in public expenditure, efficient use of
public funds, transparent public financial accountability, and support to the emerging private
sector. T o address some o f the system deficiencies, Component 2 will: (a) establish the
information technology infrastructure for e-Procurement; and (b) establish an e-Procurement
System.

Parallel financing of up to US$0.25 million for the activities under this component i s available
through the US AID-funded CLERP project, which includes advisory support and training for the
introduction of the E-procurement system, and w i l l be implemented in parallel with the PSMP.

Subcomponent 2A: Establish Information Technology Infrastructure for e-Procurement (US$
0.37 million)

Subcomponent 2 A w i l l finance workstations, servers, printers, peripherals, as well as local-area
and wide-area network technologies for the central Authorized Body and the State Procurement
Agency (inclusive o f the necessary hardware, standard software, installation and set-up, IT
familiarization training and technical support training). A similar, but more limited package o f I T
and related services w i l l be installed in each of sixty state agencies and forty-four local Treasury
units. A similar small package w i l l be installed in the information centers in ten Murz
administrations and Yerevan region. The information center infrastructure w i l l allow greater
access to the e-Procurement System b y the business community.

Subcomponent 2B: Establish the e-Procurement System (US$0.3million)

Subcomponent 2B w i l l finance the acquisition, adaptation, installation, configuration and testing
of e-procurement application software. The subcomponent w i l l also finance the localization o f
the manuals and procedures to the specifics of the Armenian procurement system and the
institutional context. Training on technical support and application user w i l l also be part o f the e-
Procurement System contract and be financed b y Subcomponent 2B. Lastly, Subcomponent 2B
w i l l finance a public awarenesdoutreach program to maximize the awareness and utilization o f
the e-Procurement System by the business community and other interested non-governmental
parties.

              Project Component 3: Strengthening the Chamber of Control
      US$0.74 million (IDA contribution US$0.29 million, expected parallel financing
                                    US$0.43 million)

The Chamber o f Control (COC) i s the supreme audit institution in Armenia. On behalf of the
National Assembly, the COC oversees the execution of the national budget, as well as the use of
foreign loans and grants. Under the current provisions of the Republic o f Armenia Constitution,
the National Assembly determines the COC's audit program and the content and nature of i t s
reports. These prevent the COC from becoming an independent institution and having the results
of i t s work respected and more relevant to improved public financial administration.

In the meantime, Component 3 w i l l provide limited and focused support to the COC. Based on
the emerging results of ongoing study under an Association-administered Dutch grant, the COC
suffers from deficiencies in organizational capacity, audit methodologies, as well as financial and
human resources.

Component 3 w i l l require coordination with USAID, TACIS and GTZ who have actively
supported the COC (albeit hindered by the constitutional constraints noted above). In particular,
Component 3 w i l l focus on the professional development of COC staff. This w i l l allow the staff
to fulfill the functions of a true supreme audit institution when the Constitution i s amended to
provide the necessary independence for the Chamber.

Component 3 will: (a) help draft auditing standards and develop an Audit Manual and provide
related training; (b) provide some essential IT and office equipment; and (c) enhance the COC's
web site.

Parallel financing of up to US$0.43 M i l l i o n i s available through GTZ, which w i l l provide
additional advisory services and training for the COC on auditing standards and other key
institutional development building issues.

Subcomponent 3A: Drafting Audit Standards and Development of an Audit Manual and
Associated Training (US$0.16 million)

The COC's opinion o f a government's financial and budgetary activities i s founded on the
financial compliance audit. To achieve the required confidence, the supreme audit institution
must either carry out the detailed financial compliance audit itself, or verify that the financial
compliance audits carried out b y the government's internal audit arrangements are effective.
Consequently, COC staff must be versed in internal audit procedures and standards, have access
to an Audit Manual, and have the relevant training.

Notwithstanding the priority of capacity building in financial compliance audit, the COC should
also begin developing i t s capacity to carry out performance audits. Performance audit activity
also needs to be guided by audit standards and associated references in the Audit Manual.

Subcomponent 3A w i l l finance international and local technical assistance to prepare the
necessary audit standards, the Audit Manual for the COC's financial compliance audits, as well


                                                   48
as evaluation o f budgetary programs. I t w i l l also finance training. Among other things, the audit
standards and Audit Manual w i l l set out a code of ethics for COC staff in line with INTOSAI and
EUROSAI guidelines.

Subcomponent 3B: Provision o essential IT and Office equipment to the COC (US$0.13
                            f
million)

To address essential needs of the COC office, Subcomponent 3B w i l l finance workstations,
printers, peripherals, as well as local-area and wide-area network technologies for the COC
(inclusive of the necessary hardware, standard software, installation and set-up, IT
familiarization training and technical support training). The subcomponent w i l l also finance
correspondence tracking software and "mini" print shop technologies. Office furnishing and
equipment to set up the COC library, archive and meeting room w i l l also be financed under
Subcomponent 3B.

These information technologies w i l l complement the ten workstations the COC expects to
receive from GTZ. Some technical assistance on IT i s also anticipated from GTZ. This w i l l help
the COC refine their technical requirements under Subcomponent 3B.

Subcomponent 3C: Enhance the COC Web Site (US$0.02 million)

Subcomponent 3C w i l l finance some local technical assistance on the further development of the
COC's web site. This w i l l facilitate public posting o f COC reports and information regarding the
COC.

    Project Component 4: ImprovingPolicy Formulation and Implementation through
                                 Capacity Building
                 US$3.55 million (IDA contribution US$3.42 million)


Component 4 aims to strengthen policy formulation and implementation capacities in three core
pilot institutions (i.e., the Ministry of Finance and Economy, the Ministry o f Economic
Development and Trade, and the Office of the Government). I t also seeks to strengthen service
delivery in a set o f specialized agencies that deliver services, which are essential to the business
community. Component 4 will: (a) improve process and document flow in the three pilot
ministries; (b) support the Ministry of Finance and Economy in the areas o f revenue policy,
internal audit, and the Budget and Financial Management Training Center; (c) support the
Ministry of Economic Development and Trade in the areas o f regulatory policy-making and
external communications; (d) support the Office o f the Government in the area o f external
communications; and (e) and support the specialized agencies responsible for the implementation
of standardization, metrology and certification policy.

Subcomponent 4A: Improving Horizontal Policy Management Processes and Document Flow
(US$1.08 million)

The Government has identified timely and effective implementation of government directives
and decisions b y the ministries and public agencies as a major weakness in public sector
management in Armenia.

Subcomponent 4 A will:

    0   Finance a diagnostic study of ministry function, organization and process-flow in core
        administration ministries, carried out by local and international consultants;
    0   Support the provision of training on the rationalized processes and document flows in the
        three pilot ministries. The project w i l l finance the introduction of an Integrated Document
        Management System including financing for the necessary information technology
        infrastructure in selected ministries. This infrastructure (i.e., hardware, software, network
        technologies) w i l l enable the departments within the selected ministries to work on
        documents in electronic form and to readily exchange these documents: within the
        departments, across the pilot ministries, and externally with other ministries, public
        agencies, and the public. This activity w i l l also finance technical training (i.e., IT
        familiarization, technical support, and applications development). The package o f
        information technologies and technical training w i l l allow the pilot ministries to develop
        focused "business" applications that support the various departmental functions. In
        addition, the third activity w i l l finance the development of a ministry-wide document
        flow management application. This application w i l l be common across the three pilot
        ministries. The application w i l l manage and track the flow of correspondence, decrees,
        work-orders, and other documents, as they flow to, from, and through the pilot ministries.
        The combination of electronic documents and an automated system to manage the flow
        of documents w i l l enhance the ability o f each ministry to function as a unified and
        coherent agency. I t w i l l also enable the ministries to be substantially more responsive to



                                                  50
        Government directives, ministry directives, and the needs o f the clients o f the ministries'
        day-to-day functions.

Subcomponent 4B: Support to the Ministry o Finance and Economy in the areas of revenue
                                             f
policy, internal audit, and the Budget and Financial Management Training Center (US$0.40
million)

The structure o f the Ministry of Finance and Economy has recently been redefined, based on a
functional review carried out with the support o f DFID. Among other things, the Ministry has
clarified i t s core functions. However, problems remain in effective management o f the
implementation o f Government policy, caused by, among other things, weakness in document
flow and activity monitoring (addressed through Subcomponent 4A above.)

Other structural issues include the division o f labor between the Ministry and the Tax and
Customs Services. In particular, the coordination o f tax and customs policy with revenue target
formulation i s unsatisfactory to the institutions concerned. Other issues remain in relation the
definition o f revenue policies. More generally, the Ministry needs to strengthen budget
formulation and execution capacity across the range of governmental institutions.

The internal audit, internal control and inspection functions o f the Ministry have also received
significant attention for the international community. This includes the Association's Institutional
and Governance Review (IGR) in April 2000, the IMF Fiscal Transparency Report on the
Observance o f Standards and Codes (ROSC) in March 2002, and the recent Country Financial
and Accountability Assessment (CFAA) by the Association in July 2003. Also an Association-
administered, Dutch Grant has financed a detailed diagnosis o f external and internal audit and
internal control and supervision activities. The thrust o f these analyses i s that there i s a need for a
major overhaul o f this area if government auditing in Armenia i s to become more in line with
international standards (IFAC, INTOSAI, E U R O S A I and IIA) and other features o f international
best practice.

The Government has taken some initial steps in strengthening these areas, most notably the
Internal Audit Decree o f December 2002. This decree requires internal audit units to be
established in all line ministries, Murz agencies and local communities. However, capacity and
procedures remain underdeveloped in the Ministry and in the public agencies that fall under
Ministry oversight. Furthermore the linkages between key institutions involved in Financial
Control and Policy Evaluation, such as the Supervision Services o f the President's
Administration, the Office of the Government and the Chamber o f Control remain weak.

To address the identified weaknesses, Subcomponent 4B will:

        Finance training to strengthen policy development in the revenue policy area, including
        coordination systems with the Tax and Customs Services;
    e   Strengthen the Ministry's internal audit mechanisms by conducting seminars and
        conferences on internal audit, providing advice on establishing two pilot internal audit
        units in selected public agencies, and designing and delivering train-the-trainer
        curriculum development. A small package o f furnishing and equipment w i l l be provided
        to address the essential needs o f the Ministry's internal audit unit, and t o effectively link

Subcomponent 4C: Support to the Ministry o Economic Development and Trade in the areas
 f
o regulatory policy-making and external communications (US$0.22 million)

The Ministry o f Economic Development and Trade underwent a comprehensive restructuring
process under the DFID funded functional review. The size and the functions o f the core ministry
were reduced. Specialized agencies were created to manage policy implementation. The
Ministry also took on functions that were transferred from state committees that were
subsequently closed down. Although the structural reforms improved the Ministry's focus, a
substantial institutional development agenda remains. This includes the areas of policy-making
in areas such as standardization and certification policy (i.e., W T O obligations), internal
management systems and procedures, as well as coordination with international interlocutors in
trade and development.

Subcomponent 4C will:

   0   Strengthen policy-making capacity in the area o f standardization and certification through
       the provision of local technical assistance;
   0   Strengthen the Ministry's ability to communicate and coordinate with external
       interlocutors, domestic and international, public and non-governmental, b y upgrading the
       Ministry's web site and providing technologies and communications services to improve
       the Ministry's access to the Internet.

Subcomponent 4 0 : Support to the Office o the Government in the area o external
communications (US$0.22 million)

The Office of the Government was re-organized under the DFID-funded functional review.
Among other things, this led to the transfer to line ministries agencies previously subordinated
directly to the Office of the Government. As a result, the Office i s better positioned to focus on
i t s core task, namely to support to the Prime Minister and the Government in the management of
the government decision-making process. Notwithstanding the improved focus, a substantial
capacity-building agenda remains for the Office, to achieve the goals of effective and timely
implementation of the Government's program, as well as transparency in public management.

Whereas Subcomponent 4 A w i l l address policy implementation management (initially in the
three pilot ministries), Subcomponent 4 D w i l l focus on strengthening the Office of the
Government's capacity to implement the Government's program in a more open and publicly-
engaged manner by financing international and local consultants to help develop the Office's
web site and Information Center.

Subcomponent 4E: Support to Standardization, Metrology and Certification Agencies (US$
1.42 million)


                                                52
In the context o f WTO accession, the administration o f standardization, metrological and
certification functions take on special significance, in so far as these are identified by the
Technical Barriers to Trade Agreement as regulatory features that significantly impede or
facilitate the free flow o f goods in international commerce (especially t o Western markets).

Over the past year some key organizational and structural changes were introduced in this area.
The functional responsibilities of the previous Standardization, Metrology and Certification
Department o f the Office o f the Government have moved to the Ministry o f Economic
Development and Trade. The policy implementation responsibilities now rest with four
specialized agencies under the Ministry o f Economic Development and Trade: the National
Institute o f Standardization and Quality, the National Institute o f Metrology, the Quality
Inspectorate, and the Accreditation Agency (with 140, 90,60 and 8 staff, respectively).

The Government plans further reforms in this area. N e w draft laws on Standardization,
Metrology and Compliance Assurance are expected t o be approved in the first half o f 2004.
These would lay the foundation for further rationalization o f the regulatory system and the
reorganization the first two institutes as non-commercial state organizations.

Notwithstanding the organizational reforms, a substantial capacity-building agenda remains
before the benefits o f the structural reforms can be captured (including a more competitive
position in the rapidly globalizing world economy).

Subcomponent 4E will:

   0    Help improve the regulatory framework and related technical standards by financing
       'finance international and local technical assistance to improve the regulatory and
        technical standards in Armenia. This includes the provision o f support t o the
        development o f a long-term strategy. The strategy w i l l identify national priorities for
        standards modernization. Based o n national priorities, existing technical
        regulationshtandards would be rationalized, eliminating those that are excessive,
        outdated, or redundant. T o fill the regulatory gaps, international standards would be
        adopted and adapted as appropriate;

        essential laboratory equipment for the specialized agencies, as well as the acquisition o f
        some essential laboratory testing equipment.

             Project Component 5: Developing Capacity in Local Governments
                   US$2.85 million (IDA contribution US$2.76 million)

Component 5 aims to improve local service delivery capacity by: (a) building inter-community
cooperation frameworks to enhance service delivery capacity; (b) supporting the development of
capacities to effectively raise revenues at the local level; (c) supporting the implementing the
Law on Municipal Civil Service; and (d) introducing an electronic municipal services and
management information system.

Subcomponent 5A: Building Inter-Community Cooperation Frameworks to enhance service
delivery capacity (US$ 0.16 million)

Armenia adopted a new Law on Local Self-Government in 2002. The Law assigned significant
responsibilities to the local governments. The implementation o f the Law has been difficult,
however, since local capacities to provide quality public services to the citizens are uneven and,
even in the best o f circumstances, limited. Moreover, the Law assigned functions to all
communities uniformly, regardless the size and whether urban or rural. The result i s the threat of
administrative fragmentation. Given these challenges and limitations, the Government has opted
to gradually transfer functions and authorities. In particular, the Government i s initially focusing
on forty-seven municipalities and the twelve districts in Yerevan.

Compulsory amalgamation seems not to be a feasible option currently. The Government i s
seelung alternative approaches to encourage voluntary cooperation among communities, with the
goal of increasing public service efficiency and effectiveness. In this regard, a GTZ funded
program has initiated a pilot on Inter-Community Unions (ICUs). These unions help improve
services delivery b y pooling local resources and by organizing joint delivery functions. There are
good precedents in Armenia for this type of initiative to succeed, despite the relatively limited
funds. For instance, the Information System Development and Training System in Charantsevan
Municipality has served as a support system for some 50 municipalities and villages in creating
automated municipal office management and Civil Status Registry systems (the latter was
instrumental in facilitating a voter registration l i s t for the 2003 elections).

The Government sees the formation o f Inter-Community Unions as the best way to avoid
administrative fragmentation. The conceptual and regulatory frameworks for the operation of
such Unions are incomplete, however. Moreover, the replication process o f this organizational
innovation has not yet been worked out.

Subcomponent 5A w i l l :
   0  Support the development of the conceptual and legal framework for the formation and
     operation of Inter-Community Unions through the provision of international and local
     technical assistance;
   0  Strengthen the ability of local administrations to effectively provide mandatory and
     delegated functions b y financing advisory services and training. Particular emphasis w i l l
     be put on assisting Inter-Community Unions in four selected different pilot areas o f the
     country; Vedi (Ararat Marz), Yeghegnadzor (Vayots Dzor Marz), Spitak (Lori Marz),
     Goris (Syunik Marz). This includes support to the pilot ICUs in the delivery of
     mandatory and delegated functions.

Subcomponent 5B: Supporting the Development o Capacities to Effectively Raise Revenues at
                                             f
Local Level (US$0.19 million)

The new Law on Local Self-Government has given local governments significant revenue raising
powers, including the right to assess and collect property and land taxes. The effective use o f
these taxation powers i s a key condition for local governments to be able to deliver public
services, as they w i l l constitute a significant part of local government revenue. The assessment
and collection of property and land tax at local level i s highly problematic. First, many local
authorities do not have the human resource capacities and material resource base to effectively
manage the assessment and collection of local taxes. Second, the property and land registers on
which tax assessment i s to be based are claimed to be outdated and need rationalization. The
latter i s problematic in particular in rural areas. These suffer most from a lack of tax assessment
and collection capacity.

The Government has responded initially by introducing the full transfer o f property and land tax
collection responsibility only to the twelve Yerevan districts and forty-seven major
municipalities only. However, in 2004 tax assessment and collection powers w i l l also be
transferred to every community, including the rural ones. Significant capacity building support as
well as support to help rationalizing the property and land registers at local level, w i l l be needed
if local governments are to effectively assess and collect these taxes. Part of the solution to this
problem may l i e in organizing the management of the assessment and collection process through
ICUs, supported under the first subcomponent, in order to achieve economies of scale.

Subcomponent 5B w i l l finance international and local technical assistance and trainers. These
w i l l advise The Ministry of Territorial Administration on the implementation of local tax
administration and to build capacity in the main local municipalities on budget management and
local tax administration.

Subcomponent 5C: Effectively implementing the L a w on Municipal Civil Service (US$ 0.11
million)

The draft Law on Municipal Civil Service provides the legal framework for the creation o f a
permanent and professional cadre o f local government staff. Proper organization and
development of these human resources i s an essential precondition to efficient delivery o f quality
public services at the local level. The Law, once adopted, w i l l require significant
implementation support. Even though the number o f staff directly employed by local
governments i s relatively small in most cases, the development o f recruitment and promotion
processes based on merit w i l l need a serious effort in training and mentoring.

Subcomponent 5C w i l l help design and implement a human resource management system for the
municipal level civil service. The Subcomponent w i l l finance international and local technical
assistance to the Office o f the Minister of Territorial Administration for this purpose.

Subcomponent 5D: Introducing an Electronic Municipal Services and Management
Information System (US$2.39 million).

Although limited in geographic scope and functional span, municipal administration i s
nonetheless a relative complex undertaking, the efficiency and effectiveness of which i s
intimately felt b y the local residents and resident enterprises. Municipal administration and
governance in Armenia suffers from numerous organizational as well as capacity constraints.
Whereas some o f the organizational constraints are addressed b y the subcomponents above,
Subcomponent 5 D focuses on capacity building in municipal management and governance.
Subcomponent 5 D will:

   0    Support the development and deployment of an integrated and networked, computer-
        based Municipal Services and Management Information System. This includes financing
        a package of information technologies, training and furnishings, initially to the
        municipalities making up the pilot ICUs and later to be extended to other municipalities,
        in particular those in rural areas. The package w i l l implement an integrated, and publicly
        accessible, information system that w i l l support a broad range o f local government
        functions. These include the Civil Status Registry (where applicable), local tax
        administration, municipal financial accounting, news, community relations, among
        others. An "average" package would provide workstations (HW and SW), including a
        receptionist and a "walk-up" public access point for the system. The information
        technologies include a server (HW and SW) to run the office system, and to serve the
        information over the Internet and via dial-up connections. Local Area and Wide Area
        Network technologies w i l l be included, to interconnect the workstations within the office
        system and to connect the offices to users and systems outside the municipal centers.
        Substantial user and technical training w i l l be provided. The user training w i l l cover the
        substantive business functions, as well as the use o f the technologies. Technical training
        w i l l be provided to a couple o f staff in each municipal center to help keep the system
        running. A small amount o f office furnishings and refurbishments w i l l be provided to
        allow the municipal center staff to operate the information system in the physical office
        environments (e.g. secure server closets, receptionist windows, etc.)
    0   Strengthen the Information Systems Development and Training Center in Charenstsevan.
        The Center's system w i l l be enhanced to cover the functions o f most of the municipal
        departments, in an integrate fashion. The system employs web-based technologies to
        provide public access to the information in the system and to support selected remote
        electronic transactions, such as queries and updates o f individual information in the Civil
        Status Registry. The web-based technologies w i l l also link the municipal centers
        together, as well as w i l l link the municipal centers to other public agencies and non-
        governmental entities. The majority o f the resources provided to the Center w i l l be used
        to fund a multi-year technical training program for the Center's staff. This technical
        training w i l l build the Center's technical capacity, motivate the Center's staff, and help
        enhance staff retention. In addition, financing w i l l be provided for a package of
        information technologies, training, furnishings and minor refurbishment to the
        Information Systems Development and Training Center in Charenstsevan Municipality.
        These investments w i l l allow the Center to be the national source o f technical support to
        the municipal centers, expand the Center's training capacity, and continue to advance the
        functionality of the System.

                   US$0.59 million (IDA contribution US$0.54 million)


Components 1-5 above represent a set o f complementary, but distinct, public sector management
initiatives. Each needs to be managed as a specific undertaking; yet, each must be orchestrated in
the overall country context and within the unified project governance and administrative
arrangements. In addition, monitoring of the overall project outcomes and impact i s essential to
proper management and substantiation of the effectiveness of the use o f the Association Credit to
the Armenian public and the international community.

Component 6 w i l l support: (a) project management; and (b) surveys and outreach.

Subcomponent 6A: Project Management (US$0.53 million).

On a day-to-day basis, project activities w i l l be implemented by each o f the beneficiary agencies.
Consequently, working groups w i l l be established in each ministry and agency for coordination
of reforms in their respective areas. At the national level, overall project implementation w i l l be
overseen by a Project Manager. The Project Director w i l l report to the standing Public Sector
Reform Commission (PSRC), via a Project Management Board that w i l l be supported by the
PSRC Secretariat. The Project Manager w i l l be supported b y a small team, including an IT
specialist and a legal expert. The staff of the Foreign Financial Projects Management Center
(FFPMC) of the Ministry of Finance w i l l perform the project's financial management and
procurement functions.

The Project Manager w i l l be responsible for:

           Developing and updating the Project Implementation Plan (PIP) and ensuring that
           project activities are implemented according to the PIP.
           Carrying out site visits and ensuring that the project activities are implemented
           properly and on time,
           Reporfing on project progress to the PSRC and the World Bank;
           Request adequate budget provisions for the project from the national budget,
           Reviewing consultant outputs, organizing acceptance testing o f I T software and
           hardware etc.;
           Providing advice to the Working Groups established for each component of the
           project ;
           Disseminating project related information and provide necessary information to
           external stakeholders;
           Ensuring that the project's mid-term review and completion reviews are conducted.

For carrying out these and other project implementation functions, Subcomponent 6A w i l l
finance operational and logistical assistance to the Project Manager. I t w i l l also finance some
costs of the FFPMC in carrying out the procurement and financial management activities.

Subcomponent 6B w i l l finance periodic surveys o f households, firms, NGOs and public officials
to collect data on key performance indicators and obtain stakeholders' feedback on the reform
process. The f i r s t survey w i l l be organized by the end o f 2004. This survey w i l l provide baseline
data against which the effectiveness of project implementation w i l l be monitored and evaluated.
Subcomponent 6B w i l l also finance a communication campaign to explain project objectives and
activities to managers, staff and other stakeholders. This w i l l be important to build and maintain
support and ownership for the reforms.

                       A R M E N I A : Public Sector Modernization Project


Given the wide span o f the reforms proposed under the project in various ministries and
agencies, the project w i l l be implemented under the leadership of the Public Sector Reform
Commission (PSRC), which w i l l service as the Project Management Board. The PSRC
(Public Administration System Reform Commission) was established b y the decree o f the Prime
Minister # 624 o f October 07, 1999. I t i s located in the Office of the Government and i s headed
b y the Minister-Chief of Staff of the Government, who reports to the Prime Minister. I t s
members include senior officials from the President's Office, different ministries and agencies,
the Civil Service Council, as well as representatives of some NGOs. The Deputy Chairman of
the Chamber o f Control i s also a member of the Commission. Representatives o f project entities
that are currently not members o f the PSRC would be invited to its project-related deliberations.
The Government may s t i l l wish to consider further strengthening o f the PSRC through adding
other officials or changing the current composition of the Commission.

The PSRC w i l l provide political support and strategic guidance to project activities; support the
implementation o f policy changes; approve and submit draft legislative acts and regulations to
the Cabinet; resolve inter-agency coordination issues; and assist in building support for reforms
and overcoming resistance to them. PSRC will carry out all the required functions as a Project
Management Board, including approval of project implementation plans, annual budgets,
important financial management and procurement documents, etc.

On a day-to-day basis, project activities w i l l be implementedby the beneficiary institutions,
which would use the PSRC as the conduit for putting support proposals and for reporting
purposes. Working Groups (WGs) w i l l be created in the beneficiary ministries and agencies for
planning, organizing and carrying out project activities in their respective areas. This w i l l ensure
that management and staff of the entities covered by the project not only actively participate in
project activities, but also take full leadership and high level o f ownership for implementing
reforms. The WGs w i l l consist of high- and mid-level public officials belonging to the relevant
area. They may also include representatives from professional associations and other interested
organizations. In their respective areas, the WGs w i l l organize and oversee project
implementation, disseminate information about project objectives and activities to concerned
staff, review consultant TORSand outputs and resolve emerging problems. The members of the
WGs w i l l not receive any payments under the project.

For implementation of the project components the following six WGs w i l l be established in
beneficiary bodies:

Working Group 1- Civil Service
WG 1w i l l be created in the Civil Service Council and w i l l include representatives from the staff
of the CSC, Academy of Public Administration, officials and representatives from other
government bodies.
Worlung Group 2- Chamber of Control of the National Assembly
WG2 w i l l be established and led by the officials from the Chamber of Control.
Worlung Group 3- Finance and Economy
WG 3 w i l l be established in the Ministry o f Finance and Economy to lead the implementation of
those project activities that affect the ministry and i t s subordinate agencies. The components on
the introduction of e-Procurement and the specific reforms in the ministry w i l l be led b y this
working group. Besides the ministry officials, representatives from the State Procurement
Agency, the Budget Training Center and any other interested agency may also be members of the
WG.
Working Group 4- Trade and Economic Development Policy
         -

This working group w i l l lead the planned reform activities in the ministry, as well as in i t s
subordinated agencies in the area o f standardization, accreditation and certification. Senior and
mid-level officials from the ministry and agencies w i l l be members o f the group.
Working Group 5- Office of the Government
WG 5 w i l l be formed by senior officials to implement the reforms in the Office o f the
Government. This WG may also include officials from the Ministry o f Transport and
Communication, as well as representatives from I T sector to implement the elements o f the
government information systems in the most effective and coordinated manner.
Working Group 6- Territorial Administration and Local governments
WG 6 w i l l be led by the Office o f the Minister of Territorial Administration, and w i l l include
representatives from regional and local authorities, NGOs, as well as representatives from other
government bodies (e.g. the Tax Service, Ministry o f Finance, etc.).

The respective Ministers and the Heads o f the Agencies w i l l be authorized to form the WGs, in
consultation with the Chairman o f the PSRC.

The WGs w i l l be supported b y a Project Manager, who w i l l be hired b y the PRSC and w i l l be
funded b y the project. The Project Manager w i l l be a high level professional, having the trust of
and access to the highest-level o f decision-making in the Government. He/she w i l l participate in
the meetings o f the PSRC. The Project Manager w i l l be assisted by an IT Specialist, a lawyer
and one administrative support staff. The Office o f the Government w i l l provide office space for
the Project Manager and her/his support staff, and the project w i l l cover i t s basic refurbishment,
as well as i t s maintenance cost during the project implementation. The Project Manager w i l l be
responsible for developing and updating the Project Implementation Plan (PIP), ensuring that
project activities are implemented according to the PP, reporting on project progress to the
PSRC and the World Bank, ensuring adequate budget provisions for the project are made in the
national budget, facilitating the work of the working groups, reviewing consultant outputs,
organizing acceptance testing of IT software and hardware, etc. The Project Manager and/or his
staff w i l l actively participate in the meetings o f the WGs and provide all the necessary support.

Procurement and financial management activities related to the project w i l l be performed by
the Foreign Financial Projects Management Center (FFPMC) at the Ministry of Finance and
Economy, which has experience in managing World Bank projects. On overall project financial
management and procurement issues the FFPMC w i l l report directly to the PSRC. The FFPMC
w i l l be responsible for ensuring that procurement o f goods and services i s done in a timely
manner in accordance with World Bank guidelines, managing project funds, maintaining
accounts, preparing financial management reports and getting the accounts audited. The FFPMC
staff responsible for project implementation w i l l work closely with the Project Manager and they
would regularly report to him/her on various implementation issues, and prepare the necessary
documentation and reports.

Financia1 Management

Financial Management Assessment. As o f December 2003 FFPMC has acceptable financial
management arrangements in place to meet the current Bank requirements in respect o f the
quality o f accounting, reporting and internal controls system and also in respect of the audit
arrangements, and i s ready to start project implementation.

Financial Monitoring Reports (FMRs): Project management-oriented Financial Monitoring
Reports (FMRs) w i l l be used for project monitoring and supervision and the indicative formats
of these have already been discussed and agreed with the Association.

The FFPMC w i l l produce a full set o f F M R s for every calendar quarter throughout the life o f the
project.

Disbursements:

All disbursement arrangements are documented in the PAD, Annex 8, table C.




                                                  62
Audit Arrangements:

The auditing arrangements for the project w i l l follow the standard procedures adopted for ECA,
and, more specifically, for i t s Hub-North part (comprising CIS countries).

The audit of the project w i l l be conducted b y independent private auditors acceptable to the
Association and on terms of reference (TOR) acceptable to the Association. There i s a L i s t of
audit f i r m s eligible to perform audits of World Bank financed projects in CIS countries, which i s
updated regularly, and there i s a standard audit TOR applicable for ECA, which i s also updated
regularly to take account of the developments in the overall Bank audit policy. The L i s t includes
two fully qualified audit f i r m s operating in Yerevan and two conditionally qualified firms. For
all conditionally qualified firms, the Country F M S should be contacted to confirm the current
status of the fulfillment of the firms' conditionalities. The project w i l l choose the auditor from
the above-mentioned L i s t and w i l l use the E C A standard audit TOR as a basis for preparation of
i t s own audit TOR, which i s to be cleared with the project F M S annually regardless o f the term
of contracts concluded with the auditors (one year contract or multiple year contract).

The annual audited project financial statements w i l l be provided to the Association within six
months of the end of each fiscal year and also at the closing o f the project. The project financial
statements w i l l be based on the quarterly FMRs and w i l l include: (i) Summary of sources and
uses of funds; (ii)  Summary of uses o f funds b y project components; (iii)  SOE summary
schedule, (iv) Statement of the Special Account, and (v) notes to the financial statements. Single
audit opinion i s required on a l l the above listed financial statements.

The contract for the audit awarded during the first year of project implementation may be
extended from year-to-year with the same auditor, subject to satisfactory performance. The cost
of the audit w i l l be financed from the proceeds of the credit.

Country Issues.

The most recent CFAA was conducted in Armenia in autumn 2003, and i t s main findings and
conclusions have been discussed with the Government representatives for last several months.
The report, however, has not yet been finalized and made public.

In making the overall fiduciary assessment, the CFAA assessed the overall fiduciary risk5as
significant. Among the reasons for such a rating are: (i)t i l l inadequate capacity of core control
                                                          s
and supervisory agencies performing the audits within the public sector; (ii) fact that while
                                                                                the
most of the basic laws are in place with respect to various entities' (private sector and public
enterprises, including state non-commercial organizations) financial reporting, but compliance
remains a problem and authorities need to improve the quality of auditing, monitoring and
supervision. However, the fiduciary risk in the stand-alone financial management arrangements
for Bank-financed investment projects in Armenia i s considered to be low.

The CFAA team identified the following financial management issues for Bank-financed
projects:

    Government counterpart funding (GCF). Historically, there have been two types of
    problems with GCF: (a) delayed counterpart contributions against the goods, works and
    services procured, i.e. payments for requests presented by the PIUs to the MOFE beyond the
    agreed 30-day deadline, and (b) failure to replenish the accounts for project counterpart funds
    to the level required in Development Credit Agreements for some projects.
    The World Bank Yerevan Office continually monitors the GCF to the PIUs. Recently, a new
    database was developed to monitor them each month; this has enabled the Bank and
    Government to more closely check the status of GCF and address potential cash flow
    problems in a timely manner.
    Project bank accounts. Weaknesses in the commercial banking sector should be managed in
    relation to maintaining projectltransit accounts and Special Accounts on Bank projects.
    Currently, only one local bank (a branch of a large international bank) i s authorized to
    manage Special Account funds. The other Special Accounts are held in reputable banks
    outside Armenia. Projectkransit accounts have been opened in other local commercial banks;
    however, the CFAA recommended that (a) the balances in these accounts be minimized and
    (b) the accounts only be used for upcoming, short-term payments.
    Project financial management staff. The financial management (FM) staff are local
    consultants employed on terms o f reference, durations o f contracts, and salaries which vary
    among the different PIUs. Some of these units have had significant staff turnover due, in part,
    to the higher salaries available in the private sector (which raises the issue o f providing
    regular training to the PIU FM staff, both in IFRS and in World Bank financial management

  Risk of illegal, irregular or unjustified transactions not being detected, measured o n a four point scale according to
the CFAA Guidelines (low, moderate, significant or high).


                                                           64
    and disbursement procedures). Overall, the CFAA concluded that PIU staff arrangements are
    satisfactory.
    Issues arising from project audits. At the time the CFAA was prepared, the Government
    was substantially in compliance with all audit covenants of Bank-financed projects. Most
    projects received clean audit reports for fiscal years 2000,2001 and 2002, although at least
    h a l f had significant internal control issues (raised in management letters) such as failure to
    reconcile debtors and creditors, and failure t o reconcile PIU and World B a n k accounting
    records.
    Compliance issues. The audits of revenue-earning entities, required for World Bank credits,
    have raised several fundamental compliance issues. I t should be noted, however, that no
    involvement of a revenue-earning entity i s planned under the Project.
    Audit arrangements. These are satisfactory. All Bank-financed investment projects are
    audited annually by an independent private sector firm acceptable to the Bank.

Strengths and Weaknesses.

The significant strengths that provide a basis of reliance on the project financial management
system include: (i)   significant experience of FFPMC in implementing Bank-financed projects
( S A T A C 2, Enterprise Development Project, S A C (3,4,5), Strengthening Statistics Service
(IDF), Enterprise Incubator LIL, Anti-corruption strategy (IDF), Foreign Investment and Export
Facilitation LIL project); and ( ithe good quality of audit reports issued by FFPMC's project
                                   i)
auditors for the past years (the only reason for qualifying audit reports was incompliance of cash-
basis accounting used by FFPMC with the IAS; at the same time, there were usually only minor
internal control issues raised in the Management Letters, or none at all).

There are no significant weaknesses identified for the project.

Funds Flow.

                                     the
Project funds w i l l f l o w from (i) Bank, either via a single Special Account which will be
replenished on the basis of SOEs or by direct payment on the basis of direct payment withdrawal
applications, and (ii) Government, v i a the Treasury at the Ministry of Finance and Economy
                           the
(MoFE) on the basis of payment requests of FFPMC.

Staffing.

FFPMC includes the Director, a finance team comprising Chief Financial Officer and Chief
Accountant, a Procurement Specialist, and various other specialists. All of them are already in
place and have extensive experience in the B a n k disbursement, financial management and
procurement procedures.

Accounting Policies and Procedures.

The accounting books and records are maintained on cash basis and project financial statements
are presented in United States dollars.


                                                  65
Internal Audit.

FFPMC has no internal audit function and none i s considered necessary given the size of
FFPMC.

External Audit.

The auditing arrangements for the project w i l l follow the standard procedures adopted for ECA,
and, more specifically, for its Hub-North part (comprising CIS countries).

The audit o f the project will be conducted b y independent private auditors acceptable to the Bank
and on terms o f reference (TOR) acceptable to the Bank. There i s a L i s t of audit f i r m s eligible to
perform audits of World Bank financed projects in CIS countries, which i s updated regularly,
and there i s a standard audit TOR applicable for ECA, which i s also updated regularly to take
account of the developments in the overall Bank audit policy. The L i s t includes two fully
qualified audit f i r m s operating in Yerevan and two conditionally qualified f i r m s . For all
conditionally qualified firms, the Country F M S should be contacted to confirm the current status
of the fulfillment of the firms' conditionalities. The project w i l l choose the auditor from the
above-mentioned L i s t and w i l l use the E C A standard audit TOR as a basis for preparation of i t s
own audit TOR, which i s to be cleared with the project F M S annually regardless o f the term of
contracts concluded with the auditors (one year contract or multiple year contract).

The annual audited project financial statements w i l l be provided to the Bank within six months
of the end o f each fiscal year and also at the closing of the project. The project financial
statements w i l l be based on the quarterly FMRs and w i l l include: (i)
                                                                         Summary o f sources and
uses of funds; (ii)  Summary of uses o f funds b y project components; (iii)  SOE summary
schedule, (iv) Statement of the Special Account, and (v) notes to the financial statements. Single
audit opinion i s required on all the above listed financial statements.

The contract for the audit awarded during the first year of project implementation may be
extended from year-to-year with the same auditor, subject to satisfactory performance. The cost
of the audit w i l l be financed from the proceeds o f the credit.

Reporting and Monitoring.

Project management-oriented Financial Monitoring Reports (FMRs) w i l l be used for project
monitoring and supervision and the indicative formats of these have already been discussed and
agreed with the Bank.

Information Systems.

FFPMC has basically a manual system o f accounting and reporting. I t keeps Excel tables with
detailed movements for all bank accounts, and Excel tables for all expenditure categories, which
give breakdown by each individual expense made, reconcilable to Excel tables for bank
accounts, and also provide breakdown by activities within each expenditure category. The Excel
table used for recording of transactions passed through the AMD transit account l i s t s both the


                                                    66
AMD amounts passed through the account and the USD amounts written o f f the SA (the
exchange rates are also shown). Such Excel tables proved to be quite adequate for accounting
and reporting purposes for the two currently implemented IDA Credits, FIEF LIL and Enterprise
Incubator LIL, since they allowed to correctly record all received financing b y financier, and to
correctly record all expenditures, including their allocation to respective project components and
disbursement categories. So, on the overall, i t can be concluded that the currently existing
accounting and reporting system of FFPMC i s adequate.

F M R s w i l l be produced also in Excel tables.

Disbursement Arrangements.

All disbursement arrangements are documented in PAD, Annex 8, table C.

Information on the proposed Action Plan.

FFPMC has to prepare and clear with the Bank FMS the Financial Management Manual for
PSMP. FFPMC has good Financial Management Manuals for the FIEF LIL project and for the
Enterprise Incubator LIL project, and the Manual for the PSMP can be prepared on the basis on
the existing manuals.

Supervision Plan.

During project implementation, the Bank w i l l supervise the project's financial management
arrangements in two main ways: (i)   review the project's quarterly FMRs and six-monthly or
annual progress reports as well as the project's annual audited financial statements and auditor's
management letter; and (ii) during the Bank's supervision missions, review the project's
financial management arrangements (including a review o f a sample of SOEs and movements on
the Special Account) to ensure compliance with the Bank`s minimum requirements. The first
financial management supervision will, tentatively, take place four months after the effectiveness
of the Credit, and subsequent supervisions w i l l take place on a regular basis, minimum once per
year.

Bank's Guidelines: Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credit published in January 1995
including all revisions up to January 1999. Contracts for Consulting Services required for the
Project w i l l be awarded following the World Bank Guidelines "Selection and Employment o f
Consultants b y World Bank Borrowers" dated January 1997, including all revisions up to M a y
2002. The Bank's Standard Bidding Documents, Request for Proposals and Forms of
Consultants' Contract w i l l be used. The project elements, their estimated cost and procurement
methods, are summarized in the Procurement Plan. Table A indicates the Project costs b y
procurement arrangements. Table A1 indicates consultant selection arrangements and Table B
indicates the threshold for the procurement methods and prior review. Other procurement
information, including capacity o f the implementing agency, estimated dates for publication of
General Procurement Notice (GPN) and Project Launch Workshop are given in Table B 1. Table
B 2 (attached) indicates the procurement plan.

1. Selection Procedures for Goods

Goods and related technical services consisting of lT equipment, information system soft wares
and hardware including installation and configuration services, office equipment and furniture,
and printing o f materials w i l l be grouped to the extent possible and considering project
objectives, in package sizes that w i l l encourage competitive bidding. A single- or two-stage
bidding procedure w i l l be used for the information systems including design, implementation,
supply o f customized software, data entry design. For this purpose the Banks Standard Bidding
Documents, "Supply and Installation of Information Systems, Single-Stage (or Two-Stage)
Bidding", published in November 1997 w i l l be used, including all revisions up to March 2003.

Thefollowing methods o procurement will be followed:
                      f

(i) Zntemational Competitive Bidding (ZCB) procedures w i l l be used for contracts above
US$lOO,OOO equivalent for the procurement of equipment, information system hardware,

manufactured goods, if any, w i l l receive a preference in accordance with Appendix 2 o f the
Bank's Guidelines.

(ii) National Competitive Bidding (NCB) procedures w i l l be used for contracts estimated to
cost less than US$lOO,OOO equivalent per contract.

(iii) International Shopping (IS). This procedure w i l l be used for IT equipment, office
equipment, furniture, estimated to cost less than US$lOO,OOO equivalent per contract. Shopping,
which requires the implementing agency to obtain three quotations from at least two countries, i s
used here because more competitive methods are not justified on the basis of cost and efficiency.
The E C A Regional sample format for international shopping "Invitation to Quote" available on
the E C A Procurement Web Site w i l l apply.


                                                68
(iv)      National Shopping (NS). These procedures w i l l be used for contracts up to US$50,000
equivalent, for the purchase o f office furniture, supplies and goods readily available in the local
market, and printing of materials for Public Information Campaign. The E C A Regional sample
format for international shopping "Invitation to Quote" available on the E C A Procurement Web
Site w i l l apply.

2. Selection Procedures for Consulting Services

Contracts for consulting services w i l l be packaged to combine related s k i l l s and services, in
order to make them attractive and increase competition as well as to reduce the number of
contracts to be managed b y the Foreign Financing Project Management Center (FFPMC). The
following methods of procurement w i l l be followed:

 ii
campaigns.

(v)    Zndividual Consultants (IC) w i l l be hired in accordance with Section V of the Guidelines.
Individual consultants w i l l be hired for small assignments o f short-term duration for consulting
services related to project management.

3. Incremental Operating Costs

IDA w i l l finance the incremental operating cost o f about U S $ 540,000 equivalent for the FFPMC
and PMG needed to oversee and manage the project including: (a) FFFMC and PMG staff
salaries; and (b) communications, maintenance and operation cost for equipment procured or
used under the project. Incremental costs w i l l be procured on the basis o f an annual agreed
budget.

Expenses for training, study tours and other communications expenses related to the project w i l l
be covered under training category and disbursed based on SOEs.

4. Notification of Business Opportunities

national newspaper.

5. I D A Review of Procurement Decisions

Scheduling o f Procurement. Procurement of goods and services for the project w i l l be carried out
in accordance with the agreed procurement plan, which w i l l be updated annually, included in the
progress report, and reviewed b y the IDA.

6. Prior Review

(i) Goods and Technical Services: Prior review of bidding documents, including review of
evaluation, recommendation of award and contract w i l l be conducted for all ICBs. The first two
contracts procured through NCB, I S and NS for goods w i l l require prior review.

(ii ) Consulting Services: Requests for Proposal (RFP), short lists, terms of condition of
contracts as well as evaluation reports and recommendation for award w i l l be prior reviewed by

documents and recommendations involving sole source contracting w i l l be subject to IDA prior
review.

After award o f contracts, should any material modifications or waiver of terms and conditions o f
a contract resulting in an increase or decrease above 15 percent of the original amount, IDA w i l l
undertake a prior review of such modifications (including modifications to contracts for
consulting services).

7. Custom Duties and Taxes

All custom duties and taxes for goods specifically imported for the project and for all technical
assistance w i l l be financed by the Borrower.

8. Procurement Organization and Cycle.

Currently, procurement in the FFPMC i s handled b y Procurement Specialist who i s reporting to
Executive Director. I t i s anticipated that project team w i l l reassess the level of the procurement
load after six months. I f i t i s necessary, in addition to the existing one a competitively selected
procurement officer/analyst w i l l be hired. I t i s agreed that Project manager and hidher team, that
w i l l be hired under the project w i l l be responsible for preparing TOR'S and technical
specifications. The FFPMC w i l l be responsible to prepare the complete Bidding Documents or
Request for Proposals.

9. Action Plan for strengthening Agency's Capacity to Implement Project Procurement


The following actions w i l l be taken to strengthen the procurement capacity o f the PCU:

       (i)   Initiating a Project Launch Workshop in M a y 2004 before the credit effectiveness,
             as part of the project implementatiodcapacity building initiatives, especially in
             procurement.
        i ) The project w i l l be subject to intensified supervision b y the Bank. During the first
       (i
             year of project implementation, there w i l l be at least two supervisions.
       (iii) Periodic ex-post review by the Bank o f 1 in 10 contracts during the supervision
             missions.

Statement of Expenditure:

Some of the proceeds o f the Credit are expected to be disbursed on the basis of Statements o f
Expenditure (SOEs), as follows: (a) services contracts for (i)       individual consultants costing less
than US$50,000 equivalent each; (ii)      consulting f i r m s costing less than US$ 100,000 equivalent
each; (b) goods contracts costing less than US$ 100,000, (c) expenditure for training and study
tours; and (d) all operating costs. Disbursements against goods and services exceeding the above
limits w i l l be made against full documentation and respective procurement guidelines. SOEs w i l l
be prepared b y the FFPMC. Related documentation in support o f SOEs w i l l not be submitted to
the Bank, but w i l l be retained by the FFPMC for at least one year after receipt by the Bank o f the
audit for the period in which the last withdrawal from the Credit has been made. This document
w i l l be made available for review b y auditors and supervision missions. If ineligible
expenditures, including those not justified by evidence furnished, are financed from the Special
Account (SA), the Bank reserves the right to withhold further deposits in the SA. The Bank may
exercise this right until the Recipient has: (a) refunded the amount involved, or (b) (if the Bank
agrees) submitted evidence o f other eligible expenditures that can be used to offset the ineligible
amounts.

Special Account:

To facilitate timely project implementation, the FFPMC with the assistance of the M O F w i l l
establish, maintain and operate, under conditions acceptable to the Bank, a Special Account in
US$, in a commercial bank acceptable to IDA. An initial deposit to the Special Account not
exceeding $500,000 w i l l be maintained until the aggregate disbursements under the Credit total
XDR 2.0 million. Thereafter, the authorized allocation o f the Special Account w i l l be increased
to US$ 1,000,000.00. Replenishment applications should be submitted by the FFPMC monthly

                          Annex 9: Economic and Financial Analysis
                      A R M E N I A : Public Sector Modernization Project

The reforms proposed under the project are expected to create economic efficiency gains which
are described below but are difficult to quantify. Follow-up actions and especially the
introduction of IT technology might on the other hand create additional financial cost which are
described below.

The project emphasizes the introduction of technological innovations to improve the efficiency,
effectiveness, transparency and accountability of public sector management. The hardware and
software to install new management systems w i l l be funded b y the project. However, additional
budgetary resources w i l l be needed to sustain and operate these systems. The impact on the
government's budget, however, to sustain these measures i s expected to be small, comprising
applicable software licensing fees along with some ongoing maintenance o f equipment acquired
under the project. The annual cost to the government's budget would be in the order of 5 Percent
of the initial investment cost for maintenance. However, i f the functionality i s to be maintained
over time, equipment and software that w i l l become obsolete w i l l need to be replaced in 5 to 7
years time. Similarly, if i t i s desired to increase coverage o f the system additional investments
would be required.

The project w i l l also fund the development o f horizontal management systems for the civil
service that would promote merit and professionalism in the civil service. However, the
investment in management systems i s unlikely to have the desired impact if i t i s not
accompanied b y an improvement in civil service salaries and the salary system This, however,
cannot be done without increasing the proportion of the civil service wage bill as a percentage of
GDP. According to the PRSP the Government intends to gradually increase the salaries of
public servants, from 1.00 Percent of GDP in 2003 to 1.81 Percent in 2009 and to 2.71 Percent in
2015. The project would support further rationalization and optimization o f the whole public
service system, . Changes in the salary system w i l l be pursued in the context o f the Civil Service
Development strategy, which i s to be designed under the project.

The introduction of the e-procurement system w i l l assist the Government to achieve better value
for money in i t s purchasing and, at the same time, w i l l improve controls and transparency in the
purchasing process. The ready access by businesses to information about contracts on offer and
previous contracts won w i l l allow any business wishing to supply the government to compete for
the business. At the same time, a transparent and fairer procurement process should also
stimulate more businesses to compete and to compete more aggressively to w i n Government
business. The Government should therefore face a more competitive pricing structure for the
goods and services that i t needs. The budgetary impact o f maintaining the e-procurement system
w i l l be similar to that of other systems supported under the project, and i s estimated at 5 percent
of the initial investment cost for maintenance, while replacement cost w i l l occur in 5-7 years
after the introduction o f the system. The system set up under the project would be self-contained
and not require additional investment, unless the Government would decide to expand i t s scope
and coverage.

The project focuses on institutional reforms in public administration and reform of the civil
service. I t has no direct environmental impact and the project does not include any major
physical rehabilitation or civil works. The minor refurbishments o f office space required for the
installation o f equipment that are foreseen under the project w i l l be executed in line with
prevailing national legislation and all bidding documents w i l l make reference to the need to carry
out any works in line with prevailing environmental standards and safety regulations.
