Specific project objectives are to assist the poor\n            to: (1) improve sustainable management of natural resources\n            through soil conservation measures and reforestation at the\n            micro-catchment level; (2) increase rural production and\n            productivity through introduction of irrigation and improved\n            agricultural practices; and (3) strengthen their rural\n            organizations so that they can become autonomous and\n            sustainable entities.  The project has four components: (1)\n            participative identification and formulation of rural\n            investments in micro-catchments; (2) rural investments; (3)\n            strengthening of rural community institutions; and (4)\n            logistical support and training to the implementing agency (PRONAMACHCS)."}, "docdt": "1996-12-12T00:00:00Z"}
