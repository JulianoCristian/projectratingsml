The lessons learned indicate that the project\n            clearly demonstrated the benefits of natural resource\n            management practices for smallholders in the Andean sierra\n            of Peru. For projects with a significant institutional\n            development objective, there needs to be strong commitment\n            by the implementing agency with actions and time programmed\n            in the first years of the project to achieve the changes\n            intended. One handicap to implementation is the lack of\n            clear definition of new concepts and practices, which in\n            this case included participatory planning and\n            micro-catchment management. Investment in works can easily\n            crowd out attention by project implementors to more\n            difficult institutional development objectives as was the\n            case in this project. Involving an external agency in\n            assisting communities in procurement should be done under\n            strict limitations and guidelines. In spite of an excellent\n            social assessment during preparation, and the inclusion of\n            the recommendations of that assessment in the project\n            design, the project impact was minimal in increasing the\n            historically low levels of women's involvement in\n            natural resource management efforts."}, "docdt": "2004-10-15T00:00:00Z"}
