Re:

Amendment
Excellency:
Please refer to the Loan Agreement dated April 11, 1997 between the Republic of 
Peru (the Borrower) and the International Bank of Reconstruction and Development (the 
Bank) in connection with the above-referenced Project. We are pleased to inform you of 
our confirmation to amend the Loan Agreement in order to increase the authorized 
allocation in the special account. Therefore, the Bank proposes to amend the Loan 
Agreement by deleting “$US3 million” in paragraph 1 (c) of Schedule 6 to the Loan 
Agreement and substituting therefore “$US5 million”.
If you are in agreement with the foregoing amendment to the Loan Agreement, 
please sign and date the form of confirmation below and return a signed copy to us. 
This amendment shall take effect, upon receipt by the Bank of the countersigned 
duplicate original.
Very truly yours,
INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
