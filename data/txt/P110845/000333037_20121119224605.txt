                               Extension of Closing Date


1.     The closing date for Albania, Disaster Risk Mitigation and Adaptation Project,
Credit No 4460 AL, Project ID P110845, will be extended from February 28, 2013 until
June 30, 2013.

2.     The project implementation shows continued progress and its objectives are
achievable. The project ratings for Implementation Progress (IP) and Project
Development Objective (PDO) in the last Implementation Status Report (ISR) are
Moderately Satisfactory. The total combined amount of the disbursements and
commitments (under the credit and loan) are €6.07 million or about 93 percent of the total
loan and credit amount. All project activities are in the implementation pipeline.

3.     The emergency response capacity of the General Directorate for Civil
Emergencies is gradually being strengthened through the acquisition of emergency
response equipment and already established the National Emergency Command and
Control Center. The feasibility study for the creation of an Integrated Emergency Call
System 112 was completed. A National Operation Center at the Ministry of Interior in
Tirana was established and a parallel Center was set up at the new Institute of
Geosciences, Energy, Water and Environment (IGEWE) headquarters, as well as two
provincial centers for civil emergencies. The process of upgrading the monitoring and
forecasting system via the Automated Hydro-meteorological Network and Central Data
Management System is being launched. The development of National Guidelines for the
Adaptation of European Building Codes was completed and the training and
dissemination workshop conducted. The integration of Eurocode 8 (the seismic code) will
provide Albania with the basis for a new building code. Albania is a member of the
Catastrophe Risk Insurance Facility (CRIF) and there is a steady progress in cat insurance
product development and work on the web-based insurance platform.

4.       Despite good progress and due to initial delays, the completion of a number of
critical activities (such as the installation of the hydromet network, delivery of last
tranches of the emergency response equipment, development of the insurance products,
etc.) fall on or just about the current closing date of the project of February 28, 2013.
The development of the National Disaster Risk Management Strategy will extend beyond
that day. Moreover, ensuring the calibration, data flow and hydromet products delivery
will likely require more time after the observation network is installed. Therefore, the
extension of the closing date of the Credit 4460 AL was requested by the Government of
Albania (via a letter dated November 1, 2012) in order to allow for full achievement the
DRMAP project development objectives.

5.     This will be a second extension of the project. The first one extended its duration
by 12 months. With the proposed second extension of 4 months, the cumulative
extension of the project will be total 16 months.
