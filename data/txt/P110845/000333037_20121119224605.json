The emergency response\n            capacity of the General Directorate for civil emergencies is\n            gradually being strengthened through the acquisition of\n            emergency response equipment and already established the\n            national emergency command and control center. The\n            feasibility study for the creation of an integrated\n            emergency call system 112 was completed. A national\n            operation center at the Ministry of Interior in Tirana was\n            established and a parallel Center was set up at the new\n            Institute of Geosciences, Energy, Water and Environment\n            (IGEWE) headquarters, as well as two provincial centers for\n            civil emergencies. The process of upgrading the monitoring\n            and forecasting system via the automated\n            hydro-meteorological network and central data management\n            system is being launched. The development of national\n            guidelines for the adaptation of European building codes was\n            completed and the training and dissemination workshop\n            conducted. The integration of Euro code 8 (the seismic code)\n            will provide Albania with the basis for a new building code.\n            Albania is a member of the Catastrophe Risk Insurance\n            Facility (CRIF) and there is a steady progress in cat\n            insurance product development and work on the web-based\n            insurance platform. This will be a second extension of the\n            project. The first one extended its duration by 12 months.\n            With the second extension of 4 months, the cumulative\n            extension of the project will be total 16 months."}, "docdt": "2012-11-15T00:00:00Z"}
