         DISASTER RISK MITIGATION AND ADAPTATION PROJECT

                             RESTRUCTURING PAPER



A. SUMMARY

This Restructuring Paper seeks approval of the following proposed changes and
adjustments to the Albania Disaster Risk Mitigation and Adaptation Project (DRMAP):

   (i) reallocation between the disbursement categories of the IDA Credit and IBRD
        loan proceeds;
   (ii) extension of the credit and loan closing dates by 12 months; and
   (iii) revisions to the project results and monitoring framework.

The proposed restructuring does not entail revisions to the Project Development
Objective (PDO), total project costs, or the percentage of financed expenditures. There is
no change to the current safeguards category A. The described changes were discussed
with the Government and requested through letters from the Ministry of Finance dated
December 2, 2011, and September 9, 2010.


B. PROJECT STATUS

Project implementation shows continued progress in the last year, i.e., since December
2010 from its mid-term point. Effectiveness of the credit and the loan were delayed by
about a year due to the later than expected establishment of the Project Management
Team, and delays in the registration and establishment of the Catastrophe Risk Insurance
Facility. The project ratings for Implementation Progress (IP) and PDO were upgraded in
the last two ISRs to Moderately Satisfactory. The procurement rating is Satisfactory, and
the financial management rating is Moderately Satisfactory due to delays in the provision
of counterpart funding. There are no outstanding audit reports and all audit reports were
found satisfactory to the Bank.

Currently, almost all project activities are at various stages of procurement or have been
contracted. To date, total disbursements amount to US$ 3.1 million, of which US$ 2.28
million is from IBRD and US$ 0.78 million is from IDA. The value of commitments
under ongoing contracts is about US$2.6 million. Despite the gained momentum in
implementation, disbursements show a lag of about 49 percent (2 months). The delays in
the provision of the counterpart funding negatively affected the disbursements and the
situation was exacerbated by foreign financing ceilings imposed by the Ministry of
Finance in November 2011 due to the adverse impact of the Euro zone crisis on
economic growth, budget revenues and public debt level. Recently, sufficient allocations
were confirmed in the 2012 national budget with regard for both foreign and counterpart

                                            6
financing of project implementation. Therefore, it is expected that disbursement will
show a significant increase in the coming months.



C. PROPOSED CHANGES


   1. Results/indicators

The Project Development Objective (PDOs) is to strengthened institutional capacities (a)
to reduce Albania’s vulnerability to natural and man-made hazards; and (b) to limit
human, economic and financial losses due to disasters. No changes to the PDO are
proposed. It should be recognized that this PDO was designed for a longer than one
project timeframe using the Adaptable Program Lending (APL), and the current DRMAP
operation contributes to its achievement by strengthening the institutional capacities,
decreasing the vulnerability to disasters, and limiting financial losses by transferring
catastrophe risk to the international (re)insurance markets. However, the reduction in
human, economic and financial losses cannot be measured within the timeframe of this
project.

The proposed amendments aim at improving the results framework by bringing more
consistency and realism, reflecting the proposed loan and credit closing date extension
and reallocation, and making the results more measurable. The details of the proposed
revisions are included in Annex 1.


   2. Reallocations

The proposed changes do not affect the total project cost but include the reallocations
between the disbursement categories of the IBRD loan and IDA Credit. There is no
change to the percentages of the expenditure to be financed under the credit and the loan.

With regard to the reallocations within the IBRD loan, these were necessitated by the
exchange rate fluctuations of US$ vis a vis Euro (the currency of the loan) which resulted
in a lower than agreed equity contribution to the Catastrophe Risk Insurance Facility
(US$1.779 million instead of US$2 million). Therefore, the Government requested Euro
185,000 to be reallocated from Consulting Services to the Membership Contribution
under the project.

Due to changes in Government priorities, the decrease in Consulting Services will mean
that some of the originally foreseen activities have to be dropped at this stage from the
Procurement Plan. This includes: the review and update of the emergency response
legislation, development of emergency response procedures, and training for first
responders. Also, the needs with regard to the support to Operation Costs are lower than
originally estimated. The IBRD Designated Account was inactive for the last 7 months;
however, once the reallocation of the loan proceeds is effective, the disbursement will be
made to fill the current gap in the membership fee to the SEEC CRIF. About Euro
215,000 is allocated for TA, procurement of which is in progress and planned to be
completed within next two months

     3. Closing date

The Loan and Credit Closing Dates are proposed to be extended by 12 months, from the
current closing date of February 28, 2012 to February 28, 2013. This is a first extension
of the project.


                                             8
Most activities for this operation are at various stages of procurement or have been
contracted. However, the completion of all initiated activities span beyond the current
closing date. These include: the development of the National Disaster Risk Management
Strategy and Investment Plan and provision of a variety of emergency response
equipment under Component 1; digitization of climate and weather data and installation
of the hydrometeorological observation network under Component 2; development of
National Plan and Guidelines for Building Eurocode 8 adoption under Component 3; and
establishment of a consumer website for the Catastrophe Regional Insurance Facility in
Albania under Component 4. All contracts are expected to be completed prior to February
2013.
