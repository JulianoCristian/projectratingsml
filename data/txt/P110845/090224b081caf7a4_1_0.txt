                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The objective of the Albania Disaster Risk Mitigation and Adapation Project (AL-DRMAP) is to strengthen institutional capacities (a) to reduce Albania's vulnerability to
                         natural and man-made hazards; and (b) to limit human, economic, and financial losses due to these disasters.

                         Prior to the project, the country was inadequately prepared for natural hazards to which it is highly prone on a periodical basis. Its hydro-meteorological services and equipment did
                         not meet international standards to contribute to regional observation data networks and forecast models. The institution lacked a basic monitoring network. Observation data
                         collected manually, in hard copy and only periodically faxed to the central office, lacked credibility and accuracy. Weather alerts were not transmitted to users, such as the

                         emergency response services, which themselves lacked technical capacity to respond to disasters, such as frequent floods and wild fires. First responders lacked basic equipment,
                         which was often dilapidated, relying on external assistance from neighboring countries (e.g. Italy). Emergency management authorities lacked a central operational center to
                         coordinate response to disasters linked through modern ITC technologies with other institutions. Building codes were outdated and not conforming to EC safety standards. The
                         catastrophe insurance market operators have been selling policies which in fact could not be paid out in case a major disaster due to low accumulated capital and lack of re-
                         insurance.

                         The project experienced two years of delay in the implementation and only started to turn around after the Mid-term review. After 3 years of intense effort by the Government and the
                         Bank, along with other donors and international institutions, a modest project funding has dramatically improved Albania's institutional capacities to reduce its vulnerability to natural
                         and man-made hazards and to limit future losses. Consequently, the PDO has been achieved and the disaster risk management strategy developed under the project will guide the
                         government in advancing this agenda into the future.

                         Key accomplishments under the project include:
                         •          Notable impact on the institutional development of the four implementing agencies, i.e. General Directorate of civil Emergencies (GDCE) at Ministry of Interior (MOI), Institute
                         of Geosciences Environment, Water and Energy (IGEWE), Ministry of Public Works and Transport (MOPWT) and Financial Supervisory Agency (FSA).
                         •          Finalization of the revisions to building codes (Eurocode 8). As a result of this effort, the Govt has now added four additional codes to comply with EU standards.
                         •          The Disaster Risk Mitigation Strategy and prioritized Investment Program have been prepared by the Government.
                         •          The new hydromet products meet WMO standards. Real time data along with the digitized historical data will shortly be published on the IGEWE website. The weather alerts
                         for wild fire and flood weather products in a form of daily bulletins are transmitted daily the emergency management authorities.
                         • Regional efforts on catastrophic risk insurance are on track, with Albania the first of 3 countries to join Europa Re. Modules of an Interactive Consumer Awareness and Education
                         Website was developed and All a legal and regulatory aspects framework have has been completed, but awaiting other regional efforts to finalize technical and other aspects to
                         launch this regional program, expected by in 2014. The draft law on insurance has been submitted for approval.
                         •          Following the floods in Shkodra District in 2010, A GFDRR TF financed a comprehensive study on flood risk management in Drini-Buna river basin, detailing options for
                         mitigation measures.
                         •          Establishment of a National Emergency and Command Control and Training Center to improve coordination during an emergency response.
