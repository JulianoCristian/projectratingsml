1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

Country context. Albania is vulnerable to a number of man-made and natural disaster risks such
as earthquakes, floods and drought. Compounded with the lack of catastrophe insurance, these
risks could have devastating effects on Albania’s population, its economy and growth prospects.
In fact, the floods in Albania in 2002 recorded economic damage of US$17.5 million. The
maximum potential probable losses in Albania from a disaster with a 250-year mean return period
(MRP) are estimated at US$2.3 billion for earthquakes and US$1.3 billion for floods. Albania has
one of the highest seismicity ratings in Europe. Considering that buildings in Albania were not
built to acceptable construction standards, the impacts of earthquakes on the built environment
was of major concern. Weather forecasting is intrinsically difficult, as precipitation is naturally
highly variable and Albania’s topography enables floods to develop rapidly. The Albanian
economy is sensitive to weather conditions, given the importance of agriculture, hydropower,
fisheries, and tourism.

Despite the serious risks, Albania’s organizational and technical capacities to respond effectively
to emergencies were extremely low prior to the project, and the country was not equipped for
management of natural disaster risks. Albania’s weather, climate and hydrological services
agency (IGEWE) and its products did not meet international standards such as those set by the
WMO, and could not contribute to the regional observation data network and forecast models.
The IGEWE was lacking the basic monitoring network; the observation data was collected
manually, in hard copies which were periodically faxed to the central office; the forecast based on
these inputs lacked credibility and accuracy, and the weather alerts were not transmitted to the
end-users. The historical observation data, critical to engineering designs and climate and risk
assessments, was stored in fragile hard copies and was not accessible when it needs to be.

The emergency response authorities lacked adequate technical capacity to respond to disasters,
such as frequent floods and wild fires. The responders lacked basic equipment, relying on
external assistance from neighboring countries and dilapidated equipment, still in stock from
early 1990s. There was no central operational center to coordinate response to disasters that
would be linked through modern ITC technologies with any other institutions.

Moreover, building codes were outdated and not conforming to the European safety standards.
Taking into account high vulnerability of Albania to seismic risks, the Eurocode 8 on structural
safety was of particular importance and needed to be urgently updated taking into account very
dynamic construction development in the urban centers.

The catastrophe insurance market operators have been selling policies which in fact could not be
paid out in case a major disaster due to the low accumulated capital and lack of re-insurance. The
insurance regulatory framework was not conducive to introduction and development of
sustainable catastrophe risk insurance market.

In this context, the Albania Disaster Risk Mitigation and Adaptation Project (AL-DRMAP) was
developed as part of a regional disaster risk mitigation and adaptation program for South Eastern
European (SEE) countries.




                                                1
Government strategy. Under communist rule, Albania’s military was responsible for emergency
management, focusing mostly on response rather than mitigation or prevention activities. Since
the end of the communist regime, Albania has made great strides towards developing an
emergency management system. In 1999, to coordinate assistance during the Kosovo refugee
crisis, an Emergency Management Group (EMG) was established under the Office of the Prime
Minister. After the refugee crisis, the Government dissolved the EMG and passed a series of
Laws and Decrees to establish a new emergency management system. In 2001, the Government
of Albania passed Law No. 8756, “Civil Emergency Services,” which identifies Government-
wide emergency management roles and responsibilities. In 2002 and 2003, the Council of
Ministers further clarified Albania’s emergency management system by passing Decision 532,
“Liabilities and Tasks of the Civil Emergency Planning and Response Department”, Decision 655,
“Establishment and Functioning of the National System Structure on Civil Emergency Planning
and Response” and Decision 664, “Criteria and Procedures of Proclamation on the Civil
Emergency Situation.” In 2004, with assistance from UNDP/DFID, the Albanian Government
developed a National Civil Emergency Plan (NCEP). The plan outlines various phases of
disasters, from identifying hazards to activating the National Civil Emergency Service System.
The NCEP was approved by the Council of Ministers and given legal status. However, Albania
did not have a comprehensive and country-wide disaster risk management strategy, which the
project was to help develop.

Rationale for Bank involvement. The World Bank has long been engaged in assisting countries
to recover from catastrophes and to reduce vulnerability to hazards, primarily natural hazards.
From 1984 to 2006, for example, the Bank financed 528 projects that addressed natural disasters,
comprising more than US$26 billion in lending. Traditionally, reconstruction assistance has been
provided in the aftermath of disasters. However, in recent years, the Bank has shifted its focus
toward support for disaster preparedness and mitigation, and catastrophe risk financing. Over
time, the Bank has developed specialized expertise and knowledge in the area of hazard risk
management. Some key policy tools and knowledge products have been developed by the Bank
in partnership with other organizations, including post-disaster damage and needs assessment,
hazard and vulnerability assessment, and risk-transfer instruments, among others. Increasingly, in
response to requests from client countries, the Bank has shifted its focus to supporting disaster
risk mitigation operations.

The Bank has prepared a regional South Eastern Europe Disaster Risk Mitigation and Adaptation
Program (SEE-DRMAP) framework, of which the Albania Disaster Risk Mitigation and
Adaptation project (AL-DRMAP) is the first project. In the Europe and Central Asia (ECA)
region, there has been an increased recognition of the importance of the proactive measures for
disaster preparedness and risk management. The Bank has supported several programs in disaster
risk reduction; the regional SEE-DRMAP together with “vertical” operations, such as the AL-
DRMAP, will advance the region’s disaster risk management and adaptation agenda based on the
experience gained in ECA and other regions. As part of the regional SEE-DRMAP, this project
was designed as the first phase of Adaptable Program Lending (APL), to ensure that Albania was
accompanied and supported regionally in its disaster risk mitigation and adaptation work.

Higher level objectives to which the project contributes. There is a body of evidence which
suggests that disasters have a particularly severe impact on the poor. Natural and man-made
disasters are major source of risk to the poor people who tend to live in the disaster-prone areas
and are not able to cope with the effects of such hazards. Recurrent disasters erode their already
minimal assets and livelihoods. The importance of hazard mitigation was underscored by
inclusion in Section IV of the Millennium Development Goals (MDG) Declaration of a goal “to
intensify our collective efforts to reduce the number and effects of natural and man-made


                                                2
disasters.” In this context, by supporting hazard risk management efforts the project intended to
contribute to the objective of poverty alleviation and protection of the most vulnerable groups of
societies.

Disasters have negative macroeconomic impacts as measured by the cost of damages as a
percentage of GDP. This share is much higher in developing countries than in the developed
ones. Since disasters pose a threat to economic growth, the project was to contribute to the
economic development of Albania by supporting measures that would limit and decrease
potential financial, fiscal, economic, and human losses due to disasters.

The Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) of Albania for the period of FY11-14 highlights the
importance of addressing natural disasters to achieve the country’s development goals. As such,
the CPS recognized the reduction of vulnerability to climate change and increasing disaster
preparedness as one of the strategy’s three key objectives. The CPS also supports Albania’s
integration in the SEE region and the EU. The participation of Albania in the regional SEE-
DRMAP through the project was to enhance this integration further. The Bank’s worldwide
experience in risk management indicates that there is a direct consequential link between disasters
and poverty; the occurrence of disasters hampers achievement of the MDGs. Since disasters may
set the country back from its development path and constitute a significant risk to its economic
growth, improvements in disaster risk reduction efforts are of key importance to Albania.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

The AL-DRMAP was the initial project of the broader regional SEE-DRMAP framework. The
objective of the AL-DRMAP was to strengthen institutional capacities: (a) to reduce Albania's
vulnerability to natural and man-made hazards; and (b) to limit human, economic, and financial
losses due to these disasters.

The AL-DRMAP, designed as APL, comprised two phases. The first phase was to focus on
consolidating and upgrading Albania’s capacity to plan for, mitigate and respond to disasters.
This phase was to provide financing for mostly soft measures consisting of activities and
investments that will build Government capacity to effectively respond to natural and man-made
disasters. The second phase was to be triggered by achievement of the first phase activities,
specifically the development and approval of a comprehensive countrywide disaster risk
reduction and adaptation strategy which was to define priority actions and an investment program
to be implemented in the second phase.

It should be noted that this PDO was designed for a longer timeframe including the two phases of
the APL, and the first phase AL-DRMAP operation was to contribute to PDO achievement by
strengthening the institutional capacities that would help decrease the vulnerability to disasters
and limit financial losses by transferring catastrophe risk to the international (re)insurance
markets.

The achievement of the project objective was originally to be measured by the following PDO
indicators:

       A Disaster Risk Mitigation Strategy and prioritized Investment Program agreed by
        Government;
       User-assessed value of weather forecasts and disaster alerts (target: US$0.5 million
        annually);



                                                3
       New building code developed in accordance with European standards; and,
       SEE Catastrophic Risk Insurance Facility is established and policies sold to businesses
        and households (target: 10% penetration rate).

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification

The PDO was not revised during the Project. The Key Indicators were revised at the first project
restructuring in January 2012 as shown below. In addition, the quantitative targets to measure the
original indicators (such as the user-assessed value of weather forecast and the insurance
penetration rate) were dropped altogether as these were regarded as unrealistic.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

The main beneficiaries of the Project are the general public and businesses that are located in
disaster-prone areas and are vulnerable to the negative impacts of various types of hazards in
Albania. Officials at target institutions are also beneficiaries as they were to get trained and their
capacity developed. These institutions include: General Directorate of Civil Emergencies
(GDCE) at the Ministry of Interior (MOI), Institute of Geosciences, Energy, Water and
Environment (IGEWE) in the Ministry of Education and Science (MOES), the Ministry of Public
Works and Transport (MOPWT), and the Ministry of Finance (MOF).

1.5 Original Components

The Project was composed of the five components described below to achieve the project
objective. It should be noted that this was a blended project which was supported by both an IDA
credit and an IBRD loan. The credit financed the main project for disaster preparedness and risk
mitigation, and the loan financed the CRIF-related activities under the component 4. The IDA-
financed components focused on mitigating catastrophic risk while the IBRD-financed
component was to cover those risks that could not be mitigated.




                                                  4
Component 1: Disaster Risk Management and Preparedness. The component objective was
to support capacity building for emergency response mechanism through provision of necessary
equipment, and strengthening disaster risk mitigation planning.

Specific activities included in the original component are as follows:
    Strengthening disaster risk mitigation planning and emergency management
             o Review and update the emergency response legislative framework
             o Develop national disaster risk management strategy and investment program
             o Prepare and implement a public awareness and education program
    Enhancement of emergency response capacity
             o Procure emergency response equipment
             o Strengthen existing emergency operations center
             o Prepare feasibility studies for establishment of an emergency communications
                  system
             o Develop emergency response procedures
             o Prepare and implement exercises and training for first responders

Component 2: Strengthening of Hydro-meteorological Services. The component objective
was that disaster risk managers (including households, farmers, and forest managers) receive
more-timely, more-accurate hydro-meteorological forecasts and services and consequently
undertake more-beneficial preparatory measures to limit weather risks.

Specific activities included in the original component are as follows:
    Increasing accessibility of data
    Upgrading the monitoring network
    Developing capacity to prepare forecast products tailored to disaster management

Component 3: Development of Building Codes. The component objective was to reduce
hazard risks through development of improved building codes and mechanisms for introduction
of improved standards.

Specific activities included in the original component are as follows:
    Building Code Development.
    Licensing of Engineers
    Training of Engineers

Component 4: Catastrophe Insurance. The main objective of the component was to make
catastrophe insurance available to Albanian households and SMEs through the establishment of
the SEE Catastrophic Risk Insurance Facility, of which Albania will be a shareholder and
member.

Specific activities included in the original component are as follows:
    Securing Albania’s membership in the SEE Catastrophic Risk Insurance Facility by
        paying membership contribution
    Establishing the presence of the Facility in the Albanian insurance market
    Establishing an interactive consumer education website on disaster risk and disaster risk
        insurance




                                                 5
Component 5: Project Management. The component was to finance some of the project
management costs, such as the procurement and financial management consultants, the
monitoring and evaluation activities, communication expenses, reporting and audits.

1.6 Revised Components

Revision of Components. Some of the planned activities were revised/ dropped from the original
components. The table below shows the summary of changes made to the components. The
details of the outputs by component are described in Annex 2 of this report.

Additional study to respond to flood events during the Project. As part of the response to the
major flood events which occurred in January and December 2010 during the project period, the
World Bank agreed to conduct a study through Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and
Recovery (GFDRR) funding in order to assist the Government of Albania to prepare a
comprehensive flood risk assessment and management plan for the Lower Drini-Buna Basin,
including options for flood risk mitigation measures.

The Study includes the details of the proposed works to be undertaken in the medium term
(within a five-year period). This includes drawings at preliminary design level, together with cost
estimates and maps showing the calculated extents and depths of residual flooding throughout the
Study Area with the implementation of these works.

In addition to the proposed works for the medium term, the Flood Risk Management Plan for the
study area, as set out in the study report, includes recommendations for non-structural and longer
term measures to reduce the risk and impact of flooding in the Basin. Terms of reference have
been prepared for additional studies required in respect of such measures.

7 Other significant changes
The Project underwent two restructurings.

First restructuring (January 2012). The first restructuring made the following amendments:
(i) reallocation between the disbursement categories of the IDA credit and IBRD loan proceeds;
(ii) extension of the credit and loan closing dates by 12 months; and (iii) revisions to the project
results and monitoring framework. However, this restructuring did not entail revisions to the PDO,
total project costs, safeguards category, or the financing percentage.

The amendments aimed at improving the results framework by bringing more consistency and
realism, reflecting the proposed loan and credit closing date extension and reallocation, and the
implementation status at that time.

With regard to the reallocations within the IBRD loan, these were necessitated by the exchange
rate fluctuations of US$ vis-a-vis Euro (the currency of the loan), which resulted in a lower than
agreed equity contribution to the Catastrophe Risk Insurance Facility (US$1.779 million instead
of US$2 million). Therefore, the Government of Albania requested Euro 185,000 to be
reallocated from Consulting Services to the Membership Contribution under the project.

Most activities for this operation were at various stages of procurement or had been contracted.
However, the completion of all initiated activities was anticipated to go beyond the original
closing date of February 28, 2012. Therefore, a 12-momth extension was sought and approved.

Second restructuring (November 2012). The second restructuring extended the closing date from
February 28, 2013 to June 30, 2013. Even though the Project showed good progress in spite of the
initial delays, the completion of a number of critical activities (such as the installation of the
hydromet network, delivery of last tranches of the emergency response equipment, development
of the insurance products, development of a national disaster risk management strategy and
investment plan, etc.) fell on or just about the previous closing date of February 28, 2013.
Therefore, it was necessary to extend the closing date once again.

Extension of ICR deadline. In December 2013, an extension of the ICR deadline from December
31, 2013 to April 30, 2014 was sought and approved. The extension was justified due to the fact
that the factors beyond the project's control are somewhat delaying the achievement and
assessment of full project results. These factors include: (i) the general election in June 2013 and
subsequent change in government in September 2013, which delayed a handing-over of some of
the assets created under the project and putting in place the operational arrangements for them;
and (ii) delays in operationalization of the regional re-insurance company (Europe Re) under the
Southeastern Europe Catastrophic Risk Insurance Facility (SEE-CRIF).

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

Background analysis. Lessons learned from previous sector projects were adequately reflected in
the project design, including: (i) focusing on ex-ante disaster risk reduction measures considering
the importance of risk reduction acknowledged by the international community;(ii) adopting
comprehensive and strategic approach to disaster risk management through integrated multi-
hazard disaster risk reduction; (iii) adopting a programmatic regional approach rather than
individual country approaches for effectiveness; (iv) considering the importance of dissemination



                                                 7
of high-quality forecasts; and (v) considering the importance of operation and maintenance of
hydromet investments. Based on these lessons learned, the project design adopted a multi-hazard
approach with focus on disaster risk reduction. The project design was also to enable Albania to
participate in the global exchange of data and information through WMO.

Funding arrangement. As noted, the AL-DRMAP was designed as a part of the regional SEE-
DRMAP. This project was supposed to be the first of a two-phase Adaptable Program Loan
(APL) for Albania. The APL instrument was determined to be the appropriate lending instrument
during the project preparation phase, since it allows for phased accessibility of funds for the
investments increasing country preparedness for and resilience to hazards and disasters. The first
phase was to establish a coordinated and consistent policy framework and strengthened
institutional capacity for second phase investments in equipment and infrastructure, and the
capacity to respond. This phasing of projects with trigger requirements to lead to the second
phase through the APL was considered necessary to ensure that the relevant institutions of the
Government of Albania have the necessary strategy, and institutional arrangement and capacity
are in place for further investments for disaster mitigation measures.

Risk assessment. The overall project risk was considered Moderate at appraisal, with three key
risks identified. These risks included: (i) weak institutional capacity and governance; (ii) limited
cooperation and coordination among government agencies; and (iii) lack of regional participation
in SEE-CRIF. While these risks were rightly identified, it appears that the Bank underestimated
the second and third risks, which were main causes of the delays in project implementation.

Effectiveness Delays. The effectiveness deadline was extended four times, and the Credit and the
Loan finally became effective in June and November 2009, respectively. The delays were caused
by the borrower’s inability to meet the effectiveness conditions such as: (i) establishment of a
project management team (PMT) at GDCE and implementation teams at three other agencies; (ii)
establishment of project steering committee; (iii) establishment of a DRM strategy working
group; and (iv) establishment of SEE-CRIF as a legal entity (this last one was an effectiveness
condition for the Loan). Particularly, recruitment of a procurement specialist critical to make the
PMU functional took a very long time and this procurement was finalized only in March 2010 (21
months after the Board approval).

Quality at Entry. There are mainly two aspects related to Quality at Entry, which are: (i) project
design; and (ii) project readiness. The project design was appropriate as it rightly focused on
building institutional capacities as a prerequisite to proceed to an investment operation in this
field. The project design covered several different fronts such as disaster preparedness, hydro-
meteorological services, building codes and risk transfer, which made it mandatory to involve
multiple agencies and caused some complexity. However, these were the essential and critical
elements of disaster risk management in Albania, and this design was deemed necessary.

On contrary, project readiness was inappropriate. In addition to the lack of institutional
arrangements critical to implementing the project (mentioned above in the section of
Effectiveness Delays), neither the TORs for key technical assistance/studies nor technical
specifications for emergency equipment/automated hydro-meteorological monitoring stations
were prepared during project preparation. The need for a Project Operational Manual was only
raised after the project became effective




                                                 8
2.2 Implementation

Inception of the Project. The project experienced significant delays in the initial years of
implementation due mainly to the lack of effective institutional arrangements and low readiness
described above. The only notable disbursement under the project for the first 2.5 years after
Board approval was the payment for the membership contribution to the SEE-CRIF out of the
Loan element of the project. As a result, the project was in a problem status for most of the first
three years with unsatisfactory or moderately unsatisfactory ratings for both PDO and IP. Both
PDO and IP were upgraded to moderately satisfactory in June 2011 (only eight months before the
original closing date) as project key activities started to move.

Mid-Term Review. The mid-term review was conducted in December 2010, two months after the
original schedule. Given the significant delays in implementation, not many project activities
were underway when the mid-term review took place. Therefore, the mid-term review focused on
identification of the necessary reallocation of project funds between categories, which included:
(i) an increase in membership fee for SEE-CRIF necessitated by the fluctuation in currency
exchange rate; and (ii) an increase in Goods category to procure more emergency equipment to
respond to the serious floods in Shkodra Region. The mid-term review also led to some minor
adjustments to the project activities such as: (i) allocation of more funds from IT/database
establishment to the extension of the hydro-met monitoring network under the component 2; and
(ii) dropping of licensing engineers under the component 3. The mid-term review also facilitated
revisions to project’s results framework.

Restructuring. While the mid-term review in December 2010 identified the necessary reallocation
of project funds, the formal project restructuring (the first restructuring) was approved only in
January 2012. This delay was mainly caused by the lack of government’s action to send a formal
letter to the Bank to request this reallocation. While the restructuring was approved by the Bank
and formally communicated to the government in January 2012, the modifications in the project
were not confirmed by countersignature of the government for a long time. The ambiguity of the
effectiveness of the modifications, and particularly, in the reallocation of the Loan and Credit
proceeds, caused a stalemate in payments and signing of new contracts, further delaying
implementation at the very late stage of the project. As a result, IP was downgraded to moderately
unsatisfactory rating in June 2012 while PDO was kept as moderately satisfactory. The
countersignature by the government was finally provided in September 2012 (IP was upgraded to
moderately satisfactory at this point), by which time it was apparent that some project activities
could not be completed by the new closing date (February 28, 2013) extended by the first
restructuring. Subsequently, the second restructuring was necessary to extend the closing date for
another six months till June 30, 2013.

SEE-CRIF. There were also delays in establishing the regional SEE-CRIF and operationalizing
the re-insurance company (Europe Re). However, this was beyond the control of the Albanian
Government or any implementing agencies of the project. The Europe Re is now licensed under
the Swiss law and has become operational as of the end of March, 2014.

Partnerships. Overall, after a few years of intense efforts from the Government and Bank side,
along with other donors and international institutions, the modest project resources substantially
improved Albania's institutional capacities to deal with disaster risks. This was possible due to the
excellent collaboration with the Italian Civil Protection, which tailored the Technical Assistance
financed by the Government of Italy to supplement the Bank-funded project, particularly in
relation to the Components 1 and 2. The project was also developed and implemented in close
collaboration with the UNISDR and WMO. During the supervision phase, joint missions with


                                                 9
Italian Civil Protection and WMO were carried out along with closely consulted implementation
support provided to the beneficiary institutions.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

Design. The overall responsibility for project monitoring and evaluation was vested with the PMT
at the MOI, supported by the implementation teams in the IGEWE, MOF, and MOPWT based on
the institutional arrangement of the Project. The original design of the project’s M&E included
the public surveys of households, farmers, and forest fire managers to assess the availability of
disseminated information and emergency warning and the value of such new information to the
users.

Implementation. Project reporting substantially improved towards the final years of project
implementation. PMT/M&E specialist prepared and sent to the Bank the Progress Reports on a
regular basis during this period. Besides the usual reporting on the progress of implementation of
activities per component, the last two project reports provided detailed information on the
achievement of the project objective based on outcome and intermediate indicators outlined in the
project results framework. A comprehensive Implementation Completion Report was also
provided, with thorough analysis of project performance and useful lessons learnt.

Utilization. Given that project implementation was delayed substantially and most project
activities took place in the last two years, there was little utilization of results of project’s M&E
which focused mainly on monitoring progress and outputs of project activities, rather than
outcomes/impacts. The original results framework contained some measurable indicators with
yearly targets, such as: (i) user-assessed value of weather forecasts; (ii) percentage of people
aware of availability of seven-day forecasts; and (iii) penetration rate of the catastrophic risk
insurance. But it was not possible to monitor these indicators due mainly to the implementation
delays, and these indicators were eventually dropped, let alone the public surveys mentioned
above. It is still a good idea for each agency to monitor some of these original indicators in the
future once the project benefits are fully realized.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

Safeguard policies. The Project’s compliance with the Bank’s safeguards policies were reviewed
at appraisal to ensure that all potential issues had been taken into account in the Project’s design.
In sum, the Project did not trigger the Bank safeguard policies. However, as a matter of due
diligence, it was decided that the disaster risk mitigation strategy to be developed under the
project would identify whether future displacement/resettlement would be likely to be called for,
and if so, should indicate the actions needed to carry this out in compliance with the requirements
of OP 4.12.

Environmental category rating. The Project was a technical assistance project and as such, under
OP 4.01, was determined to be environmental assessment category “C.” If the project were to
advance to the APL second-phase, which would involve civil works, the PMT implementation
teams in consultation with the World Bank project team would define and prepare the appropriate
safeguard due diligence requirements, in compliance with World Bank safeguard policies.

Procurement. The procurement performance of the Project was moderately satisfactory. The
procurement capacity in the PMT was sufficient. However, delays were encountered with the
selection of the consultants for various activities. These delays, according to the PMT, were
attributed mainly to the appointment of members of Evaluation Committee from different


                                                 10
ministries. The procurement documents are archived to the MOI’s central archive following the
rules of this institution. The filing was made in a satisfactory way, although there is room for a
better segregation of contracts’ files indicating the beginning and completion of each procurement
procedure and preparation of an index for each folder. A post review was conducted jointly with
financial management staff and its results were recorded in a post-review report.

Financial management. The project disbursement and financial management arrangements were
adequate including project accounting and reporting arrangements, internal control procedures,
planning and budgeting, and audit. Therefore, the financial management arrangements are
considered as “satisfactory”. The Government also ensured a smooth closure of the project with
appropriate staffing arrangements during the grace period, financial management related manual
and electronic documentation handover and archive, final audit period arrangements, etc.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

Finalization of the Disaster Risk Management Strategy and Investment Plan. The project was
supposed to finance a Technical Assistance to develop a National Disaster Risk Management
Strategy and Investment Plan. The original idea was that the Phase 2 of the APL would finance
implementation of the Strategy and Investment Plan. In fact, this was a dated covenant, which
was to be achieved by January 31, 2010. However, delays in preparation of TORs and the
subsequent procurement process led to the very late start of the consultancy (only in late 2012).
As a result, a draft strategy and investment plan were drafted but not finalized before the twice-
extended closing date of June 30, 2013.

This activity needs to be finalized by the newly-formed government, as the document will not
only provide the strategic framework for disaster risk management for the five upcoming years,
but more importantly will help prioritize actions to address major disaster risks in the country.
This includes consideration of available government resources, its capacity for operations and
maintenance, as well as future resources to be mobilized. The draft version of the strategy exists,
which will need to be reviewed, revised, finalized and adopted by the new government. The Bank
is willing to support this strategy formulation further if the government is interested. As the
Strategy and Investment Plan have not been finalized, it is uncertain at this point whether there
will be the Phase 2 operation of the APL as originally planned.

Operations and maintenance of hydro-meteorological observing stations. The project financed
modernization of 40 automated hydro-meteorological monitoring stations across the country.
Project completion coincided with the general election in June 2013 in Albania. The election and
subsequent change in the government have delayed a handing-over of these monitoring stations
and particularly, operational arrangements for them were not in place immediately. A new head
of IGEWE was appointed by the new government only in November 2013.

All hydro-meteorological data was supposed to be transmitted by General Packet Radio Service
(GPRS) which requires fast speed internet or bandwidth to transmit the data from station
locations to the internet where it is saved in a data base. Monthly costs of the required high
internet bandwidth are estimated to be about Euro 1,000 for collecting and processing the data
from 40 hydro-meteorological observing stations. The new government approved the operational
budget of IGEWE in early April 2014, and it has been reported that the real-time data from the
majority of these stations are now flowing as of the middle of April 2014.

Real time data from the 6 satellite stations is currently being transmitted directly to EUMETSAT
in Germany and the data is forwarded onto the WMO GTS. The contractor needs to establish


                                                11
functionality for the GTS message switching software at IGEWE and train the staff how to
operate and maintain the downlink and communications software. This will allow IGEWE to
receive the 6 synoptic stations continuously via the downlink at IGEWE and re-transmit to WMO
by way of the GTS.

There are some problems with equipment malfunctioning (for about 8 stations out of 40), which
need to be fixed. Also a lack of proper sensor data calibration needs to be done by the vendor in
cooperation with IGEWE. In late March 2014, the Bank and IGEWE agreed on an Action Plan to
fix these problems and to put in place all operational arrangements including staff training in the
operations and maintenance of the hardware and software.

IGEWE website and data platform. The IGEWE website is running, and 3-day and 7-day
bulletins are published. Ten years of historical meteorological data and 20 years of historical
hydrological data were digitized under the project. According to WMO, the real time data
collected by this project needs to be merged with the digitized data to meet the CDMS WMO
standard. As of the end of March 2014, both the real time data and the archived historical
hydrometeorological data are stored in standard SQL DBMS format. This meets the WMO
standards and is being merged into a singular and remotely accessible (password protected)
database. IGEWE needs to maintain the website and database from now on.

Legal adoption of building codes. Key sections of the Eurocode 8 (earthquake resistance) were
prepared, including national parameters, under the project for adopting European standards of
building designs. A national plan for revisions of building codes has been developed. The code
was widely disseminated and training was provided for local engineers and architects. The code,
when made effective, will be applied to all new buildings and this represents a major step
forward.

The Ministry of Public Works also translated with its own resources the Eurocode 0 (basis of
structural design), 1 (actions on structures), 2 (design of concrete), and 3 (design of steel) into
Albanian language. The next steps required for the legal adoption of Eurocode 8 are to update
other Eurocodes which are referred to in Eurocode 8 and to coordinate with national and EC
institutions for their formal adoption.

CRIF. Albania is a founding member and part owner of the Europe Re, a reinsurance company
created under the SEE-CRIF and now licensed and operational in Switzerland. About half of the
existing private insurance companies in Albania have already registered with the Europe Re. In
the meantime, the Bank together with Europa Re will help the technical staff of the Ministry of
Finance to understand better the consequences of different disaster scenarios and explore further
disaster risk financing instruments available to the Ministry that can complement the residential
earthquake insurance scheme developed under the SEE-CRIF program. The Ministry will also
review the education and communication materials prepared by the Europa Re for the public
awareness and education campaign for catastrophe risk and catastrophe insurance products in the
country.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

The Project’s overall objective, that is “to strengthen institutional capacities to reduce Albania’s
vulnerability to natural and man-made hazards and to limit human, economic, and financial losses,



                                                12
due to disasters,” was considered highly relevant to the situation of Albania and remains so at
completion. The devastating flood in Albania which happened during project implementation in
2010 also showed the importance of effective hazard risk management of the country. The overall
objective continued to provide the logical links to the relevant policy, sectoral project context and
constitutes the broad development impact, to which the project was designed to contribute in
national and sectoral level. The project design focused on capacity building of various agencies
responsible for DRM, with modest funding, as a prerequisite for bigger investment operations,
which is regarded as the right approach.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

By the middle of April 2014, the Project mostly achieved the development objective to strengthen
institutional capacities to reduce Albania’s vulnerability to natural and man-made hazards and to
limit human, economic, and financial losses, due to disasters. According to the revised results
framework, PDO was to be achieved mainly through newly produced hydro-meteorological
products, revisions to building code to EU standards and ready for legal adoption, and making
catastrophic risk insurance available to business, households and government. While project
implementation was significantly delayed and further follow-up by the Government of Albania is
required for some operational aspects as described below, the Project was able to meet most of
the targets of the PDO Level Results Indicators by the time this ICR is being prepared. Details on
achievements of the PDO indicators (revised ones after the first project restructuring) are
described below.

PDO Level Results Indicator: Newly produced hydrometeorological products meet WMO
          standards.
Baseline: Severe weather products and warnings tailored to users are not available
Target: Hydromet data and alerts (flood and forest fire risk indexes) are disseminated to risk
          managers and data posted on IGEWE website
Current Status: The digitalization of Hydrometeorological data has been completed. 20 years of
          hydrological data and 10 years (2001-2011) of meteorological data have been digitized.
          The data was undergone quality analysis and has been published on the IGEWE
          website for user access. 40 hydrometeorological observing stations have been installed,
          and the real-time data from the majority of these stations are now flowing. 3-day and 7-
          day bulletins are published and posted on the website for user access. Forest Fires
          Warning Bulletin during the summer and a Meteorological Warning Bulletin during the
          wet seasons are issued.

In addition to the achievements described above, IGEWE also needs to ensure that the operational
Action Plan, on which the Bank and IGEWE agreed, will be fully implemented to sustain the
project benefits. This includes, among other things, maintenance of the website and database,
staff training, calibrations of monitoring stations, and fixing of some malfunctioning equipment.

PDO Level Results Indicator: Revisions to Building Code, bringing them to EU standards
          (Eurocode 8) are ready for legal adoption.
Baseline: Outdated building codes
Target: National plan of Revisions developed and approved by MOPWT
Current Status: National plan of revisions of building code has been developed. A special decree
          has been issued by MOPWT to integrate Eurocode 8, 0-3 into national legislation based
          on the national plan. Key sections of the Eurocode 8 for earthquake resistance were
          prepared with project funds and Eurocodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 were translated with MOPWT
          budget.


                                                 13
PDO Level Results Indicator: Catastrophic risk insurance is available to businesses, households
          and government.
Baseline: No catastrophic insurance
Target: CAT insurance infrastructure and regulatory framework in place
Current Status: The CRIF has been established and catastrophic insurance infrastructure and
          regulatory framework are in place. More than half of the existing private insurance
          companies in Albania have already registered with the Europe Re. A regional
          arrangement, especially operationalization of the Europe Re (the reinsurance company
          under SEE-CRIF), has also been completed as of the end of March 2014.
          Comprehensive earthquake and flood insurance packages have been fully developed
          with view to provide homeowners and SME’s with high credit quality coverage. An
          innovative underwriting platform and consumer education website on disaster risk and
          disaster risk insurance have been developed and is made available to the government
          and the public.

In addition to the achievements of PDO level indicators described above, other project outputs
have contributed to or are expected to contribute to strengthening of institutional capacities
(therefore, PDO achievements). Such outputs include: (i) procuring emergency equipment such as
earth-moving vehicles, multi-purpose fire trucks, and motor-boats for flood response teams;
(ii) equipping the national emergency operations center with the IT hardware and office furniture;
(iii) various training activities; (iv) feasibility studies for emergency communication system; and
(v) draft national disaster risk management strategy.

3.3 Efficiency

Economic analysis to calculate current Economic Rate of Return (ERR) based on the actual ex-
post project data was conducted using three different methodologies: (i) benchmarking analysis;
(ii) sectoral analysis; and (iii) required benefits analysis (detailed explanation of these
methodologies is in Annex 3). The analysis assumes that the annual operation and maintenance
cost is 10 percent of the investment cost, and that the project lifetime is 20 years after the
completion of the project.

The result of the ex-post ERR calculation is in the table below.

     Method                                                 ERR                    NPV
                               Benefits

Benchmarking                                          34 – 120 percent
                             US$ million                                        US$ million
                              2.13 - 4.75                                       4.12 - 16.72
Sectoral analysis                                      20 – 37 percent
                             US$ million                                        US$ million

Required benefits                                        12 percent                  0
                             US$ million

The ERR results, both from benchmarking methodology and sectoral analysis, suggest that the
Project is economically feasible. The lowest ERR estimate from the benchmarking methodology
is 34 percent and the lowest ERR estimate from the sectoral analysis is 20 percent, both of which
are well above the 12 percent threshold. Therefore, the efficiency is rated substantial.

Financial analysis was not conducted, as this is not a revenue-generating project. Further details
of the economic analysis are described in Annex 3.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

The overall outcome rating is moderately satisfactory, combining relevance, PDO achievement,
and efficiency described above. Relevance remains high, PDO has been mostly achieved despite
some delays in implementation and putting in place operational arrangements, and efficiency is
substantial.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
 (a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

Natural disasters disproportionately affect the poor and the vulnerable including women and
children. While the project was not particularly targeting the vulnerable groups of the society,
strengthening the government capacity in disaster preparedness and response can benefit the
society as a whole. This is what this project was intended for.

The project’s original design included development of school curricula teaching students on
disaster risks and actions required in emergencies. Experience from other countries shows that
educating children on this subject greatly contributes to overall public understanding on what
actions to take before, during and after an emergency and saves more lives than just children’s. It
is regrettable that this activity was dropped at the end due to the lack of timing, but should be
included in the future operation.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

The lack of operational capacity (inadequate staffing and budget) for weather-related services at
IGEWE, as a research-oriented institute under the Ministry of Education, was identified as a
major risk at appraisal. This issue was raised from time to time by the Bank team during project
implementation. While the project did not intend any explicit institutional reform, WMO visited
Albania in July 2010 to assess and recommend options for reforming IGEWE or establishing a
new institutional structure for more effective hydrometeorological services. These options are:
(i) significantly strengthening IGEWE and create an organizational structure focusing more on
operations of hydrometeorological services; (ii) create a new government agency responsible for
hydrometeorological services under a line ministry such as the Ministry of Environment; and
(iii) create a multi-agency model where IGEWE provides technical support in hydrology,
meteorology and climatology by doing research in these fields. The government may wish to
consider these options in determining a longer-term institutional arrangement for Albania’s
hydrometeorological services.

After the general election in June 2013 and subsequent change in government, MOPWT was
reorganized and a department responsible for building codes has been shifted from MOPWT to
the newly-created Ministry of Urban Development and Tourism. Now the new ministry is
responsible for any follow-up actions such as formal adoption of the new building codes for
seismic resistance to make the codes enforceable.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

No beneficiary survey was conducted. But according to the Project Appraisal Document, at least
two surveys (at mid-term and project closing) were supposed to be conducted to measure use-
assessed value of weather forecasts and disaster alerts. The original results framework included,
as an outcome indicator, the user-assessed value of these improved weather services under the
Component 2 with a target of US$0.5 million annually. But implementation of the Component 2
did not really start before the mid-term review, and this indicator was dropped at the first project
restructuring in January 2012.

A stakeholder workshop was planned at project closure to discuss implementation experiences
and lessons learned. However, this did not take place due to the fact that project closure coincided
with the general election and subsequent change in government. It is expected that a workshop
will be held sometime later in 2014 in coordination with the new government and key
stakeholders to disseminate the lessons learned and also to discuss the draft national disaster risk
management strategy.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Substantial

The main risks to development outcome are related to institutional and operational aspects of
various project entities and activities. Most project activities would need serious follow-up
actions in order to sustain the project benefits on a long-term basis and to really achieve
development outcomes. These are already highlighted in the section 2.5 above, but one critical
example worth repeating here is the need to secure adequate staffing and operational budget on a
continuous basis for IGEWE. The World Bank is now working with the new government, but
because the follow up actions are not yet fully completed, the risk is deemed substantial.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Moderately unsatisfactory

The Bank performance in ensuring quality at entry is moderately unsatisfactory. While the Bank
ensured that the project design was generally sound, project readiness was totally lacking. The
project design, while complicated, was regarded as necessary to adopt a multi-hazard approach
crucial for Albania exposed to various types of hazards. Consequently, the project had to involve
multiple implementing agencies, such as the MOI, MOPWT, IGEWE, etc. However,
implementation arrangements at these agencies were not established before Board approval, and
this contributed to the serious delays in effectiveness and implementation in initial years. In
addition, critical project preparation activities were not completed before appraisal, including
development of TORs for key TA/studies and preparation of technical specifications for
emergency equipment and hydro-meteorological monitoring stations. In fact, most of these
preparatory activities started only after the project became effective. In sum, the project was not
ready for implementation when it was approved.

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Satisfactory




                                                16
The Bank performance for supervision is moderately satisfactory. The Bank team conducted
regular supervision missions with relevant technical specialists and reported important issues
candidly. The mid-term review and two project restructurings ensured that most project activities
were completed at the end although the closing date had to be extended twice (a total of 16
months). The Bank team also worked with the new government to help operationalize the assets
created under the project, especially for the hydrometeorological monitoring stations.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately satisfactory

Combining the moderately unsatisfactory rating in ensuring quality at entry and the satisfactory
rating in supervision, the overall Bank performance is rated as moderately satisfactory.

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Moderately satisfactory

Despite the various delays in taking required actions during project implementation, the
Government performance is rated as moderately satisfactory given its strong commitment to
completing the project activities. The new government has started to work with the Bank to
ensure that some of the necessary operational arrangements will be in place.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Moderately satisfactory

There were four main implementing agencies. These included PMT at GDCE of MOI, which
played a leading role in project implementation, and three other implementation teams at IEWE,
MOPWTT, and MOF. While they suffered from implementation delays and coordination
difficulties on many occasions throughout project implementation, they managed to complete
most project activities at the end. For that, their performance is rated moderately satisfactory.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately satisfactory

Combining the moderately satisfactory rating of Government performance and the moderately
satisfactory rating of implementing agencies’ performance, the overall Borrower performance is
rated as moderately satisfactory.

6. Lessons Learned

Project Readiness. Project preparation was not sufficient at the time it was approved in June 2008,
which led to implementation delays in initial years. Establishing Project Management Team
(PMT) at the GDCE was one of the effectiveness conditions, but it took MOI about one year
since project approval to establish the team. Moreover, none of the TOR for key studies and
consultancy services was developed before project approval, including: (i) the National DRM
Strategy and Investment Plan; (ii) feasibility study for establishing an emergency communication
system; and (iii) development of school curricula for disaster risk and preparedness. In addition,
none of the technical specifications were prepared for main procurement items, before project
approval, including emergency equipment such as fire trucks under the Component 1 and the
hydrometeorological monitoring stations under the Component 2. Some of these activities



                                               17
planned for the first years of implementation should have been completed by appraisal to ensure
project readiness at the time of project approval.

Coordination of multiple agencies. While the project was relatively small in size with a focus on
technical assistance, project design was complex with four independent components, each of
which was implemented by a different agency. Procurement of all items was to be handled by
PMT of the lead implementing agency, at GDCE, by coordinating on technical details with other
implementing agencies. The required coordination proved to be too difficult at many times,
contributing to procurement delays and dropping of some activities. While the project design
involving multiple agencies was necessary to deal with multi-hazards, a more effective
coordination mechanism should have been carefully thought through at project preparation and
managed throughout project implementation.

Early attention to operational phases. While the project completed most of its activities after the
two closing date extensions, there was some serious delays regarding post-completion operational
aspects and follow-on activities (please see more details in the section 2.5 above), which was
partly attributed to the change in government. Given the initial delays in implementation, most of
the project activities took place in the last two years and were completed just before the final
closing date. Because of this, the Bank was unable to effectively supervise the post-completion
operational aspects. The Government and the Bank should have paid more serious and early
attention to the operational phases of various project activities to ensure effective operational
arrangements once the project is completed.

Start small. The project was designed as the first phase of the bigger APL, focusing on capacity
building aspects of various DRM-related institutions with modest funding, paving the way for
major investments for the second phase at a later stage. This proved to be a less risky approach as
major investments will take place only if the required capacity and other necessary arrangements
are in place.

Regional approach to disaster risk management. The key lesson of the insurance component of
the Albania DRMAP is that with a rather small investment in the regional insurance program, the
government managed to create the framework for reducing its fiscal risk exposure to natural
disasters and at the same time secured access to affordable and innovative catastrophe insurance
products for the Albanian homeowners and SMEs. Despite a relatively long gestation period, the
SEE-CRIF is an example of how a regional approach to disaster risk management can benefit all
participating countries by enabling them to reach better quality outcomes at a much reduced cost
per country. Hence, in the future the Bank should continue to encourage countries to pool their
resources in DRM related operations.

Additional study to respond to flooding events during the Project. As part of the response to
the major flood events which occurred in January and December 2010 during the Project period,
the World Bank agreed to fund the “Post-Disaster Comprehensive Flood Risk Assessment &
Management Study” in order to assist the Government of Albania to prepare a comprehensive
flood risk assessment and management plan for the Lower Drini-Buna Basin, including options
for flood risk mitigation measures.

The Study includes the details of the proposed works to be undertaken in the Medium Term (as
defined by the ToR to be within a five year period). This includes drawings at preliminary design
level, together with cost estimates and maps showing the calculated extents and depths of residual
flooding throughout the Study Area with the implementation of these works.

In addition to the proposals for Medium Term Works, the Flood Risk Management Plan for the
Study Area, as set out in this report, includes recommendations for Non-Structural and Longer

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

Economic Analysis

At appraisal, a partial economic analysis of the project was done focusing on Component 2. This
analysis was based on a country assessment study which evaluated the potential economic
benefits arising from improving hydromet services in Albania to a “good” level. The country
assessment study suggested annual benefits between US$3 million and US$6.2 million. 1
However, since the project was expected to yield a lower range of benefits - bringing hydromet
services to a “satisfactory” rather than a “good” level – the team did not calculate an ERR
(Economic Rate of Return) for this component but decided to estimate the stream of annual
benefits that would make the ERR for this component equal to 12 percent. Based on Component
2 costs, the value of needed annual benefits was estimated at US$0.6 million. In this calculation,
it was assumed that annual O&M costs were equal to 10 percent of the investment cost and the
period of analysis was set for 20 years.

The ex-post economic analysis also concentrates on estimating potential benefits resulting from
Component 2 activities but expands to take into account all project costs. The ex-post economic
analysis is also complemented by different methodologies and refers to recent studies. Three
different methodologies were used: (i) a benchmarking analysis; (ii) a sectoral analysis; and (iii) a
required benefits analysis. Table below summarizes results using these methodologies. A more
detailed description of assumptions can be found in below.

Benchmarking: This methodology estimates the potential annual benefits from investing in
hydromet and early warning systems based on the country’s GDP and the initial level of
development of the hydromet and warning system. The methodology points out that to achieve
the assumed benefits investments would be required in: (i) local observation systems; (ii) local
forecast capacity; (iii) increased capacity to interpret forecasts and translate them into warnings;
(iv) communication tools to distribute and disseminate information, data, and warnings; and
(v) institutional capacity building and increased decision-making capacity by users of warnings
and hydro-meteorological information. The current project delivered significant investments in all
of these critical areas. Three categories of benefits are generally included in this analysis: assets
(reduced asset losses from disasters), productivity enhancement or other economic benefits and
lives (reduced human losses from disasters). However, for this project only benefits from reduced

1
  This estimates were obtained using (i) assessment by national experts in weather-dependent sectors of the current
level of losses incurred and assessed the incremental benefits likely to result from specific improvement in lead time
and accuracy of weather forecasts and warnings, and (ii) benchmarks on the intrinsic weather-dependence of the
national economic structure, and the meteorological vulnerability of the quality of information and service provision by
the national meteorological service. Assessment of Economic Benefits of Hydrometeorological Services in Albania

asset losses and productivity enhancement were included. Using the benchmark methodology
annual benefits were estimated to be between US$4.32 and US$42.19 million. Using this range of
benefits and including the total economic cost for all components, the project yields an ERR
between 34 and 120 percent and a NPV between US$14.63 and US$196.63 million. A summary
of the main assumptions used by this methodology can be found below. For a more detailed
description of the methodology please refer to Hallegatte (2012).2

Assets: Hallegatte (2012) found that a well-functioning early warning system could reduce
disaster-related losses between 0.003 and 0.017 percent of GDP. The potential benefit in
hydromet and warning systems is the difference between the protection prior to the project and
the protection after the project. Albania, prior to the project, was considered to be a low income
country with a weak system capturing only 10 percent of the asset-saving benefits achievable
when compared to a country with a high functioning hydromet and warning system. Potential
benefits can thus be estimated as the difference between the potential reduced losses (0.003 and
0.017 percent of GDP) with the project potential and reduced losses without the Project, which in
the case of Albania would be 10 percent of that value. Using the global benchmark of 0.003
percent of GDP as a lower bound and a conservative figure of 0.017 percent of GDP as an upper
bound, potential reduced losses (with project implementation) were estimated to be between 0.53
and US$2.99 million per year3. “Without-Project” reduced losses were estimated to be between
US$0.05 and US$0.30 million per year. As a result annual benefits from the project are estimated
between US$0.48 million and US$2.69 million.

Productivity Enhancement & other Economic Benefits: modernizing hydromet systems can also
significantly enhance economic productivity, e.g. agriculture, mining, etc. A conservative global
benchmark is that modern forecasts add value to weather-sensitive sectors, which would translate
into gains of approximately 0.025 to 0.25 percent of GDP. Potential annual benefits from
improved services due to the project were estimated between US$3.96 million and US$39.61
million.

Sectoral Analysis: An assessment 4 of the potential benefits of modernizing the national
hydrometeorological services in Albania, using a sector-specific approach, was done in 2008. For
this assessment national experts on a set of weather-dependent sectors 5 were surveyed to:
(i) estimate the current level of losses incurred in that industry or sector; and (ii) to assess the
marginal benefits likely to results from specified improvements in the lead time and accuracy of
weather forecasts and warnings. Results were generalized and integrated to yield estimates of the
current level of aggregate economic benefits from hydromet services, and then of the incremental
benefit that could accrue from a modernization project. This study suggested that an investment
of approximately US$4 million to modernize hydromet services would yield between US$1.8 and
US$3.9 million on annual savings linked to these sectors. However, since the project invested
only US$1.2 million (for the modernization of hydromet services), the annual savings linked to
these sectors should be lower than the one estimated in this assessment. Supposing that only 30
percent of these savings materialized, annual savings due to a partial modernization of the
hydromet program would yield between US$2.13 to US$4.75million of annual benefits.

The ERR results, both from benchmarking methodology and sectoral analysis, suggest that the
Project is economically feasible. The lowest ERR estimate from the benchmarking methodology
is 34 percent and the lowest ERR estimate from the sectoral analysis is 20 percent, both of which
are well above the 12 percent threshold. Therefore, efficiency is rated as moderately satisfactory.

Financial Analysis

Financial analysis was not conducted, as this is not a revenue-generating project.

Summary of Borrower’s ICR

A very detailed ICR report was submitted by the borrower, with general explanation of the
project, evaluation of the project performance, and implementation results. Three sections in the
report which summarize the project performance and implementation results are attached below:

C.7 Conclusions (of project performance evaluation)

1. The context in which DRMAP was initially designed and implemented deserves special
   attention. The Government has initiated changes in disaster risk management through
   revisions of the institutional set-up and planning process. It was clearly instilled a sense of
   urgency among all stakeholders, which keeping the focus on long-term sustainability issues
   paying the attention on the need to foster disaster risk management and adaptation agenda. In
   addition to the one year delay in project start due to disagreements on fiduciary staff
   appointments, there was also some project inertia with many new modalities and concepts
   such as the catastrophe insurance, acceptable construction standards, etc. This led to delays in
   of first year activities with only limited impact and sustainability, often being supply- driven
   and with poor monitoring and supervision. Combined with a partly confused approach
   towards disaster reduction and too heavy emphasis on utilizing new implementation
   modalities, the project performance in the first years was unsatisfactory.

2. To the credit of WB, and GoA, during the MTR remedial actions and reorientations were
   proposed in order to restore relevance and improve DRMAP’s impact and sustainability.
   Emphasis was put on identifying the obstacles in the implementation; review the work plan
   and procurement plan; and discusses measures to accelerate progress in achievement of
   project objectives, including potential reallocations between project elements. Empirically,
   this has proven the relevant growth approach for achieving the results. This approaches shift
   has successively promoted and increased relevance and looks set to be continued in the
   ongoing successor project ‘DRMAP.

3. The largest achievement of DRMAP is arguably strengthening of several core institutions of
   MoI (GDCE), IGEWE, (MOES), and the MoPWT. They have proven relevant as key
   institutions dedicated to advancing course of disaster risk management and response in civil
   emergencies. They have also assisted in raising the profile of the beneficiary’s capacities on
   the policy agenda. The general knowledge of the specific needs and problems, but also
   opportunities and investment potentials, of these areas (risk management, preparedness and
   response) is now significantly enhanced among policy-makers. However, institutions could
   have performed even better had they been subject to more robust impact evaluation.

4. In light of the above, DRMAP’s overall achievement has been considered as satisfactory.
   While initial performance was not satisfactory, the project, especially after the Mid-term
   Review, has made continuous attempts to improve its performance, most often with
   considerable success. Performance has thus improved over time and DRMAP has
   increasingly supported and benefited from the strong efforts of the implementing agencies
   and progress done in the strengthening of capacity building that has occurred during the
   project period.



                                                32
C.8 Recommendation for the current and the next phase (based on project performance
evaluation)

1. Deeper identification, assess and monitor disaster risks and early enhanced warning. Since
   the DRMAP play a role in strengthening the capacity building of the respective institutions
   dealing with disaster risk management and reduction, it is necessary further action to be taken
   toward conducting a disaster risk assessments in the country, developing a National Risk
   Assessment Framework, to provide an overall guidance for disaster risk assessments. It then
   should follow by organizing technical training courses focusing on risk assessment and
   decision-making, and aiming towards the standardization of risk assessment methodologies in
   the country. These should be available for the General Directorate of Emergencies and other
   relevant institutions or ministries at national, district and municipal levels.

2. More knowledge, innovation and education should be used, to increase the awareness among
   the people on disaster risk management and reduction. The project failed to build up a
   training center for disaster risk management in Tirana. However, the project is still
   collaboration with the Ministry of Education and municipal authorities to agree on a plan of
   action to integrate disaster risk management and reduction into schools. It tent to insert
   disaster risk reduction, disaster preparedness and health emergency preparedness into the
   curriculum for primary and secondary schools and to train teachers in disaster reduction,
   preparedness and health emergency preparedness (as per the above-mentioned curriculum).

3. The voice of the local people in policy making and allocations of importance to them should
   be increased. The design of DRMAP has focused more efforts on central institution than in
   local level. Effective disaster risk reduction interventions have the potential to strengthen
   grassroots institutions at the local and district levels, as well as to strengthen the interface
   between grassroots community organizations and local authorities. Thus the interventions can
   make local governance more inclusive and participatory. This need to be corrected and will
   have to entail more investment in community and local level.

4. More realistic analysis of incentives and economic sustainable development issues should be
   ensured in the incoming design of similar programmes. It is important to include balanced
   approaches in the support strategy for the country to disaster management that can relate this
   area of activity to both sustainable development and poverty reduction. Design of the project
   might have more attention paid to supporting overall natural disaster management processes
   within a sustainable development framework and poverty reduction, it is likely that funds will
   be required again to address the same recovery needs.

5. The training manuals of the Albanian Disaster Management and Emergency Preparedness
   programme and training at national, regional and municipal levels should be reviewed and
   provided. Strengthening the disaster preparedness planning for participatory and preparation
   of the manuals and guidelines under the international experiences would lead to the effective
   response at all level during the second phase of the programme. They should clarify the roles
   and responsibilities of actors and partners, including government institutions, civil society,
   and beneficiaries

D.8 LESSONS LEARNT (from project implementation results

Component 1

1. The PMT staff should be established before project start-up time. The delay of procurement
   officer recruitment cause delay in procurement process of the goods and services.

2. Since the procurement process and fund disbursement are specific tasks and they were carried
   out as per the WB procedures, several training courses for procurement officer and project
   accountant are necessary. It would improve the quality of their works and would fulfill the
   quality request of the WB.

3. PMT should have a wider structure (not only two specialists) in organizational aspect where
   the members responsibilities fit the coordination requested to other complex implementing
   agencies involved in project implementation. A law specialist and M&E specialist should be
   included in the PMT staff in order to follow respectively in correct way the legal aspect under
   the WB regulation and procedures and to increase the management level of the project.

4. PMT might establish the information flow system between project and agencies. A weak
   information flow system affected negatively the proper management and progress of the
   project toward achievement of the project objectives and results.

5. Usage of knowledge, innovation and education to increase the awareness among the people
   on disaster risk management and reduction need a well planning process and a programme of
   investment supported by an ensured budget.

6. The sustainability of the achieved results after the project completion would be compromised
   if the maintenance and operational cost of the new inputs provided by the project were not
   included in the respective institution annual budget.

Component 2

1. More rapid decisions “no objection” might be taken by the WB during the review of bid
   evaluation sent by PMT in order to shorten the procurement process, and to avoid the delays.

2. Consultancy and good contracts should respect the deadlines regarding timely delivery of
   services and goods.

3. The PMT needs to have a well-qualified team leader, with a long time experience with Bank
   procedures to ensure achievement of project objectives on time and at the expected quality.

4. The WB should insist stronger to the government in order to make the needed structural
   changing in the institutions where they are being investing. The administrative dependence of
   the IGEWE under the Ministry of Education would negatively affect the sustainability of the
   investment and its effectiveness in the future

5. The project might focus better in building technical and human capacity involving new
   contracted staff with clear job description for the field specialists. More training for the staff




                                                 34
    especially for those who belong to education field on operational system and communication
    chains.

6. The project should push stronger the institution responsible meteorological and hydrological
   service for the weather and climate hazards to have better focus on a comprehensive delivery
   end-to-end of the services engaging different local, national and regional stakeholders and
   agencies. (Air Force Command Weather Forecast Service and National Air Traffic Agency in
   the country and region.)

Component 3

1. The project might design more training activities toward relevant civil side organizations and
   associations for practical implementation of the building code

2. The beneficiary could design more powerful approaches to develop an effective building
   code implementation combined with strong policy support and environment. Without multi-
   dimensional efforts, it is not impossible to achieve the launch society with earthquake safety
   of buildings even in small economy like Albania

3. The beneficiary should continue the trainings to other actors such are main architectonic
   building design studios. They should assist the construction inspectorate to check and control
   new building, and to have cooperation between experts of technical work and social workers.

Component 4

1. Ensure the quality, and continuity of component deliverables taking better in consideration
   the proposal from the stakeholders, (e.g. the Association of Albanian Insurers proposal) to
   establish a national earthquake insurance program for local owners and SMEs in compliance
   with national earthquake insurance schemes that were developed by the World Bank.

2. The further collaboration between MoI and the SEEC CRIF (Europe Re) Program is essential.
   It would provide needed support mass sales of standardized earthquake insurance products by
   local insurers as well as all necessary back-office support functions, including risk models for
   pricing and underwriting, risk management systems, effective claims settlement systems, and
   affordably priced reinsurance capacity.

3. The SEEC CRIF Strategic objectives included in the Disaster Risk Reduction and Civil
   Protection Strategy Document should be supported through the development of the national
   mandatory catastrophe insurance scheme.

Borrower’s Comments on Draft ICR (unofficial translation)

In response to your letter dated 12/11/2013 on the draft final report concerning the results of the
‘Disaster Risk Mitigation and Adaptation AL-DRMAP’ project in the quality of the main project
implementation agency we are sending you our comments. The financing of the project AL-
DRMAP although distributed among four implementing agencies was very important for
strengthening the capacities of the Albanian institutions concerning adaptation of civil
emergencies with regard to the indispensable equipment and means and training for the staff of
all the agencies.

The report provides a realistic overview of the project development and difficulties during the
implementation but we are of the opinion that it should put more emphasis on the fact that
although it started to be implemented after the mid-term mission, within 3 years 98.4 percent of
the funds were used effectively. This is the merit of the World Bank supervisory mission that
monitored step by step all the activities that were conducted and enabled the required
coordination with the other partners that assisted the Albanian institutions such as the Italian Civil
Protection and the World Meteorological Organization.

We consider that despite the delays and difficulties encountered during the project
implementation the project achieved tangible results such as: enhanced capacities for emergencies
through the establishment and furbishing of the National Operational Center and the two offices
in Lezhe and Shkoder, through the digitalization of the historical hydro-meteorological data,
development of the Feasibility Study, the project for emergency number 112, preparation for
approval of the Euro Code 8, purchase of 40 automatic hydro-meteorological stations and
membership of Albania in SEE-CRIF.

In addition to these activities, in response to the 2010 floods in Shkoder the project prepared a
comprehensive flood risk assessment for the area of Shkoder.

With regard to sustainability of the investments in the framework of the project I would like to
assure you that the Government of Albania and the new management staff of the Ministry of
Internal Affairs are seriously committed to provide all the necessary budgetary support in order to
keep functional the recently established hydro-meteorological network.

Furthermore the Government of Albania has expressed its commitment in the review of the draft
National Strategy, National Platform and Priority Investment Plan for Disaster Risk Mitigation
with the participation of the interested parties.
