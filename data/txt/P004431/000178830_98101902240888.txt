REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES FOR THE
RURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan for an equivalent of US$25 million to the Republic of the Philippines
to help finance a rural development project on Mindoro island. The loan
would have a term of 25 years including seven years of grace with interest
at 8.5 percent per annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        The most recent Economic Report - "Current Economic Position and
Prospects of the Philippines" (No. 568-PH of November 7, 1974) was circu-
lated to the Executive Directors on November 11, 1974. Annex I contains
country data.
Recent Developments
3.        In the past two years there has been a sharp increase in the level
of economic activity in the Philippines. The growth in real GNP, which had
been about 5-6% a year for more than a decade, doubled to 10% in 1973. The
strong recovery in 1973 was led by the international commodity boom and
resultant increased export incomes in the Philippines, by a strong recovery
in agricultural and industrial production for the domestic market, and by
an expansion in public and private investment. The increased domestic out-
put, and a 28% improvement in the external terms of trade, resulted in a
14% increase in gross national income in real terms in 1973 compared with
about 1% in 1972. Underemployment and unemployment remain quite high, how-
ever, and in common with most other countries, the rate of inflation in-
creased appreciably in the past 18 months. The Government has pressed ahead
with a number of important and lpotentially far-reaching economic and social
reforms in such areas as agrarian reform, taxation, customs administration
and tariffs, banking and government organization.
4.        The agricultural sector, which has suffered from adverse weather
conditions during the previous t:hree years, grew by 7% in 1973. Rice pro-
duction in crop year 1973-74 inoreased by 23% over the level of the previous
year when floods reduced production. This increase was mainly due to fa-
vorable weather conditions, increased use of fertilizers, more supervised
credit and increased investments in supporting rural services as part of a
general drive for rice self-sufficiency. The impact of typhoons and flooding
in December, 1974 appears to have been significant and as a result no in-
crease in rice production is likely for the crop year 1974-75. The Govern-
ment made rapid progress in implementation of the program of agrarian reform
for the nation's one million rice and corn farm tenants in 1973 and issued
certificates of land transfer to about 144,000 tenants mostly associated
with the large holdings. But this was considerably slowed down in 1974
mainly due to the increased resistance of medium scale farm owners, ad-
ministrative difficulties and land valuation and compensation problems.



- 2 -
As a result, only about 47,000 additional certificates were issued during
1974. Recently the Government indicated its intention through various
decrees and memoranda to resolve these problems and move forward with the
implementation of the program.
5.        The boom in export incomes and increased activity in agriculture
has provided the base for renewed expansion of the industrial sector which
grew by about 11% in 1973. Non-traditional industrial exports, which have
been increasing since 1970, are estimated to have doubled in 1973 to about
$200 million. The growth of industrial production for export has also been
stimulated by the Government's industrial export drive which includes a
range of export incentives. However, industrial exports have been affected
by the recent slowdown in the economies of key trading partners, and earnings
are expected to have levelled off in 1974.
6.        The growth in production was also assisted by increased public
development outlays in 1973 made possible by a significant improvement in
the financial position of the Government. The ratio of public investment
to GNP is currently about 3% compared with 1.8% in FY72. The Government
has implemented a series of long needed tax reforms and improvements in
tax administration, such as customs and tariff reform, tax amnesties, re-
forms in corporate and local taxation, continuation of the export tax, and
increased taxation on luxury items and on gasoline. These reforms, aided by
the increased economic activity, the boom in export incomes, and domestic
inflation, resulted in a 36% increase in tax revenues in FY73, and an esti-
mated 47% in FY74. As a result, the ratio of national and local Government
tax revenues to GNP has increased from an average of 9% in recent years to
an estimated 12.4% in FY74.
7.        High prices for the Philippines chief exports, including coconut
products, sugar, copper and wood products, were largely responsible for an
increase in merchandise receipts of almost 70% in 1973. The merchandise
trade account recorded a surplus of about $270 million, as compared with a
$150 million deficit in the previous year. International reserves rose by
about $600 million during the year and stood at $876 million, equivalent to
about five months of imports, at the end of December 1973. However, since
mid-1974, a large trade deficit has appeared, largely because the growth
in export prices has moderated while import prices have continued to rise
rapidly. As a result of this trade deficit, the overall balance of payments
surplus is estimated to have fallen from about $700 million in 1973 to less
than $100 million in 1974. By the end of 1974 international reserves were
about $1.2 billion, equivalent to roughly four months imports.
8.        In the latter part of 1973, inflation emerged as a major problem
in the Philippines. Starting in mid-1973 consumer prices began to rise at
an annual rate of more than 40%. This was caused by the large increase in
liquidity since the export boom began in 1973, and by a number of factors,
including the higher rate of world inflation, domestic food shortages and



-3-
the increased cost of petroleum. Aided by monetary and fiscal policies aimed
at absorbing the excessive liquidity expansion, the rate of inflation slowed
to less than 20% by the end of 1974. Other factors that helped moderate
the rate of inflation include the substantial reduction in the balance of
payments surplus in 1974 and the considerable increase in rice production
in crop year 1973/74. The inflation of the last two years has exacerbated
the decline in real wages which fell by a total of about 25% between 1969
and 1973. The urban wage earners have been most affected. Agricultural and
entrepreneurial incomes have improved very substantially. Money wages will
have to be raised in the near future if further deterioration in the living
standards of wage earners is to be avoided.
The Energy Crisis
9.        Imported petroleum provides some 97% of the Philippines' total
energy requirements. In 1973 the equivalent of 71 million barrels of
petroleum crude and other petroleum products were imported at a cost of
about $230 million cif. When the energy crisis developed in late 1973, it
looked as though economic activity in the Philippines would be severely
disrupted. There were temporary dislocations but the Government moved
quickly with conservation measures to reduce non-essential consumption.
By March 1974 these problems had been overcome and the Philippines is now
obtaining sufficient petroleum for its needs. In 1974 imports of petroleum
and products are estimated to be about 71 million barrels at a cost of about
$780 million cif.
10.       In response to the energy crisis the Government has decided to
accelerate the development of local energy sources, especially hydropower
and geothermal energy. These will be supplemented with nuclear energy
in the 1980's. The transport sector, which now accounts for 40% of total
energy consumption, is likely to continue to be the major consumer of energy.
The growth in demand for energy will therefore be influenced by the pattern
of expansion in this sector. In any event, total demand for energy is ex-
pected to grow at about 10% a year, and even with more rapid development of
natural power sources, petroleum would still account for more than 90% of
total energy needs by 1980. The Philippines does not have any commercial
oil fields, but the Government has taken steps to encourage more explora-
tion.
Growth Prospects
11.       The abrupt deterioration in the external terms of trade since
the middle of 1974, and the recession in the economies of key trading
partners, together with uncertainty about how quickly they will recover,
now threatens some of the Philippines' recent economic gains even though
the Government remains committed to maintaining the growth momentum which
began in 1973 and providing for a continued increase in incomes and employment.
The high priority accorded to expanding employment opportunities - in the
short-term as well as the long-term - stems from the fact that unemployment
and underemployment are still high and the labor force continues to grow at
3% a year.



- 4 -
12.       Priority is also being given to expanding food production for the
domestic market, to expanding export production and to accelerating develop-
ment of local energy resources. Quantities of cereal imports declined in
1974 because of the significant increase in agricultural output,especially
rice. However, the value of food imports increased somewhat due to the large
increase in world food prices and is estimated to be about $250 million for
1974. The Government is continuing its efforts to achieve food self-suffi-
ciency as soon as possible. The Government rightly recognizes that the in-
creased cost of petroleum and other imports cannot be financed indefinitely
by borrowing abroad and it is actively encouraging both local and foreign
investors to expand the productive capacity of export industries and to
undertake major new import-replacing investments. Because it will take time
for these investments to have an impact on the balance of payments, the Govern-
ment is seeking increased support from the international financial community
to help carry out its development program and to ease the adjustment to higher
petroleum and other import prices. Because of the substantial improvement in
the external debt burden and international reserve position in the last two
years the Philippines now has the capacity to borrow externally larger amounts
of capital in support of its development program, if capital is made available.
13.       Maintaining a GNP growth rate of about 7 percent a year in real
terms during the next few years will depend heavily on the buoyancy of the
domestic market. The prospects are for continued expansion in agriculture
with a 4-5 percent increase in production in the year ahead. With a few
exceptions, industries are operating at relatively high levels of capacity
utilization. Increased investments will be needed in a wide range of
consumer and intermediate goods industries. A number of big projects are
proposed in mining, wood processing, fertilizer, steel and shipbuilding
which are likely to push up the private investment rate from recent levels
of about 16% of GNP to perhaps 22 percent by the latter part of the decade.
The public infrastructure program that was approved in 1973, which called
for outlays of about P 12 billion at current prices in FY74-77, has become
outdated because of the subsequent rapid inflation and changes in invest-
ment priorities as a result of the energy crisis. A new program has not
been finalized, but the Government is putting more emphasis on developing
nuclear and indigenous power resources and on irrigation, feeder roads and
other projects to support increased food and export production. The Gov-
erunent has made considerable progress in recent years in building up its
capacity to prepare and execute projects. However, there will be a need
for continued efforts to strengthen this aspect of administration. The
ratio of public investment to GNP is projected to rise from the present
level of 3% to about 4% by 1977.
Balance of Payments
14.       Merchandise export receipts are projected to increase by a total of
about 30% in 1975 and 1976, with only a small increase in the unit value of
exports. Import payments are projected to increase by a total of almost
40% in the same period, including a 30% increase in prices. A cumulative



-5-
decline in the external terms of trade of about 23 percent during this
period would probably wipe out the gains made in the recent export price
boom and return the terms of trade to the level prevailing in 1972. However,
the outcome for the balance of payments is quite sensitive to assumptions
about external prices and without the projected deterioration in the terms
of trade, for example, the projected trade deficit of $1.2 billion in 1976
would be reduced by about $1 billion.
15.       The total foreign exchange requirements for meeting the current
account deficit and amortizing loans during 1975 and 1976 would be about
$2.3 billion. About $700 million would be provided by direct investment
and short-term trade finance and about $700 million would come from sup-
pliers' credits and commercial commodity financing. Disbursements of pro-
ject finance to the public sector, from the present pipeline, would amount
to about $300 million. The balance of the remaining capital inflow of
about $200 million in 1975 and $400 million in 1976 could be financed by
the Central Bank through short and medium-term borrowing. Net reserves,
however, would be negligible by 1976 and unless additional capital were
made available in the form of development aid, the Government would be
forced to consider a reduction in its growth targets for the rest of the
decade.
16.       Recent important gains in reducing the external debt burden and in
improving the external reserve would be jeopardized if the banking system had
excessive recourse to short and medium-term borrowing abroad. Fortunately,
some assistance may be forthcoming from the IMF. In addition, foreign
donors should consider extending quick-disbursing commodity loans with long
maturities, which would make an important contribution to maintaining growth
and a manageable balance of payments position in 1975. There is considerable
scope for additional medium and long-term loans from foreign donors to finance
the much larger capital goods imports projected for 1976. The Philippine
Consultative Group reviewed the improved foreign exchange position at its
meeting in December 1974 and accepted the need for some official commodity
aid in addition to rising levels of commitments for development projects to
support the Philippines' increased development program. If the projected
inflows on the capital account are forthcoming and if the presently identified
shortfalls in foreign exchange availabilities are met with an appropriate
combination of medium and long-term loan capital as suggested, management of
the external debt would not present serious problems. Medium and long-term
debt outstanding would rise from $2 billion this year to about $3 billion
by 1976 but the ratio of debt service payments to exports would fall from
15 percent this year to about 13 percent in 1976. The Philippines would
still be in a position to contract substantial amounts of external debt
during the final years of the decade although this would lead to an increase
in the debt service ratio to about 16-17 percent by 1980. The Philippines
is already creditworthy for substantial Bank lending. Moreover, at present,
the Bank/IDA share in total debt outstanding is about 9 percent and its
share in debt service is about 5 percent. Even with a substantially higher
level of Bank lending, these shares would not be expected to increase
significantly in the years ahead.



- 6 -
17.       During the last two years, the Government has significantly improved
its fiscal performance with taxes increasing by more than an average of 40
percent each year. Nevertheless,the Governments ambitious development program,
which would increase public investment from the current level of 3 percent of
GNP to about 5 percent by the end of the decade, will continue to require
resources in excess of the foreign capital which will become available for
financing the import component of development projects. Some financing of
local currency expenditures will be justified, especially for projects of
economic and social importance which need only limited amount of foreign
exchange.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN THE PHILIPPINES
18.       The Philippines has received 28 Bank loans and three IDA credits
totalling $619 million, net of cancellations. About 50 percent of the Bank/
IDA lending, about $306 million, has been for infrastructure projects in
power, transportation, water supply and for education whilst $25 million
has been for population. The remainder has been divided about equally be-
tween agriculture and industry. About $143 million of this has been for
irrigation, livestock, rice processing and rural credit and about $145 mil-
lion for industry in four loans for the Private Development Corporation of
the Philippines and one loan for the Development Bank of the Philippines.
There has been a marked improvement in the way Bank financed projects in
the Philippines have been executed in the last two or three years compared
with experience in the 1960's when shortages of peso counterpart funds com-
bined with poor administration to cause serious problems. All these projects
are now going reasonably well. Annex II contains a summary statement of
Bank loans, IDA credits and IFC investments as of February 28, 1975 and
notes on the execution of on-going projects.
19.       The Bank's lending program has been designed to support an increased
Philippine development effort with particular emphasis on agriculture and
infrastructure.Shortages of domestic financial revenues and poor administra-
tion led to low investment for these purposes in the past. The last two
years have seen major changes which have helped to overcome these constraints
and both the ambitious Philippine development program and the Bank's lending
program have been designed to make good past neglect and to meet future needs.
Commitments in FY74 amounted to $165.1 million, compared to an average of
about $30 million a year in the previous five years.
20.       Five loans in the Philippines totalling $153 million - Population,
Sixth Power, Inter-Island Shipping, Fourth Private Development Corporation
and Tarlac Irrigation have already been approved by the Executive Directors
in FY75. In addition to the present Rural Development proposal, a loan for
small and medium industries should be ready for consideration this fiscal



- 7 -
year; this loan would provide about $30 million for relending to small and
medium sized firms and to establish Regional Technical Assistance Centers
to serve these firms. This would bring total Bank lending in the Philippines
in FY75 to $208 million.
21.       IFC has made commitments in the Philippines totalling $76.1 million
for investments in thirteen companies in the fields of development banking,
power, telecommunications, ceramic tiles, paper, petroleum products, nickle
mining and refining, chemicals and synthetic fibers. Of these investments,
as of February 28, 1975, $18.1 million have been sold, $0.4 million can-
celled and $2.3 million repaid, leaving a net portfolio of $55.3 million.
On the same date $8.8 million was undisbursed. Preliminary proposals have
been received for an aluminum smelter and other projects in the pulp and
paper, dinnerware, metal alloys and shipbuilding fields.
PART III - THE ECONOMY OF MINDORO
22.       Mindoro island, situated some 45 km south of Luzon, has a popu-
lation of about 500,000. Administratively the island is divided into two
provinces; Oriental Province and Occidental Province. It covers about one
million ha of which about 550,000 are rough, mountain land. About 270,000
ha - slightly more than half of the agricultural land - is used for production
of rice, upland crops and coconut. About 70% of the labor force is engaged
in agriculture, fisheries and forestry; seasonal underemployment is high,
especially in areas where only one rice crop is grown. There has been heavy
immigration from Luzon, especially during the last 15 years. The original
inhabitants of the island, numbering about 80,000 and known collectively as
the Mangyans, who traditionally practise shifting cultivation, have been forced
back into the mountains by land pressure on the coastal plains.
23.       Before the present phase of the agrarian reform program, Occidental
Mindoro was characterised by large estate holdings and absentee ownership.
The tenancy rate was about 80% and average -farm size was 4.6 ha. By con-
trast, 80% of the farms in Oriental Mindoro were worked by owner-operators,
and average farm size was 2.2ha-i-The Department of Agrarian Reform has
therefore concentrated its activities so far in Occidental Mindoro.   Presi-
dent Marcos recently decreed that the program would be implemented on all
tenanted rice and corn holdings down to 7 ha. When this phase is completed
on Mindoro, some 103,000 ha (or 84% of the island's rice and corn lands)
would be cultivated by about 31,000 owner operators (or 72% of the farmers).
About 12,000 farmers on holdings under 7 ha would probably remain under some
form of leasehold which provides for payment of fixed rent and is therefore
a far better arrangement than share cropping which has now been abolished.
24.       Rice is by far the most important crop on Mindoro.   It is grown
on about 100,000 ha in the wet season, about evenly distributed between
the two provinces, and 50,000 ha in the dry season, almost all in Oriental



- 8 -
Mindoro. Rainfed upland corn is grown in both provinces while coconut,
banana and fruit trees are also important in Oriental Mindoro. The Gov-
ernment's Masagana 99 program, launched two years ago to provide intensified
agricultural services and supervised credit with the objective of doubling
rice yields, is progressing well in Mindoro. The Philippine National Bank,
which is an important institution in the Masagana program has three branches
on the island channelling credit to farmers. Eighteen rural banks also provide
production loans, while the Development Bank of the Philippines, with a
branch in each province, provides medium and long-term credit. The increased
institutional credit has helped offset the reduction in credit which was
provided by landlords before the agrarian reform program got underway.
25.       A major obstacle to development in Mindoro is poor transportation.
The two provinces are not connected by road. In Oriental Mindoro, which has
a national highway running north and south along the coast, most produce is
moved by road. But due to poor design and heavy traffic conditions, the
highway is deteriorating rapidly. There are few good provincial and farm
to market roads; many wooden bridges are dilapidated and unusable. The roads
in Occidental Mindoro are much worse. There is no north to south through
road; numerous small piers have been built along the coast and much farm
produce is moved by sea in small boats at high cost. Regular ferry services
for passengers and goods run between Calapan in Oriental Mindoro and
Batangas and, also between San Jose in Occidental Mindoro and Manila.
26.       Agricultural production and rural incomes on Mindoro are limited
by lack of irrigation, inadequate supplies of certified seed and extensive
damage to crops by rats. A further problem in the Lake Naujan area of
Oriental Mindoro is schistosomiasis (an endemic disease). In addition to
improving transportation, the proposed rural development project would
tackle all these problems and help the hill tribes mentioned in paragraph 22.
27.       In Spite of its proximity to Manila, Mindoro has remained rela-
tively backward. The Ls19l!rd has great potential for food-grain production;
and since it does not suffer frequent damage from typhoons, the Government
proposes to develop it as an alternative to Central Luzon in supplying food
for metropolitan Manila. Typical per tapita farm incomes on Mindoro are
currently 30% to 60% of national per capita GrN±.  Therefore development of
the island would contribute both to food production, and to improving the
living standards of the rural poor.
IV.  THE P_ROJECT
28.       The Government's development strategy includes priority for
development of relatively backward regions with good agricultural potential.
The objectives are to help correct regional economic and social imbalances,
to assist national programs for food grain self-sufficiency and to build up
Government services for planning and implementing projects in rural areas.



-9-
The proposed rural development project, the first Bank-assisted project
of its kind in the Philippines, was chosen to meet these objectives. It
would directly benefit about 40 percent of Mindoro's population by raising
per capita incomes on rice farms (see para 42), and would indirectly benefit
almost everyone on the island. The project was prepared by the Government
with assistance from the FAO/IBRD Cooperative Program. A Bank mission
appraised the project in June 1974 and negotiations were held in March 1975.
The leader of the Government negotiating team was Ambassador Eduardo Z.
Romualdez. The Appraisal Report No. 633a-PH on the proposed project is being
circulated separately to the Executive Directors. Annex III provides a loan
and project summary.
Description of the project
29.       The project would improve water control, roads and port facilities
on Mindoro Island. It would also provide an agricultural program, schisto-
somiasis control and assistance to minority Mangyan tribes. The project
would include:
(a) construction and improvement of about 150 km of national
highways in Oriental Mindoro and 280 km of provincial
roads in both provinces (accounting for over half of the
total costs);
(b) improvement and extension of the Pula and Baco-Bucayao
national irrigation systems to serve 12,000 ha of rice
land;
(c) improvement and extension of about 2,000 ha of communal
irrigation systems in Oriental Mindoro and about 1,000 ha
in Occidental Mindoro;
(d) establishment of river gauging and meteorological stations
to improve the hydrological data base in Mindoro;
(e) introduction of watershed protection programs in four
river watersheds;
(f) technical assistance for detailed highway engineering
and supervision of construction;
(g) consultant services for studies and, if economically
feasible, detailed engineering of a national highway in
Occidental Mindoro, and possible road links with Oriental
Mindoro.
(h) improvements to Calapan port by rehabilitating and upgrading
the existing pier and deck, reclaiming and resurfacing land
to increase cargo storage space, and constructing a passenger
building and a concrete landing stair;



- 10 -
(i) an agricultural program to construct and equip two seed
testing laboratories and to carry out a rat control pro-
gram on 90,000 ha of paddy land;
(j) control of schistosomiasis in Oriental Mindoro through
health education, construction of communal domestic
water supplies, drainage of 460 ha of swampland, provi-
sion of about 10,000 water-seal toilets, and treatment
of persons suffering from the disease;
(k) assistance to minority Mangyan tribes through mobile medical
services, construction of access roads and provision of legal
and technical assistance and agricultural inputs.
Project Execution and Management
30.       A number of national departments and agencies would be responsible
for implementing the project. The National Irrigation Administration (NIA)
would carry out the irrigation and water control component; the Department
of Public Highways would be responsible for the roads component; the Depart-
ment of Public Works would be responsible for improving Calapan port; the
Department of Health would be responsible for implementing the schistosomia-
sis control program; the Department of Agriculture would carry out the seed
and rat control programs; and the Presidential Assistant on National Minor-
ities (PANAMIN) would be responsible for Mangyan assistance.
31.       To coordinate the work of these departments and agencies, the
Government would employ a Project Director who would report directly to
the Cabinet Coordinating Committee for Rural Development. The Project
Director would have a small technical and management staff including a
monitoring unit which would assess regularly the agro-economic aspects of
the project. The Project Director who has already been nominated by the
Government would be employed within three months of loan signing (Section
3.02(a) of the draft Loan Agreement).
32.       The Project Director would also be responsible for approving
detailed annual work programs and budgets of the departments and agencies.
To enable him to perform this function effectively, he would be chairman
of a Steering Committee which would consist of senior officers from each of
the departments and agencies involved in the project plus the two provincial
Governors. The Steering Committee would be established within three months
of loan signing (Section 3.02(b) of the draft Loan Agreement).
33.       At the provincial level, the senior officer in each department
and agency would be the project officer for his organization. The proj-
ect officers would be members of the Provincial Development Council whose
Chairman would be the Governor of each province. The Councils would include
a representative of the Philippine National Bank and the rural banks. They
would meet as needed to coordinate project implementation and resolve inter-
agency problems at the provincial level. Intra-agency coordination would



- 11 -
be handled through normal departmental and agency chains of command through
regional offices to national headquarters. To resolve major conflicts which
remain, the Governors would have direct access to the Project Director.
34.       The alternative of a centralised project organization was con-
sidered and discussed with the Government. However, it was concluded that,
in this instance, a project authority would not be appropriate because it
would tend to cut across the responsibilities of the existing departments
and agencies and might weaken, rather than strengthen, their effectiveness
in Mindoro.
35.       The 3,000 ha of communal irrigation systems to be constructed or
improved under the project would be largely pilot in nature. They would
allow NIA to work out policies and procedures for planning, designing,
building, operating, maintaining and recovering the cost of such small,
scattered systems. The standards, policies and procedures adopted for
Mindoro would have far reaching implications for the country's 300,000 ha
of communal gravity and 150,000 ha of small pump irrigation systems. The
Government has agreed to submit a comprehensive plan for the communal sys-
tems included in the project to the Bank for approval. The proposed schis-
tosomiasis control program, though basically sound, needs to be worked out
in more detail. Again, policies and procedures to control the disease on
Mindoro would have wider relevance for the Philippines as a whole, particu-
larly the islands of Leyte, Samar and Mindanao. The Government has agreed
to revise its plan and submit it to the Bank for approval. Agreement be-
ween the Government and the Bank on plans for communal irrigation and schisto-
somiasis control would be conditions of disbursement for those parts of the
project (Section 2.02 of the draft Loan Agreement). The Government would
also ensure that a qualified seed technician is employed to work at each of
the two seed laboratories (Section 3.03 of the draft Loan Agreement) and
would furnish the Bank, within two years, a proposal to recover the cost of
rodenticides from farmers (Section 3.09 of the draft Loan Agreement). In
order to provide adequate agricultural extension services on Mindoro, the
Government would gradually increase the number of extension workers so that
by 1980 and thereafter, there would be one extension technician to not more
than 300 farmers in each of the provinces. The Government would also establish
and maintain an agricultural development coordinating council in each province
for the purpose of coordinating the provision of agricultural services (Section
3.04(a) and (b) of the draft Loan Agreement).
Cost Recovery for the Irrigation Component
36.       The Pula and Baco-Bucayao national irrigation systems would be
improved, operated and maintained to the standard of the recently approved
Tarlac Irrigation Systems Improvement Project (Loan No. 1080-PH). Water
charges for these irrigation systems would therefore be the same as in the
Tarlac Project. NIA would raise water charges gradually over a period of
5 years from completion of project works to a level sufficient to cover
operation and maintenance cost and to recover (without interest) the total



- 12 -
investment over not more than the 50-year life of the systems taking into
account the farmers' incentives and capacity to pay. A gradual increase in
irrigation fees over a period of five years from completion of construction
to a level equivalent to about 3.5 Cavans of paddy per ha in the wet season
and 4.4 Cavans in the dry season would meet the requirements (Section 4.03(b)
iii of the draft Loan Agreement).
Project Cost and Financing
37.       The project is estimated to cost a total of US$50 million equiv-
alent of which US$22 million would be in foreign exchange. The Bank would
finance half the total project cost, that is the foreign exchange cost plus
US$3 million of local costs. The Government would finance the balance of
$25 million. Each implementing department and agency would maintain a
separate account for the project and would submit all budget requests to
the Project Director for approval. The Project Director would forward
approved requests to the Budget Commissioner, who would provide the necessary
funds directly to the implementing agencies in accordance with normal Gover-
nment procedures which are satisfactory to ensure the continuous and timely
flow of project funds.
Procurement
38.       Each department and agency would be responsible for its own pro-
curement under the project in accordance with the agreed procedures outlined
below, but would submit all documents to the Project Director for informa-
tion. Equipment and vehicles costing about US$3.1 million would be procured
after international competitive bidding in accordance with Bank Group Guide-
lines. A preference limited to 15% of the cif price of imported goods or
the custom duty, whichever is lower, would be extended to local manufac-
turers in the evaluation of bids. Procurement of off-the-shelf items cost-
ing less than US$10,000 each would be purchased through normal Government
procurement procedures which are satisfactory; the total for all such items
would not exceed US$250,000.
39.       Because of their size, location and seasonal nature, civil works
for the national irrigation systems (US$5.2 million) would not be suitable
for international competitive bidding. In the past, such works have failed
to attract much interest even among local contractors. Therefore, in order
to stimulate the local contracting industry in Mindoro, NIA would investigate
ways of expanding the execution of civil works by contract, so that the
amount of work done by force account on the national systems would not
exceed 40 percent of the total cost of the work. The balance would be
awarded on the basis of competitive bidding advertized locally and in
accordance with local procedures, which are satisfactory. The commtunal
irrigation systems (US$0.9 million), which are smaller and more scattered
than the national systems, would be constructed either by NIA force account
or by farmers under NIA supervision.



- 13 -
40.       Contracts for civil works on the national highways (US$8.6 mil-
lion), together with the provincial roads in Oriental Mindoro and the San
Jose district of Occidental Mindoro (US$4.4 million), would be awarded
following international competitive bidding in accordance with Bank Group
Guidelines. To attract both foreign and local bidders, contracts would be
placed on the basis of individual sections or combinations of sections for
the works. The roads in Mamburao and Sablayan districts of Occidental
Mindoro (US$1.3 million), which are isolated from major population centers,
would be constructed by force account by the Department of Public Highways.
The improvements to Calapan port (US$0.2 million) would be carried out by
contract. Because of the small size of the works, contracts would be awarded
on the basis of competitive bidding advertised locally and in accordance with
local procedures, which are satisfactory. Civil works for other components
of the project (US$2.3 million) would be small and scattered and would not
be suitable for competitive bidding. They would be carried out by force
account using mostly manual labor. All costs of equipment and civil works
shown in this and paragraphs 38, 39 and 40 are base costs i.e. before con-
tingencies.
Disbursements
41.       Disbursements would be made at the rate of 100 percent against the
cif cost of directly imported equipment, 100 percent against the ex-factory
cost of locally manufactured equipment and 65 percent for imported equipment
procured locally. For services of technical assistants and consultants, dis-
bursements would cover 100 percent of the foreign exchange cost, or 60 percent
of total costs. For civil works contractors' mobilization and imported equip-
ment, disbursements would be at 100 percent of foreign exchange cost. Other
disbursements for civil works would be at the rate of 50% against certified
monthly progress payments or expenditures.
Economic Justification
42.       A central purpose of the project is to raise farm incomes.   Per
capita incomes on typical size farms would increase from a weighted average
of about $90 at present to about $140 by 1985. The project would thus
benefit directly some 30,000 poor paddy farmers, who with their families,
comprise about 200,000 people or 40% of the island's population. It would
also create the equivalent of some 13,000 seasonal agricultural jobs. At
full development, annual paddy production from the island as a result of
the project would increase by 100,000 tons or 40% above present level. The
increased production would provide enough rice to feed over half a million
people a year. The project would improve the transportation system on
Mindoro and thus provide further benefits to the rural population; it would
also help control schistosomiasis and would benefit the Mangyan tribes who
now live in primitive conditions. Thus the project would generally
revitalize Mindoro and benefit nearly everyone on the island.



- 14 -
43.       The economic rate of return on the national highway improvements
is expected to be about 18%. For the irrigation systems, agricultural pro-
gram and provincial roads taken together, the rates of return range between
15% and 25%. Sensitivity analysis indicates that under a number of adverse
assumptions, the rates of return would not fall below 10%. No attempt was
made to quantify the benefits from the other project components, but they
would all be justified as improving the incomes and living conditions of
Mindoro's rural population.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENT AND AUTHORITY
44.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Republic of the Philippines
and the Bank, the Report and Recommendation of the Committee provided for
in Article III. Section 4 (iii) of the Articles of Agreement of the Bank
and the text of the Resolution approving the proposed loan are being dis-
tributed separately to the Executive Directors. The draft Loan Agreement
substantially conforms to the normal pattern of loans for rural development
projects.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
45.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.

C.   Project in Execution -
Ln. No. 637-PH       Upper Panpanga River Irrigation; US$34.0 million Loan
of August 18, 1969; Closing Date: June 30, 1976
This is the first major irrigation project in the Plhilippines
and will supply water year-round to nearly all its 84,000 ha command area.
The project's on-farm development scheme is setting a pattern for future
irrigation development in the country. Despite some delays caused by the
1972 floods, the dam was coimmissioned on September 7, 1974 ahead of schedule.
All work is expected to be completed in 1975 and the loan entirely disbursed
by June 30, 1976, the Closing Date. Project costs have increased 40% over
appraisal estimates, largely as a result of rapid inflation, the effects of
successive devaluations of the peso, and design changes in the dam (which
accounted for nearly half the increase in costs). The increase in costs is
being financed by the Government. However, as a result of the close coor-
dination established between irrigation and agricultural supporting services,
the project is expected to reach full development in 7 years after completion
of construction, instead of 13 years which was the appraisal estimate. Also,
nearly 7,000 ha have been added to the project, mostly by including lands which
were formerly under a private irrigation system. Finally, there has been
a considerable increase in the projected world market price of rice. As a
result, the rate of return estimate is now more favorable than at appraisal.
Ln. No. 720-PH       Rice Processing and Storage; US$14.3 million Loan of
February 4, 1971; Closing Date: June 30, 1977
This project provides long-term credit through the Development
Bank of the Philippines to finance a program for the development and
modernization of the rice and corn processing industry. Originally the
project was restricted to rice and to the private sector, and the emphasis
was on the construction of new integrated rice mills with large capacities.
Due in part to poor harvests and in part to large cost increases for rice
mills, the demand for sub-loans for new integrated rice maills turned out
to be small, and, as explained in the President's Memorandum dated June 8,
1972 (R72-40), the loan agreement was amended to shift the project emphasis
to rehabilitation of existing rice milling facilities. In spite of this
the project made little progress. T.he loan agreement was amended again
1/ These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarditng
the progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report any
problems which are being encountered, and the action being taken to
remedy them. They should be read in this sense, and with the under-
standing that they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of
strengths and weaknesses in probject execution.

in April, 1974 basically (i) to expand the scope of the project to include
corn in addition to rice, (ii) to enable local governments and the National
Grains Authority to borrow funds under the project, and (iii) to streamline
procurment procedures (President's memorandum Sec. M74-244 of April 15, 1974).
As a result of these amendments, the project is now progressing satisfactorily
and the loan is expected to be fully disbursed long before the revised
Closing Date, June 30, 1977.
Ln. No. 731-PH      Highway; US$8.0 million Loan of April 14, 1971;
Closing Date: May 15, 1975
The construction of the Cotabato-Digos Road is only 55% complete
based on the original scope of works. The delay being mainly due to
civil disturbances and army activity on part of the road representing about
20% of the total roadworks. As there is little chance of the contractor
being able to enter this area, the Bank has agreed to a Government proposal
to delete this stretch of the road from the contract and eventually execute
the work by force account; the undisbursed amount of the loan fund will be
applied to the balance of works which can be completed by contract. The
total project cost, allowing for the reduced scope of works, is still
estimated at US$15.8 million, the same as the appraisal estimate. Construc-
tion progress is slightly behind the revised work schedule, which foresees
completion by May 31, 1975. Consulting services for detailed engineering of
roads now constructed under the Second Highway Project (Loan 950-PH) were
completed in late 1973.   UNDP financed road feasibility studies and a
highway technical assistance program, which also form part of the project,
were completed in the same year. Technical AssistAnce tp the Department of
Public Highways is continuing with Bank financing under the Second Highway
Project.
Ln. No. 809-PH and Fifth Power; US$22.0 million and US$10.0 million Loan
Cr. No. 296-PH       and Credit of April 3. 1972; Closing Date:   June 30, 1978
The project is helping the National Power Corporation (NPC) to
finance the construction of a second thermal unit of 150-MW at Bataan and
transmission facilities in Luzon. After initial delays, the project is
proceeding satisfactorily. All contracts have been awarded. Major equipment
is being manufactured. Construction work has started on 230 kV transmission
lines. NPC's financial situation has been improved by the imposition in July
1973 of a surcharge to cover increased fuel costs. A further tariff
increase was approved, effective July 1, 1974. But due to recent inflation
this would not enable NPC to achieve the covenanted rate of return of 8
percent. NPC is therefore considering another tariff increase in mid-1975.
Ln. No. 823-PH       Livestock; US$7.5 million Loan of May 25, 1972;
Closing Date: December 31, 1978
The project is assisting Government in carrying out its livestock
development program through credit supervised by the Development Bank of the



AVNEX I'i
Page 5
Philippines. The start of DBP lending operations was delayed by about six
months because of late appointment of technical staff.   Although sub-loan
commitments were slow as a result of this, they are now improving, and all
funds are expected to be fully committed by December, 1975.   The project has
expanded the agricultural credit capability of DBP into a new and important
field thus meeting a previously unsatisfied demand for small to medium scale
livestock development finance.
Cr. No. 471-PH      Aurora-Penaranda Irrigation; US$9.5 million Credit of
May 149, 1974; Closing Date:  June 30, 1979
Ln. No. 984-PH      Aurora-Penaranda Irrigation: US$9.5 million Loan of
May 14. 1974; Closing Date:   June 30, 1979
The project will assist the Government to rehabilitate and open up
25,300 hectares of land in Central Luzon for year round irrigation for rice
growing. It also provides for a study of irrigation development in Central
Luzon. The loan became effective on August 22, 1974. It is progressing
satisfactorily.
Ln. No. 998-PH      Industrial Investment and Smallholder Tree-farmers:
US$50.0 million; Loan of June 12, 1974:
Closing Date: December 31, 1981
The proceeds of the loan will be relent to the Development Bank
of the Philippines (DBP).   The industrial portion of the loan (US$48 mill4son)
will be used by DBP to make sub-loans to finance direct imports for medium
and relatively large industrial projects. DBP will use the balance (US$2
million) to finance about 1,300 smallholders in a pilot tree-farming
project. The loan became effective on September 9, 1974. Since then,
commitments for sub-loans totalling $21.2 million have been made.
Ln. No. 1010-PH     Third Rural Credit; US$22.0 million: Loan of June 17. 1974;
Closing Date: December 31, 1977
The Central Bank will relend the proceeds of the Loan (except for
a small amount for an evaluation study) to participating banks. These will
relend the funds to farmers and rural entrepreneurs to finance investment
in farm mechanisation, on-farm transportation, farm support facilities and
equipment, coastal and inland fisheries, small-scale livestock development
and cottage-scale agro-industry. The project also provides for a review
by local experts of the first, second and third rural credit projects. The
loan became effective on August 27, 1974. It is progressing satisfactorily.
Ln. No. 1034-PH     Sixth Power; US$61.0 million; Loan of July 31,, 1974;
Closing Date: December 31, 1978
The project is helping the National Power Corporation (NPC) to
finance a 100MW hydro plant at Pantabangan and transmission lines for the



ANNEX II
Page 6
further expansion of the Luzon grid and feasibility studies by consultants
for a future power project. NPC raised its tariff in July, 1974 to meet
the covenanted rate of return of 8 percent. But due to recent inflation
it would not be able to achieve this. NPC is therefore considering another
tariff increase in mid-1975.
Cr. No. 349-PH      Second Education: US$12.7 million; Credit of January
5, 1973; Closing Date: December 31. 1976
The project will assist Government to improve such areas as educa-
tion, planning, management and curriculum development, science teacher
training, and training of technicians, skilled craftsmen and farmers. The
project is currently a few months behind schedule, but the delay is being
reduced through action by the project unit on civil works, designs and
equipment procurement. The project is expected to be completed on schedule.
Current problems include unexpected cost overruns (42% higher than the orig-
inal estimate), difficulty in introducing reforms in admissions, and quality
standards of project agricultural colleges. The government has agreed to
finance overruns and is considering steps to solve the other problems.
Disbursements are expected to start in the second half of FY75 and remain
ahead of, or on, schedule until project completion.
Ln. No. 891-PH       Fisheries; US$11.6 million Loan of May 21, 1973;
Closing Date: June 30, 1979
This project is designed to provide long term credit to the private
sector through the Development Bank of the Philippines for marine and inland
fisheries development. The loan became effective on December 5, 1973. The
demand for loans is adequate, and the organization to implement them has
been properly established. The project is progressing satisfactorily, and
all funds are expected to be fully committed by December, 1975.
Ln. No. 939-PH       Second Ports; US$6.1 million Loan of October 24, 1973;
Closing Date:  December 31. 1977
This project provides for the rehabilitation and expansion of the
ports of General Santos and Cagayan de Oro in the island of Mindanao. Bids
for the civil works for both ports were opened on November 22, 1974, with
only one bid received for each port. Bidding results, particularly that
for the works at Cagayan de Oro, were substantially higher than the appraisal
cost estimates and the consultants' estimate of August 1974. The works
at Cagayan de Oro are expected to be re-bid, and the start of construction
is expected to be delayed.
Ln. No. 950-PH      Second Highway; US$6.1 million Loan of December 12,
1973; Closing Date: December 31. 1977
The project is helping the Government to implement its program
of construction, improvement and rehabilitation of highways and feeder roads.



ANNEX II
Page 7
Work has begun on twelve of the fourteen contracts. In line with world-wide
inflation, costs have increased sharply during the past 12 months. Price
adjustments are being awarded to contractors by the Government to offset
the sharp rises in costs of basic materials, fuels and labor. The UNDP
financed Road Feasibility Studies (Phase II), for which the Bank is Exe-
cuting Agency, are progressing satisfactorily and a possible Third Highway
project has already been identified. Execution of other minor project
items is proceeding generally on schedule.
Ln. No. 1035-PH     Population; US$25.0 million; Loan of July 31, 1974;
Closing Date: December 31, 1979
The project is assisting the Government in expanding rural
health infrastructure, staff training facilities, and research and
communications capacity. This will help the Philippines achieve their
long-term goal of fertility reduction. The loan is progressing satis-
factorily.
Ln. No. 1048-PH     Inter-Island Shipping; US$20 million; Loan of October 29,
1974; Closing Date: June 30. 1979
The Government will relend the proceeds of the loan to the Develop-
ment Bank of the Philippines for onlending to beneficiaries for the acquisi-
tion of new and used ships and for major repairs and conversions. The loan
became effective on January 15, 1975.
Ln. No. 1052-PH     Private Development Corporation of the Philippines
Loan of November 12, 1974; Closing Date: June 30, 1979
The project will assist in the financing of industrial projects
in the Philippines. The Loan Agreement was signed on November 12, 1974. It
became effective on February 7, 1975.
Ln. No. 1080-PH      Tarlac Irrigation; US$17.0 million; Loan of January
27. 1975; Closing Date: December 31. 1980
The project will assist the Government to improve and expand 34,000
hectares of land in Central Luzon for wet season irrigation for rice growing.
It will also provide for a ground water pilot scheme, a water management
training program and a national irrigation systems improvement study. The
Loan Agreement was signed on January 27, 1975, It is expected to be
effective before April 27, 1975.
