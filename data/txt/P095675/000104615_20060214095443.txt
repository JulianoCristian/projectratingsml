1. 
Country and sector background 
Brazil
’s total factor productivity (TFP), the key to growth and competitiveness, grew 
considerably faster than the world technological frontier during the economic reform era of 
1967-1977, slipped badly from then until around 1992, when inflation and government controls 
were rampant, and has been growing at about the same rate as the world technological frontier 
for the last decade. One major indicator of this lackluster performance is that Brazil’s share of 
total world exports fell from over 2 percent in 1948 to less than 1 percent
 
by 2000. Despite a 
variety of market-friendly reforms since the early 1990s, there remains a wide variety of 
microeconomic measures that Brazil could take to improve the performance of its economy. 
 
2. 
Key development issues and rationale for Bank involvement 
Since the first operation, macroeconomic fundamentals of the Brazilian economy improved even 
further, a result of resilient commitment to sound macroeconomic management. For example, 
primary surplus increased from 4.25 to 5.25 percent; debt-to-GDP ratio fell from 57.0 to 51.4 
percent; the share of public debt indexed to the exchange rate decreased from 20 to roughly 4 
percent; services of external debt as a share of exports declined from 20 to almost to 10 percent; 
and international reserves increased to US$60 billion. Sovereign spreads dropped systematically 
to less than 400 points. At the same time, economic growth in the period averaged 4 percent, 
inflation has been kept within the targets and unemployment decreased 2 percentage points. For 
the first time in three decades, the Brazilian economy has been experiencing a macroeconomic 
environment that combines reasonable growth prospects with low inflation and a relatively 
comfortable external situation.

The First Programmatic and Sustainable Growth Loan (Board presentation in January, 2004) 
supported the design of a program of reforms that constituted a new growth strategy for Brazil. 
Microeconomic, institutional and policy reforms were started in the areas of: (i) logistics; (ii) 
business environment; (iii) financial efficiency and depth; and (iv) innovation and technology 
policy. It targeted key measures to boost private investment and productivity while avoiding 
inefficient microeconomic policies. The following loan in the programmatic loan series (Board 
presentation in June, 2005) extended the 
Bank’s support mainly to the housing sector where the 
government undertook several steps to create an efficient unified formal housing market based 
on private capital-markets, a clear departure from a history of directed credit and market 
segmentation. The proposed operation (Second Programmatic and Sustainable Growth Loan) 
would, then, consolidate reforms in the four areas originally selected by the first operation, 
supporting achievements reached by the Brazilian administration between 2004 and 2005.
 
3. 
 Proposed objective(s) 
The proposed loan would support a critical mass of microeconomic and institutional reforms in 
the areas originally selected by the first programmatic loan: (i) logistics; (ii) business 
environment; (iii) financial efficiency and depth; and (iv) innovation and technology policy. 
 
4. Preliminary 
description 
The pillar of reforms adopted since the first operation is the approval by Congress in December 
2004 of the Public-Private Partnership (PPP) Law, the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Law and the 
corresponding amendments to the National Tax Code.
1
The enactment of the Innovation Law, 
originally conceived as a trigger for a later operation, was also attained in December 2004.
2
Several additional steps, although unevenly distributed among the four areas, indicate a 
reasonable level of government commitment with the overall program and provide for required 
“critical mass” for the proposed operation. As further evidence of commitment, the reform of the 
judiciary, a field not originally supported by the program due to its complexity, was initiated. 
Reform progress during 2004-2005 surpass by large the thresholds defined in either scenario 
established by the First Loan (i.e., “Uneven Reform Progress Across Pillars” and “More Uniform 
but Slower Progress”) for a follow-up operation.

Annex 1 includes a summary matrix with the 
main prior actions to be supported by the current operation, possible next steps, and medium 
term actions. The following summarizes the achievements of the Brazilian government in core 
reform areas:  
 
a) On logistics, the average net release time was reduced by 20 percent (15 percent for imports 
and 30 percent on exports). The federal government also transferred to the states 3,432 km and 
3,446 km in 2004 and 2005, respectively, thereby increasing the potential for road maintenance 
activities. The second phase of the federal road concession program, of about 3,059 km, is to be 
launched after several years of intense questioning from the
 Tribunal de Contas da União
 
(General Accounting Office). Output-based contracts now account roughly for 30 percent of 
1
Laws No. 11,079/2004 and No. 11,101/2005, respectively.  
2
Law No. 10,973/2004.

Sustainable and Equitable Growth. 2004.

public investments in road maintenance and rehabilitation, improving the quality of public 
expenditures in infrastructure. A career plan was established for the national department for 
transport planning (DNIT) which will help to attract better qualified staff.
4
b) On the business environment, the PPP law creates the legal framework for efficient public 
expenditures while the approval of a career development plan for the staff of regulatory agencies 
enhances regulatory governance, both important steps to boost private investment in 
infrastructure. The final approval of the Bankruptcy Law
 
was pivotal, not only because the 
reform process was delayed for more than 10 years in Congress but also because its impact on 
improving firms’ turnaround and preserving intangible assets is expected to be significant. A 
draft law that consolidates the Brazilian antitrust regime was sent to Congress after five years of 
public discussion, an important step to improve the competitive environment in the country.
5
In 
order to simplify firm registry and operation, the government is supporting Congress Bill of Law 
number 210/2004
 
that facilitates the formalization of micro-enterprises particularly through the 
full-exemption of Federal taxes and changes in the Social Security requirements.
6
Moreover, 
significant initiatives to improve contract enforcement by the judiciary were undertaken, an area 
in which the government originally had lower expectations. These included the approval of a 
constitutional amendment that has the potential to improve the appeal system by making 
supreme court-rulings binding and creates the 
Conselho Nacional de Justiça
,
a
core institution 
for reform implementation; and the submission to Congress of several Bills of Law to improve 
procedural issues and support alternative dispute resolution mechanisms.
7
c) On the financial sector, a formal agreement between the antitrust authority and the central 
bank was signed, establishing a clearer division of responsibilities in the oversight of competition 
issues. With the objective of mobilizing long-term resources in the insurance sector, a law 
providing for the gradual opening of the reinsurance market was sent to Congress.
8
In November 
2004, the Federal Government also launched the National Program of Oriented Productive Micro 
Credit (PNMPO), aimed at expanding access to productive credit for formal and informal micro-
entrepreneurs.
9
Other actions to encourage lending include the introduction of the payroll 
deduction loans and new securitization and insurance mechanisms for the agricultural and 
housing sectors.  
 
d) On the technology side, the approval of the Innovation Law
 
is a very important step towards a 
productive application of the scientific knowledge available in Brazil. The envisaged instruments 
include the possibility of agreements between public entities and private companies, the transfer 
of technology and sharing public infrastructure of laboratories, equipment and instruments with

(Bill of Law 52/2004); (ii) procedural reform for out-of court securities settlements (Bill of Law 4,497/2004); and 
(iii) other projects of reform of the Civil-Law Code of Procedures [(a) Bill of Law 4,723/2004, (b) Bill of Law

private companies. Additionally, the Ministry of Science and Technology (MCT) took several 
initial steps to rationalize the use of public resources available to finance R&D activities through 
the “Sector Funds.” 
 
4.    Environnent Aspects 
Issues: 
The main direct environmental aspects will the operationalizing of the Inter-ministerial 
Commission for Climate Change (ICCC), which is to be in charge of all issues related to the 
Kyoto Protocol and the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM). Brazil has excellent prospects 
for attracting external financing under the CDM for the provision of global environmental 
services, especially biodiversity protection and carbon sequestration. Unlike in most other 
developing countries, the Brazilian private sector has been aggressively seeking out CDM 
projects, but cannot move ahead until the ICCC is functional, has defined the criteria for 
sustainable development, and is then able to certify whether each proposed project contributes to 
sustainable development.
