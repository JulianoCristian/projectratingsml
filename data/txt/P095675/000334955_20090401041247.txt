F. Results Framework Analysis

Program Development Objectives (from Program Document)
The main objective of this program is to support sustainable and equitable economic
growth in Brazil. The program will raise Brazil's sustainable economic growth potential,
thus increasing employment and reducing poverty. In logistics, key actions will cut
customs release times by 40 percent, cut container handling costs in ports by 10 percent,
lower road transport costs by about 5 percent and increase non-road transportation by 10
percent. Improvements to the business environment will increase public-private
partnership, increase cartel prosecutions by the competition authorities, halve the time to
register a business in selected cities, and increase the speed of resolution and the recovery
value of insolvent enterprises under the new bankruptcy law. Financial sector reforms
will reduce bank overheads, increase financial access and reduce credit risk, accelerate
the expansion of the insurance industry, and increase access to bank accounts from 95
million to 103 million people by the end of the program. In innovation, a new innovation
law will increase technology transfer contracts between universities and the private sector
by 20 percent and increase the private share in R&D by 10 percentage points. Supported
improvements in the Clean Development Mechanism will generate at least US$100
million in carbon credits.

1. Program Context, Development Objectives and Design

This implementation Completion Report (ICR) describes the results of a series of two DPLs: the
First Programmatic Loan for Sustainable and Equitable Growth (GDPL1) and the Second
Programmatic Loan for Sustainable and Equitable Growth (GDPL2). Together they comprise a
programmatic lending operation spanning four years of the Lula1 da Silva Administration. The
results of the first operation were presented in a Simplified ICR . These results will be briefly
reviewed in this document, as well as in the context of describing the program results. The last
operation will be described in more detail in this document as will the full program results.


1.1 Context at Appraisal

Context at Appraisal of GDPL1

During the 1990s Brazil had laid the institutional foundations for a sounder macroeconomic
management and better inflation control. High inflation had been eradicated by the end of the
decade and the combination of inflation targeting, fiscal balance, and a floating exchange rate
regime had created a stable macroeconomic base, the permanence of high interest rates
notwithstanding. Although efforts had begun to make public spending more effective in attacking
poverty, economic growth during the decade had remained at a disappointing 1 percent and
national unemployment had reached record levels of around 13 percent. The "first generation"
structural reforms were unable to foster solid growth. Public investment had fallen to about 2.6
percent of GDP and private investment had remained weak, partly because of the uncertain
investment climate particularly in relation to Government regulation and microeconomic
impediments to investment, innovation, and productivity. Fiscal rigidities and high Government
consumption leaved little room for public investments, especially in infrastructure. Government
deficits continued to crowd private-sector borrowing out of credit markets, and the financial
sector was still highly regulated and dominated by large public sector institutions.


Brazil's administration of President Lula da Silva combined a clear commitment to social
justice with a sound economic program. The new administration had taken office on January
2003 with the strong support of social movements. Faced with low investor confidence, currency
depreciation, and inflation, the administration increased interest rates and cut spending. As a
result, inflation and inflationary expectations were brought in line with targets set by the Central
Bank of Brazil (BCB). During 2003, the Government introduced a number of reforms including
initiating the reform of the public-sector social security system and the rationalization of Brazil's
system of social assistance transfers. The Government's economic strategy--the Growth
Agenda--included growth determinants such as macroeconomic stability, education, institutions
and governance. At the core of this strategy are a number of microeconomic measures and
institutional reforms--The Growth Program (see Annex 9)--to improve economic efficiency and
stimulate investments and savings. The GDPL1 was approved in February 2004, to support a
subset of microeconomic, institutional and policy reforms within the Growth Program in the areas
of logistics, business environment, financial efficiency and depth, and knowledge and innovation.

Context at Appraisal of GDPL2

By early 2006, macroeconomic fundamentals of the Brazilian economy had greatly improved.
The austere macro-fiscal policy had generated an impressive improvement of market sentiment
with regard to the sustainability and growth prospects of the Brazilian economy. The primary
surplus grew from 3.9 percent of GDP in 2002 to 4.9 percent in 2005. Government had used the
primary surplus as a device to assure Brazil's credibility in financial markets and guarantee the
sustainability of public debt. The responsible fiscal stance resulted in significant fall of public
debt as share of GDP and the improvement of debt composition. Inflation fell from 12.5 percent
in 2002 to 5.7 percent in 2005. The realignment of inflationary expectations to the BCB target
zone heralded a substantial reduction of the interest rate from 26.5 percent in February 2003 to 16
percent in April 2004. The value of exports almost doubled from 2002 to 2005 as a result of high
commodity prices and diversified industrial exports. The current account of the balance of
payments reached a surplus of 0.8 percent of GDP in 2003 and 1.8 percent of GDP in 2005.
External debt sustainability indicators were the best in the last 30 years. Sovereign spreads fell
from 2,400 basis points in October 2002 to below 300 basis points in 2005. The robust trade and
current account balances promoted an appreciation of the exchange rate from RS$3.60 to the US
dollar to RS$2.25 over the same period. The improvement of macroeconomic conditions allowed
Brazil not to renew the stand-by arrangement with the IMF and to make an early repayment of its
entire outstanding obligations in January 2006.

While Brazil had begun to pick up the returns of its sound macroeconomic policy in terms of
poverty reduction, growth rates had remained below expectations. The government program of
well targeted conditional cash transfers and the recovery of labor income were having the desired
effect in improving income distribution, as indicated by the fall of the Gini index from 0.59 in
2002 to 0.57 in 2004, and the drop in poverty from 32.9 percent in 2002 to 31.7 percent in 2004.
However, growth rates remained disappointing compared with other parts of the world and even
other countries in the region. After the 2003 adjustment, the Brazilian economy had experienced
an expansionary period and the growth rate increased from 0.5 percent in 2003 to 4.9 percent in
2004 (the highest rate in ten years). But the tight monetary and fiscal policies decelerated the
growth rate to around 2.9 percent in 2005, and the expectation was that the growth rate for 2006
would only recover to around 3 to 4 percent. By early 2006, the vast majority of key conditions
established for a second DPL operation had been met, including the approval of important
legislative pieces. The GDPL2 was approved in June 2006.

Structural/sector background

The Government's Growth Program addressed constraints to Brazil's growth in a number of
microeconomic areas, including four areas supported by the Growth DPL series: (i) logistics, (ii)
business environment, (iii) financial efficiency and depth, and (iv) knowledge and innovation.

Logistics

Logistic costs accounted for the largest share of doing business in Brazil. Conservative
estimates suggested that avoidable logistics costs added more than US$1.2 billion per year to the
costs of external trade and at least US$1.3 billion per year to the costs of domestic inter-regional
trade in corridors with available rail services, particularly in poorer regions. High logistics costs
resulted from the combination of four factors: (i) excessive delays for customs clearance.
Clearance time on import and exports averaged 5 and 2 days, respectively, more than twice the
international averages due to the excessive focus on revenue collection rather than on trade
facilitation; (ii) poor conditions of the road network. Inadequate road maintenance for many



                                                  2

years was due to fiscal and institutional limitations; (iii) inefficient port services. The Port
Modernization Law was passed in 1993, but the reform of port services remained incomplete;
and, (iv) insufficient development of multimodal transportation systems. Freight transport
market was dominated by trucking over long distances instead of low-cost coastal shipping or
rail-based options.

Business Environment

Insufficient investment in infrastructure due to limitations in the regulatory framework.
Investment in infrastructure as a share of GDP had remained under 1 percent for much of the last
decade. Low investment rates resulted from the incompleteness of the legal environment in
selected sectors, the inappropriateness of concession designs; the weaknesses of regulatory
governance, and the high rate of renegotiation of contracts. The least developed regulatory
framework was in the water and sanitation sector, but some major progress was still required to
consolidate the legal framework in the electricity sector and increase market opportunities in the
gas and railway industries. Cumbersome procedures for obtaining environmental licenses were a
source of risk, particularly in the energy and road sectors. Ill-defined property rights and
liabilities in concession contracts and the absence of an appropriate basis for efficient public-
private partnerships in infrastructure projects were also obstacles for higher levels of investment.

Unfriendly investment environment due to weaknesses in the legal framework and its
enforcement. The main problems included: (i) Weaknesses in competition law enforcement.
Brazil's Competition Law broadly resembles competition laws in other countries, but
enforcement has been weak due to the complex enforcement of merger control provisions,
institutional fragmentation with three Government bodies involved in competition law
enforcement, and lack of a stable corps of qualified professionals; (ii) Weaknesses in the
framework for creditor rights and slow contract enforcement by the Judiciary. Although the
legislation for corporate insolvency provided for both reorganization in the case of insolvency
and for liquidation processes, the system was characterized by weak creditor protection and few
meaningful rehabilitation options. Poorly designed procedures hindered turnaround of viable
enterprises in distress and impeded the efficient functioning of credit markets. In addition,
difficulties associated with judicial debt collection, due to procedural requirements, weakened
creditors' rights and rendered credit more expensive; and (iii) Government-generated entry
barriers. These included unduly complicated business registration processes, costly and time-
consuming labor regulations, restrictive standards and registration procedures, and difficulties in
acquiring and developing land or receiving environmental licensing, at the federal, state and
municipal levels. The cumulative effect of these requirements removed the incentive to formally
register a business, leading to a vicious circle of informality and contributed to lower productivity


Financial Markets

Scarce and expensive credit for individuals and SMEs. Although financial depth in Brazil,
gauged by the ratio of credit to GDP, was somewhat greater than in other major countries in the
region, it was considerably lower than in several emerging markets, due in part to the "crowding
out" of bank intermediation by Government borrowing. Additionally, about 40 percent of total
credit in the banking system was "earmarked", at non-competitive rates, for selected sectors such
as housing and agriculture. Credit spreads (an average of 40 percent per annum) were among the
highest in the world. In this context, small and medium enterprises (SMEs) and low income
individuals had limited access to financing. The bulk of financing to SMEs came from public
banks or microfinance institutions indirectly supported by public banks at subsidized rates.



                                                   3

Important complementary reforms were still needed to strengthen financial intermediation.
The amendment in 2003 of Article 192 of Brazil's Constitution paved the way for a series of
reforms by allowing the individual treatment of different issues by appropriate complementary
laws. Specific areas for further reform included: (i) the legal framework for systemic risk control
and bank failure resolution. The failure of one medium-sized bank prior to appraisal of GDPL1
showed that the legal framework for systemic risk control and bank failure resolution was still
inadequate and needed upgrading to ensure maximum protection of small depositors and retail
investors; (ii) the retail payments system and credit information systems. Although a Real Time
Gross Settlement System (RTGS) had been launched in 2002, there was considerable room for
improvement in the efficiency of retail payment instruments and systems. In the area of credit
information regulation was needed for the enhanced use of positive credit information to expand
coverage and facilitate access to credit to low income individuals and SMEs; (iii) competition
and antitrust oversight in the banking sector. Market structure and barriers to entry were a
constraint to a competitive and affordable provision of financial services to the population at
large; and (iv) the capital markets. The contribution of pension funds and insurance companies to
financial intermediation and growth had yet to achieve its potential due, among other reasons, to
their moderate size relative to banks, under-funding problems in closed pension funds, and
excessive financing of the public sector (which accounted for roughly half of their portfolios). A
large share of resources in the insurance industry continued to be channeled to finance the public
sector. One reason for limited technical skills and product innovation was the Government's
reinsurance monopoly through the Brazilian Reinsurance Institute (IRB).


Knowledge and Innovation

Brazil has been a pioneer of science and technology policies in Latin America, but overall
technological performance measures of private sector innovation and technology absorption
were not as good as expected. In 1998, Brazilian R&D spending as a share of GDP was the
largest in Latin America and spending per researcher was in line with other countries in the same
income level. But federal R&D spending declined, on average, 3.1 percent per year between 1996
and 2002. R&D effectiveness measured by the ratio of US patents to R&D expenditures and the
number of licensing agreements was also low by international standards. Low private-sector
innovation levels were caused more by the low effectiveness of R&D expenditures than by a
shortage of inputs. Low innovative outputs were the result of misaligned incentives for public
R&D and weak Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) protection. Seventy-five percent of the
Brazilian R&D efforts were aimed at "general knowledge improvement" as opposed to any
specific activity, an emphasis on basic research that is much higher than that found in countries
with arguably comparable cultural heritage. Cost-effective output-oriented research was not duly
rewarded and the transfer of public-sector generated knowledge to the private sector for
commercial application was not encouraged. Public resources allocated through "Sector Funds"
could not be directly transferred to the private sector to support R&D. On the other hand, low
private R&D investments was due to low expected net private returns, since IPR laws in Brazil
were still inadequate despite recent improvements. Also, Innovating in Environmental Markets
was at an incipient stage. Brazil was a signatory of the Kyoto Protocol. The Brazilian Inter-
ministerial Commission for Global Climate Change (ICCC), the Designated National Authority
responsible for the approval and promotion of CDM (Clean Development Mechanism) needed
restructuring to improve efficiency, and its approval process had to be streamlined and the
monitoring system improved, in order to take full advantage of market potentials.

Rationale for Bank Assistance

The Program of Growth DPLs was a key part of the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for
2004-2007, discussed by the Board on December 9, 2003. The CAS proposed Bank support
towards a more equitable, sustainable and competitive Brazil, built upon a foundation of good
governance and macroeconomic stability. The Growth Program was a centerpiece of the Bank's
planned support to Brazil and one of the four thematic pillars of the CAS2. This series of
programmatic loans supported the third pillar of the CAS "A More Competitive Brazil", which
pursued a more competitive Brazil through reduced logistics and financial costs; increased
investment through better regulation; and increased productivity through innovation. The series of
programmatic loans also supported the sustainability and equity pillars of the CAS by
strengthening natural resource management through strengthened environmental licensing
services, and through innovative market development initiatives such as the CDM and carbon
trading under the Kyoto protocol. In addition, the program pursued more equitable growth
through measures to ensure access of the poor to financial services. In assessing its support for
the Growth Program, the Bank had concluded that the program was politically feasible due to the
Government's emphasis on consensus building in support of the reforms, and that the reforms
were consistent with sound macroeconomic management and subject to public scrutiny.

1.2 Original Program Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

Program Development Objectives. The main objective of this program was to support
sustainable and equitable economic growth in Brazil. The program would raise Brazil's
sustainable economic growth potential, thus increasing employment and reducing poverty. In
logistics, key actions will cut customs release times by 40 percent, cut container handling costs in
ports by 10 percent, lower road transport costs by about 5 percent and increase non-road
transportation by 10 percent. Improvements to the business environment will increase public-
private partnership, increase cartel prosecutions by the competition authorities, halve the time to
register a business in selected cities, and increase the speed of resolution and the recovery value
of insolvent enterprises under the new bankruptcy law. Financial sector reforms will reduce bank
overheads, increase financial access and reduce credit risk, accelerate the expansion of the
insurance industry, and increase access to bank accounts from 95 million to 103 million people by
the end of the program. In innovation, a new innovation law will increase technology transfer
contracts between universities and the private sector by 20 percent and increase the private share
in R&D by 10 percentage points. Supported improvements in the CDM will generate at least
US$100 million in carbon credits.

Program Design. Bank support for Brazil's Growth Program was designed as a series of
programmatic loans. In GDPL1 key next steps were established and a set of complementary
measures, a critical mass of additional reform initiatives, were defined in each of the four selected
reform areas: logistics, business environment, financial sector and innovation. GDPL2 was to be
prepared when the vast majority of key conditions had been concluded, including the approval of
important legislative pieces. GDPL2 was designed to consolidate reforms implemented in the
four areas originally selected, and reinforce steps taken to improve judicial performance, a field
not originally supported by the program due to its complexity. A third Growth DPL had been
envisaged, but it was dropped. The Bank and the authorities decided that with a much-improved

  The four thematic pillars of the CAS were: A More Equitable Brazil, A More Sustainable Brazil, A More
Competitive Brazil and Good Governance and Public Sector Management.




                                                  5

macroeconomic situation and reduced vulnerability in Brazil, the Bank should provide less
financing and more knowledge services to the Federal Government and focus the majority of its
funding on State programs. The Series of Growth DPLs was accompanied by a US$12.12 million
Sustainable and Equitable Growth Technical Assistance Loan (Growth TAL) to support the
ministries involved in the four areas of the program.

Key Indicators. GDPL1 defined a result-oriented framework in which key measures (triggers),
progress indicators and target outcomes were identified for each reform area. In logistics, the
main targets were deep cuts in the through times in customs and ports to ease trade and improve
productivity, and improvements in road maintenance. Within the business environment, an
important target was to halve the average time taken to register a new business. The number of
cartel prosecutions would also provide an indication of progress in improving antitrust activity.
The main measures of success of financial reforms would be falling intermediation spreads and
increased access to credit. In innovation, a higher share of private R&D and a value of trade
under the CDM of roughly US$100 million were some of the outcome indicators. GDPL2
incorporated most of the same key progress indicators revising the target values in the areas in
which the original target values had been achieved, and adding new indicators for new actions
concerning facilitating entry and exit, improvement of judicial contracts, and access to financial
services. The table of PDO indicators in Section F has been modified to present outcome
indicators of both, GDPL1 and GDPL2 as defined in the Summary Matrices of these operations.


1.3 Revised PDO (if any, as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators,
and Reasons/Justification

The Program Development Objectives are basically the same for both Growth DPLs, although
some output indicators and target values of some outcome indicators were modified and
additional indicators were incorporated in GDPL2 concerning tax reform, improvement of
judicial contracts, and regulation on credit reporting, reflecting new developments and
Government priorities.


1.4 Original Policy Areas Supported by the Program (as approved):

The Growth DPL series supported structural legal and institutional measures in four areas of
Brazil's Growth Agenda: logistics, business environment, financial efficiency and depth, and
innovation. A feature of Brazil's Growth Agenda is that it consists not only of passing laws
(constitutional amendments and complementary laws), but also of (a) defining approaches to
public-private interactions, (b) strengthening the institutional capacity of agencies to plan and
regulate, and (c) enforcing laws and regulations consistently and predictably. This required the
exercise of judgment in defining the triggers of the Growth DPLs appropriately, since there was a
trade-off between insisting on "observables" such as laws or the formation of agencies, and "less
tangible" measures such as the definition of an approach in a Government White Paper or the
adoption of hiring norms in an agency, which taken together could be more important for
economic growth than enacting new laws strictu sensu. The Growth DPL series contains a
combination of these two types of action.

(in design, scope and scale, implementation arrangements and schedule, and funding
allocations)

As indicated, the Growth DPL series had been envisaged as three consecutive operations.
However, the Bank and the Brazilian authorities decided to drop the third operation on the
consideration that with a much-improved macroeconomic situation and reduced vulnerability,
Brazil was not in need of Bank financing and that the Bank should focus on providing knowledge
services to the country. The same consideration led to a decision to disburse only US$150.0
million of the originally approved loan amount of US$601.510 million of GDPL2.


2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Program Performance.

Program performance of both Growth DPLs was moderately satisfactory in the sense that a
number of legal and institutional reforms were implemented in the four reform areas covered by
the program and that the triggers for the GDPL2 were met. However, program performance
varied among components and in some areas the reforms lacked enough depth to achieve the
expected outcomes. Moreover, dropping a third operation meant that follow up actions needed to
complete the reforms were not taken in some areas. The following is a summary of the program's
performance by component focusing on the prior actions met for each GDPL and the key output
indicators for the program, including some intermediate indicators presented in the summary
matrix of each operation. Outcome indicators are discussed in Section 3 of this report.

Component A. Reduce Logistic Costs.


                                                 8

The Government program to reduce logistic costs focused on addressing the problems of
excessive delays for customs clearance, inefficient port services, poor conditions of the road
network, and insufficient development of the multimodal transport system. As shown below,
some progress has been achieved in improving customs effectiveness, in roads maintenance, and
in improving the ports, but less progress has been made in fostering multimodal transport.

(1) Improve customs effectiveness. A prior action to GDPL1 was the approval of a customs
reform strategy. Following this strategy, improvements were made in customs effectiveness with
the modernization of clearing systems and of the customs administration's management
information systems. As a result, the goals of cutting selectivity levels from 40 percent to 30
percent and reducing the average release time of merchandise by 20 percent were accomplished
by early 2006, before approval of GDPL2. Export procedures have been simplified, especially
through the expansion of the Blue lane regime. As a result, it is faster to complete an export or an
import. A customs administration modernization plan, financed under the Growth TAL was
approved in October 2008. However, the customs administration modernization plan and the
reengineering of customs procedures and systems are not yet fully implemented.

(2) Reduce port costs and delays. The approval of the Agenda Portos, the creation of a Special
Secretariat for Portos (Secretaria Especial de Portos--SEP) in September 2007, and Decree
6,620/2008 that defines policies and guidelines for the development of the port sector, are
important steps setting up the stage for ports reform and infrastructure rehabilitation. Since the
creation of SEP, the sector has made advances in terms of infrastructure improvements,
operational performance and reduction of port handling costs. Several programs and studies for
the modernization of the ports are underway such as: the National Dredging Plan (Plano Nacional
de Dragagem); the General Concessions Plan (Plano Geral de Outorgas) for the concession of
new public ports; and the project of a Paperless Port, to accelerate port operations.

(3) Reduce transport costs on federal road network. After many years of inadequate road
maintenance, the federal government has been gradually strengthening its road maintenance
management capacity, establishing new criteria for the concession of federal highways, and
increasing funding for road maintenance and rehabilitation. These activities have been supported
by the Growth TAL. As a result, the percentage of output-based management contracts for the
federal road network increased from 26 percent in 2003 to 30 percent prior to approval of
GDPL2, and to 37 percent in 2007. Efforts in transport cost reduction on federal roads are being
financed by the Bank's Road Transport Project, under execution.

(4) Foster multimodal transport. Government efforts to foster multimodal transport have met
only partial success. The geographical restructuring of railway concessions, a key next step in
GDPL1, was completed and progress was made on the regulation of the railway sector. An
important objective not yet accomplished is making the Inter-Ministerial Committee for
Integration of Transport Policies (CONIT) operational. There is also a need for appropriate
transport regulation and investment in infrastructure to resolve connectivity bottlenecks.

Component B. Improve Business Environment

The Government program to improve business environment under the Growth DPL series has
focused on addressing the problems of insufficient and declining investment in infrastructure,
weaknesses in competition law enforcement, weaknesses in the framework for creditor rights and
turnaround of viable enterprises, competitive environment damaged by Government-generated
entry barriers, and slow contract enforcement by the judiciary due to procedural requirements.



                                                 9

Several important laws and regulations have been passed and institutions have been created and
strengthened, but it is too early for these measures to produce the expected outcome of easing
doing business in Brazil.

(5) Strengthen infrastructure regulation. Brazil has established 16 independent regulatory
agencies, including the land and water transport regulatory agencies (ANTT and ANTAQ)
created before approval of GDPL1. An important step to improve the efficiency and effectiveness
of these agencies has been the passage in 2005 of a Law on Career Development Plan for
Regulators. However, the regulatory system still suffers from limited institutional capacity as
demonstrated by failures in the power sector and the air and ground transportation systems. The
Public Private Partnership Law (PPP Law - Law 11,079/2004), approved by Congress in
December 2004, creates the appropriate legal environment for joint public private investments in
infrastructure. Additional legislation was passed in order to regulate other aspects of the PPPs and
establish the Management Committee for the Federal PPPs. Several State Governments have also
approved state legislation on PPPs and established PPP contracts3. The Bank is supporting the
Government's PPP unit through an IDF grant, as well as PPP initiatives at the state level.
Although the actual implementation of PPP initiatives at the federal level is taking longer than
expected, the federal government has signed a number of road concessions with the private
sector, which operate as public private partnerships, without the subsidy component incorporated
in PPP contracts.

(6) Enhance the competitiveness environment and strengthen corporate insolvency framework
(Bankruptcy and Antitrust regimes). A number of important laws affecting business
environment have been approved. The Bankruptcy and Insolvency Law (Law 11,101/2005)
and the corresponding changes in the Tax Code were approved by Congress in 2005. These two
pieces of legislation align the bankruptcy legislation in Brazil with international best practices.
Following the approval of the new law, training was provided to judges and prosecutors under an
initiative by the Justice Ministry ­ financed by the Growth TAL ­ in order to enable the justice
system to properly apply and enforce the new legislation. The Bankruptcy Law needs to be
complemented by enforcement of a simple and effective antitrust regime. Enforcement of the
1994 Antitrust Law has been affected by the complex enforcement of merger control provisions,
institutional fragmentation with three government bodies involved, and lack of a stable corps of
qualified professionals. Despite these difficulties, the Conselho Administrativo de Defesa
Econômica ­ CADE (Administrative Council for Economic Protection), one of the three bodies
involved in the enforcement of the antitrust law, has been achieving successful results that
contribute to the enhancement of the competitiveness environment. CADE is responsible for
setting guidelines, overseeing, preventing and investigating abuses of economic power. An
amendment to the Antitrust Law was sent to the Congress in 2004, but it has not been approved
yet due to controversies generated by proposed institutional changes.

(7) Simplify entry and business operations. Government generated entry barriers in Brazil
include unduly complex business registration procedures and cumbersome regulations at the
federal, state and municipal level, that make costly and time consuming to establish and operate
businesses. Some success has been achieved in simplifying the tax system with the passage in
December 2006 of a new tax system law for SMEs (National SIMPLES) that combines the six


3
  Rio de Janeiro, São Paulo, Bahia, Rio Grande do Sul, Ceará, and Santa Catarina have approved PPP
legislation. Minas Gerais has established a PPP for the expansion, rehabilitation, and maintenance of the
MG-050 road. The state is now developing additional PPPs in the road sector and in other sectors. The state
of São Paulo is also considerably advanced in the area of PPPs




                                                    10

federal taxes with state and municipal taxes levied on consumption. This law, backed by
Constitutional Amendment No. 42 on Tax Reform, is expected to lower taxes to SMEs and help
reduce informality. Also export norms have been simplified and a tax regime (RECAP) was
implemented in 2005 to reduce bureaucratic costs and administrative procedures related to the
compensation and refund of indirect taxes (PIS-COFINS) on the acquisition or importation of
capital goods by export-oriented firms. Also, some progress has been achieved in simplifying
company registration processes, but progress has been very uneven throughout Brazil. Several
state governments have initiated programs for simplifying procedures and establish single entry
points for businesses.

(8) Improve judicial contract enforcement. Brazilian courts operate with long delays in the
provision of court services to citizens and businesses. Part of the problem is that courts handle
and decide on an unusually high caseload and there is a high rate of appeals and repetitive cases.
Measures supported by the Growth DPL series to reduce these problems include the passage in
2004 of a Constitutional Amendment, the súmula vinculante that allows the Constitutional Court
(STF) to declare its constitutional interpretations binding both on all other judges and on the
administrators, in order to eliminate repetitive cases and reduce court congestion. Also, during
2005 and 2006, four laws were enacted introducing important amendments to the Code of Civil
Procedures4, to hasten court procedures. After being formally created in 2004, in mid 2005 the
Conselho Nacional de Justiça (National Justice Council) was finally implemented. One of the
functions of this Council is to develop and publish information on the judicial process which may
inform and lead to additional measures to improve court procedures. It is still early to assess the
effect of these laws on court procedures.

Component C. Enhance the Efficiency and Depth of the Financial Sector

The Government program to enhance the efficiency and depth of the financial system under the
Growth DPL series has focused on addressing the problems of lack of competition in the financial
sector, the risks in the payment system, the limited role of the capital markets in the provision of
long term finance, and of scarce and expensive credit for individuals and SMEs. Progress had
been made in establishing the legal basis for enhanced competition in the financial sector and in
expanding access to financial services to poor segments of the population. However, competition
in the financial sector remains low and the cost of borrowing remains high, limiting access to
credit to both families and SMEs.

(9) Increase financial competition. A number of measures have been taken to enhance
competition in the banking sector, including the approval by Congress of the Banking Sector
Bankruptcy Law in February 2005, and the signing of a formal agreement between the BCB and
the antitrust authority (CADE) establishing a clearer division of responsibilities in the oversight
of competition issues.

(10) Enact sound fundamental legislation and systemic risk control. A major legal impediment
to the ability of Brazil's financial sector to grow and mature was lifted with the amendment in
2003 of Article 192 of the Constitution. This amendment paved the way for a series of reforms by
allowing the individual treatment of different issues by appropriate complementary laws.
Important new legislation on bank failure resolution and to enhance systemic risk control is still
pending. On the other hand, the BCB has made significant progress in minimizing risks in the

 Laws: 11187/2005; 11232/2005; 11276/2006; and 11280/2006.




                                                 11

payments systems. Steps have been taken to strengthen and clarify the oversight role of the BCB
in the risk management of clearing houses. Also, after the successful launching of an RTGS
system for large value payments, the authorities are working on the modernization of the retail
payments system to increase the relative use of electronic payment instruments vis-à-vis paper
based instruments.

(11) Mobilize long term resources in the insurance sector. Efforts to mobilize long term
resources in the insurance sector have had good results. The insurance supervisor, SUSEP, has
made major advances in strengthening insurance regulation and supervision aimed at
strengthening asset allocation, eligibility registration and audit requirements. Complementary
Law 126, approved in January 2007, eliminated the state monopoly over reinsurance, transferred
the regulatory and oversight functions of the reinsurance market to SUSEP, and introduced a new
regulatory framework based on the existence of local and authorized foreign insurers registered
and overseen by SUSEP. The expectation is that the establishment of the reinsurance market will
reduce the cost for the final consumer, create greater underwriting capacity, and increase
competition amongst insurance companies.

(12) Improve access to financial services for the poor and SMEs. A number of actions have
been taken in this area including the launching by the Federal Government of a National Program
of Oriented Productive Microcredit (PNMPO) in November 2004, aimed at expanding access to
productive credit for formal and informal micro-entrepreneurs, and of several agricultural
insurance schemes and rural credit mechanisms. Regulation on positive credit information
reporting (Cadastro Positivo) has been issued, but the inter-linkage of credit registries has not
been established. Importantly, regulation of payroll deduction loans was introduced to facilitate
access to credit to low income groups. To expand access to housing loans, Law No.10,931/2004
was enacted, which developed and improved financial and securitization instruments for the real
state segment, and two new instruments--the Real State Credit Bill (CCI) and the Real State
Letter of Credit (LCI) were created to complete the existing framework.

Component D. Increase Innovation Capacity

The Government program to increase innovation capacity to transform knowledge into
productivity gains focused on addressing the problems of low effectiveness of public R&D and
low private investment in innovation. The legal foundations for more effective public R&D have
been established, incentives have been created for grater private investment in R&D, and Brazil
has made important advances in presenting project for the carbon trading market.

(13) Increase public R&D effectiveness. Approval in December 2004 of the National
Innovation Law (Law 10,973/2004) was an important step towards a productive application of
the scientific knowledge available in Brazil. This law promotes collaboration between public
entities and private companies, creates boundaries for the definition of intellectual property rights
distribution over inventions between researchers and research institutions, and provides for direct
public support for private research and development (R&D). In addition, the Ministry of Science
and Technology (MCT) has taken steps to rationalize the use of resources available to finance
R&D activities with public resources through the Sector Funds and to improve management of
the funds.

(14) Foster private innovation. Steps have been taken to improve the system of tax incentives to
stimulate private investment in R&D. These include deductions of up to 80 percent of the
expenses in technological research and technological innovation from the corporate income tax
base, and the provision of a subvention of up to 60 percent of the cost of hiring researchers with



                                                12

post-graduate studies if the companies are located in the regions of Sudam and Sudene.
Companies located in other areas may obtain subventions of up to 40 percent for the same costs.
In private sector R&D Brazil outperforms many middle income countries. Since 2006, BNDES
has designed new facilities aiming at the increase of innovative activities in all economic sectors.
For instance, the financing lines Innovation R&D and Innovation Production were created in
2006 and revised and renamed in 2008 as Line Innovative Capital and Technological Innovation.
More recently, BNDES has developed programs to support innovation in specific industries such
as aeronautics, digital TV and car engines.

(15) Environmental markets. Following Brazil's ratification of the Kyoto Protocol, the ICCC
was made operational and the mechanism for approval by the ICCC of project activities under the
CDM of the Kyoto Protocol was established and published.


2.2 Major Factors Affecting Implementation:

Initially, the Government was highly committed to the reform program. The Lula da Silva
administration that had taken office in early 2003 was concerned that despite deep
macroeconomic reforms, Brazil's economic growth had remained low and erratic, threatening the
administration's goals of creating employment and reducing poverty. Moreover, low growth and
high social expectations threatened to unravel achievements already attained in macroeconomic
and social reforms. Growing recognition at the highest levels of Government that the removal of
microeconomic impediments to investment, innovation and productivity were crucial to galvanize
growth, led to the adoption within the Government's development strategy of an ambitious
Growth Program of microeconomic reforms. Such program involved some political risks, since it
required coordinating actions across an array of sector ministries, and to some extent substituted
for a competing, more economically distorting growth agenda. The Government's growth
program was discussed in two official documents: "Roadmap for the New Economic
Development Agenda" launched jointly by the Ministries of Finance, Planning, Development and
the Chief of Staff, and the Multiyear Plan (PPA 2004-07) sent to Congress in September 2003.
Prior to Board approval of GDPL1, the Brazilian Government had proven its commitment with
the reforms by supporting the Amendment of Article 192 of the Constitution a needed step in
approving fundamental legislation in the financial sector and by submitting to Congress new bills
on bankruptcy and innovation.

However, fiscal constraints limited the Government's capacity to implement some reforms.
The average growth rate of Brazil during the period 2003-2006 was 3 percent, below the average
of the Latin American region. This low growth rate limited the fiscal resources required to
implement some of the infrastructure reforms supported by the Growth DPL series, particularly in
road construction and maintenance and in ports modernization.

Government priorities had changed by the time GDPL2 became effective. Government
commitment to the reform program remained strong until the approval of GDPL2 in mid-2006.
However, several factors reduced the Government's commitments to the microeconomic reform
program agreed with the Bank. First, the departure of key officials in the Ministry of Finance,
including the minister, shortly before approval of GDPL2 signaled a change in Government
priorities that led to an 18 months delay in the effectiveness of the loan. Second, by 2007, Brazil's
economic growth had started to accelerate as commodity prices increased and the authorities did
not need additional resources. This led to a loss of interest in some aspects of the microeconomic
reform agenda and to the decision not to have a third Growth DPL operation.




                                                 13

The background analysis supporting the reform program was sound. The Growth DPL series
were based on extensive analytical work done by the Bank. The report: "Brazil: the New Growth
Agenda"5 issued in 2002, contained much of the diagnostic work and policy recommendations
that were later included in the Government's Growth Program. This report was important in
giving support to those in the administration that were in favor of market oriented microeconomic
reforms as opposed to those in favor of more interventionist approaches. The Bank report helped
to organize the policy debate and to reach consensus on the reform agenda. Further analytical
work by the Bank that influenced the design of the Growth DPL series include the Investment
Climate Assessment issued in December 2005, the 2006 Doing Business in Brazil, a report on the
costs of contract enforcement, an analysis of the regulatory environment for infrastructure
investments, a trade policy report and a labor market report. Also, Bank's economic and sector
work (ESW) on the financial sector provided critical insights that helped to design the reform
program in this area, including a report on the cost of intermediation which helped to "demystify"
the issue of high spreads in Brazil by calling attention to the SELIC as the primary driver of both,
interest rates and spreads, and a report on the banking industry market segments which was
effective in helping identify the extent of competition in the sector. These studies were
complemented by analysis done for the fiscal reform series of policy-based loans and for the
human development series, and advisory work (AAA).

And the Bank provided continued support to the institutions involved in implementing the
program through the accompanying technical assistance loan. The Growth DPL series were
supported by a companion Growth TAL that provides support to the ministries and agencies
involved in the four pillars of the program. This support was important to galvanize interest and
generate momentum for the progress of sector specific reforms. Among the activities financed
under the Growth TAL are studies on the impact of judicial bottlenecks on private sector
performance, which contributed to the design of the legal reforms submitted by the Government
in this field, and support for the modernization strategy of customs carried out by the Secretariat
of Federal Revenue (Secretaria da Receita Federal do Brasil--SRB).

Assessment of Program Design

The Growth DPL series covered too many reform areas making it difficult to support deep
reforms in some of the areas and to maintain a productive policy dialogue between the Bank
and the Government. The programmatic approach was appropriate to Brazil's legislative
process which dictates a flexible approach. Constitutional amendments must pass two stages of
voting in each House of the Legislative Branch and complementary laws have to be approved by
both houses. This implies that some reforms will progress faster in some areas than others and a
programmatic approach can accommodate this uneven pace of policy reforms. Also, a
programmatic approach allows for adjustments to further strengthen the program goals and its
overall outcomes as circumstances change over time. However, as is the case with many DPL
operations, the Growth DPL series included reforms in too many sectors: logistics, business
environment, financial sector and innovation with 15 components and each of them with a
number of outputs and outcomes. Although the analytical work supporting the reform measures
was sound, such a wide coverage of reform areas reduced the depth of the reforms and made it
difficult for the Bank and the authorities to maintain a substantial policy dialogue during the
course of the series. In hindsight it would have been more effective to have a series of sector
specific loans.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

GDPL1 defined a result-oriented framework in which key next steps, progress indicators and
target outcomes were identified for each reform area.. The key next steps of GDPL1 were, for the
most part, well designed to reflect incremental stages of the reform process and provided the basis
for deciding if and when to go ahead with a second operation. Conceptually there was a good
connection between outputs and outcomes. However, the outcome indicators were too numerous
and in some cases difficult to measure. The only Implementation Status Report (ISR) archived for
GDPL1 does not present a table of outcome indicators because such a table was not required at
the time of loan preparation. This meant that the only information on compliance with GDPL1
key next steps is presented in the Simplified ICR for that operation issued on June 28, 2005.
Before preparation of GDPL2, the Bank reviewed in detail compliance with the next key steps
and selected outcome indicators of the first operation and concluded that most of them had been
met. This positive review cleared the way for preparation of the second Growth DPL. The Bank
prepared six ISRs for GDPL2. The ISRs provide information on the base line and end of project
target of 14 mostly output indicators, but no information is provided on the status of compliance
with any of these indicators or on the outcome indicators defined in the policy matrix, because the
focus of the supervision missions was to make the loan effective. In the case of GDPL2 the output
and outcome indicators were also too numerous and in some cases difficult to measure.


2.4 Expected Next Phase/Follow-up Operation (if any):

No next phase or follow-up DPL operation to the Growth DPL series is envisaged in Brazil,
although the Growth TAL continues to support key reform areas of the series. In May 2008, the
Bank approved its new Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for Brazil, which will guide the
overall program in the country for 2008-2011. The CPS recognizes that Brazil's needs have
evolved remarkably since the previous partnership strategy reflected in the 2004-2007 CAS, with
a much-improved macroeconomic situation, and reduced vulnerability, and that the focus of
lending also needs to be considerably different. Instead of large federal loans in support of the
balance of payments, most of the federal program will consist of technical assistance programs of
ambitious scope but modest financial size, focusing on areas where Brazil has not yet devised
solutions and where international experience can be of particular value. The states will be the
main recipients of most (70 percent) of the Bank financing, based on their development priorities
and in compliance with the Fiscal Responsibility Law. Within this new framework, the Bank is
expected to continue supporting reforms in the areas of innovation and logistics, mostly through
state level investment loans.


3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
(to current country and global priorities, and Bank assistance strategy)


The objectives of the Growth Program remain highly relevant to current country priorities.
Brazil's macroeconomic conditions have improved considerably over the last five years, and its
fiscal outlook, debt situation, and financial sector health are much better. Also, growth has been
strongly pro-poor. Nevertheless, Brazil still faces the challenges of how to achieve long-run
growth sustainability, reduce its high levels of taxation, reduce remaining barriers to a more
efficient financial intermediation, improve its business environment reducing the time and cost
involved in setting up a business; and increase public investment in infrastructure. The Bank and
the Brazilian authorities have agreed that future Bank support should move away from policy



                                                 15

based lending and place greater emphasis on supporting the country's current priorities through
technical assistance and lending at the state level. Nevertheless, it is important that the federal
Government focuses also on completing the microeconomic reforms supported by the Growth
DPL series.


3.2 Achievement of Program Development Objectives
(including brief discussion of causal linkages between policy actions supported by operations and
outcomes)

a. Achievement of the Program's Broader Development Objective

In achieving the objective of accelerating economic growth by making Brazil more competitive,
the performance of the Growth DPL series has been moderately satisfactory. Although
important progress has been made in all the reform areas supported by the Growth DPL series,
more reforms are needed to make Brazil more competitive by lowering logistic costs, facilitating
doing business, making credit more accessible and less costly, and promoting innovation and
technical development. The recently published Global Competitiveness Report (GCR) for 2008-
2009 ranks Brazil 64 out of 134 countries, a minor improvement from a rank of 66 in the previous
year. The ranking of Brazil is below that of other Latin American countries such as Chile (28),
Panamá (58), Costa Rica (59) and Mexico (60). On the other hand, Brazil's economic growth
averaged only 3 percent during the period 2003-2006, below the average of 4.5 percent for the
region and of 8-9 percent for emerging market economies during the same period. The growth
rate jumped to 5.4 percent in 2007, and continued strong during the first half of 2008. This
improved growth performance is more the result of high commodity prices than improved
Brazilian competition. Nevertheless, growth slowed down in the last quarter of 2008 due to the
worsening of the effects of the international financial crisis in the domestic economy. The
expectation before the recent financial crisis was that the growth rate for 2008 would reach 6.2
percent. It is unlikely that Brazil will be able to sustain a high economic growth in the absence of
more reforms to improve Brazil's competitiveness, particularly if the external conditions remain
unfavorable with lower demand for commodities and higher financing costs.

b. Achievement of the Program's Sub Objectives

(A) Reduce Logistic Costs: Moderately Satisfactory.

        Improve customs effectiveness: Progress has been made in achieving the expected
        outcome of reducing customs gross release times. The expected outcome of reducing
        custom clearance time has been met. The average time needed for customs clearance has
        been reduced from 5 to 3 days, and the average clearance time for exports has decreased
        from 2 days to 13.5 hours. According to Doing Business 2009, the time needed to
        complete an export decreased from 18 days in 2007 to 14 days in 2008 and the number of
        days to complete an import decreased from 24 to 19 days during the same period. Despite
        these improvements, the Global Competitiveness Report (GCR) 2008-2009 ranks Brazil
        127 out of 134 countries in burden of customs procedures.

        Reducing port costs and delays. According to Doing Business 2009, the average port and
        terminal handling time has been reduced from 13.8 days for imports and 8.4 days for
        exports to 4 and 3 days respectively. Although port delays have been reduced, lack of
        modern cross-border links and port conditions continue to constrain Brazil's integration
        into international trade. The GCR ranks Brazil 123 out of 134 countries in quality of port
        infrastructure.


                                                  16

        Reduce transport costs on federal road networks. The expected outcomes of improving
        road conditions and reducing transport costs have been met. The percentage of output-
        based maintenance contracts for the federal road network has increased from 26 percent
        in 2003 to 37 percent in 2007, above the 30 percent target established in GDPL1. With
        better maintenance, 49.5 percent of the federal road network (a total of 52,524 km) is
        considered to be in good conditions according to the International Roughness Index (IRI),
        and the average road transport cost decreased in roughly 11 percent between 2003 and
        2007. Despite these achievements, the GCR ranks Brazil 110 in quality of roads and 101
        in quality of transport infrastructure out of 134 countries.

        Foster multimodal transport. The expected outcome of a 10 percent increase in non-road
        transportation has not been achieved, although productivity of railroad operations has
        increased as a result of improvements in railroad regulation. Brazil's transport continues
        to be based on road networks. There is a need for appropriate transport regulation and
        investment in infrastructure to resolve connectivity bottlenecks.

(B) Improve Business Environment: Moderately Unsatisfactory.

        Strengthen infrastructure regulation. Although infrastructure regulation has been
        strengthened and the legal and institutional framework for PPP is in place, public
        investment in infrastructure has remained under 1 percent of GDP crowded out by other
        budget expenditures and a rigid budget framework. Private investment is holding back
        due to the risks posed by regulatory uncertainty and contract renegotiations. Although
        some states are beginning to implement PPP projects, the actual implementation of PPP
        initiatives at the Federal level is taking longer than expected.

        Enhance the competitiveness environment and strengthen corporate insolvency
        framework. Although the Antitrust Law has not been approved, some improvement have
        been made in enhancing the competitiveness environment. Pre-merger notification to
        CADE are mandatory, and over the last five years CADE has investigated and decided on
        several mergers and acquisitions, having rejected requests from important companies.
        The number of days taken by CADE to decide on mergers and acquisitions has decreased
        from 84 days in the early 2000s to 48 days in 2008.

        Simplify entry and business operations. Progress in simplifying company registration
        processes has been very uneven throughout Brazil. For example, Minas Gerais has
        established one-stop shops that have reduced the number of days to register a business to
        10 days. São Paulo has also taken some measures to simplify business registration and
        aims to reduce from 152 to 30 the days needed to register a business. Nevertheless, the
        GCR 2008-2009 ranks Brazil 127 in time required to start a business and 125 in number
        of procedures to start a business out of 134 countries. The Doing Business 2009 report
        ranks Brazil 125 out of 181 economies in ease of doing business.6 There is still more to
        do to facilitate starting and operating a business in Brazil.

        Improve judicial contract enforcement. Despite amendments to the Code of Civil
        Procedures and other legal and institutional reforms introduced under the Growth DPL

6
 This ranking is somewhat biased by the fact that it is based on data from Sao Paulo, where the time
needed to start a business is much higher, 152 days, than in other States, which take 68 days or less.




                                                     17

      series, contract enforcement remains slow and uncertain. Also, it is unclear if the number
      of appeals has decreased. A proxy indicator for the reduction in appeals rate is the
      reduction in the number of procedural and extraordinary recourses seen by the Supreme
      Federal Court. These decreased only slightly between 2003 and 2008. According to
      Doing Business 2009, the time involved in enforcing contracts in Brazil has remained
      unchanged in the last three years (616 days), and Brazil ranks 100 overall for enforcing
      contracts out of 181 economies.

(C) Enhance the Efficiency and Depth of the Financial Sector: Moderately Satisfactory.

      Increase financial competition. The antitrust scrutiny over financial sector mergers and
      acquisitions has increased. CADE has reviewed 7 cases of bank mergers and acquisitions.
      Nevertheless, competition in the financial sector remains low. Although the top four
      banks have maintained their share in deposit from 56 percent in 2001 to 57.6 percent in
      2008, competition in the financial market has increased as evidenced by the declining
      trend in total bank spreads from 41.3 percent in December 2003 to 28.4 percent as of
      December 2007, and the decrease in the share of administrative expenses in the total
      spread from 19.5 percent in 2003 to 16.9 percent in 20067. The reduction in spreads is
      also the result of reform measures to reduce credit risk, such as payroll deduction loans
      and improvements in credit information. Also, the banks are facing increased competition
      in the provision of funds from Brazil's capital market.

      Enact sound fundamental legislation and systemic risk control. Fundamental financial
      legislation on systemic risk control and bank failure resolution is still pending. But,
      Brazil has made advances in modernizing the legal framework and physical infrastructure
      for the payments system. This has led to the increase in the relative use of electronic
      payment instruments vis-à-vis paper based instruments. Payments with credit and debit
      cards increased 20 percent between 2006 and 2007; and 25 percent between the first
      quarter of 2007 and the first quarter of 2008. There have been advances in rationalizing
      the interconnection of automatic teller machines (ATMs) and point of sale networks.
      Also banks use nationwide telecommunications network over satellite to help deliver
      services throughout the country.

      Mobilize long term resources in the insurance sector. The objective of increasing
      competition in the reinsurance sector has been largely met. Following the elimination of
      the state monopoly over reinsurance, 35 reinsurance companies have registered with
      SUSEP, of these, three local reinsurers have been authorized and 11 foreign ones have
      been approved to operate in Brazil. Evidence of improved capacity of the insurance
      sector to mobilize resources is that the insurance market has increased from R$51.1
      million in 2003 to R$84.3 million in 2007.

      Improve access to financial services for the poor and SMEs. This objective has been
      partly met. Following legal reform is this area, the volume of payroll deduction loans has
      increased from around R$6 billion to about R$40.3 billion between January 2004 and
      August 2008. The volume of overall bank credit has increased from 28 percent of GDP in
      December 2005 to 35 percent in December 2007 and to 38 percent in August 2008. A
      large share of the increase has been in the retail market. Importantly, earmarked credit for
      housing, agriculture and BNDES has declined in relative terms from around half of total

         credit in 2000 to around a third in 2006. Bank accounts also expanded from 95 million to
         140 million, and housing finance credit operation tripled in volume. Important to improve
         access to finance has been the reduction in the SELIC base rate from a peak of nearly 20
         percent in 2005 to 10.33 percent in December 2007, although it increased to 12.75
         percent in August 2008. Cost of borrowing remains high, limiting access to credit to both
         families and SMEs. According to the GCR 2008-2009 Brazil ranks 77 out of 134
         countries in ease of access to loans.

(D) Increase Innovation Capacity: Moderately Satisfactory.

         Increase public R&D effectiveness. Despite the passage of a comprehensive Innovation
         Law, Brazil's overall R&D expenditures remain hovering around 1 percent of GDP, and
         new patents and scientific papers from Brazilian inventors and academics have not
         increased substantially. However, these are outcomes that take time to materialize even if
         the environment for public and private R&D has improved. According to the GRC 2008-
         2009, Brazil ranks 43 in the quality of scientific research institutions out of 134 countries.

         Foster private innovation. Steps have been taken to improve the system of tax incentives
         to stimulate private investment in R&D. In private sector R&D Brazil outperforms many
         middle income countries. According to the GCR 2008-2009 out of 134 countries, Brazil
         ranks 27 in capacity for innovation and 31 in company spending on R&D.

         Environmental markets. Brazil has been among the most proactive countries in the
         carbon trading market under the Kyoto Protocol. In 2005 78 CDM projects were
         approved by the ICCC, more than any other in the world. According to MCT, a total
         amount of 130.2 million tons CO2 eq. is expected to be reduced during the first
         commitment period with an estimated benefit for the Brazilian economy of about US$780
         million.


3.3 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
(combining relevance, achievement of PDOs)
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

The overall outcome rating is moderately satisfactory based on the following reasons. First, at
the end of GDPL2 a substantial number of the expected outputs had been achieved in most of the
microeconomic reform areas. However, many of the expected outcomes that would make Brazil
more competitive had not materialized, in some cases because it is too early to see the results of
the reform measures, and in others because the reforms have not been deep enough to produce the
desired results. Second, after several years of average growth rate of 3 percent, Brazil's economic
growth jumped to 5.4 percent in 2007 and continued strong during the first half of 2008.
However, faster growth was achieved more due to high international commodity prices than to
improved competitiveness resulting from the microeconomic reforms implemented under the
Growth DPL series. Nevertheless, what has been accomplished so far in microeconomic legal and
institutional reforms is a good basis for the Brazilian Government to continue deepening the
reforms that would enable Brazil to face the current deterioration in external conditions with
lower demand for commodities and higher financing costs. The Growth DPL series provided
significant synergies with IFC activities in support of the private sector, such as IFC's
involvement in drilling down the doing business indicators to specific municipalities, its support
for PPP and BNDES, as well as with large banks and corporations to increase SME access to




                                                 19

finance and in housing finance. The Bank work was also strongly complementary to Brazil's
program with the IMF of strengthening economic stability.


3.4 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(if any, where not previously covered or to amplify discussion above)
(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

The Government Growth Program has had important pro-poor effects, particularly by
increasing access to financial services to the poorer social segments and by simplifying entry
and business operations. Specific measures to increase the access of the poor to financial
services under the program included: (i) the simplification of the procedures to open bank
accounts in public banks with the opening of more than 4.6 million bank accounts between
August 2003 and December 2004, which are exempted of bank tariffs and taxes on financial
operations; (ii) the offering of loans through payroll deductions, which increased from R$6 billion
in 2004 to R$40.3 billion in 2008, subjected to interest rates of 40.3 percent per year against 70.7
percent per year for other personal credit lines; (iii) the launching of the PNMPO, aimed at
expanding access to productive credit for formal and informal micro-entrepreneurs with annual
revenues up to RS$ 60,000. Other reforms aimed at simplifying entry and business operations are
likely to benefit SMEs and hence contribute to increase employment and reduce poverty.
Similarly, the reduction in road transport costs may have pro-poor effect by improving access of
the rural poor to health and education services in urban areas.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
(particularly with reference to impacts on longer-term capacity and institutional development)

The Growth DPL series and the Growth TAL have had a significant impact on the institutional
strengthening of the ministries and agencies involved in the reform program. Institutional
strengthening actions include the creation or revitalization of several inter-ministerial committees
such as the Economic Policy and Infrastructure Committees; the National Science and
Technology Council (CCT) the Capital Markets Working Group. Measures that involved
institutional strengthening include the modernization of clearing systems and management
information systems in the Customs Administration; the reorganization of the Federal Transport
Administration; the set up of the PPP unit in the Ministry of Planning; the geographical
restructuring of railway concessions; the strengthening of BCB's capacity to minimize risks in the
payments system and to exercise oversight over competition issues in the financial sector; steps
taken by the MCT to rationalize the use of resources available to finance R&D activity through
the sector funds and to improve management of the funds; and measures taken to make the ICCC
operational with a transparent project approval mechanism and to establish the NJC. The Growth
TAL has been particularly effective in supporting the modernization strategy of customs carried
out by SRB including the implementation of an electronic system of risk analysis and artificial
intelligence system for customs.

                                                 20

Rating: Moderate

The risk that the reform actions taken under the Growth Program will not be maintained is
moderate. The legal and regulatory reforms were approved by Congress after intensive public
consultation. From this point of view, the reforms have strong legitimacy and political support
and are not likely to be reversed. However, there are internal and external risks that could delay
the accomplishment of some of the development outcomes that are expected in the medium to
long term. One internal risk is that Government has increasingly shifted its focus away from
microeconomic reforms to addressing other key government bottlenecks to growth, especially
issues related to infrastructure and fiscal and public resource management. Another risk is that
lack of political consensus may delay the passing of key legislation in sensitive areas of the
Growth Program such as tax and antitrust reform. Finally there is the risk that the public
resources needed to increase investment in infrastructure, ports and roads improvement, and on
R&D will be delayed for lack of fiscal space. An external risk that has become a major threat
recently is the reduction of external financing and the effects of volatility from the international
financial crisis on interest rates and inflation, and eventually on the liquidity and solvency of the
local banks. Although the Government has acted promptly to provide liquidity for those banks
that needed it, the passing of complementary legislation to strengthen systemic risk control and
bank failure resolution is of outmost importance. These domestic and external risks are mitigated
by sound macroeconomic policies that provide a solid anchor to the economy.


5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
(relating to design, implementation and outcome issues)


5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
(i.e., performance through lending phase)
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory for GDPL1
          Moderately Satisfactory for GDPL2

The program of reforms agreed with the Government was based on extensive analytical work
done by the Bank during the identification and preparation of GDPL1 (see section 2.2). The Bank
was also instrumental in supporting consensus-building among different sectors of the
government, actively helping in the assessment of short-term impact of reforms as well as
potential winners and losers. However, despite excellent analytical work the Bank team made the
wrong decision of combining under one operation a large number of reform areas when a better
approach would have been to prepare several more sector specific operations. Preparation of
GDPL2 demanded less analytical effort on the part of the Bank because the major themes had
been already studied for the first operation, although changes were made in key measures for the
second operation to reflect changing circumstances. But, the Bank continued with the same
approach of covering a wide range of reform areas and went ahead with the second operation
despite signals that the Government was changing its focus towards new priorities as economic
growth accelerated reducing the need for additional resources. Bank misreading of the changing
circumstances led to a long delay in the effectiveness of GDPL2.

(b) Quality of Supervision
(including M&E arrangements)
Rating: Satisfactory for GDPL1
          Satisfactory for GDPL2




                                                   21

The structure of the program puts emphasis on project preparation rather than on supervision. The
formal supervision of GDPL1 was undertaken during preparation of the Simplified ICR and the
preparation of the second operation. GDPL2 required some supervision efforts during the long
delay in loan effectiveness to assess the willingness of the Authorities to sign the loan.
Nevertheless, the Bank team was in regular interaction with the Brazilian authorities in the
context of the Growth TAL, the discussion of economic and sector work that supported several
aspects of the program, and the preparation of the Country Partnership Strategy for Brazil which
presents a review of the accomplishments of the 2004-2008 CAS.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Satisfactory for GDPL1
         Moderately Satisfactory for GDPL2

Despite flaws in the design of the Growth DPL series, Bank overall performance is rated
Satisfactory for GDPL1 for the following reasons. First, during preparation of the first operations
and in the context of the Growth TAL the Bank provided quality policy advice based on extensive
economic and sector work. The Bank put together a high quality multi-disciplinary team to
provide advice and experience and to liaise with the local preparatory and implementation teams
involved in the design of the Growth Program. Second, the Bank provided timely support to an
important transition in Brazil, when the development strategy of the new da Silva administration
was being designed. Bank support for a program of microeconomic reforms helped to strengthen
the resolve of groups in the Government that advocated for marked oriented reform as opposed to
groups that were inclined to adopt more interventionist industrial policies to confront the decline
in economic activity and increase in unemployment. Bank management showed foresight in
supporting Brazil during the complex political transition, when uncertainty prevailed among
international investors. The Bank's financial assistance helped Brazil meet its external obligations
at the same time that allowed the new administration to build a reputation of good
macroeconomic management. The Bank rating for the GDPL2 is rated moderately satisfactory
because the Bank failed the react to the signals that the Government was changing its priorities
away from microeconomic reforms.


5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Satisfactory for GDPL1
         Moderately Satisfactory for GDPL2

Throughout preparation of the of the Growth DPL series, the Ministry of Finance had a leadership
role in the design of the microeconomic reform agenda incorporated into the Growth Program,
and was instrumental in working with the Bank Team in shaping into a cohesive operation the
various goals and strategies of each institution that participated in the Program. During
implementation this ministry successfully coordinated the many participating ministries and
agencies and ensured that the Program objectives remained on track. However, changes in key
staff in the Ministry of Finance and in the Government priorities led to an 18 months delay in
making the second Growth DPL effective and to the eventual disbursement of only one fourth of
the original loan amount.


(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Satisfactory for GDPL1
         Satisfactory for GDPL2




                                                22

Several ministries and government agencies were involved in all steps of program design and
implementation, dedicating highly qualified and committed staff to the program. The most
relevant include the Ministries of Finance, Justice, Transport and Science and Technology.
Within the Ministry of Finance, the SRB has played a very important role in customs reform.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Satisfactory for GDPL1
         Moderately Satisfactory for GDPL2

The rating of Satisfactory for GDPL1 is justified for the following reasons: First the Government
of Brazil developed a clear vision and strategy of its microeconomic reform agenda that was
incorporated into an ambitious Growth Program, a center piece of its broad Growth Agenda for
the period 2004-07. By subjecting this strategy to intensive consultation with civil society, the
Government ensured the program was politically feasible, despite other competing views that
supported a more interventionist approach. Second, several ministries and government agencies,
under the leadership of the Ministry of Finance, designed the specific reforms within their
respective areas and managed and monitored their implementation, adapting the reforms to reflect
changing country circumstances. Third, the technical staff of these government agencies worked
with the Bank Team to shape into a cohesive operation the various goals and strategies of each
institution and to identify key next steps, progress indicators and target outcomes for each reform
area. The rating of Moderately Satisfactory for GDPL2 is based on the fact that the Government
went ahead with the second operation although its priorities were changing away from
microeconomic reforms.


6. Lessons Learned
(both operation-specific and of wide general application)


The lessons learned from the two Growth DPLs are the following:

    (i)      Deep legal and institutional reforms may require sector specific operations rather
             than DPLs with large number of reform areas. This DPL series, as is the case with
             many other DPLs, covered too many reform areas: four sectors (logistics, business
             environment, financial sector and innovation) with 15 components and each of them
             with a number of outputs and outcomes. Such a wide coverage of reform areas
             reduces the depth of the reforms and makes it difficult for the Bank and the
             authorities to maintain a substantial policy dialogue during the course of the series.

    (ii)     The quality of the technical analysis underpinning a policy based operation is crucial
             to engage the borrower's commitment to the reform agenda. Extensive analytical
             work done by the Bank provided the diagnosis and policy recommendations that
             were incorporated into the Government's Growth Program. The high quality of the
             technical analysis was crucial to engage the authorities' commitment to a market
             oriented approach to stimulate economic growth at a time in which more
             interventionist industrial policies were being considered.

    (iii)    Sustained Government ownership of the reform agenda is crucial to the success of a
             policy based operation. The da Silva administration was at first highly committed to
             both macroeconomic and microeconomic reforms to accelerate economic growth and
             reduce poverty and inequality. It did not hesitate to take unpopular macroeconomic
             measures when it was needed and to send to Congress proposals for constitutional



                                                  23

            reforms and for complementary laws in areas that were highly controversial such as
            tax reform. At the time of effectiveness of GDPL2 the Government had shifted its
            focus and the momentum moved on to macroeconomic reforms and investment
            incentives. This led to long delays in loan effectiveness and to the dropping of a third
            operation.

    (iv)    Selection of outcome indicators for a series of programmatic loans should include
            medium-term results as well as long term results, to allow for an assessment of the
            results if fewer loans materialize than initially envisaged. A number of outcome
            indicators for the two Growth DPLs were designed with the expectation that there
            was going to be three consecutive operations, and that the expected outcomes would
            be met at the end of the third one. Since only two DPLs were eventually approved, at
            the time of this ICR it is too early to assess the results of some of the implemented
            reforms. It would have been useful if some intermediate outcome indicators would
            have been established against which to evaluate the success of the policy reforms in
            the absence of a third operation.

    (v)     Programmatic loans should be subject to a more structured schedule of supervisions
            missions to assess the progress in implementing next key steps and in meeting
            outcome indicators. GDPL1 was supervised once in the context of preparation of the
            Simplified ICR. GDPL2 was supervised in FY07 and FY08, in the context of trying
            to make the loan effective. However, during this time limited information was
            obtained to assess progress towards accomplishing the key next steps or the expected
            outcome indicators. This makes it difficult for the Bank to assess progress in
            accomplishing the program goals and be able to influence the outcomes through
            country dialogue, before producing the final ICR.



7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners
(a) Borrower/Implementing agencies


1. We refer to the document "Report Nº: ICR0000972 ­ Implementation Completion
Results Report (IBRD ­ 72180 - 73860) on a loan in the amount of EUR427.20 million
(US$505.05 million equivalent) and a loan in the amount of US$601.510 million to the
Federative Republic of Brazil for a series of Programmatic Loans for Sustainable and
Equitable Growth ­ Loans I and II".

2. We inform that this report was reviewed by various organizations of the federal public
administration interested in the achievement of the objectives stated in the Policy Letter
related to the above mentioned Operations. With regards to this report, the organizations
identified some incorrect statements, as well as some judgment values that are politically
sensitive in the form presented.

3. The Brazilian Government disagrees with the opinion expressed in the document with
regards to the loss of interest with microeconomic reforms. To mention some examples, it
was approved: the Gas Law, the National Plan and Program for Dredging (Law
11.610/2007), the Policies and Guidelines for the Port Sector (Decree 6.620/2008). In
addition, the Government is making significant efforts in the National Congress in order
to approve the tributary reform, a polemic issue that affects various interests; the Project


                                                24

Law for the Regulatory Agencies and for the Brazilian Competency System; and new
directives for the civil aviation and aquatic sectors. This Government disagrees with the
methodology used in the Doing Business 2009, World Bank, and doesn't recognize this
publication as a benchmark for determining performance. For this reason, we request that
this observation should be included in the document.
