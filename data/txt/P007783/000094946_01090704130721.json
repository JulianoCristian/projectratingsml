impacts are only modest. Lessons drawn from the project,\n            above all reinforce the notion that collaborative efforts\n            with communities, are conducive to faster implementation,\n            and quality results. In addition, the close collaboration\n            between the Bank, and Borrower facilitated the procurement\n            implementation schedule for a timely delivery of textbooks,\n            and educational materials. Nonetheless, standard procurement\n            practices for emergency operations - such is the case of the\n            Supplemental Credit following Hurricane Mitch - could be\n            redefined, to streamline emergency procurement, and avoid\n            unnecessary delays. However, the staff continuity within the\n            Project Implementation Unit proved valuable, and should be\n            emphasized that even through several political changes, and\n            two elected new governments, this continuity assured the\n            Government's ability to achieve project objectives."}, "docdt": "2001-08-10T00:00:00Z"}
