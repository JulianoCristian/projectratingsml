                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The overarching goal of the project is to contribute reducing rural poverty and build social cohesion by improving and maintaining access in rural areas to markets,
                         schools, health centers and other social and economic infrastructure through broadened community participation. By emphasizing beneficiary involvement, the project
                         will assure that local development decisions reflect the needs and priorities of rural communities.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?

                         The project is making progress towards the achievement of its development objectives but has a few significant issues that have yet to be resolved. Fewer kilometers of secondary
                         and tertiary roads will be rehabilitated than planned due to changes in project design, increases in costs and delays in project implementation. There has been substantial
                         participation of beneficiary communities at all stages of the project. Rural access has been improved through the secondary and rural road improvements done to date, including
                         pedestrian bridges, periodic maintenance works, and regravelling and paving of road sections in the San Marcos and Huehuetenango project areas. The project has also been

                         successful in building planning and implementation capacity at local government level. A project restructuring and two reallocations of loan proceeds were carried out in 2010 to help
                         improve project implementation and to increase the disbursement of loan proceeds - US$44.8 million has been disbursed out of $46.7 million to date, 96% of total. Resettlement took
                         place in conjunction with some of the secondary road improvement, with a plan prepared and approved to resolve outstanding cases. The Bank has agreed to provide loan funds to
                         help finance these costs. Further project restructuring was carried out in 2011 in support of these measures. The Government has submitted an action plan to address this and all
                         other pending project issues as agreed to during the last Bank supervision mission.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         A project restructuring to accommodate the triggering of the involuntary resettlement safeguard was approved by the Board. The government previously issued a Corrective Action
                         Plan dated April 26, 2011 which identifies all measures taken or to be taken to bring the project into compliance on social safeguards. The Bank has agreed to the use of loan funds
                         to help finance the costs of some of the outstanding resettlement cases. The Government requested an extension of the closing date to September 30, 2012. This was approved
                         under a project restructuring. Todate, the procurement processes for the reconstruction of the houses have not had a positive outcome. A Government action plan for redress under
                         the action plan and completion for all outstanding issues (including completion of road sections in San Marcos and Huehuetenango) has been received at the end of May 2012. The
                         completion of road sections would be with 100 percent national financing since Bank proceeds have been used up, and the execution will certainly go beyond the project closing date
                         of September 30, 2012. The houses reconstruction is a matter of high priority, and efforts are being made to have this activity completed by the project closing date.
