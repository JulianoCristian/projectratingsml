moderately satisfactory, and\n            Borrower performance was moderately unsatisfactory. Some\n            lessons learned included: closer attention should be paid to\n            potential resettlement issues, taking into account cultural\n            practices and land tenure issues. Project development\n            objectives (PDOs) and PDO indicators should be aligned with\n            what a project can realistically achieve, and the results\n            framework should be updated following a restructuring.\n            Adoption of the civil works procurement strategy for a\n            design and build approach should be accompanied by a\n            comprehensive capacity assessment and supported by vigorous\n            strengthening of the implementing agency. Ensuring adequate\n            financing for maintenance remains a challenge, and future\n            Bank engagement in the sector should also pay special\n            attention to this issue. Local funding for civil works in\n            roads segments may be unrealistic under the country context.\n            It is advisable in the future to either use central\n            government funds to finance the operation or use\n            municipalities\u0092 contribution as the advance payment to\n            ensure timely completion of works."}, "docdt": "2014-05-12T00:00:00Z"}
