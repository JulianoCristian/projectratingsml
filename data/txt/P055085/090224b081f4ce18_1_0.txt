                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The overarching goal of the project is to contribute reducing rural poverty and build social cohesion by improving and maintaining access in rural areas to markets,
                         schools, health centers and other social and economic infrastructure through broadened community participation. By emphasizing beneficiary involvement, the project
                         will assure that local development decisions reflect the needs and priorities of rural communities.

                         The project has made progress towards the achievement of its development objectives and is in the final stages of implementation. This is the last ISR before the upcoming project
                         closing date of September 30th, 2013. The project has had substantial participation of beneficiary communities at all stages of the project. Rural access has been improved through
                         the secondary and rural road improvements done to date under the DGC and INFOM implementing agencies, including some secondary roads upgrades, pedestrian bridges,
                         periodic maintenance works, and regravelling and paving of road sections in the San Marcos and Huehuetenango project areas. The project has also been successful in building

                         planning and implementation capacity at the local government level (with support for the municipal associations, technical road units, and maintenance committees). The Project has
                         been previously extended to enable the satisfactory resolution of a pending resettlement issue in the project. This includes the compensation of affected persons with houses
                         reconstruction, reconstruction of other affected structures including possibilities for alternative compensation in line with Bank policies and guidelines and as per the Corrective Action
                         Plan (CAP) dated 18th September 2012. As of the time of reporting, the activities are advanced in the most affected area of Santa Barbara, and indications are that these will be
                         completed there before the closing date. The completion of the secondary road construction both in Huehuetenango and San Marcos also remain high priorities though these can
                         only be completed fully with national financing since project loan proceeds were exhausted due to changes in the design and cost of these works. The Government remains
                         committed to complying with its obligations to ensure a more satisfactory achievement of the project objectives, and to ensure that the full benefits of the project interventions are
                         realized by the project beneficiaries in the two departments of Huehuetenango and San Marcos. Bank supervision and follow-up of the project will continue after the closing date to
                         ensure the achievement of project outcomes that fall under government financing and responsibility.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         A project restructuring to accommodate the triggering of the involuntary resettlement safeguard was approved in October 2011. The government had previously issued a Corrective

                         September 2012. The houses reconstruction is a matter of high priority, and works are underway and it is expected that this activity will be completed in the most affected area of
                         Santa Barbara in advance of the project closing date. The completion of road sections would be with 100 percent national financing since Bank proceeds have been used up, and the
                         execution will certainly go beyond the revised project closing date of September 30, 2013. Bank no objection to enable Government reinitiate the San Marcos works is deemed
                         critical.
