      Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
      The overarching goal of the Second Rural and Main Roads Project (SRMRP) is to reduce
      rural poverty and build social cohesion by improving and maintaining access in rural
      areas to markets, schools, health centers and other social and economic infrastructure
      through broadened community participation. By emphasizing beneficiary involvement,
      the SRMRP will assure that local development decisions reflect the needs and priorities
      of rural communities.
      The specific project development objectives of the SRMRP are:
      (a)     improve rural access on a sustainable basis by improving paths, rural roads,
      secondary/departmental roads, and main roads; (b) develop institutional capacity at the
      local and central level, for rural roads management and strengthening stakeholder
      participation; and (c) generate employment in rural areas by developing an
      entrepreneurial culture using cost-effective technologies, providing a demonstration
      effect through pilot programs, and promoting spillover activities.

                     benefit 900,000 beneficiaries; the data collected at the completion of the project
                     corresponds to the total beneficiary population of each municipality that integrates the three

                        maintenance without pay, the pilot program was dropped. Instead, the Project
                        supported the creation of the COMAVIs, which were established to perform
                        the rural roads maintenance function. These committees were equipped and

                        consequent entrepreneurial culture is a major shortcoming although the
                        culture of maintenance aspect was achieved. Jobs were also created in the
                        works undertaken (which contributed to the entrepreneurial and spillover

1. Project Context, Development and Objectives Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

1.      Country and Sector Background. At the time of Project appraisal in 2003, Guatemala
was still suffering from the after-effects of a 35 year long civil strife that kept the economy from
reaching its full potential with a GDP per capita of US$1,817 and relatively low growth rates
(2.5 percent). According to the 2000 National Quality of Life Survey (ENCOVI), more than half
the population was categorized as poor and nearly 2 million people (18 percent) lived in extreme
poverty. This dire situation was more prominent in the rural areas, with poverty levels twice as
high compared to those in the urban areas. The civil war had also created an untenable situation
with the marginalization of the poor and indigenous populations that live in remote isolated areas.
These populations remained disconnected from the main country fabric due to deficient
infrastructure and a lack of basic services. Following the signing of the Peace Accords of 1996,
the Government had committed to increasing social cohesion and reducing poverty. Physical
connectivity was identified as a critical element to achieving these goals.

2.      An unreliable and unsatisfactory road network, especially in rural areas, was a
large determinant factor in the poverty profile of the country. The absence of all-weather
roads limited access to basic services and the lack of an adequate distribution network for crops
and essential products led to worsening welfare conditions. This created particularly grave
circumstances for the rural poor who derived their income predominantly from agricultural labor
and who lived in small (less than 10,000 people) municipalities with limited infrastructure
service provision. Thus, a key step for poverty reduction called for integrating these smaller,
rural municipalities with large percentages of poor populations, with services, access to markets
and connectivity with the rest of the economy.

3.      Guatemala´s road network was estimated to be approximately 26,000 km of roads,
of which only 14,000 km was classified. Of the classified network, 10,000 km were unpaved,
and only 45 percent were in maintainable condition. Jurisdictional competence for the main and
secondary road network was under the General Roads Directorate (DGC) within the Ministry of
Communications, Infrastructure and Housing, while the municipalities were in charge of the
tertiary road network. Other actors such as the Municipal Development Institute (INFOM) and
the National Fund for Peace (FONAPAZ at the time) have also been involved in the delivery of
tertiary roads and bridges. According to ENCOVI 2000, 13 percent of the households primarily
used dirt roads or paths and trails to reach places outside their community. Only 40 percent of the
rural ENCOVI households had access to public transport (versus 65 percent of the urban
ENCOVI households).

4.     All of these facts underscored the need for rural road work interventions in
Guatemala, including: (i) the rehabilitation and subsequent regular maintenance of rural roads;
and (ii) the improvement of tracks, paths and footbridges used by residents of remote
communities. The absence of a dependable road network implied that most households in San
Marcos and Huehuetenango were hours away from a marketplace to buy and sell their products,
and very poorly connected to the rest of the country. This situation was worse during the rainy

                                                 1
seasons when many roads became impassable and whole communities remained cut off from the
rest of the country.

5.      Rationale for Bank assistance. The Bank has supported the development of
Guatemala’s road sector for over sixteen years and has maintained an important policy dialogue
on the development and maintenance of the sector. At the time of appraisal, the Bank had an
active Project: the Rural and Main Roads Project (RMRP I; Loan 4260-GU approved in 1997).
This first Project focused in San Marcos, a rebel stronghold during the civil war and one of the
most isolated parts of the country. Besides the isolation and years of underinvestment in basic
infrastructure, there was the general mistrust that 35 years of conflict had generated between the
central government and the local communities. RMRP was intended to be a first step towards a
sustainable rural development agenda and bringing together central and local authorities in a
combined effort to improve the livelihoods of the rural population. The Implementation
Completion and Results Report of the RMRP rated the overall outcome as satisfactory, driven
mainly by the successful completion of the rehabilitation of rural roads and the incorporation of
the UTAV and ADIMAM. The current Project of focus (Second Rural and Main Roads Project
or RMRP II as it was referred to in short) was proposed to anchor the efforts already started
under the first Project, and further the Bank assistance and support in achieving the stated
challenges following a similar framework in other areas of the country.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

6.      The objectives of the Project were to assist the Borrower in: (a) improving rural
access on a sustainable basis by improving paths, rural roads, secondary/departmental roads, and
main roads; (b) developing institutional capacity at the local and central level, for rural roads
management and strengthening stakeholder participation; and (c) generating employment in rural
areas by developing an entrepreneurial culture using cost-effective technologies, providing a
demonstration effect through pilot programs, and promoting spillover activities. To measure the
Project’s achievement of its development objectives, the following key indicators were presented
in the main text of the PAD: (i) improved rural road network in Mamsohue and Huista; (ii)
strengthened institutional capacity to manage rural transport infrastructure on sustainable basis;
and (iii) employment generated in rural areas.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification
7.      The original PDO remained unchanged during the Project’s implementation.
However alterations were made in Project restructurings to some indicators (and their targets)
due to changing circumstances as explained in the restructuring details, and in the results
framework (see Data Sheet Section F). The PAD results framework also introduced two sub-
indicators relating to: (i) satisfactory implementation at national level of relevant components of
the Social Management Plan; and (ii) Satisfactory implementation at local level of relevant
components of the Social Management Plan.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries
8.     The indigenous population of western Guatemala was the primary beneficiary of the
Project (see Maps IBRD 40903 and IBRD 40904). The Project was implemented in the
                                                2
departments of San Marcos and Huehuetenango located in the western part of Guatemala. Thirty
three municipalities 1 were the direct beneficiaries of the Project, totaling around 795,743 people.
It is worth noting that the PAD referred instead to a total number of beneficiaries of 900,000
people (400,000 in the ADIMAM association in San Marcos area and 500,000 in the
MAMSOHUE and HUISTA associations in the Huehuetenango area). The Project area is
predominantly rural with about 70 percent indigenous population, mostly involved in agricultural
and commercial activities.

1.5 Original Components (as approved)
9.      The Project consisted of the following four components:
Component 1 ̶ Rural Roads Program (US$20.3 million, including US$14.62 million IBRD
financing): The component was implemented by the Municipal Development Institute
(INFOM) and financed the rehabilitation of about 830 km of rural roads in both Huehuetenango
associations to restore year-round transit and meet the specific transport needs of the local
communities. This component was also to support the development and implementation of the
following pilot projects: (i) road maintenance pilot; (ii) trail paths and footbridges pilot; and (iii)
labor intensive road rehabilitation works.
Component 2 ̶ Main, Secondary/Departmental Roads Program (US$24.45 million, including
US$17.35 million IBRD financing): This component was implemented by General Roads
Directorate (DGC) and included four subcomponents: (i) reconstruction of main roads; (ii)
upgrading of unpaved secondary and departmental roads, (iii) rehabilitation of unpaved
departmental roads; and (iv) road maintenance.
Component 3 ̶ Support for Decentralized Rural Road Development (US$24.45 million,
including US$17.35 million IBRD financing): This component was implemented by INFOM and
supported the extension of sustainable arrangements and financing of local roads in rural areas
developed under the San Marcos Rural Roads Pilot Project (SMRRPP) to other departments. To
reach the scale of a cost-effective road network, the municipalities had to form the Association of
Municipalities in the Huista Region in Huehuetenango (HUISTA) and Association of
Municipalities in the South West of Huehuetenango (MAMSOHUE) associations to manage
their respective municipal road networks. Each association was to create a Road Technical
Assistance Unit (UTAV) staffed according to their specific needs. To support their activities, this
component financed the following activities: (i) Project Coordination and Equipment; (ii)
Municipal Capacity Strengthening; (iii) Technical Assistance (TA) for Project implementation;
and (iv) Works Supervision.




1
 These 33 municipalities were grouped among 3 municipal associations: (a) ADIMAM (Asociacion de Desarrollo
Integral de Municipalidades del Altiplano Marquense) with 12 municipalities and a population of 367,207; (b)
MAMSOHUE (Mancomunidad de Municipalidades del Sur Occidente de Huehuetenango) with 13 municipalities
and a population of 243,945; and (c) HUISTA (Mancomunidad de la Región Huista de Huehuetenango) with 8
municipalities and 184,591habitants.


                                                     3
Component 4 ̶ Support for Main/Departmental Roads (US$6.25 million, including US$5.00
million IBRD financing): This component was implemented by DGC and financed operational
costs and equipment for the Project Coordination Unit (COFINEX), during the Project
implementation period, engineering studies and final designs, and works supervision.

1.6 Revised Components
10.    Changes were introduced in response to the need to repair the road infrastructure
damaged under Hurricane Stan in late 2005, and to the insufficiency of Project funds to
achieve originally foreseen activities due to cost increases and changes in design and scope.
In November 2011, a reallocation of credit proceeds was also approved to finance the
reconstruction of houses that were affected by the civil works on secondary roads in
Huehuetenango.

The following changes were made to two Project components:
Component 1 – Rural Roads Program: an activity was added for the “rehabilitation and
improvement of about 250km of core rural network rehabilitated under the RMRP I and
damaged by the Hurricane Stan”.
Component 2 ̶ Main, Secondary/Departmental Roads Program: all four sub-components
were replaced with one new activity “rehabilitation and improvement of about 100 km of
departmental roads located in the RMRP’s areas that were damaged by Hurricane Stan”.

1.7 Other Significant Changes
11.    Target revisions. No formal target revisions were made to the results framework.
However, with the signature and countersignature of the first amendment to the loan agreement
(with consequent changes in components and activities), some targets were invariably affected,
especially the number of kilometers of roads to be rehabilitated, or improved. Since the
Secondary and Main Roads component (Component 1) was restructured, the total target
kilometers under this component, as well as the corresponding indicators, should have been
replaced with one target indicator of 100 km. (Details in Section 1.3 above).

12.     There have been four amendments to the loan agreement and five closing date
extensions (see Data Sheet Section H). Two loan amendments are discussed under the revised
components section (the first and fourth amendments). The second amendment (signed on March
23, 2010 and countersigned on April 14, 2010) raised the financing percentage of the loan for
rural road works from 75 to 85 percent as a consequence of financial constraints in the
beneficiary municipalities. The third amendment (signed on October 4, 2011 and countersigned
on October 25, 2011) triggered the Bank’s safeguard policy on Involuntary Resettlement (OP
4.12) and the implementation of the Corrective Action Plan. The Project was extended five times
to allow for the implementation of outstanding Project activities due to delays in effectiveness,
delays related to Hurricane Stan, and to finalize the reconstruction of houses affected by
secondary road construction in the Huehuetenango area.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry
13.     The Project responded to an analysis of the national context and reflected
experiences of a previous well-performing Project, the RMRP I and SMRRPP. As part of
the completion process of the RMRP I, a stakeholder workshop was carried out, during which,
the effectiveness and acceptability to the beneficiary population of the implemented model was
confirmed and deemed a good base for the Project. Furthermore, the Project design incorporated
lessons learned from other similar projects in Latin American countries, specifically the Rural
Road Project in Peru. The Project design envisioned the following:

(i)     Extend the model of empowering local communities by setting up local institutions for
        selecting, funding and implementing rural roads rehabilitation and maintenance
        programs;
(ii)    Aid GoG in its poverty alleviation and employment generation focus;
(iii)   Pilot the improvement of non-motorized means of transport in ADIMAM through the
        improvement of tracks, paths and footbridges;
(iv)    Assist the GoG with financing rehabilitation works and road works that improve main,
        secondary, departmental and rural road networks; and
(v)     Provide critical support for capacity building in the region and for strengthening the
        capacity of INFOM, DGC, and municipal associations.

14.     The chosen Project design faced two critical tests during implementation that
magnified some of its inherent weaknesses. First, in some contracts, full engineering designs
were not available and a design and build approach was adopted. This would have been a viable
solution in theory but presented challenges in practice due to the lack of experience with the
model and to the weak contract management environment. Second, at the time of Project
appraisal, involuntary resettlement was not anticipated, given that none of the road sub-projects
involved significant changes in width or alignment. As demonstrated by the chronology of
Project closing date extensions, this resulted in significant implementation delays and challenges.
On all other aspects, the Project design was appropriate, for instance, the rural roads component
work, in particularly with setting up the municipal associations, helping to build capacities at the
central and local levels in the administration, and management of road infrastructure assets. The
design also failed to take into account lessons learned from RMRP I with respect to delays in
implementation caused by the lack of strategy to deal with municipality requests for changes to
agreed proposals.

15.     Financial Management and Capacities. Financial management systems at both
implementing agencies were deemed adequate during preparation. The financial capacity
assessment of 2000 showed that the majority of municipalities would not have difficulties in
meeting the expected costs of rehabilitation and maintenance of the road network. This
assessment proved overly optimistic and failed to take into account the poverty levels in these
areas. It was assumed that INFOM would assist through “adjustment programs” i.e. provide
technical assistance to improve revenues. These optimistic financial assumptions created a
number of constraints related to municipal local counterpart contributions throughout Project
execution. At the same time, the planning for the realization of Project financial audits also faced

                                                 5
challenges, especially later in the Project, with delays in submitting the reports as required by the
legal agreement.

2.2 Implementation
16.     Project implementation suffered a number of setbacks, delay in the Project start
date, and slow and challenging project execution. The RMRP II was approved by the Board of
the Bank in May 2003 and became effective in November 2004. Since the early stages of the
Project, progress was rated as unsatisfactory mainly due to the delay in loan approval by the
Guatemalan Congress. Thereafter, the low rating of overall Project implementation process was
due to the relatively stagnant disbursements and slow mobilization of works. Two years after the
Project’s approval, only 11 percent of the loan had been disbursed and the first package of works
was only in its very preliminary stages.

17.     During implementation, the Project had to face several unpredicted shortcomings
that greatly impacted its outcomes. During the ten years of Project execution, two hurricanes,
one major tropical storm, and a volcanic eruption hit the country, causing significant loss of life
and infrastructural damage. Hurricane Stan (2005) was the first and most severe of these three
natural disasters. According to the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean
impact assessment, the total negative impact of the hurricane amounted to 3.4 percent of the
country’s GDP in 2004 and damage alone was equivalent to 39 percent of the country’s gross
capital formation in the construction sector for that year. The hurricane caused significant and
widespread damage, affecting half of the country, burying whole villages, causing huge damage
to road infrastructure assets (accounting for US$446.9 million), including previously
reconstructed roads, and leaving the country with death toll of 1,500 people. The region most
affected by Stan was the department of San Marco, which had 39 percent of its population
negatively impacted. This ultimately led to a Project restructuring to assist with a road
restructuring plan. In addition, the Project also spanned four different administrations throughout
its execution phase. The ministers, vice-ministers and heads of the implementing agencies
changed multiple times during Project execution resulting in the subsequent turnover in Project
Coordination Unit (PCU) staff (Project Coordinators in particular). This turnover adversely
affected the institutional memory and fiduciary capacity of the PCUs creating additional delays
in the implementation of the Project.

  (a) Implementation efficiency and delays
18.     Counterpart funding. The lack of counterpart funding for the main and secondary roads
component under DGC adversely affected performance of Project implementation. The delayed
release of Borrower´s counterpart funds, compounded by the insufficient amounts after the
design changes, was a factor that affected the rehabilitation of secondary roads and the
completion of the component (especially during the period 2010-2014). At the same time, the
rural roads component required a contribution of 25 percent of the infrastructure cost from the
beneficiary municipality. Some municipalities continued to have delays even when their
counterpart contribution was reduced to 15 percent.

19.    Changes in cost and delays due to the design and building approach. As part of the
secondary roads component, road reconstruction works (consisting of a total of seven road
sections) were incorporated in the San Marcos area. Three separate international competitive
                                                 6
bidding processes were launched in late 2007. The contracts were based on a design and build
approach (the contractor was to prepare the final designs). However, at the request of
communities, variations to the original contract were made to incorporate major design changes.
These design changes were due to: (i) a change in the pavement design from a gravel and double
surface dressing to an asphalt pavement due to beneficiary requests; (ii) increases in earthworks
quantities due to road vertical and horizontal improvements including slope cuts, and
replacement of unsuitable roadbed materials; and (iii) other ancillary items not previously
incorporated in the initial preliminary design. The changes resulted in cost overruns in the
amount of US$35.6 million (from US$18.8 million original contract value to US$54.4 million to
complete works). The changes resulted not only in unfunded cost overruns but also in protracted
delays during implementation, and insufficient funds to complete all the works prior to the
closing date of the Project.

20.     Procurement challenges. The road civil works have been paralyzed for more than three
years due to changes in design and cost increase, and the government´s inability to extend the
original contract with the contractor because contract modifications had already exceeded the 40
percent maximum increase permissible under national law. At the same time, Bank financing for
these contracts was exhausted and, thus, the road civil works had to be financed 100 percent with
national resources to achieve full target completion (with an extra financing need of Q192
million or US$24 million equivalent). The Bank has been making all efforts beyond Project
closure to support the Government in this regard in order for the target beneficiaries to receive
the total number of kilometers of roads under the Project.

21.     Resettlement. In the course of Project implementation, resettlement took place as a
result of road design changes, widening of some sections, and the presence of houses too close to
the road in the Huehuetenango area. The PAD had not contemplated the possibility of these
potential adverse impacts in its main text even though an annex was added referring to a
Resettlement Policy Framework, which was also included in the Supplemental Letter to the Loan
Agreement. The compensation of affected people with house reconstruction, reconstruction of
other affected structures including alternative compensation took considerable time to implement
in accordance with Bank’s policies and guidelines. In addition, the implementing agency was
constrained by the need to comply with the national Expropriation Law No. 438, dated July 1948
which is outdated but still remains in force.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

22.     The Monitoring and Evaluation system had some weaknesses in its design and its
implementation proved challenging. The M&E measured Project indicators through the Project
executing units of the DGC and INFOM. Although the PDO of the Project was too broad, most
of the indicators were related to specific Project development objectives and components. The
indicators were somewhat problematic with many repetitions within the framework, or with
some confusing cross-references, or unclear sources of the adopted numbers and targets. This
situation was remedied by the loan amendment after Hurricane Stan that affected Project scope
in 2006, but no formal restructuring of the results framework and targets was undertaken.
Despite challenges, the Project output indicators were monitored on a regular basis. Moreover,
this ICR report had sufficient data to analyze and assess the Project performance on its specific

                                               7
development objectives (broader Project objectives on rural poverty and social cohesion are not
easily measurable in transport projects without robust, and longer-term impact evaluations). The
Project also undertook an impact evaluation albeit with some weaknesses (see Annex 9).

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

Safeguards
23.     Environmental. Environmental Assessments (EA) for this Project were completed in
2002 and no significant environmental impacts were anticipated. Consequently, the Project was
classified as Category B. According to the information available when the EAs were prepared,
none of the roads included in the Project required significant changes in road characteristics
(vertical or horizontal realignments). The Project´s impacts were projected to be positive,
especially the paving of roads that would lead to less erosion of road materials into river streams,
and to less exploitation of borrow pits for continued gravel maintenance. Three policies were
triggered at the time of appraisal: OP/BP 4.01 on Environmental Assessment, OP/BP 4.11 on
Cultural Property, and OP/BP 4.10 on Indigenous Peoples. The main environmental impacts
requiring mitigation during road construction were: slope stabilization, prudent exploitation of
borrow pits and material deposits, earthwork management, disposal of hazardous and surplus
materials, management of dusts and noise, and protection of road drainage and water sources. In
order to ensure adequate environmental management during construction for each road sub-
project, an Environmental Management Plan (EMP) was developed in compliance with the
national legislation taking into account the Environmental Manual for Road Design and
Construction, developed by the DGC. Compliance with the EMPs was satisfactory. As had been
expected at design, no major environmental impacts were detected during Project
implementation in relation to the road sub-projects.

24.     Cultural Property. In regard to cultural property, no specific adverse effects were
identified during Project implementation.

25.     Indigenous Peoples. To ensure that Indigenous People within the Project area of
influence fully benefitted from the Project and were adequately protected, a consultative process
with communities was carried out as part of the social analysis and assessment conducted during
Project preparation. During rural road sub-project preparation, a Social Management Plan, under
the supervision of INFOM, was prepared to maximize positive impacts of the Project and to
prevent and mitigate any adverse impacts. As part of this Plan, INFOM disseminated
information on road sub-project characteristics, sub-project status, and measures to address
adverse impacts through workshops and community assemblies. Presentation in Mam Maya,
Sipacapense Maya and other Mayan languages were made with the support of the presidents of
the Community Development Councils (Consejos Comunitarios de Desarrollo). A capacity
building specialist was a member of the core PCU team for the Project, supported by two social
promoters “promotores sociales” based in each of the three mancomunidades that participated in
the Project. INFOM also developed public awareness campaigns. These activities were
coordinated with the mancomunidades, which assigned qualified technical personnel to monitor
and oversee the implementation of the Plan.



                                                 8
26.     Involuntary Resettlement. At the time of Project appraisal, OP/BP 4.12 on Involuntary
Resettlement was not triggered given that the proposed road sub-projects did not have significant
changes in alignments. However, in November 2009, the Bank supervision missions found that
resettlements in three sections of the secondary road sub-projects were being carried out by the
DGC in Huehuetenango (Santa Barbara, La Libertad and Tohon – Santiago Chimaltenango).
The resettlements occurred as a result of: (i) the inclusion, in the final road design, of the
widening of some sections, which required excavations and side cuts of rock or slope; (ii) the
design changes, and (ii) the construction of new houses very close to the existing roads.

27.     As a result, the Bank requested the GoG on December 22, 2009 to: (a) identify the
number and location of all resettlement cases in Huehuetenango; (b) provide information on the
processes used to handle complaints and determine compensation; and (c) indicate the extent of
any displacement in the case of the San Marcos roads and the response or compensation given to
the affected households. The Bank also informed Government at that time of the requirement to
trigger the involuntary resettlement safeguard policy and the need for compliance with the same.

28.     Through DGC and the supervising consultants, the Government subsequently
identified 82 cases of dwellings and other structures affected or to be affected to
accommodate the final alignment of the secondary road improvements in Huehuetenango
and San Marcos. Of the 82 cases, 56 involved total or partial loss of dwellings. In the remaining
26 cases, the fences, entrances and water structures were affected. The majority of the cases were
on the road alignment of the Santa Barbara road in Huehuetenango.

29.     A Corrective Action Plan was prepared dated 26th April 2011, and a Project
restructuring was done to accommodate the triggering of the involuntary resettlement in
October 2011. Two procurement processes were carried out for the reconstruction of houses and
structures; however, neither process was successful. Finally, in 2012, the Government requested
the Bank to finance the house reconstruction with loan resources. The impact of population
displacement and of house reconstructions have been highly problematic and caused over four
years of delays in Project implementation. Nevertheless, as a result of concerted efforts and
continuous collaboration between the Government and the Bank, all resettlement issues were
successfully resolved by the loan closing date.
Fiduciary
30.     Financial management (FM) and Procurement. Fiduciary aspects under the Project
were handled, by DGC and INFOM, in a moderately satisfactory manner. Financial management
reports and auditing reports were at times submitted after the agreed period. Most were
considered satisfactory. There were significant issues at both DGC and INFOM in delayed
contractors’ and supervisors’ payments relating to internal budgeting processes and resource
allocations. There were also shortfalls in non-payment of some municipality contributions in the
INFOM administered component.

31.    Integrity Concerns. There were a number of weaknesses identified in the procurement
processes in 2008. The Bank Team addressed these red flags by designing a comprehensive
action plan, which included lessons learned and focused on: (i) reviewing the Independent
Procurement Review (IPR) process; (ii) strengthening the capacity of bid evaluation committee
members; training DGC staff on capacity building on contract management issues. The IPR
                                                9
process and the capacity strengthening of bid evaluation committee members were completed,
and training of DGC staff was undertaken to enhance capacity on contract management issues in
July 2013. The Bank noted the GoG’s support in these processes. The implementation units
endorsed lessons learned to ensure that the Project and future Project management took
appropriate measures to conduct additional due diligence as needed.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase
32.    Despite concerted efforts from the Government and the Bank, some road sections
that form part of the Project had not been completed by the closing date. Due to cost
overruns, these road sections are to be financed 100 percent with Government funds since Bank
funds were exhausted. In Huehuetenango, 19 km out of 32 km remain to be paved and are
expected to be completed satisfactorily this calendar year. In San Marcos, 51 km out of 113 km
remain to be paved and is expected to be completed in eighteen months. The road sections in San
Marcos are distributed in three contracts. The first contract covers four road sections: Tejutla-Las
Delicias (San Miguel Ixtahuacan), Desvio Concepcion Tutuapa-Concepcion Tutuapa, Tejutla-
Comitancillo, and Santa Irene-Rio Blanco for a total length of 53 km. The second contract covers
two road sections: Comitancillo-San Lorenzo and San Lorenzo-San Miguel for a total length of
26 km. The third contract covers the road section Desvio Sipacapa-Sipacapa for a total length of
34 km.

33.      In order to enable the satisfactory completion of the San Marcos roads, the
Government asked the Bank to issue no objections to the revised execution times and costs
needed to complete the three contracts. In January 2014, the Bank issued its no objection to
the first road contract extension. At the time of ICR preparation, the two remaining no objections
were pending, conditional on the Government providing the requisite proof that a competent
supervision firm has been contracted to supervise the works.

34.     Once completed, secondary road sections under the Project would be transferred to
the remit of the maintenance agency the National Road Maintenance Fund (COVIAL) to
undertake needed routine and periodic maintenance activities. With respect to the
improvements of rural infrastructure, INFOM has agreed, in principle, to maintain a road
maintenance team in order to monitor and provide technical assistance, as required, to the 180
COMAVIs created under the Project. The INFOM and the DGC have developed and
strengthened capacity, in particular with respect to fiduciary and safeguards, to implement
similar development projects.

3. Assessment of Outcomes
3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

35.     The relevance of the PDOs is considered Substantial. The PDO remains aligned with
the country’s goal to reduce poverty and improve social cohesion. The PDO remains in line with
the current development priorities of GoG, which aims to foster inclusion and participation of
beneficiaries through decentralized decision-making and implementation of local investment,
while strengthening local government and rural communities in planning and investing in basic
infrastructure. Furthermore, improving road access for rural areas continues to be a critical part
of the GoG’s poverty alleviation policy matrix. Reducing poverty, building social cohesion and

                                                10
strengthening participatory decision processes are fully aligned with the main goals of the
Country Partnership Strategy for Fiscal Year (FY) 2013-2016.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

36.    In summary, the Project had three PDOs of which two were substantially achieved
and one was marginally achieved. Of the thirteen intermediate results indicators, ten were
exceeded or fully achieved and three were partially achieved (See Results Framework analysis).

37.      The Project has made a significant contribution to: (i) improving access to social and
administrative services in the departments of Huehuetenango and San Marcos (as a result of
improved rural and secondary roads, pedestrian bridges, and periodic maintenance works); and
(ii) strengthening institutions at both the central and local levels to manage and maintain the road
infrastructure (with the formation and support of three municipal associations, capacity building
of road technical units and road maintenance committees, and technical support to the
implementing agencies INFOM and DGC).

38.     An impact evaluation performed for the targeted areas of the Project, suggested
positive effects of the Project on its beneficiaries’ self-reported income levels (See Annex 9
for more details). According to the respondents in the treatment group, the situation regarding
poverty had changed positively in their favor as a result of the improved rural roads. According
to the ranges of the income variable, the percentage of people earning below Q800 (US$103
equivalent) was reduced by 29.3 percent (from 53.6 to 24.3 percent) 2. With respect to travel time
to the nearest village, comparing before and after rehabilitation, an average reduction of 35
percent was observed in the travel time in the treatment group. In terms of travel times to health
services, a decrease in average travel times of 24.0 percent was noted. Women in the control
group reported increases in their education levels with a 35.9 percent increase compared to the
control women. According to the testimony of the focal groups, in terms of family and local
economy , the improvement of roads, has helped improve agricultural production especially
coffee, vegetables, white corn, avocado, fruit by facilitating the acquisition of fertilizer to their
farms and plots, and by helping to get more production out to markets in time and with less
losses.

Specific Objective 1: Improve rural access on sustainable basis by improving paths, rural
roads, secondary and departmental roads and main road

39.    The Project contributed to improving access in rural areas to markets, schools and
health centers. By Project completion a total of 749 km (vs. a target of 819) km of rural roads
and 75 km (vs. a target of 100 km) of secondary/departmental roads were rehabilitated, 30 km of
roads have received periodic maintenance (vs.300 km), and 37 pedestrian bridges (vs. 80) have
been constructed. Due to changes in Project design, increases in costs and delays in Project
implementation, the Project could not fully achieve its set physical targets. However, the


2
    The study was conducted in 2012, using year 2007 as ex-ante and 2012 as ex-post.


                                                         11
outcome indicator for this objective was substantially achieved. Furthermore, taking into
consideration the overarching Project objectives, this indicator should be given more weight in
the final assessment of Project achievements.

Specific Objective 2: Develop institutional capacity at the local and central level, for rural
roads management and strengthening stakeholders’ participation.

40.     The Project provided significant contributions to the institutional development
capacity at the local and central level for rural road management of the transport sector in
Guatemala. In particular at the local level the Project: (i) assisted in the creation of two
municipalities associations (mancomunidades), MAMSOHUE and HUISTA, and in their
strengthening of road management through the establishment of the UTAVs and securing
funding for their operation during the Project implementation; (ii) supported the already created
mancomunidad of ADIMAM; (iii) strengthened road planning and management basic
infrastructure service at municipal level; (iv) supported active participation of the beneficiary
population at all the road subproject cycle stages; and (v) strengthened and improved the
implementation of road maintenance system by introducing more than 180 community
committees (COMAVIs) for routine maintenance at local community associations, including
training as well as the procurement of road maintenance equipment, tools and clothing for these
COMAVIs.

41.      The Project also had important impacts on the implementing agencies at the central
level. The resources assigned to DGC for institutional development were mainly to support
Project costs in the administration of the coordination unit for external financing (COFINEX).
COFINEX already had extensive experience working with the Bank and other multilateral
agencies. The DGC received funds to address: (i) updating of financial and procurement
procedures; (ii) equipment; and, (iii) enhancing training of staff. In addition, the Project
supported the recruitment of key procurement and financial specialists. With regard to safeguard
issues, the unit responsible was the Environmental Management Unit (División de Gestión
Ambiental) and the same received training on Bank`s environmental and social policies and
procedures. Although, the DGC underperformed in terms of meeting final outcomes, all the
initiatives of strengthening institutional capacity that were conceived at appraisal were executed.

42.     With regards to INFOM, the Project financed the Project coordinating unit
(UCBM), and provided capacity building for social and environmental management. The
Project also financed a procurement specialist, financial management specialist, a social
specialist and a full-time specialist on municipal capacity development to assist the
mancomunidades in their “day to day” administration of the UTAVs. Simultaneously, the
Project financed a group of social promoters “promotores sociales” who worked closer with the
municipal and association agencies responsible for Project implementation at the local level. In
addition, the Project contracted several engineers and environmental staff that worked actively in
the rural sub- project design and execution, collaborating with staff of the mancomunidades’
UTAVs and municipalities’ Environmental Unit (Unidades Municipales Ambientales).




                                                12
Specific Objective 3: Generate employment in rural areas by developing an entrepreneurial
culture using cost-effective technologies, providing demonstration effect through pilot
program, and promoting spillover effects.

43.     The Project did not significantly contribute to generating employment in rural areas.
The Project envisaged that rural local residents would be contracted to undertake routine
maintenance of the roads financed by the Project. In turn, it was expected that the project would
generate direct employment through the creation of microenterprises and the corresponding
formation of an entrepreneurial culture. However, during Project implementation, the
community-based micro-enterprise pilot program was cancelled at the request of the
mancomunidad of ADIMAM. Instead, the Project supported the creation of 180 community
based committees -COMAVIs – founded on voluntary work. The COMAVIs received training,
tools and basic equipment to perform routine road maintenance without payment to their
members. In addition, the Project also supported the creation of a number of jobs by contracting
firms that carried out and supervised the individual works under the Project. Many of these were
local firms. This helped to a certain extent in building local knowledge and capacity, and for
making local companies more competitive in preparation for future contracts. The
entrepreneurial culture spirit and related spillover effects envisaged under the project design
could also have been reasonably furthered through the execution of these contracts.

3.3 Efficiency
44.     A thorough ex-post economic analysis has not been undertaken for this ICR.
However, overall, the Project achieved to a great extent its targets within the resources
approved. Despite the fact that a full ex-post analysis of the secondary roads Project cannot be
undertaken at the time of the ICR (since the road sections under the secondary/departmental
roads component have not been completed, and final costs and benefits cannot be robustly
calculated), some cost-effectiveness approaches and review of previous economic assessments
are nevertheless presented to gauge how efficient the Project was in the use of allocated
resources. At the time of appraisal, for the first year package of identified secondary road
improvements, overall economic results obtained using the Highway Development and
Management Model (HDM-3) yielded an overall net present value of US$5.99 million, with
individual road sections Economic Internal Rate of Return (EIRR) ranging from 16 percent to 35
percent. When the cost increase of the roads in the San Marcos area was being approved, a
revised economic analysis was done using the same model. The revised economic analysis
showed these roads to maintain strong economic viability despite the increased costs, due to a
disproportionate increase in benefits (higher values for travel times, higher projections in
diverted and generated traffic due to the interconnection of the roads proposed for rehabilitation
in San Marcos). The results as of May 2009 indicated a revised EIRR of 24.5 percent for the
affected roads. The lower category rural roads improved under INFOM had since inception
(appraisal) only a multi-criteria analysis approach defined for selection as they were not
considered amenable to traditional cost-benefit analyses.




                                               13
45.     During the ICR stage, a cost-effectiveness analysis was undertaken to justify Project
expense efficiency 3 . For the rural roads component under INFOM, the cost effectiveness
analysis indicates Project spending at US$57 per beneficiary. For the secondary roads
component (using costs to completion) under DGC, the cost effectiveness analysis indicates
Project spending at US$196 per beneficiary. These results are on the conservative side of typical
road project investments, representing prudent use of public resources 4. For the secondary roads,
the costs as per 2012 updates of the civil works are also in line with country and regional
estimates for single carriageway secondary road upgrading works with an average of about
US$485,977 per km versus regional averages that range from US$400,000 to US$1.3 million.
(See Annex 1).

46.     On the whole, in support of the findings from the impact evaluation work and this cost-
effectiveness analysis, the Project civil works have significant public value benefit, and represent
good value for money on efficiency and efficacy grounds.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
47.     The overall outcome rating is Moderately Satisfactory and is based on the following
considerations: (i) the Project largely accomplished its planned outcomes; (ii) the positive
agreement with the Government to complete the secondary road reconstruction in San Marcos
and Huehuetenango; (iii) the satisfactory completion of the resettlement and house
reconstruction, which directly mitigated social cohesion tensions; and (iv) the efficiency and
efficacy of the civil works.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
48.     The Project has had direct impact on improving the welfare of target beneficiaries
in terms of a more reliable transport network with faster travel times, and improved travel
conditions in the regions of San Marcos and Huehuetenango. The Project triggered job
creation and provided access to markets and better connected the communities, reinforcing social
nets through the creation and strengthening of the mancomunidades.

49.     Poverty impacts were intended to be measured through an Impact Evaluation Study.
Although the methodology used (propensity score matching combined with double difference) to
estimate the impacts of the intervention have been tested in many cases to control for
endogenous placement, the study’s main weakness is a lack of an accurate and reliable
counterfactual group. Also, the baseline for HUISTA and MAMSOHUE was collected after the
Project had begun implementation and no ex-ante data was collected for ADIMAM. The ex-post
follow up study was undertaken in 2012, and by that time not all the civil works envisioned by

 World Bank Transport Note TRN-9, “Notes on the economic evaluation of transport projects” dated January 2005.

 For example, the Morocco rural roads project did a thorough cost-effectiveness analysis of rural road investments,
with a threshold in 2013 values of US$620 per beneficiary.

                                                        14
the Project had been executed. Annex 9 provides more detailed information of the study and its
findings.

50.     Nevertheless, it is clear that having adequate transportation ensures better access to
social and economic services and provides a mechanism to improve the level of income of
beneficiaries. According to the testimony of the focal groups in HUISTAS and MAMSOHUE,
in terms of family and local economy, the improvement of roads, has helped improve agricultural
production especially coffee, vegetables, white corn, avocado, fruit by facilitating the acquisition
of fertilizers and to get more production out to markets in time, and with less losses. In
ADIMAM, the focus groups expressed that the facilitated transport of products to local or
regional markets represents one of the major benefits from this Project to the small producers in
the communities. The Project did not specifically address gender issues, which is an important
lesson learned for future work in the sector.
(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
51.     Institutional and capacity strengthening were part of the core objectives of the
Project. DGC, INFOM and municipal associations (mancomunidades) were targeted to receive
the technical assistance activities. As previously mentioned, the Project aimed to elaborate a
national strategy of transport and rural roads. This intended to create useful synergies among all
the agencies involved in the transport infrastructure sector of Guatemala. Evidently, the UCBM
Project coordination unit had important institutional effects on INFOM. Capabilities of staff in
project management, social aspects, environmental aspects, financial management and
procurement were enhanced. This installed capacity was accompanied by the integration of these
personnel in the INFOM institutional structure as had been designed by the Project. In DGC,
training in procurement and social and environmental management enhanced the capabilities of
staff working on these aspects. Also, there was learning by doing process through which a
number of evolving problems during implementation were solved by Project staff.
(c) Other outcomes
52.      The Project assisted in the implementation of a road restoration and rehabilitation
program for rural roads destroyed by the Hurricane Stan. These roads were financing under
the main/secondary roads component. It could be argued that being able to respond to an
emerging disaster (Hurricane Stan) was a positive development by the Bank and Government,
showing Bank flexibility and ability to respond to emerging country issues, and adapting to new
realities on the ground.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops
(See Annex 9).

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: High
53.     The risk to the development outcome at the time of the ICR is considered High.
Going forward, with respect to the main/secondary roads investment component, the
Government will need to: (i) finance the estimated US$45 million gap required to complete
satisfactorily the three road contracts in San Marcos; (ii) supervise carefully the road civil works,
through the Supervision Division of the DGC together with the supervision firm(s); and, (iii)

                                                 15
assume the responsibility for providing the resources for road maintenance through COVIAL.
With respect to the rural roads component, the risk is also high because the operation and
maintenance beyond the closing date requires resources as well as an active and equitable
involvement of INFOM, the Municipalities and beneficiary communities in the maintenance of
the rural roads which is not guaranteed.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

54.      Bank performance on ensuring Quality of Entry is rated Moderately Satisfactory.
The Bank carried out good analytical sector work and prepared the Project design based on
replicating the SMRRPP, which was considered "best practice" during its implementation. In
addition, the Bank brought several other best practice approaches to the design and
implementation of rural road projects including the experience obtained in the Second Rural
Roads Project in Peru which received an Excellence Award from the Bank. Also, the proposal,
through the institutional strengthening component, to assist and develop the microenterprise
model implemented successfully in Peru for rural roads maintenance was a worthy design goal.
The envisaged institutional arrangement for executing municipal roads through the leadership of
the Associations, creating and strengthening Road Technical Unit (UTAV and FVR) were also
sound and ideal mechanism that would have provided sustainable funding arrangements for
maintaining rural roads. In general the Project was innovative and was in accordance to the needs
of the transport sector, specifically in the rural areas.

55.     However, there were some shortcomings in Project design, including: (i) weaknesses
in fully grasping the modalities and challenges with the design and build approach in a weak
contract management environment; (ii) no reference to resettlement or resettlement related
impacts; (ii) lack of plan to address the potential failure of the municipalities to make their local
contributions both to the rehabilitation works and micro-enterprise maintenance model; (iv)
flaws in the institutional strengthening component with funds allocated principally for the Project
administration costs, equipment, studies and designs, and very little in terms of much needed
road sector asset management and reform work; and, (v) failure to consider relevant aspects of
design at entry due to the previously successful experience with the first roads Project and to
incorporate lessons learned from that Project. For these reasons, the Bank performance for
ensuring quality at entry is rated as moderately satisfactory.
(b) Quality of Supervision (including of fiduciary and safeguards policies)
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
56.    Given the complex issues that arose during the Project implementation, the Bank
had to provide close and intense supervision with respect to technical, procurement,
fiduciary, and social safeguard policies, to reduce Bank reputational risk. Issues that arose
included: changes in Project design, increases in cost, Hurricane Stan, resettlement and house
reconstruction, untimely provision of local counterpart funds, procurement challenges, and
incomplete secondary road infrastructure. Although these issues were resolved by the Borrower
                                                 16
and the Bank, the solutions were slow, protracted and took considerable time to achieve.
Admittedly, many elements were beyond Bank control. Nevertheless, some issues were caused
mainly by the weaknesses identified in the design, and leave the Bank responsible to a certain
extent in the supervision phase. Attention to updating the results framework was also sporadic in
intermediate ISRs. For these reasons, the quality of the supervision is rated as moderately
satisfactory.
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
57.    For the reasons indicated above, the overall Bank performance is rated Moderately
Satisfactory.

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
58.     The Government performance is rated Moderately Satisfactory on the basis of its
role during the Project preparation and implementation. During the implementation phase of
the Project, the Government ownership was strong. The Government was committed to
empowering and developing institutional capacity at the municipal levels through the creation of
mancomunidades. The Government’s foremost challenges that have contributed to delays in
implementation were to ensure counterpart contributions, resolution of arising safeguards
challenges, and the financing of the incomplete secondary road sections. The Government made
efforts to satisfactorily address these challenges as they arose, and its performance is rated as
moderately satisfactory given that the greater part of the efforts to resolve these issues rested
with the implementing agencies.
(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies’ Performance
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory
59.     The performance of DGC, through COFINEX, which managed the main and
secondary road component, is rated as Moderately Unsatisfactory. The DGC was
responsible for the: (i) poor management of the reconstruction of the houses and structures in
Huehuetenango; (ii) tedious contract management in the secondary roads construction; (iii)
failure to ensure timely budgeting and payment of contractors, supervisors and consultants; and
(iv) unfinished road sections in San Marcos at the time of loan closing.

60.     The performance of INFOM, through the UCBM, was Satisfactory. The INFOM
made good progress on managing the rural road component with the re-graveling and periodic
maintenance. It also performed well on activities related to rural pedestrian bridges, routine
maintenance with rural road committees and local municipal strengthening. INFOM, however,
failed to ensure that the municipalities made their local contributions and this was identified as
the weakest element in INFOM’s performance. At the beginning of the Project, the delays in
commissioning the rural road packages also had a negative effect on municipality expectations.
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory



                                               17
61.    For the reasons outlined above, the overall Borrower performance is rated
Moderately Unsatisfactory. Delays in the provision of counterpart funds had a strong negative
impact on Project implementation, and at times put the Project “at risk”. This rating is mainly
driven by the performance of DGC and the significant shortcomings discussed above.

6. Lessons Learned
62.     Closer attention should be paid to potential resettlement issues, taking into account
cultural practices and land tenure issues. The Project should have prepared a more detail-
oriented social assessment, and focussed on the potential resettlement given the unclear land
ownership system in the Project areas, and the fact that people tend to build their houses as close
to the road as possible. This could have minimized the problems that arose during the
implementation of the Project. In particular, lessons learned include: (i) detailed plans
delineating land and properties that might be affected due to horizontal road re-alignments
should be prepared; (ii) full consultations with affected people should be carried out; (iii)
establishing a cut-off date beyond which no new encroachment on the road would be recognized;
and (iv) ensuring that funds are set aside to make the necessary compensation either within the
loan or with counterpart funds.

63.     PDOs and PDO indicators should be aligned with what a Project can realistically
achieve, and the results framework should be updated following a restructuring. The
overarching PDO and some indicators were defined too broadly, given the scale and scope of the
Project. Indicators should be simple, measurable and non-repetitive. When changes are made
during restructurings, the results framework should be updated, with indicators revised, targets
changed, and a new framework officially adopted.

64.     Assess capacity and ensure staffing of environmental and social management team
in the Project implementing agencies. Issues encountered during Project preparation and
implementation could have been avoided had the implementing agency been staffed with
dedicated, full-time environmental and social management team from the very beginning of the
Project to ensure due diligence in terms of: (i) quality assurance of environmental and social
mitigation plans; (ii) supervision of the implementation of environmental and social management
plans; and (iii) timely and systematic reporting of main findings on issues encountered in the
field.

65.    Adoption of the civil works procurement strategy for a design and build approach
should be accompanied by a comprehensive capacity assessment and supported by
vigorous strengthening of the implementing agency. The design and build approach requires
a procurement capacity assessment and knowledgeable technical expertise of both the Bank and
the executing agency. Also, if this approach is undertaken, the contractor should make final
designs and submit them for approval to the Government within the agreed and set deadline, but
before execution. This will ensure commitment to designs and that costs are known upfront as
opposed to the design and build approach where costs change continuously during
implementation.

66.   Ensuring adequate financing for maintenance remains a challenge, and future Bank
engagement in the sector should also pay special attention to this issue. Rural sector

                                                18
financing still faces strong restrictions. Current budget allocations cannot sufficiently address
rural transport sector needs. Further Bank support should facilitate a broader policy dialogue
with the GoG, on how to ensure a better sustainability of rural road maintenance financing.

67.     Local funding for civil works in roads segments might be unrealistic under the
country context. The Project envisioned that the local municipalities would serve as
counterparts in the financing of some of the roads Projects. However, lack of payment from the
local authorities throughout Project implementation caused extensive delays and frequent
cessation of works. It is advisable in the future to either use central government funds to finance
the operation or use municipalities’ contribution as the advance payment to ensure timely
completion of works.

Project Context, Project Development Objectives and Design

After the signing of the peace accords in 1996, the Government of Guatemala (GoG)
committed to a decentralization policy as an instrument for social cohesion and poverty
reduction. One critical element for creating this “integrated society” was determined to be
the promotion of physical connectivity and elimination of geographic isolation. The
improvement of the country’s road network was determined as one of the key
components of the Government’s Poverty Reduction Strategy (GUAPA 2012). The
provision of good quality roads, with all-weather access roads all year round, is one of
the key targets of the current administration.

The Project is noted as being the follow up phase of GoG-Bank collaboration to the
success with the first Main and Rural Roads Project (4260-GU) which had one of its
main components the San Marcos Rural Roads Pilot Project (SMRRPP). In addition to
replicating the successes of the first project, the design also sought to introduce new
planning approaches, and service delivery models that promote greater participation of
end beneficiaries and local community organizations, and strengthening the institutional
policies and framework, and sustainability of the programs.

The Project Development Objectives (general and specific) as well as the indicators are
reiterated as per the PAD.

Significant Changes noted

   •   In May 2009, the Bank approved the change in road surfacing from double
       surface dressing to hot mix asphalt with an elevation in the cost of works, and a
       reallocation of loan proceeds from the unallocated category to the works category
       in 2-11
   •   In December 2011, the Bank approved the percentage of financing to 100% and
       transferred the remaining funds from INFOM to DGC to be used for the
       reconstruction of houses affected under the Project
   •   The changes in roads to be intervened that were made as a result of the damages
       caused by Hurricane Stan in the San Marcos area are noted
   •   The change in the micro-enterprise model to the community maintenance model
       (COMAVIs) is also mentioned. The COMAVIs work without receiving
       enumeration and the change is justified on the grounds that the model of
       maintenance on a community basis as opposed to a for-profit basis is heavily
       ingrained in the culture and a change would have generated significant social
       problems.

Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

   •   Problem noted of not having budgeted adequately for advance payments of signed
       contracts.
   •   Problem noted of not having foreseen need to liberate the right of way with the
       widening of the secondary roads.
   •   The design and build approach is also noted as having been problematic since the
       design was being made in parallel to the road works execution.

Implementation

   •   Design change for roads in San Marcos noted, with negotiation process that lasted
       8 months to approval.
   •   The contractor’s suspension of works in San Marcos in 2010 is also noted as
       having had negative effects environmentally due to unattended environmental
       needs. Similar environmental challenges noted in Huehuetenango with secondary
       road contract works there since works keep getting suspended, and restarted.

Evaluation of Outcomes/Results

   •   The current Government continues to see the need for road infrastructure
       improvements in order to advance productivity, competitiveness and the
       development of rural areas. This is also supported by Government efforts in
       programs like “Hambre Cero”, or “zero hunger” in English, that is intended to
       combat poor nutrition.
   •   Connectivity/accessibility programs like the current project are noted as being
       important in delivering benefits to the target populations through improved access
       to basic series, health centers, schools, markets, social and economic
       infrastructure, while also allowing for direct participation of local communities.
   •   The targets achieved with DGC secondary roads are noted at 50% of the 145km
       target. Extra funds are needed for the successful completion of the San Marcos
       roads (Q192 million or about 24.6 million dollars), and Huehuetenango roads
       (Q40 million or about US$ 5 million).
   •   Efficiency results are quoted for a Gisystems analysis that indicated an ERR of
       42.9%, and NPV of 41.9 million.
   •   The cost changes for secondary roads are also noted from US$170,000 per km for
       the surface dressing to US$480,000 for the asphalt course and noted to be
       reasonable according to the Feasibility department review.
   •   For the San Marcos roads, the Bank no objection is noted for the draft
       modification of one of the contracts, and works are foreseen to be completed by
       the first half of 2016.
   •   Physical progress of the Huehuetenango secondary road contracts is noted as 37
       percent for the contract serving La Libertad and Santiago Chimaltenango



                                           32
       municipalities (15.98 km total road lengths); and 76 percent for the contract
       serving San Juan Atitan and Santa Barbara (18.53 km total road lengths).
   •   While project roads are not yet completed in their totality, it is noted that already
       some tangible benefits have been noted in beneficiary areas with improvements in
       living standards, with people becoming more involved in productive activities,
       and in the social and education sectors benefiting from road sections that were
       improved, with reduced travel times.
   •   The failure to conclude works on time is primarily attributed to the failure to
       count on budget funds, a situation made worse by the refocussing of funds to
       attend to damage by natural disasters hitting the country over the later parts of the
       implementation period.
   •   The results presented in the results framework and the comments provided are in
       line with those presented in the present ICR.
   •   The report emphasizes the main impacts at the institutional strengthening at the
       local level including the technical support through workshops, equipment
       purchase, and training of the mancomunidad of ADIMAM which had been
       created in the first project, and is now a well-developed organization with
       technical, financial and administrative capabilities. The mancomunidad of
       MAMSOHUE, one of two created under the Project is also detailed as having a
       good level of development, and working efficiently on a teamwork basis. The
       other mancomunidad HUISTA is noted as being the weaker link, with significant
       challenges, especially financial Agencies like INFOM need to give continued
       support to this mancomunidad to ensure its continued proper functioning.
   •   Major project impacts on poverty alleviation are noted as documented in the
       ENCOVI 2011 survey (Living Standards Measurement Survey). The same results
       in effects on income levels as noted in the ICR main text and impact evaluation
       annex are reported.
   •   Other results are noted related to Bank support in the training courses offered to
       DGC staff in the topics of project administration, new pavement technologies, and
       involuntary resettlement.

Evaluation of Bank Performance

   •   For quality at entry, the report documents the project preparation work, approval
       of the loan and its effectiveness. The resettlement problems faced later and the
       changes in pavement design are also mentioned. No scoring of the Bank
       performance is entered.
   •   For quality of supervision, bank visits are noted on a frequent semestral basis with
       aide memoires signed at the end of each mission. No scoring of the Bank
       performance is entered.

Evaluation of Borrower Performance

   •   Government participation of all relevant institutions is noted as having been
       complete with full commitment to the Project



                                            33
   •   On implementing agencies performance, the challenges with the natural disasters
       are reiterated, causing a shift in financing priorities and allocations, but with
       commitment to complete unfinished works in the medium term.
   •   On the basis of the delays in delivering all programmed project activities, the self-
       evaluation of the Borrower’s performance is noted as moderately unsatisfactory.

Lessons Learned

   •   Non-compliance with contract execution times
   •   Need to count on budget allocations for contracts, and comply with national
       counterpart commitment payments
   •   Improve the preparation and approval of designs, while ensuring that the same
       respond to the wishes/needs of the beneficiaries; case of the secondary roads in
       San Marcos is provided as a major lesson learned.
   •   Carry out advance procurement of the needed right of way and register it as
       Government property
   •   Get better linkages between the mancomunidades and the implementing agency,
       including support as necessary on administrative and financial issues
   •   Constant monitoring and follow-through that institutionalizes such a large project
       as part of a national or regional strategy and avoid significant staff turnover at all
       levels to preserve institutional memory and continuity.

Other Comments by Borrower

   •   Important to link project with Government road sector policies, determine needed
       amounts, and include contingencies to enable the achievement of set targets, and
       avoid project execution delays.
   •   Bank support for this type of program is noted as being of vital importance given
       that it has enabled rural communities to benefit from socio-economic
       development that has eluded them for many years.
   •   Need to improve project proposals and designs and socialize the same with end
       beneficiaries to avoid future problems or delays
   •   Need to involve the implementing agencies, and all authorities in the program
       execution for efficient results.

General conclusions and recommendations

   •   There is a need to establish better communication between the implementing
       agencies and the mancomunidades, and the end beneficiaries
   •   There is a need to support, strengthen and promote the integration of the
       mancomunidades of MAMSOHUE and HUISTA.
   •   There is a need for better information flow from INFOM to the communities, and
       their leaders on the status of issues, and possible solutions.
   •   INFOM needs to help in strengthening the administrative and financial
       capabilities of the mancomunidades.



                                            34
•   There is a need to disseminate the impacts of the project especially the benefits in
    terms of reduced travel times, increase in numbers and frequency of public
    transport and the impact on health and employment outcomes.
•   Link project benefits with other intervention benefits to demonstrate the
    cumulative and integrated impacts in improving accessibility and the quality of
    life of the people.
•   Make attempts to inform about the changes in family incomes as a result of
    project interventions even if this may only be on a qualitative information basis.
•   Expand focus made on the cobblestone (empedrado) projects and the pedestrian
    bridges given their wide acceptance and important benefits
•   Discuss and disseminate knowledge on gender impacts as a result of the project,
    and how the project interventions have contributed to reducing the gender gap.
•   Get a commitment from beneficiary municipalities to undertake road maintenance
    as a condition of their participation as beneficiary municipalities.
•   Continue with institutional strengthening efforts in the implementing agencies,
    and reduce staff turnover
•   More efforts are needed in capacity building, training, workshops, courses, and
    monitoring and evaluation of road projects
•   Continue the inter-change and support of strengths between DGC and INFOM
    with DGC providing its technical knowledge transfer to INFOM, and INFOM its
    social knowledge transfer to DGC on a sustained basis.
•   There is a need to ensure that road projects consider on an obligatory basis the
    incorporation of rural roads (intra-municipal network) given the wide-ranging
    significance of these roads for the local populations.
•   There is a need to make all necessary efforts to complete the
    secondary/departmental road projects.
•   There is a need to ensure that future designs incorporate the best designs
    (technical and financial) to avoid some of the problems that arose in the
    secondary/departmental roads component.

Annex 9. Impact Evaluation of Second Rural and Main Roads Program - Summary

A brief summary of the main features and results of the impact evaluation of the Project
conducted by DMC Consultores SA and Borges y Asociados is presented below.

Sources of information

Information used as inputs for the study included a series of previous papers, as well as
primary and secondary sources of information. Background documents consist of studies
in the years 2006 to 2008. The primary sources of information consist of a recompilation
of information gathered from in-depth surveys to selected households ( 2,836 ) and focus
groups in the three mancomunidades ( 6) and the implementing units (PCU / INFOM ;
DGC / MICIVI ) ( 1).

Methodology

The selection of treatment and control groups was accomplished using Propensity Score
Matching (PSP), so that the groups compared are similar in some observable
characteristics ( poverty , vulnerability and unmet basic needs) and whose only
difference is the effect of receiving the benefit of the intervention or not ( counterfactual).
This was done in order to establish causality of the changes that could occur among the
treatment and control groups.

It should be noted that using the combined method of propensity score matching and
double differences, minimizes the bias and its error given that groups are selected in the
region of common support. Also, specifically taking into consideration the closeness of
the control observation to the treatment group helps to mitigate some spillover effects.

The study was conducted in 2012, using year 2007 as ex-ante and 2012 as ex-post.

Samples Size of the Municipal Associations

MAMSOHUE and HUISTAS. Data from the 2007 baseline selected a sample size of
1,200 cases, of which 600 interviews were applied treatment households and the other
600 households corresponding to those that did not participate in the intervention. The
sample is fixed for the 2012 study in 1,200 cases and with the same design parameters in
a bilateral or two-tailed test with a confidence level of 95 percent, a statistical power of
80 percent and with an expected loss ratio of 15 percent. The universe of the study was of
66,409 households (330,691 inhabitants) corresponding to the 211 towns and villages that
receive benefits directly from the intervention (26 municipalities) and 326 villages
selected as a control group without intervention or (5 municipalities).

ADIMAM. The universe of the study was 137,229 households. Some households were
discarded because they were outside the common support area (54,039) and others
because, despite being in the region of common support, they were within the area of
influence of a parallel intervention implemented by Compañia Minera Montana (11,100



                                              37
households). In this case a sample size of 818 surveys, 409 treatments and 409 controls,
with a statistical confidence level of 95 percent, a statistical power of 80 percent, and 15
percent loss. Based on the foregoing, 12 municipalities were part of the treatment group
and 9 municipalities were controls. For this municipal association, no baseline data had
previously been collected.

Results of impact estimates

MAMSOHUE and HUISTAS
• In relation to physical access, respondents reported an increase in the volume and types
of vehicles for passenger and cargo circulating in their villages. In the case of the autos
(taxis) an increase of 34.25 percent was reported, for trucks 65.57 percent and 82.14
percent for pick-ups.

• With respect to travel time to the nearest village, comparing before and after
rehabilitation, an average reduction of 35 percent was observed in the travel time in the
treatment group. Replicating the same analysis for the travel time to reach a nearest
primary or secondary road, the treatment group verified a decrease on average time of
29.13 percent. For travel times to attend schools, this was calculated on average at 32.73
percent in the treatment group (this was significantly higher than that reported in the
control group). In terms of travel times to health services, a decrease in average travel
times of 24.0 percent was noted in the treatment group. Nonetheless, the control group
reported a significant and higher reduction than the treatment group. This finding was not
explained.

• Women in the control group reported increases in their education levels with a 35.90
percent increase compared to the control women.

• According to the respondents in the treatment group, the situation regarding poverty had
changed positively in their favor as a result of the improved rural roads. According to the
ranges of the income variable, the percentage of people earning below Q800 was reduced
by 29.3 percent (from 53.6 to 24.3%). The proportion of people earning between Q801
to Q1,600, was increased by 12.2 percent (from 40.2% to 52.4%); the proportion of
people earning between Q1,601 to Q3,200, was increased by 16.4 percent (from 6 to
22.4%) and the percentage of people earning more than Q3,200 was increased by 0.7
percent (from 2-9%).

• According to the testimony of the focal groups, in terms of family and local economy ,
the improvement of roads, has helped improve agricultural production especially coffee,
vegetables, white corn, avocado, fruit by facilitating the acquisition of fertilizer to their
farms and plots, and by helping to get more production out to markets (in time and with
less losses).

ADIMAM
• With regards to physical access, respondents reported increases in the volume and types
of vehicles for passengers and cargo passing through their towns. In the case of the cars



                                             38
an increase of 15.90 percent was reported, and for trucks, the increase noted was 17.28
percent, both significant at the 95 and 99 percent confidence interval levels.

• In the case of accessibility benefits arising from less transit interruption, a better
situation was evidenced in the treatment group with the group reporting on average 29.82
percent less interruption by rain and erosion than the control group.

• As for the cost of tariff for passengers, the treatment group reported an 8 percent lower
cost than the control group with a 95 percent significance. Meanwhile the cost of freight,
showed no significant differences.

• With respect to travel time to the nearest primary or secondary road, comparing before
and after rehabilitation, an average reduction of 12.49 percent in the travel time was
noted for the treatment group. Replicating the same analysis for the travel time to reach
the nearest school, the treatment group and control group did not reveal any significant
changes (travel time remained around 38 minutes). This could be attributed to the fact
that most of the students in the area indicated that they still predominantly walked to
school. In terms of travel times to health services, a decrease in average travel times of
45.77 % was observed in the treatment group.

• With regards to road safety, many road accidents in the rural areas have predominantly
affected pedestrians or occupants of non-motorized vehicles. The study found that the
level of accidents reported by the treatment group is 51.78 percent lower than that
reported by the control group. This might be explained by the fact that while improved
roads may lead to faster speeds, the impact may be related to the fact that more people are
now using motorized transport, with fewer casualties reported in the non-motorized
category.

• With regards to family income, the treatment group reported a significant improvement
in their economic condition by 10 percent over the control group. Regarding employment,
both groups indicated similar occupational distribution with 69.4 percent engaged in
agriculture and 11.2 percent in trade.

• The facilities to transport products to local or regional markets represent major benefits
for small producers in the communities. It was mentioned by the focus group that the
production of vegetables, legumes and perishables were previously lost by difficulty or
delays in getting these to the market. At the time of the surveys, there was almost no crop
losses, reported as most of the product could be sent to the market in less time and in
proper condition for sale.
