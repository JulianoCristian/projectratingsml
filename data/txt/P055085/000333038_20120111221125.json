The closing date\n            for project will be extended from December 31, 2011 until\n            September 30, 2012. The extension is necessary to support\n            the implementation of the Corrective Action Plan to\n            completion and to thus resolve all outstanding cases of\n            involuntary resettlement. This includes principally the\n            execution of contracts currently in the procurement stage to\n            reconstruct houses and structures affected by the secondary\n            road improvements carried out in Huehuetenango department.\n            The extension will also support the completion of ongoing\n            contracts for tertiary road and bridge improvements which\n            will contribute towards a satisfactory outcome for the\n            project as well as the completion of an impact evaluation study."}, "docdt": "2011-12-20T00:00:00Z"}
