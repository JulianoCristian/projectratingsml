Other lessons for\n            attention include the recognition that policy frameworks on\n            women's health and safe motherhood, and programs,\n            require careful technical preparation, and designs sensitive\n            to the local context; the need for an integrated planning,\n            financing, and management for services delivery related to\n            women's health; intensified interventions in family\n            planning based on information, education, and communication\n            support; intensified interventions in reproductive tract\n            infections, and sexually transmitted infections (STI), given\n            the potential link between STI and HIV infection; and, a\n            comprehensive review of training programs in women's health."}, "docdt": "2003-02-21T00:00:00Z"}
