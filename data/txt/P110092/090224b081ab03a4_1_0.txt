                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The Project’s implementation has continued to advance since the last supervision mission (September 2012), however progress on key procurement processes has not been as fast
                         as expected and important challenges remain for 2013. ENACAL and the Bank team have committed to work together to accelerate these procurement processes as soon as
                         possible.

                         The Project is scheduled to close in early 2014, and a possible extension of closing date will be discussed with the Bank, Enacal and the Ministry fo Finance as soon as key contracts
                         of the Project are formalized, in order have a precise clarity of the implementation time needed. In parallel to this time constraint, the Project also faces a budget restriction due to the
                         fact that certain procurement processes obtained much higher bids than the estimated costs. The Bank team reviewed the Project portfolio during the mission and, in order to

                         preserve funds for the most essential activities, agreed on the elimination of certain processes (namely, the strategic study for Managua Water Sources, supervision of works (which
                         will be directly carried out by Enacal, with support from specialized individual consultants) and sewerage works in Zona 7 were eliminated, along with minor goods purchases and
                         communications activities.

                         In terms of general Project implementation, as of January 2013, US$ 25.43 M had been disbursed and documented with the Bank, and the disbursement rate was of 59.85% for the
                         Grant and 68.74% for the Credit. The disbursements are expected to peak up as soon as key procurement processes are adjudicated.
