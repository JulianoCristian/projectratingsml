                         Implementation Status Overview
                         This ISR covers the period from November 2013 to May 2014 and reflects the results of the last supervision mission carried out in March, 2014.

                         The Project’s implementation has continued to advance smoothly since the September 2013 supervision mission, and significant progress has been made in the three key activities

                         remaining on the Project’s critical path: (i) the waste water treatment plant works in Ciudad Sandino, (ii) sewerage works in Bello Amanecer, and (iii) water efficiency works in the
                         Altamira and Asososca macrosectors. These processes have expected finalization dates between February and August 2014. In addition, the accompanying social work must remain
                         a focus in order to meet Project objectives, in particular regarding the increase of intra-domiciliary sewerage connections and cost recovery in Project areas. The processes remaining
                         to bid under the Project (around US$188,700) are minor processes that are expected to be simple from a procurement point of view.
