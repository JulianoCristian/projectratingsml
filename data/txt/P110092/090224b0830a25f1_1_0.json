for the Greater Managua Water\n            and Sanitation Project for Nicaragua were as follows:\n            outcomes were moderately satisfactory, the risk to\n            development outcome was substantial, the Bank performance\n            was moderately satisfactory, and the Borrower performance\n            was also moderately satisfactory. Some lessons learned\n            included: institutional change is a long-term process,\n            especially when the Bank is initiating or reinitiating a\n            relationship with a client. Before engaging effectively on\n            institutional modernization activities, the client and the\n            Bank task-team need to develop a level of trust in each\n            other. After confidence is established, projects can usually\n            move forward with more innovative, institutional focused\n            activities. Nevertheless, the process of appropriating best\n            practices oftentimes requires far more time than the life of\n            one project especially when the client has low institutional\n            capacity. As described in the risks to the development\n            outcome section, many of the good practices established\n            through PRASMA are still in the process of appropriation. A\n            method to reduce the risk that good practices will not\n            disappear with the close of the project and also to\n            implement effective institutional reforms is to engage new\n            or low-capacity clients in projects with implementation\n            periods that extend beyond five years. When carrying out WSS\n            infrastructure projects in very poor areas, some challenges,\n            including violence, theft of infrastructure as well as\n            building sustainability, can be amplified. Strong and\n            consistent social accompaniment that begins in the\n            pre-investment phase with community consultation on designs\n            and continues throughout implementation and after completion\n            is a key to minimizing these challenges as it increases\n            communities\u2019 sense of ownership, understanding of the\n            benefits, and commitment to the success of the project. To\n            build sustainability of the infrastructure, the social\n            accompaniment should be aligned with utilities\u2019 commercial\n            arms to improve collection rates and thus utilities\u2019\n            long-term commitment to maintaining quality service and\n            investing in poor communities."}, "docdt": "2015-08-17T03:54:00Z"}
