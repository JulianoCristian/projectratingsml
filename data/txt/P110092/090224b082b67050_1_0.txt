Project Development Objectives

 Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)
 The Project's Development Objective is to increase access to reliable* water and sanitation services to the population of the greater Managua
 region.   *Reliable water is defined as piped potable water with adequate pressure and continuity of at least 16 hours per day, 7 days per week.

Implementation Status and Key Decisions


 As of the second week of February the status of the activities highlighted in the previous ISR is as follows:
 (i) Sewerage works in Bello Amanecer: The construction of the condominial sewerage networks and collectors is finalized. ENACAL's team continues to
 be mobilized on site promoting household connections. As of December 31, 2014, the proportion of households that had connected their sanitary
 services to the new network was 70%, as per ENACAL’s on-site surveys. A group of local plumbers, trained as part of the Project, is active offering their
 services to residents to build the connections. ENACAL will continue to update the sewerage connectivity surveys until the ICR fact finding mission
 (April 2015).
 (ii) Wastewater treatment plant in Ciudad Sandino: ENACAL repaired the blockage in the collector that transports raw sewage to the plant. The
 contractor finalized the rehabilitation works on the original module. The flow delivered to the treatment modules is being progressively increased whilst
 ENACAL monitors the effluent quality to ensure formation of the biological mass needed by the process. ENACAL and the contractor are evaluating
 replacement and upgrade options of a fixed pre-treatment screen that is not performing in accordance with the design. Both parties are expected to
 reach an agreement on a solution within the next few days.
 (iii) Water efficiency works in the Altamira and Asososca macrosectors: ENACAL completed the most technically complex works: the installation of
 special high diameter fittings and valves to connect the newly constructed Las Pilas storage tank to the water network. Another storage tank, El
 Seminario, which was also financed as part of PRASMA, is already operational. With the completion of these works ENACAL is well on track to comply
 with the macrosector’s objective of delivering a better service to more than 60 neighborhoods in Managua.

         This indicator is a core one and it repeats with the first outcome "custom" indicator. The core indicator was added after the project had two
         years of implementation. The custom indicator was kept (although duplicating with the core one) since Project documents (PAD in
         particular) provide some clarification on the way this indicator should be measured in the context of this project, while the core indicator
         definition was not so precise.
