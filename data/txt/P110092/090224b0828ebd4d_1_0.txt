Implementation Status and Key Decisions

 Despite progress in the ongoing key infrastructure works of the project, ENACAL has to speed up the execution pace and put in place several
 managerial actions in order to close the Project satisfactorily: out of three key activities outstanding on the Project critical path, one is moving towards
 its completion smoothly (sewerage works in Bello Amanecer); a second one (the waste water treatment plant in Ciudad Sandino) is advancing at a
 good pace towards physical completion, but still presents challenges to start operating by the project’s closing date; and finally, the third critical activity
 (water efficiency works in the Altamira and Asososca macrosectors) is paralyzed due to financial constraints. ENACAL has worked to coordinate action
 plans with specifically assigned teams between its different departments in order to address these issues. In particular, ENACAL expressed that they
 will provide funding for a deficit of around US$400,000 recently identified under Component 2, and will do a close follow-up on the launch of the
 macrosectors and the reparation of the Ciudad Sandino collector that will convey the raw sewerage flow to the waste water treatment plant thus
 allowing its commissioning and operation before Project closure. In addition, the accompanying social work must remain a focus in order to meet
 Project objectives, in particular regarding the increase of intra-domiciliary sewerage connections and tariff collection in Project areas. The processes
 remaining to bid under the Project are minor individual consultancies that are expected to be simple from a procurement point of view.
 In terms of general Project implementation, as of November 2014, US$ 37.3 M had been disbursed and documented with the Bank, and the
 disbursement rate was of 98.55% for the Grant and 99.3% for the Credit. To date, the committed funds total US$1.1M, and the funds not yet committed
 or still in the bidding process total only US$0.36M.
