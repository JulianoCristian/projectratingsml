                         The Project's Development Objective is to increase access to reliable* water and sanitation services to the population of the greater Managua region.

                         *Reliable water is defined as piped potable water with adequate pressure and continuity of at least 16 hours per day, 7 days per week.

                         This ISR covers the period from March to October 2013 and reflects the results of the last supervision mission carried out in September, 2013.

                         The Project’s implementation has continued to advance since the January 2013 supervision mission , and significant progress has been made with the contracting of the three key

                         procurement processes remaining on the Project’s critical path: ((i) the waste water treatment plant works in Ciudad Sandino, (ii) sewerage works in Bello Amanecer, and (iii) water
                         efficiency works in the Altamira and Asososca macrosectors, which have a combined value of approximately US$12M). These processes have all been contracted, with expected
                         finalization dates between February and August 2014. The remaining processes remaining to bid under the Project (around US$800,000) are minor processes that are expected to be
                         simple from a procurement point of view.

                         The Project is scheduled to close in February 2014, and a possible 12-month extension of closing date is being discussed with the Bank, Enacal and the Ministry of Finance. This
                         would allow the orderly conclusion of the three important processes mentioned above, and would also enable ENACAL to continue having the Bank’s technical assistance on the non-
                         revenue water, commercial management activities among other institutional strengthening activities. The restructuring request, which is expected to be received from the Ministry of
                         Finance in the next weeks, should also include several other modifications, including a reallocation of funds amongst disbursement categories, a minor revision to the project
                         description, and revision of certain results indicators and targets. Additionally, the Bank team reviewed the Project portfolio during the mission and detected the possible availability of
                         an additional US$1.3M due to exchange rate fluctuations, which will be taken into account in the planned restructuring and for which ENACAL has developed an implementation plan.

                         In terms of general Project implementation, as of October 2013, US$ 31.45 M had been disbursed and documented with the Bank, and the disbursement rate was of 74% for the
                         Grant and 78% for the Credit. To date, the committed funds total US$38.16M, and the funds not yet committed or still in the bidding process total only US$0.78M. This reflects
                         important progress throughout 2013.
