                         THE REPUBLICOFCROATIA

              SECONDPROGRAMMATICADJUSTMENT LOAN


                               PROGRAMSUMMARY

Borrower:       The Republic o f Croatia
Amount:         EUR15O million (US$197.4 million equivalent) to be withdrawn intwo tranches,
                EURlOOmillionfirst tranche and E m 5 0 million second tranche

Terms:          fixed spread LIBOR-based loan, commitment link, level repayments payable in
                fifteen years including a five-year grace period
Description:    The proposed loan is the second inthe series of three Programmatic Adjustment
                Loans (PAL), which aim to support enhanced economic growth through: (i)
                improving the investment climate, and (ii)reducing the size and improving
                efficiency o f the public sector. Fulfillment o f EU accession criteria and
                successful EU integration call for intensive structural and institutional reforms,
                and the PAL series supports the Government inthat effort.

                PAL specifically supports:

                       Improvements in the investment climate by completion o f the privatization
                       or liquidation o f state-owned enterprises, improving financial discipline
                       o f enterprises, reducing the cost o f doing business, and strengthening the
                       judiciary.

                       Efforts to improve governance by rationalizing and improving efficiency
                       o f public administration, and improvingpublic expenditure management.

                       Measures to enhance fiscal sustainability of sector programs by
                       addressing health financing, rationalizing social benefits, improving fiscal
                       and social sustainability o f the pension system, and fiscal sustainability o f
                       railways operations.

Benefits:       The PAL series helps the Government implement a medium-term reform
                program to achieve its goals o f enhanced economic growth and progress towards
                EU accession. The reforms supported are part o f EU accession requirements,
                and o f the Government's Strategic Development Framework and Pre-Accession
                Economic Program. They aim to strengthen the public sector's capacity to carry
                out its role more effectively, and provide an enabling environment for private
                sector growth.
Risks:          Several risks attend the reformprogram under PAL:
                       Political risks remain highas the country has a coalition Government with
                       a mere one seat majority in Parliament, and several proposed reforms are
                       ambitious and politically challenging. Also, the next Parliamentary

                       elections are scheduled for November 2007, and the country i s entering a
                       pre-election period, which raises a risk o f contemplation and adoption o f
                       fiscally unsustainable policies and investments. However, reforms to be
                       supported under PAL are consistent with the EUaccession agenda, whch
                       i s expected to somewhat mitigate the risk. Further, to mitigate the risk o f
                       other policy reversals during the 2007 pre-election period after the PAL2
                       Board, the whole Bank program inCroatia has been put on the line: ifthe
                       PAL supported reforms will be reversed in 2007, the Bank program will
                       immediately move to the low case scenario with further lendingcurtailed.


                    0  Capacity weaknesses could impede implementation o f proposed reforms.
                       Capacity i s uneven and limited in several ministries, which may hinder
                       the reform effort. However, investment projects that complement PAL
                       and technical assistance by other donors are designed to mitigate some o f

                       External shocks that have adverse effects on regional stability or access to
                       finance could seriously harm the reform effort. Given Croatia's heavy
                       reliance on tourism revenues and exports to Europe, it i s vulnerable to any
                       deterioration in regional stability or EU growth slowdown. However,
                       PAL supportedreforms to improve the investment climate are expected to
                       mitigate the riskthrough diversification o f economic activities.

                       Given the high degree o f euroization o f the Croatian economy, the
                       Croatian financial sector remains vulnerable to exchange rate risks. The
                       Croatian National Bank has, however, taken several measures to control
                       the risk by discouraging foreign borrowing by banks, monitoring foreign
                       exchange exposures of bank clients and strengthening supervision both o f

                                       I. INTRODUCTION

1.      This Program Document presents the Second Programmatic Adjustment Loan (PAL2) to the
Republic o f Croatia in the amount o f EUR15O million (US$197.4 million equivalent). The proposed
operation builds on the first PAL (PALl), and it continues to be the centerpiece o f Bank's assistance to
Croatia.

2.     'The Government hasmade satisfactory progress inimplementing the PALprogram and all PAL2
prior actions have been fully met. The reform program supported by PAL2 aims to enhance economic
growth in Croatia through: (i)improving the investment climate; and (ii)reducing the size and
improving efficiency o f the public sector. The Croatian Government i s aspiring to join the European
Union (EU), and fulfillment o f EU accession criteria and successful EU integration call for intensive
structural and institutional reforms across sectors. The proposed PAL2 supports the Government in
these efforts.

3.      The proposed reformprogram has been developedjointly with the Government, and incorporated
inCroatia's Strategic Development FrameworkandPre-Accession Economic Program, whichlayout the
country's comprehensive economic policy. The program has been coordinated with other development
partners, in particular with the European Commission (EC) to ensure consistency with EU accession
requirements, and the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Several other partners (SIDA, USAID,
UNDP, DflD)have financed technical assistancerequiredfor the implementation o f reforms.

                11.      RECENT POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS

                                  A.     Recent PoliticalDevelopments

4.      The center-right Croatian Democratic Union party (HDZ) returned to power in 2003, and a new
coalition Government was formed. The new Government reaffirmed Croatia's European orientation,
aiming to make EU accession a reality. Croatia's achievements under the Partnership for Peace process
inthe past couple ofyears are at the same time aiding the country's quest to gain an invitation to NATO
membershipin2008.

5.      InOctober 2005, Croatia opened EU accession negotiations. Preceding that, in June 2004, the
European Council granted Croatia a candidate status and endorsed the EU Accession Negotiation
Framework, but delayed the opening o f accession negotiationsuntilsome pre-conditions were met. The
first phase o f negotiations-the  screening process-was   finished in October 2006, and two out of the 33
chapters o f the accession treaty were provisionally closed. For another four chapters closingbenchmarks
were set. The key economic issues that the Government would need to resolve prior to potential EU
accession are consistent enforcement o f market competition and state aid rules, increasing efficiency o f
public administration, stepping up anti-corruptionmeasures, andjudiciary reform.

6.      The next Parliamentary elections are scheduled for November 2007.            Pressures for fiscal
relaxation are expected duringthe pre-election period.

                                  B.      Recent Economic Developments

 7.      Benefiting from successful economic transformation after independence and the start o f EU
 accession negotiations, economic activity has been robust in the past few years. Inflation has been
 modest despite increased oil and commodity prices, helped by central bank policy to maintain exchange
 rate stability. The adverse terms o f trade shock has, however, contributed to the widening o f the current
 account deficit, even though fiscal policy has tightened since 2003.

 8.      Growth recovered in 2005, and continued to be strong in 2006. Real GDP growth, after
 moderating in2004 accelerated to 4.3 percent in2005 and 4.8 percent in2006 (see Figure 3). Growth i s
 projected to slightly slowdown to 4.5 percent in
 2007. Inflation has remained low at 3.2 percent,            Figure 1: Catching Up with the EU, GDP

 percentage point increase from 2005), followed by
 household consumption (contributing with 2.1
 percentage points       of GDP).        Government
 consumption increased somewhat in 2006 as well,                           2000             2004           2006

 remained low.       Compared to 2005, exports of
 goods and services grew at a faster pace in 2006,           Source: Eurostat
 but the growth of imports also accelerated to 7.3
 percent and exceededthe export growth.

 9.      Fiscal consolidation has takenplace. Fiscal
 policy has tightened in the past few years to arrest          Figure 2: Comparison of Fiscal Deficits,
 the growth o f public debt: the fiscal deficit declined       percent of GDP
 from 6.3 percent in2003 to 3.9 percent in2005. The
 2006 general government deficit was 3.1 percent o f
 GDP,' excluding the deficit of HBOR and the
 additional one percent o f GDP allocated for
 repayment o f pensioners' debt, which has been
 financed      by    privatization   receipts.*   While
 noteworthy, this i s still above a sustainable level by         - 6 1     I                                       II

 ratio was at 49.6 percent at end 2006.                        Source:Eurostat, CroatianMinistryof Finance



 10.     Further fiscal consolidation is still required
 because the scope for increasing tax revenues i s limited, and relying on privatization receipts to finance
 deficits i s not a viable medium-term strategy, since they are expected to decline after Telecom IPOs.
 The overall tax burden in Croatia is high compared to most EU countries: Croatia taxes directly and

* These two items would add 1.Ipercent of GDP to the deficit and expenditure levels.

indirectly 39 percent o f its gross value added.4 However, without cuts in public spending, tax reduction
i s not feasible. Accordingly, the government i s pursuing further fiscal consolidation and targeting a
fiscal deficit o f 2.8 percent of GDP in2007.

11.     After coolingdown in 2003-2004, domestic credit expansion haspicked up again, driven by the
shvt in thegovernment borrowingtowards the domestic market. Domestic credit growth at 20 percent
in 2005 was eight percentage points higher than monetary authorities' target. Loans to government and
households rose by 44.1 percent and 20.2 percent, respectively. Since a major share o f deposits is held
in foreign currency, the financial sector remains vulnerable to exchange rate shocks. The Croatian
National Bank (CNB) has taken several measures to discourage foreign borrowingby banks and monitor
foreign exchange exposures o f the banks' clients, including the increase o f the marginal reserve
requirement on new bank borrowing from abroad to 55 percent; increasing risk weights on un-hedged
foreign-currency denominated and indexed loans; introducing quarterly reporting requirements for such
loans; issuing new guidelines to banks on managing household and currency-induced credit risk,
including a 75 percent loan-to-value ratio for mortgage loans; high risk weights for loans not checked
against the credit bureau; and broadeningthe base of the foreign-exchange liquidity requirement to cover
instruments indexedin foreign currency. To prevent banks from resorting to issuance o f securities, CNB
introduced in January 2006 a special interest-free 55 percent reserve requirement on commercial banks'
liabilities arising from issued securities (see also Box 1 below). In addition in 2007, CNB i s aiming to
limit credit growth to 12 percent through a mandatory purchase of CNB notes by banks, whose credit
growth exceeds the 12 percent limit.


                                   Box 1: RelativelySound BankingSystem
   The latest Bank-Fund Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) was completed in October 2002, and the
   authorities have implemented most of its recommendations. An FSAP-update is being discussed between the
   Government, IMF, andthe World Bank.
   The Croatian banking system, despite its rapid expansion, is relatively sound. Since 1996, the system has
  undergone major consolidation, and banking regulation and supervision have been improved and idly
  harmonizedwith the EU. By 2002, most banks were privatized. Foreignownership is widespread, with foreign
  banks accountingfor 91 percent of bank assets. Only two banks (including the postalbank) remainstate-owned.
   Minimum capital adequacy is 10 percent, and banks are reportedto be well capitalized (at 12.9 percent). The
   average interest margin is declining, and was below 4 percent in2006. Credit is relatively high at 68 percent of
   GDP in2006, with more than 75 percent going to the private sector. At the end 2006, non-performingloans had
   declinedto 3.5 percent of total loans. The share of foreign exchange loans (including loans indexedto foreign
   exchange) in total loans has declined from 80 percent in 2003 to 71.7 percent at end 2006. Overall, there is a
  relatively high level o fdepth andresourcemobilization.
   The central bank is independent, which was further strengthened in 2006 by the adoption of a new CNB Act
   consistent with EU requirements. The Base1 Core Principles are also consistently adhered to. A deposit
   insurance scheme i s in place, and prudential requirements are consistent with consolidated supervision
  requirements. While the CroatianNational Bank is responsible for the regulationand supervisionofthe banking
   sector, the 2005 law on the integrated supervisionof non-bank financial institutionsestablished a new regulator
   (HANFA) for the supervision of securities exchange, insurance companies, investment and pension funds, and
   leasing companies. A Memorandumof Understandingbetween the two supervisors was signed in September
   2006, andthejoint supervision ofmost financial conglomerates has started.




The average tax burdenfor the ten new EU member states was 30 percent of GDP in2005.

12.     Thesedomesticpolicy measures have not been sufficient to curtail the external current account
deficit. The current account deficit increasedto 6.6 percent of GDP in 2005 from 5.2 percent in 2004,
and continued to grow to 7 percent of GDP in 2006, despite strong growth in exports of goods
(excluding ships) and services. The trade deficit widened by 11.3 percent compared to 2004. The debt
generating current account deficit (current account deficit plus net FDI) remained moderate at 2.7
percent of GDP in2005 and turned to surplus of 0.4 percent of GDP. FDIinflows stood at 5.1 percent of
GDP in 2005, which was double the 2004 level, and increasedto USD3.3 billion or 7.8 percent of GDP

in 2006. FDIfinancing is projectedto continue strong in2007, given the upcoming Telecom P O and
the planned sale o frest of the companies inthe Croatian Privatization Fundportfolio.

13.     External debt has been broadly stabilized, but external vulnerabilities remain. Gross external
debt (inEUR) stood at 84.7 percent of GDP in2006, up from 79.4 percent at end 2004, owing to strong
capital inflows to domestic banks. InUSD terms, the external debt-to-GDP ratio declined by about nine
percentage points o f GDP to 78.5 percent in 2005, but rose to above 89.0 percent o f GDP by end 2006.
In 2005, in order to reduce foreign indebtedness, the Government shifted from foreign to domestic
sources of finance, but since domestic banks are re-lendingloans from foreign mother banks, the public
sector borrowing requirement has continuedto indirectly contribute to the external debt growth.

14.     Continued external vulnerability poses a risk to macroeconomic stability and leaves the
Government with little room to maneuver in the event of shocks. Given the highdegree o f euroization
o f the Croatian economy, external shocks could potentially cause substantial damage. Hence, further
fiscal consolidation and reduction of external debt remains critical to reducing Croatia's macroeconomic
vulnerability over the medium term. As will be discussed later, the PAL series i s aiming to mitigate
these macroeconomic risks by supporting structural reforms facilitating further fiscal consolidation and
promoting private sector activity.

15.     The Government's macroeconomicframework for 2007 is broadly satisfactory. As mentioned
earlier, the authorities are targeting only slight further fiscal consolidation during the election year, with
a fiscal deficit target o f 2.8 percent of GDP. More ambitious further fiscal consolidation i s expected in
2008.

In 2006, Croatia climbed up 13 positions to the
51st place on the global competitiveness ladder o f the 125 countries rated by the World Economic
Forum. Also, the 2006 Cost o f Doing Business assessment indicates improvements in the overall
business climate andranks Croatia up by 10positions. Over time, the reforms taken inthe past couple o f
years can also be expected to increase the share of the private sector in the economy. The regulatory
framework governing the private sector remains cumbersome nonetheless, and the judicial system
inefficient as property rights are weak compared to OECD countries. To facilitate further expansion of
the private sector, strengthening of the investmentclimate is required. Further reforms to streamline the
regulatoryregime governing the private sector, and strengthen thejudicial system are already underway.

                                             E.       Poverty

19.    Low and stagnant poverty. The poverty analysis conducted in 20065 indicates that poverty in
Croatia i s relatively low and shallow, but has not changed since the last poverty assessment in the late
1990s. Four percent of the population live on less than USD4.30 a day (at purchasingpower parity), and
about 11 percent live on about USDlO a day, which the study suggests i s an absolute poverty line for
Croatia. Another ten percent o f the population i s at risk o f poverty, as their average consumption i s less
than 25 percent above the poverty line. About one percent o f the population faces severe deprivation.
The poverty gap is about 2.6 percent. The report estimated that to lift all poor out of poverty with
perfect targeting of assistance would cost only about 0.7 percent o f GDP. At the same time, total social
benefitspendingwas at 3.8 percent in2006 inCroatia, of which only 0.26 percent of GDP was spent on
means-tested poverty benefits. The results also showed that there are no significant differences in the
prevalence o f poverty by gender. Income inequality measured by the Gini coefficient was 0.25 in2004,
which i s on par with the average o f advanced transition countries. Household size, education, age, and
employment status of the householdhead are important correlates o f poverty.




The analysiswas basedon the 2002-2004householdbudgetsurveys.


                                                    6

20.      Relatively high unemployment. At only 55 percent6,Croatia's employment rate was in2005 one
o f the lowest inEurope, and the proportion o f long-term unemployed (that is, workers without jobs for
 12 months or longer) is higher than in all EU countries except Poland and Slovakia.                     The low
employment rate i s a reflection o f a relatively low labor force participation rate among the worlung age
population (63.2 percent), and relatively high unemployment rate (about 13 percent, using the ILO
definition o f unemployment). The job creation rate' in Croatia i s 3.5 percent, which i s low compared to
about ten percent inLithuania and seven percent inBulgaria. Furthermore, women and youth face clear
disadvantages inthe labor market. Women have higher unemployment rates and lower wages than male
labor market participants. Employment rates among youth and average earnings are particularly low-
 fewer than one in four people aged 15-25 years have jobs, and the unemployment rate for this age group
 i s three times that of the age group 25-50.

 21.      Looking ahead, the task o f faster external income convergence with the EU will be challenging,
 and will require both faster job creation and flexibility in the allocation o f jobs and workers in the
 economy.8 This further underscores the need to strengthen the enabling environment for private sector
 growth. This will also help improve living conditions inlagging regions.

                                F.       Statusof the IMFPrograminCroatia

22.       The Stand-by Arrangement (SBA) with the IMF for Croatia has been successfully completed, and
the Government does not intend to request a successor arrangement. The first and second reviews
experienced delays, and the third review was concluded on September 29, 2006. The objective of SBA
was to reduce external vulnerabilities by narrowing the domestic saving-investment gap and stabilizing
the external debt-to-GDP ratio. This was to be done through fiscal and quasi-fiscal adjustment during
2004-06.     Although, all end-September quantitative performance criteria, except the one for the general
government arrears, were met for the thirdreview and fiscal consolidation has taken place, the reduction
o f external debt, which was the ultimate goal o f the program, has remained elusive, though the level of
external debt seemto have broadly stabilized.

                        111.     GOVERNMENT'SDEVELOPMENTPRIORITIES

 23.      InAugust 2006, the Government adopted a Strategic Development Framework (SDF) for 2006-
 2013. According to SDF, the goal of the Government i s to achieve social prosperity through growth and
 employment in a competitive market economy, acting within a modern Europeanwelfare state. The aim
 i s to increase the average GDP growth rate to six percent by 2013, in order to facilitate convergence to
 the average EU25 income per capita at PPP.'             To achieve this goal, the Government plans to: (i)
 complete the unfinished transition process, which includes redefining the role o f the state, completing
privatization and restructuringprocesses, and improving investmentclimate; (ii)           develop infrastructure,
 including ICT, improving education outcomes, R&D linkages to the business sector, increasing
 flexibility o f labor markets, and strengthening social cohesion; and (iii)sustain and promote
 macroeconomic stability, environment and regional development, and integrated financial services.

  Labor market reforms are not part o f the PAL program, since a series of labor market reforms were supported
underthe previous Structural Adjustment Loan(SAL) and it was important to see the impact ofthose reforms before
proceeding with new ones.

               IV.     WORLD BANKGROUP STRATEGYAND PROPOSEDPAL

                                          A.       Linkto CAS

24.     The Bank Group's Croatia Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for 2004/05-2007/08 was
presented to the Board in December 2004 (Report No. 30717-HR). The goal of the CAS is to support
Croatia's efforts to: (i)improve macroeconomic stability through greater efficiency/effectiveness o f
public expenditure; (ii) promote private sector-led growth; (iii)  enhance broad participation in growth;
and (iv) promote sustainable natural resource management.

25.     The series o f Programmatic Adjustment Loans (PAL) i s the centerpiece o f CAS. Successful EU
integration calls for governments to launch intensive structural and institutional reforms across sectors.
The Bank has found that the most effective tool for supporting this ambitious effort, especially in EU
accession countries, i s with a comparable instrument, such as PAL, which supports key structural and
institutional reforms across a range o f sectors. A PAL type instrumentcan provide a vehicle for inter-
ministerial collaboration around a clear policy reform agenda with clear outcomes, performance
benchmarks, and monitorable indicators against which to assess progress during implementation, thus
sendingclear andpredictable signals to the international community.

26.     To maximize the impact o f the PAL series, the Bank has complemented it by investment loans,
and analytical and advisory services in Croatia. These activities focus on social protection, education,
and health sector reforms, and revitalization o f war-affected areas.

                            B.      AnalyticUnderpinnings ofthe Program

27.     The PAL series is based on a series of economic and sector work on Croatia. This includes the
following analysis:

28.     Country Economic Memorandum: PAL i s partly based on the results o f the Croatia Country
Economic Memorandum (CEM) completed in July 2003. CEM analyzed reforms and economic policy
options to promote sustainable growth, while ensuringthat Croatia complies with the requirements of the
Stabilization and Association Agreement for EU integration. The report has guided the overall PAL
reform framework and prioritization. However, to avoid overload and ensure effectiveness, PAL
supports only a subset o f CEM recommendations.

29.     Public expenditure management: In addition to the CEM analysis, preparation o f the public
expenditure management component has been guided by the findings o f the Public Expenditure and
Institutional Review o f 2001, and an assessment of Croatian Government's debt management practices
in the context of the Joint BanWund Program on Central Government Debt Management and Debt
Market Development. A new Public Finance Reviewwas completed inspring2007.

30.     Financial management and public procurement: A Country Financial Accountability
Assessment (CFAA) and Country Procurement Assessment Report (CPAR) were carried out in 2004-
2005. Key issues emerging from CFAA and CPAR have beenreflected inthe program.

31.     Private sector development: The component focusing on investment climate has utilized the
results o f (i) FIAS studies on administrative barriers to foreign investment; (ii)Cost of Doing
               the
Business assessments; and (iii)  a real sector study on Croatia. Further,an assessment o f Government's
export and SMEpromotion programs has been carried out.




                                                   8

32.    Health: The proposed component on health financing i s underpinned by analytic work on health
financing. The Croatia Health Financing Study, which was completed in June 2003, analyzed the
current financing o f the sector and made recommendationsfor reform.

33.    Pension: Informalanalytic work on the pension sector, utilizing social insurance modeling tools,
has beenongoing and guidingthe design o f the pension component.

34.    Poverty and living standards analysis: A new poverty and living standards assessment was
carried out in Croatia in 2006. The results o f the assessment have influenced the reform program on
socialbenefits andhealth financing.

35.    Poverty and social impact assessment: A social impact assessment o f shipyard restructuring
plans proposed by shipyard management was conducted on two shipyards (Brodotrogir and Kraljevica)
in2006, and the results are expected to feed into the Government's preparation ofthe national shipyard
restructuring plan and the accompanying social impact mitigationplan.

36.    Enterprise subsidies: An inventory of enterprise subsidies was carried out in 2004-2005, and
guided the preparationof the enterprise subsidy reduction plan.

37.    Railways: A framework paper for proposedrailways reforms was preparedby the Bank inApril
2004, and it had guided the work on the railways component. In addition, the Bank commissioned a
study onrestructuring o fCroatianrailways in2005, which has also shapedthe railwayreformdialogue.

38.    Policy Notes: Inthe past couple o f years, the Bank has also prepared a series o f policy notes as
the work on PALhasmovedforward to guide the design ofreforms inselect areas. This includespolicy
notes on local government pay and employment, fiscal decentralization, the use of environmental audits
inthe privatizationprocess, andbenchmarkingofCroatian shipyards.

39.     Workshops: To share lessons learned from other countries, in particular from EU, a series of
workshops has been organized inZagreb on topics o f interest to the Government in the past two years.
For example, workshops on public administration, judicial reform, fiduciary systems, health financing,
education, landregistration, fiscal decentralization, and investmentclimate have beenheld.

                            C.       LessonsLearnedfrom Prior Operations

40.    Country Assistance Evaluation: OED conducted an evaluation o f Bank assistance to Croatia in
1991-2003. The report rated the effectiveness o f Bank's assistance mixed, with overall outcome o f the
Bank assistanceprogram having improved since FYOl.

41.    The report emphasizes that adjustment and assistance programs should not be pursued when the
Government is unconvinced of the need for reform. It points out that large infrastructure project are not
necessarily beneficial in the absence o f related policy reforms. The report also stresses the need to: (i)
closely supervise operations; and (ii) ready to modify or cancel them if necessary, rather than allow
                                       be
faulty implementation to proceed. The following areas were highlighted as priorities for future Bank
assistance:

           rationalization and retargeting o f public expenditure in line with public revenues to contain
           debt;

           improving growth by ensuring that privatization of state-owned enterprises, or re-
           privatization o f failed enterprises which are reverting to Government ownership, is
           successful, and for example not favoring insiderbuy-outs; and

            improvingcore functions of government, public administration, and thejudicial sector.

42.    Implementation Completion Report of SAL: An Implementation Completion Report (ICR) on
SAL was completed in the spring 2004. The ICR provides an overall positive assessment of the
operation, and commends its focus.      S A L focused only on three major areas (fiscal consolidation,
improving the business climate, and improving labor market flexibility), instead o f attempting to cover
all major sectors. The report highlightedjudicial reformas the priority for Bank's future assistance.

                       D.      CoordinationwithOtherDevelopment Partners

43.     Coordination with I M F : IMF i s concentrating on macroeconomic issues in Croatia, focusing
specifically on short- and medium-term macroeconomic stability, and measures to reduce external debt.
The Bank has been coordinating activities with the IMF staff In general, structural benchmarks have
been covered by PAL, though the structural component o f the recently expired SBA focused on debt and
public expenditure management and on select issues, where joint Bank-IMF effort was considered
desirable.

44.     Coordination with EC: The PAL series i s coordinated with EC that welcomes the PAL support
for EUaccession related reforms. Inparticular inthe areas o f public administration, public expenditure
management, environment, andjudicial reform the Bank and EC activities are closely coordinated. The
Bank i s also working closely with EC to identify opportunities for accessing EU grant funds for
technical assistance and other financing relevant to PAL-supported institutional capacity building.

45.     Partnership with Other Multilateral and Bilateral Development Parners: P A L is also closely
coordinated with other donors to Croatia, in particular USAID, UNDP, Netherlands, SIDA, DfID, and
EBRD. For example, SIDA has provided a sizeable trust fundto finance technical assistanceinthe area
o f public administration; DfID as well has been supporting public administration reform; and UNDP has
financed the development o f the social impact assessment methodology. The work on privatization has
been carefully coordinated with USAID, which has funded assessments o f two draft shipyard
restructuring plans. Ingeneral, in a number o f areas, Bank and other donors are carefully dividing the
work to ensure complementarity o f actions and to reap synergies.

                               E.      Consultationswith Stakeholders

46.     At the start of the PAL series, consultations with various Croatian stakeholders-government,
private sector, trade unions, NGOs, other development partners-were        conducted to identify the key
reform areas. As the implementation of the program has proceeded, a series o f consultation have been
carried out inparticular with trade unions to explain and fine-tune the proposedmeasures to mitigate the
social impacts.
                       V.       THE PROPOSEDPALREFORMPROGRAM

                                      A.      Objectives ofPAL

47.     The objective of the PAL series is to enhance economic growth in Croatia through (i)   improving
the investment climate, and (ii)  reducing the size o f and improving the efficiency o f the public sector.
This requires fiscal adjustment and consolidation, which is a theme running through the proposed
operation. The PAL series i s designed to specifically mitigate Croatia's external macroeconomic
vulnerabilities discussed earlier. The series also supports the Government in its EU accession and
integration efforts, and helps ensure that key economic reforms under the acquis are effectively
implemented and enforced.

                                            B.       Overview of PAL

 49.     Reform ureus: The reform program supported by the PAL series i s built on three pillars: (i)
 improving investment climate; (ii)      strengthening governance; and (iii)    enhancing fiscal sustainability o f
 sector programs. Table 1 summarizes the pillars, and reform areas and actions covered under each o f
 them. The specific reforms to be supported in each area are detailed in the Government's Letter of
 Development Policy (see Schedule I)and the PALpolicy matrix (see Schedule 2), which focus on actions
 that are critical for the reform process and achievement o f the set outcome goals; and which the
 Government would have difficulties moving forward without external support.

 50.      The program i s in line with Croatia's Strategic Development Framework and Pre-Accession
 Economic Program, and there is a broad ownership o f the program at the highest level o f Government.
 Some o f the reforms supported, such as privatization and enterprise state aid reduction, aim to complete
 Croatia's transition to a well-functioning market economy, which i s one o f Government's stated goals.
 The other reforms further Croatia's EU accession objective. The sections to follow will discuss each
 pillar andreform area inmore detail, and are intendedto be read together with the policy matrix.

 51.     Expected overall PAL outcomes: The following overall outcomes are expected as a result o f the

I'It is important to note that the above outcome targets are stretch goals. They should not be used rigidly and in
isolation as guideposts to measure the results o f the program, since factors beyond the control o f P A L will also
affect their achievement. How each reform area is projected to contribute to fiscal consolidation is reflected inthe
expected results o f each program component. While the projected fiscal impact o f some reforms can be quantified,
for some reforms-such     as judicial, public expenditure management, and administrative and regulatory reforms-
that is not feasible. Also reforms such as privatization and railways restructuring contribute to fiscal consolidation
primarilythrough reduced state aid levels.

 52.     The Government has made satisfactory progress inimplementingthe PAL program and all PAL2
 prior actions for the first tranche have been completed. A second floating tranche was introduced to
 PAL2 at the request o f the Croatian authorities to give them further time to complete three PAL2 actions,
 which could not be completed by end April 2007 but were considered important for the program goals.
 These actions are as follows: (i)        complete the sale of three HZ subsidiaries; (ii) majority shares in
                                                                                                  sell
 one shipyard; and (iii) the new Civil Service Salary Law and a new job classification system.
                               enact
 Postponingthe PAL2 Boardwas not an option, since the Croatian Parliament will be inrecess after July
 15, 2007 for the fall owing to forthcoming Parliamentary elections scheduled for November 2007. The
 three second trance actions are expected to be completed in 2007: three HZ subsidiaries sold and two
 further subsidiaries tendered; the new Civil Service Salary Law and job classification system enacted;
 and the majority shares ina shipyard sold.

 53.     PAL2 has intotal 11prior actions-eight for the first tranche and three for the second tranche-
 compared to the nine actions anticipated in the P A L l Board documentation. The introduction o f the
 second tranche explains the slightly increased number. Table 2 lists the anticipated PAL2 prior actions12
 in PALl Board documentation and final PAL2 prior actions. The anticipated actions have remained
 essentially unchanged, except for some rewording and refocusing o f the public administration prior

                                                              12

action, expansion o f the prior action on privatization to cover the sale o f three major loss-makers, and
adjustment of the prior action on health financing. The new Health Insurance Act enacted fell short of
the initial goal. Hence, to achieve the goal, Croatian authorities took a series of further actions agreed
half a year prior to appraisal with an overall revenuehavings target, which are listed as part of the final
actual PAL2 prior action. All these actions have been completed.

 Box 2. Applicationof Good PracticePrincipleson ConditionalityinPAL
 Principle 1: Reinforce Ownership
 The PAL supported reform program is inline with the Government's Strategic Development Framework and the
 Pre-AccessionEconomic Program, which lay out Croatia's comprehensive economic policy. The latter document
 refers several times to P A L as the vehicle under which select reforms are to be carried out.

 Principle 2: Agree upfront with thegovernment and otherfinancial partners on a coordinated accountability
 framework
 At the start of the PAL series, a policy matrix outlining actions over the medium-term with clear and measurable
 overall and component specific outcome goals was developed jointly with the Croatian government, and
 thereafter jointly adjusted as the program has evolved. The reform program was also coordinated with other
 development partners (EC, IMF, EBRD, USAID, SIDA, UNDP, DfID, Netherlands), and a number o f them
 (SIDA, UNDP, USAID, DfID) have financed some o fthe required technical assistance.
 Principle 3:      Customize the accountability framework and modalities of Bank support to country
 circumstances
 The reform program is based on and part o f Government's strategies and programs. I t reflects the intensive
 structural and institutional reforms needed across sectors for successful EU integration, and to complete the
 country's transition to a well-functioning market economy. A t the start o f each operation in the series, the
 Council o f Ministers has reviewed and endorsed the reform program. Further, the program focuses on outcome-
 oriented actions, since that i s the best way to calibrate the series o f reforms that are necessary to achieve program
 objectives.

 Principle4: Chooseonly actions criticalfor achieving results as conditionsfor disbursement
 The PAL program focuses on actions that are critical in terms o f achieving the set outcome goals, and the
 Government would have difficulties moving forward without external support. The number of prior actions has
 beenlimitedto six for PALl, and eight for the first tranche and three for the second tranche o fPAL2.
 Principle 5: Conduct transparentprogress reviews conducivetopredictable and performance-based financial
 support
 Progress made with the implementation o f reforms and achievement o f outcome goals is monitored on a regular
 basis: a progress matrix, which outlines the status o f reforms and outcome indicators, i s updated periodically and
 circulated among ministries and agencies.

                     D.      OverallProgress Achieving Outcome Goals since PAL1

 54.    Progress towards overall PAL outcome goals: Croatia has made progress towards the three
 outcome goals as follows:

             General government expenditure has been reduced from 51.3 percent o f GDP in2003 to 48.4
             percent in 2006. The fiscal deficit has declined from 6.4 percent o f GDP in 2003 to 3.1
             percent o f GDP in2006.

             The DoingBusiness 2006 report indicates an improvement inthe investment climate.

             According to EBRD reports, the private sector share in GDP has remained at 60 percent in
             2005. This may be due to lack o f a private sector response to the improved investment
             climate, but also reflect the fact that the impact o f some reforms i s likely to be seen only with
             a lag. Indeed, some other indicators (such as private investment and private sector
             employment) suggest that the private sector has started to respond. National accounts data
             suggests that the private sector share inGDProse to 69 percent in2006.

 55.    Inlight ofthe overall outcome goals being stretch goals, the reductionintotal public spendingby
 about 3 percentage points o f GDP and the over 3 percentage points o f GDP decline in the fiscal deficit
 are notable. However, from the macroeconomic point o f view, further fiscal consolidation i s still
 requiredandthe authorities are targeting a fiscal deficit o f2.8 percent o f GDP in2007 and 2.6 percent in
 2008 and a reduction in total public spending to 47.7 percent o f GDP in2007 and further to 46.7 percent
 in2008.

 56.    Progress towards sector/area outcome goals: In each o f the program's sub-components, the
 authorities have made steady progress towards the sectodarea specific outcome goals. Insome areas, the
 set stretch goals for the end o f the program (that is, at the end of PAL3) have already been achieved or
 are close to beingmet. Since many reforms supported by PAL are politically sensitive, progress made i s
 noteworthy. Examples o f the progress since the launch o f the PAL series are as follows:

              State shares sold or liquidated in 841 companies;
              Enterprise subsidies reduced as plannedby over one percentage point o f GDP;
              The court case backlog reducedby 30 percent, and indicators ofjudicial performance show
              improvement;
              The public sector wage bill reduced by about one percentage point o f GDP, legislation
              governing the civil service modernized, and including clauses to depoliticize state
              administrationafter the upcoming parliamentary elections;
             Total public health spending reduced by close to 1.5 percentage points o f GDP, though the
              health sector arrearsremain ~ignificant;'~

             Pension spendingon a steady downward trend;
             The working ratio of Croatian railways down by over 50 percentage points, and state aid to
              railways decreasedby 0.7 percentage points o f GDP.




13Since Croatia follows accrual accounting, actual spending includes the arrears.


                                                        16

57.     At the same time, however, there is a significant risk that some of the progress achieved in the
area of social benefit spending-in     terms o f consolidating the spending and increasing the share o f the
best-targeted benefits to the poor and vulnerable-may        be reversed in 2007, despite the PAL2 prior
action having been met. The Government adopted in September 2006 a National Population Policy
(NPP), which, if implemented as proposed, increases rather than consolidates social benefit spending in
2007. Innet terms, the implementation o f this policy increases total social benefits spending by about
0.2 percent o f GDP in 2007 and, unfortunately, may decrease the share o f best targeted benefits. Since
the Croatian authorities have capped social benefit spending at 4.0 percent o f GDP in 2007, this means
that only part o f fiscal consolidation achieved in the area o f social benefits may be eroded. Also, the
authorities expect further reductions in social benefit spending after 2007 as a result o f the
implementation o fthe socialbenefit spendingreform strategy supported by PAL2.

58.     Anticipated PAL3 Prior Actions: Looking forward, PAL3 is proposed to focus on reforms that
are critical for further fiscal consolidation inorder to mitigate the risks on the macroeconomic front, as
well as for the achievement o f PAL outcome targets. In addition to satisfactory overall progress in
meetingthe program goals, Board presentation of PAL3 i s proposed to be triggered, among others, by
the following:

             Croatian Privatization Fund sells (through tender or auctions) or liquidates the remaining
              companies with majority state ownership ina manner acceptable to the Bank.
             Ministryof Finance reduces enterprise subsidies to 2.2 percent of GDP in2007, and further
              to 2.0 percent o f GDP inthe 2008 budget.
             Consistent with the social benefit spending reform strategy, benefits consolidated and total
              social benefit spendingreducedto 3.7 percent o f GDP in2008.

             Means-testing applied to health co-payment exemptions for social categories .ofinsurees.

             HZ takes actions requiredto reduce the working ratio to 170 percent in 2007 and further to
              150 percent in2008.
             CPF privatizes at least 7 further HZ subsidiaries.

                             E.     Pillar I:Improving Investment Climate

59.     Croatia's performance in terms o f enterprise restructuring, privatization, new business
development, attraction o f foreign direct investment, and creation of an enabling investment climate has
improved since the launch o f the PAL series. While, as noted earlier, the private sector share o f GDP i s
still relatively low compared to a number o f other transition or EU countries, enterprise privatization,
which is needed to create space for the private sector, has been re-launched, state aid to enterprises has
been gradually decreasedsince 2005, and the cost o f doing business has declined. This can be expected
to affect positively the entry o fnew business.

                       Privatization and Liquidation of Stateowned Enterprises

60.     Outcome Goal: State shares inat least 1,000 enterprises privatized or liquidated by end 2007.

               Progress towards the goal: State shares privatized or liquidated in 841 enterprises (116
               companies with majority state ownership and minority stakes in725 companies)




                                                   17

 61.     PAL has supported the re-launch o f the privatization process in line with the Government's
 Strategic Development Frarnew~rk'~,and noteworthy progress has been made on this front: since the
 PAL launch in 2004, state shares have been privatized or liquidated in 841 enterprises." This includes
 the sale o f all the remaining ago-kombinats, except one; most tourism companies; and two steel mills
 and an aluminum plant, which were large loss-makers. In addition, the privatization process o f one
 shipyardhas started, and its majority shares are expected to be sold in2007. Since the Government is in
 the process o f preparing a National Shipyard Restructuring Plan for the EC's approval, no further
 shipyards are expected to be sold in 2007. To prevent Government bailouts o f privatized companies,
 previous repurchase clauseshave been excluded from these privatization contracts.

 62.     In 2006, the Croatian authorities were also drafting a new privatization law to govern
 privatization of the remaining state-owned enterprises inthe Croatian hvatizationFund(CPF) portfolio.
 The main objective of the new law was to introduce an Employee Share Ownership (ESOP) model, but
 the model as proposed would have deviated from the international ESOPpractice and its implementation
 might have created a category of enterprises that have difficulties attracting strategic investors.
 Consequently, inspring2007, the authorities decided to forgo the adoption o f the new law and retain the
 legal framework governing privatization unchanged at least through the Parliamentary elections
 scheduled for November 2007.

 63.     Reform Strategy to Reach the Outcome Goal: PAL has supported the following actions related
 to privatization and liquidation of state-owned enterprises:

                 Sell or cancel government's minority shares in enterprises:
              o Progress under PALI: CPF sold or cancelled state's minority shares in 200 companies
                   through the stock exchange.
              o Progress under PALZ: CPF has sold or cancelled minority shares in 525 companies.
                   Under PAL3, the remainingminority shares are expected to be sold.
                 Sell or liquidate companies with majority state ownership:
              o Progress under PALI: CPF sold through tender or auctions ten companies with majority
                   state ownership.
              o Progress under PALZ: CPF has sold 31 and liquidated another 75 companies with
                   majority state ownership. Under PAL3, the remaining companies with majority state
                   shares are expected to be sold or liquidated.

                 Sell state shares in shipyards:
              o Progress under PALI: CPF initiated preparation for the sale of state shares in one
                   shipyard.




14PAL is supporting the second round o f privatizationto complete Croatia's transition process. The first phase was
carried out in early 1990s and was characterized by sales to managers and employees, and distribution to political
supporters. I t did not provide the hoped-for boost to investment and growth, since companies were not transferred
to those who could operate themmost efficiently, and because the Government, instead o f establishing hard budget
constraints andpushing the chronic loss-makers into liquidation, kept bailing out the newly privatized enterprises.

l5At the start o fthe PAL series in2004, there were about 1,132 enterprises with some form o fstate ownership inthe
Croatia Privatization Fundportfolio. These consisted of: (i)   827 enterprises with state ownership o f 0-25 percent;
(ii) enterpriseswithstateownershipof25-50percent;and(iii) 162enterpriseswithmorethan50percent
    143                                                             about
state ownership. Enterprises with high state ownership were mamly in shipbuilding, tourism, agriculture (agro-
kombinats), and metal-processing sectors, and many o f them were loss-making, heavily indebted, and could not
survive without direct subsidies (including for working capital).


                                                       18

             o Progress under PAL2: The process o f privatizing majority shares in one shipyard has
                   been initiated, withthe sale expected in2007. UnderPAL3, a tender for another shipyard
                   i s expected to be issued.

               Sell or liquidate agro-kombinats:
             o Progress under PALI: Owing to concerns about the process of agro-kombinat
                   privatization, the Ministry o f Agriculture (MoAFWM) prepared a strategy for enhancing
                   competitiveness in the agricultural and food sectors, including the privatization o f agro-
                   kombinats. Ten agro-kombinats were sold.
             o Progress under PAL2: MoAFWMhas implementedthe strategy relatedto ago-kombinat
                   privatization, and tenderedthe remaining agro-kombinat.

                                 Improving Financial Discipline of Enterprises

 64.     Outcome Goals: (i)       Subsidies to enterprises reduced from 3.4 percent o f GDP in 2003 to 2.2
 percent of GDP in2007; (ii)      Reducedpublic enterprise arrears.

               Progress towards thegoals: (i)     Enterprise subsidies reducedto 2.33 percent of GDP in2006
               and to 2.2 percent o f GDP in the 2007 budget; (ii)       Public enterprise arrears reduced from
               HRK1.36 billion at end2004 to HRK486 millioninDecember 2006.
 65.     For the current round o f privatization to be successful, it i s critical that the Government imposes
 hard budget constraints on privatized and other enterprises. The Government has supported the loss-
 making public and state-owned enterprises through generous subsidies, transfers, and guarantees. This i s
 costly to the economy, since supporting losses of non-viable enterprises i s ultimately financed by taxes
 on the rest of the economy, involving resource transfers from efficient to inefficient sectors, and
 constrainingproductive investments.

 66.     To bring the enterprise subsidies down to the average EU levels, the Croatian authorities have
 prepared and implemented the enterprise sector subsidy reduction plan16, and enterprise subsidies have
 been gradually but steadily reduced since the PAL launch."                 Enterprise subsidies had increased
 significantly inCroatia in2003 inthe run-upto the last Parliamentary elections. In2003, state aid to the
 enterprise sector18, including direct budgetary transfers and indirect financing through CPF, extra-
 budgetary funds, or the Croatian Bank for Reconstructionand Development (HBOR), amounted to about
 3.4 percent o f GDP, compared to the EU15 average of about 1.8 percent o f GDP. A large portion o f this
 aid went to shipyards, agro-kombinats, railways, and the metal and machinery manufacturing sector.

 67.     Also, the Government has been undertaking refoms to enhance the financial transparency o f key
 public sector enterprises and limit enterprise arrears. Public enterprise arrears stood at about 0.5 percent
 of GDP in2004 as the PAL series was launched, and have since beenreduced by 64 percent.

 68.     Reform Strategy to Reach the Outcome Goals: PAL has supported the following actions to
 promote financial discipline o f enterprises:




l6 Judicial reforms supported under PAL are complementary to measures limiting state aid.            In particular, the
strengthening o f the bankruptcy procedures will help to ensure unhindered exit o f unviable enterprises.
    The subsidy reduction plan captures the subsidy elements in state issues guarantees.         In parallel, the IMF
supported SBA has imposed a ceiling o n state guarantees.

                 Reduce state subsidies to enterprises:
               o Progress under PALI: The Croatian authorities prepared an inventory of direct and
                     indirect subsidies, and aligned their methodology with EU state aid guidelines. The
                     Government also adopted a medium-term enterprise subsidy reduction plan that sets an
                     overall annual ceiling to total subsidies, which is tightened from one year to the next, and
                     started its implementation. Enterprise subsidies were reduced from 3.4 percent of GDP
                     in2003 to 3.0 ofGDPin2004, andfurther to 2.72 percentofGDP inthe 2005 budget.''
               o Progress under PAL2: Enterprise subsidies reduced to an actual 2.77 percent in 2005,
                     and further to 2.33 percent o f GDP in 2006 and 2.2 percent o f GDP inthe 2007 budget.
                     UnderPAL3, enterprise subsidies expectedto be further reducedto 2.0 percent in2008.
               Containpublic enterprisearrears:
               o Progress under PALI: Quarterly publication of public enterprises' balance sheets,
                     including liabilities and receivables data, commenced. Overdue payables and receivables
                     of public enterprises reduced by 47 and 17 percent, respectively, from end-2004 to June
                     2005.
               o Progress under PAL2: Overdue payables and receivables of public enterprises reduced
                     by 64 and 19 percent, respectively, from end 2004 to end 2006. Government arrears to
                     public enterprises have declined by 44 percent from end 2004 to end 2006. Further
                     reductions are expected under PAL3.

                                        Reducingthe Cost of DoingBusiness

  69.    Outcome Goal: Private sector investment (including changes instocks) increased to 25 percent o f
 GDP by 2008.

                 Progress towards the goal: Private sector investment increased to 26 percent o f GDP in
                 2005 and to 27.5 percent o f GDP in 2006. In 2007, private sector investmentprojected to
                 reach 28.2 percent of GDP.
 70.     Inaddition to completing the privatization process and ensuringthat enterprises are subjected to
 the market disciplineand exit mechanisms function, the Government needs to create an environment that
 facilitates new business entry. The analysis indicates that new private firms are most productive and
 generate most new employment inCroatia.

 71.     The Croatian Government has tackled a number of administrative barriers to business since the
 launch o f the PAL series, and the recent Doing Business and other assessments indicate that the
 investment climate has indeed improved. Among other things, the Government has established one-stop
 shops to simplify business startup. Also, preparations are at an advanced stage for the introduction of a
 regulatory impact assessment and a regulatory guillotine, which aims to cut redundant and business
 unfriendly regulations by 40 percent by end-July 2007. These efforts have been supported USAID and
 FIAS. Further, the Bank supported Science and Technology Project has been covering a set of measures
 inthe area ofresearch and development (R&D). This includes strengtheningand restructuring of select
 R&D institutions, promoting commercializationofresearch outputs, andprovidingfundingfor programs
 aimed at upgradingtechnological capabilities o f enterprises.




19 At the start o f the enterprise subsidy reduction plan implementation, Croatian authorities were concerned that the
plan would block further privatizations by limiting privatizationrelated liability write-offs. To address this concern,
it was agreed that inthe context of the subsidy reduction plan, the one-time privatizationrelated write-offs could be
offset by the revenues from privatization o f those companies.

  72.      Reform Strategy to Reach the Outcome Goal: PAL has supported the following actions to
  reduce the cost o f doing business:

               Reduce administrative and regulatory barriers to business:
              o Progress under PALl:          Amendments made to the Physical Planning and Construction
                   laws as well as to the Utility Services Law in 2004 to streamline the administrative
                   procedures to obtain construction-relatedpermits.
              o Progress under PAL2: A new unifieddraft law on spatialplanning and constructionwas
                   completed in April 2007. Under PAL3, this law and the regulatory guillotine will be
                   implemented.

                                         Strengtheningthe Judiciary

  73.      Outcome Goals: (i) percent reduction in the court case backlog by 2008; (ii) assessment
                                  50                                                                EU
  o f the judicial sector showing progress inadapting to EUstandards.

                Progress towards the goals: (i) court case backlog reducedby 30 percent between April
                                                   the
                 2004 and November 2006 (from 1.64 to 1.15 million cases); (ii) assessment o f the
                                                                                          EU
                judicial sector shows progress, but the large case backlog and ensuringproper enforcement
                 o fjudgments remain challenges.
  74.      The creation of stable, clear, effective, and predictable laws and legal institutions i s one o f the
  main challenges facing Croatia in its efforts to promote investment and growth. For businesses to be
  successful, contracts and property rights need to be observed and protected, and the court system needs
  to provide impartial and efficient adjudication of disputes. Strengthening thejudiciary i s also critical for
  EUaccession, andthe Government considers it one ofthe priorityareas for reform.

  75.      The Croatian authorities have implemented a series o f reforms in the past couple of years to
  improve the efficiency o f the judiciary and reduce the court case backlog, which was well above 1.5
  million as the PAL series was launched. One o f the key sources o f inefficiency and backlog both in
  commercial and municipal courts was the non-adjudicative functions thatjudges were tasked with-such
  as land registration2' and titling, maintenance o f the company registry, execution o f judgments,
  supervision o f elections, and other administrative tasks.21 These tasks have now been almost completely
  been transferred from judges to other bodies.22 Also, the automated court case management has been
  brought to the point o f implementation, which should further help since its absence was contributing to
  inefficiency and backlogs.

  76.      The impact of these measuresi s already evident, and the case backlog has beenrapidly declining.
  While the overall case backlog has declined by 30 percent, land registration and enforcement case
  backlogs were reduced by 50 and 15 percent, respectively, by September 2006. In parallel, plans for
  rationalization o f the court system have been prepared, since distribution o f work among the courts
  continues to be highly uneven, and the number o f county courts (21) is high for the size of the
  population.     Bankruptcy procedures have also been streamlined to facilitate the exit o f unviable
  enterprises, and a movable propertyregistry established.




20 Land registration cases alone formed about 50-60 percent o f the backlog.
21  The backlog has not been caused by a shortage o fjudges: the number o fjudges per 10,000 inhabitants in Croatia
i s among the highest inEurope, but the number o f court supporting personnelperjudge is one o f the lowest.

22  Some Supreme Court judges, including the Supreme Court President, will still participate in the supervision o f
elections.

 77.    Reform Strategy to Reach the Outcome Goals: PAL has supported the following actions to
 strengthen the judiciary:

            Rationalize the court system:
            o Progress under PALI: To ensure a more even caseload distribution among courts, the
                 Government prepared and approved in June 2005 a strategy and an action plan for the
                 reform o f the judicial system.
            o Progress under PAL2: The Government decided to proceed with rationalization in
                 phases. The rationalization process has started with mergers o f five misdemeanor and
                 five municipal courts on a pilot basis. Under PAL3, the rationalization o f courts i s
                 expected to proceed on a broader scale.

            Reduce case backlogs and accelerate courtproceedings:
            o Progress under PALI: Land registration was transferred from judges to court clerks in
                 municipal courts. Also, the Ministryo f Justice adopted an IT strategy for courts.
            o Progress under PAL2:             Other non-adjudicative functions--commercial registries,
                 enforcement o f court decision, and partially participation in electoral commissions-have
                 been transferred from judges to other judicial personnel or outside o f courts, and new
                 caseload and workload rates per judge have been adopted. Also, the Court Rules o f
                 Procedure have been modified to support the automated court management system.23

            Strengthen enforcement of judgments, contracts, property rights, and bankruptcy
            procedures:
            o Progress under PALI: To facilitate enforcement and execution o f contracts andproperty
                 rights, the Law on Execution was amended.
            o Progress under PAL2: To reduce average duration o f a bankruptcy case, the bankruptcy
                 law has been amended, and the regulatory framework for bankruptcy trustees
                 (certification exam, maintenance o f the list on bankruptcy trustees) developed.           A
                 movable property registry has been established, and under PAL3 it is expected to be fully
                 functioning.

                               F.       Pillar11: StrengtheningGovernance

 78.    Public administration and public expenditure management have also been strengthened inthe past
 couple o f years, and improvement o f expenditure management is notable. A prerequisite for effective
 policy implementation and public service delivery i s efficient, skilled, and motivated public service. The
 emphasis in PAL has been on measures that reduce the size and promote effectiveness o f public
 administration, and enhance the efficiency o f public expenditure management. While the public sector
 wage bill has declined since the launch o f the PAL series, it i s still high by international standards, and
 would need to be further pruned inthe quest to reduce the size o f the state. Also, since adequate public
 administration capacity i s one o f the key requirements for EU accession, further reforming and
 modernizing public administration i s critical.




23Development o f information technology and capacity for the introduction o f the automated case management
systemis supported inparallelbythe Court and Bankruptcy AdministrationProject.

 2003 to 10 percent o f GDP in 2008; (ii) assessment o f public administration showing progress in
                                                 EU

              after Parliamentary elections in2007.
 80.      Since the launch o f the PAL series, the public sector wage bill has been reduced, and the outcome
 goal regarding the wage bill already achieved. However, further measures to strengthen and modernize
 public administration are still needed. Inparticular, the recent legislative changes would still need to be
 rigorously implemented and enforced.

 81.      To realign the size and role of the state as well as to strengthen the policy making process and
 service delivery, the authorities have taken a number o f measures regarding the size, structure, and
 remuneration of the public service. T o address the size and structure, the Government has launched a
 rationalization effort",    starting with the Ministry o f Health and Social Welfare and two state
 administration offices at the county level. These entities have prepared rationalization plans consistent
 with the recommendations o f prior functional reviews. Functional reviews o f other ministries and
 county offices are being carried out.         The Ministry o f Finance has in parallel proceeded with the
 development and piloting o f a government-wide personnel and payroll database to help control the size
 o f public administration and wage bill.

 82.      T o modernize the civil and public service consistent with EUstandards, a new Civil Service L a w
 has been enacted and a Law on Civil Service Salaries is expected to be enacted by September 2007. The
 new Civil Service Law, among other things, requires depoliticization and professionalization o f the top
 level of state administration and, specifically, reintegration of Assistant Ministers and Ministerial
 Secretaries into the civil service system to ensure continuity in policy and management. While the
 depoliticization clauses become effective only after next Parliamentary elections, a series o f other laws
 have in the meantime been amended to reflect depoliticization in order to reduce the risk o f non-
 implementation.       The job classification system is also being revised to ensure similar jobs across
 ministries and agencies are consistently classified. Further, the new L a w on Civil Service Salaries,
 which i s being finalized, includes provisions for decompression and performance-based remuneration.26
 The current reward system i s fragmented and too compressed to provide performance incentives to staff.
 It also poses issues on equity, and impedes the development o f an integrated public administration
 system.27 The new L a w on Civil Service Salaries is expected to be later linked to a future legislation
 covering the broader public sector.




24Based o n the consolidated general government statistics.

25Inaddition, the Government reduced the number o f ministries, and rationalizedsome administrative units placed
directly under the Government in2004.
26The implementation of the Civil Service Salary L a w is supported by over dozen decrees and other secondary
legislation, which introduce modern human resources management inpublic administration.
21For example, different organizations within the civil service had varying pay levels for similar jobs, and local
authorities were seen as being paid excessive salaries compared to other public sector staff.


                                                       23

83.     The policy process has also been strengthened. Weaknesses inthe policy formulation process led
earlier to the adoption o f policies with adverse fiscal, social, environmental, or state aidcompetition
impacts. With the support o f PAL, the Rules of Procedure o f the Government have been amended to
require assessment o f fiscal, state aidcompetition, social and environmental impacts o f policy proposals,
and a satisfactory response to the comments o f the Office for Legislation on the legal compatibility o f
draft laws.

84.    Reform Strategy to Reach the Outcome Goals: PAL has supported the following actions to
strengthen public administration:

        0   Reform employmentlegislation and rationalize the reward system:
            o Progress under PALI: The new Civil Service Law enacted, which provides incentives
                for depoliticized, efficient, client-oriented, and performance-based administration.
               However, the depoliticization clauses will become effective only after the next
               Parliamentary elections.
            o Progress under PAL2: The forthcoming depoliticization o f public administration has
               been further reinforced in a set o f technical amendments to the laws on Government
                Officials, System o f State Administration, Transfer o f Power, and Conflict o f Interest.
                To unify and decompress civil service salary structures, a new Law on Civil Service
                Salaries and a new job classification system are being prepared and expected to be
                enacted by Parliament by September 2007. Under PAL3, new legislation on public
                employment conditions, including provisions for centralized collective bargaining, i s
                expected to be adopted.
            Rationalize organizational structures:
            o Progress under PALI: The Government developed and endorsed a functional review
               methodology to assess current organizational structures, and functional review pilots
               were conducted intwo central ministries and two county offices.
            o Progress under PAL2: The Ministry of Health and Social Welfare and two state
                administration offices at the county level have prepared rationalization programs based
                on the functional review results. Also, the Ministryo f Financehas developed a personnel
                and payroll database with an interface to the Treasury system to improve the control of
                the public administration size and the wage bill. The system i s piloted in selected
               ministries, and the plan i s to develop a full human resource management information
                system under PAL3. Also under PAL3, all the remaining ministies and county offices
                are expected to adopt rationalizationprograms.

            Strengthen thepolicy process:
            o Progress under PALI: To increase quality and fiscal affordability o f proposed laws and
               policies, the Rules o f Procedure o f Government were amended to make impact
                assessment (fiscal, social, environmental, and state aidcompetition) o f proposed policies
                and legislation mandatory. A standard methodology for fiscal impact assessment was
                adopted and its implementation started.
            o Progress under PAL2: Fiscal and state aidcompetition impact assessment has been
               conducted as agreed on all proposed policies and legislation submitted to Parliament.
               Methodologies for social and environmental impact assessment have been prepared, and
               their implementation started at the beginning o f 2007.

85.     Outcome Goal:        General Government spending consistent with the medium-term fiscal
framework.



                                                  24

            Progress towards the goal: General government spending reduced from 51.3 percent o f GDP
            in2003 to 49.3 percent ofGDPin2005 and further to 48.4 percentofGDPin2006.

 86.     Since the PAL launch in 2004, the Croatian authorities have made significant progress in
 strengthening public expenditure management.** The budget execution processes, including accounting
 and reporting structures, have improved. GFS 2001 standards have been formally adopted in accounting
 and reporting, although adherence to these standards by some local governments remains questionable.
 The Treasury Single Account has been expanded to cover bank accounts o f all line ministries and the
 remaining extra-budgetary funds (health insurance find, pension find, employment fund). Also, the
 Ministryof Finance has carried out all the preparatory work to integrate existing financial management
 information systems in 2007. While the Government has made progress incontrolling arrears, they still
 exist (for example in the health sector). The strengthening o f financial management processes can be
 expected to reduce them over time.

 87.     Further, the authorities have, with the help of EC, established internal audit units in all line
 ministries, central state organizations, and extra-budgetary funds. Their establishment i s also underway
 inlocal governments. Internal auditors have been fully trained, and measures to enhance the quality o f
 audits are being undertaken.         Internal control has also been strengthened.         The L a w on Financial
 Management and Control Systems in the Public Sector has been enacted, controllers have been
 appointedto line ministries, and a financial management control manual i s being prepared

 88.     Reform Strategy to Reach the Outcome Goal: PAL has supported the following actions to
 improve public expenditure management:

             Improve internal audit andfinancial control:
              o Progress under PALI: The internal audit and control function was strengthened through
                   the establishment o f internal audit units in over half o f the line ministries and the city o f
                   Zagreb. Also, the Ministry o f Finance developed, issued, and disseminated a rule book,
                   standards, and manual for internal audit, including certification requirements for internal
                   auditors.
              o Progress under PAL2: All 13 line ministries, extra-budgetary funds, nine central state
                   institutions and some local government units have established internal audit units, and
                   their establishment is some large cities and counties. Under PAL3, the remaining large
                   cities and local governments are expected to establish such units.




28 At the start o f the PAL series, the Bank and IMF agreed on a division labor in the area o f public expenditure
management. Since the IMF under SBA focused o n strengthening o f budget formulation and debt management,
these areas were not included into the PAL program, but PAL focused o n internal audit and budget execution. The
Bank has, however, supported reforms on the debt management and budget planning through an IDF grant, as has
the EC. Debt management has also been strengthened in the past couple o f years: a new public debt management
and recording system as well as an electronic system for treasury bill auction have been introduced and staff trained;
the department inthe Ministry o f Finance covering debt management has been reorganized with separate front (debt
issuance), middle (risk management) and back (debt recording, planning and analysis) offices; and a new public debt
management strategy has been adopted. The budget formulation has also improved. Among other things, the
Government has shifted to a three-year budget framework. In 2006, public finance statistics were for the first time
constructed according to ESA 95, by using the transfer tables between the national chart o f accounts and E S A 95
methodology, which will enable the cross-country comparison o f the public finance statistics. Further, the state
budget coverage has been expanded from the 2006 budget onwards by inclusion o f lottery revenues, road charges,
own revenues o f budgetary users, revenues under the special regulations (administrative taxes and other earmarked
revenues), and EUgrants. The control o f collection and the use o f earmarked revenues have also been established.

             Improve budget execution:
             o Progress under PALI: The MinistryofFinancecarriedout an assessmentof functionality
                 and overlap of financial management information systems (including SAP) operating in
                 ministries and other budget entities.
             o Progress under PAL2: Based on the assessment results, the Ministry of Finance has
                 prepared a strategy and operational guidelines to rationalize and integrate the financial
                 management information systems. The integration o f system i s taking place in 2007.
                 Further, to improve budget execution, the Treasury Single Account coverage has been
                 widened to cover and consolidate bank accounts o f all line ministries and extra-budgetary
                  funds into it.

             Strengthenpublic procurement: The authorities are inthe process o fharmonizing the public
             procurement legislation with EU requirements. Under PAL3, a new Public Procurement
             Law, consistent with EUDirectives, i s expected to be enacted.

                 G.       Pillar 111: Enhancing Fiscal Sustainability of Sector Programs

 89.    The level and efficiency o f social sector spending requires attention inthe quest to reduce the size
 o f the state, enhanced macroeconomic stability, and higher growth. Public spending on health and
 pension has declined since the PAL launch, but social benefit spending continues to be high by
 international standards. The financial performance o f the Croatian Railways (HZ) has significantly
 improved, but it remains one o f the worst performing railways companies in Europe, and the current
 level of subsidies required for its operation i s still high.

                                                Health Financing

 90.    Outcome Goals: (i) public health spending reduced fi-om 7.7 percent o f GDP in2003 to 6.0
                                total
 percent o f GDP in2008; (ii)    arrears inhealth sector cleared.

             Progress towards thegoals: (i) public spendingon healthreducedto 6.1 percent of GDP
                                                total
             in 2005, and to 6.0 percent of GDP in 2006; (ii)health sector arrears increased from
             HRK743.8 million at end September 2004 to HRK1.27 billion at end 2006.

 91.    While public spending on health has declined notably since the PAL launch, health sector arrears
 have increased and continue to be ~izeable.~'This i s a concern, which both the PAL program and the
 IMF SBA have attempted to address. To further reform the health sector and control the growth of
 arrears, changes in the demand for and supply o f care as well as improved accountability mechanisms
 are required. PAL has supported interventions which attempt to reduce unnecessary demand for health
 services.

 92.    As the first step of health financing reform, the Government introduceda small administrative fee
 for health services in the summer 2005. In 2006, as the second step, the Parliament enacted a new
 Obligatory Health Insurance Act, which reduced health co-payment exemptions and cut the drug co-
 payment coverage under the complementary health insurance. In Croatia, about 60 percent o f the
 population has been exempted fiom health co-payments (2.4 million people costing about HRK800
 million per year), not just the poor and vulnerable as i s the case as in EU countries. In principle the
 exemption policy i s based on poverty, but the practice i s different since most exemptions are categorical
 and parts o f them income-tested, instead o f means-tested, and thus not necessarily targeted to the poor



29Since Croatia is following accrual accounting, the arrears are included inthe actual spending figures.


                                                       26

 and vulnerable. The new law has strengthened income-testing o f co-payment exemptions (by adjusting
 family and income definitions) as the first phase toward gradual extension o f means-testing to determine
 co-payment exemptions. In addition, the list of unemployed people eligible for health co-payment
 exemption has been updatedand made consistent with the data o f the unemployment regi~try.~'

 93.     Further, to control spending on drugs, the new law has introduced two drug lists: a list for
 essential drugs not requiring co-payments (that is, covered by the Obligatory Health Insurance), and an
 additional list requiring co-payments. The coverage o f these drug co-payments has been eliminated from
 the complementary health insurance. The Croatian Health Insurance Fund (HZOZO) has also revisited
 and revised the drug list since its issuance to ensure that the target savings/revenues (HRK400-500
 milliodper year) are achieved. HZOZO will hereafter adjust the list on an annual basis to guarantee the
 savingshevenues.

 94.     However, the new law did neither rationalize the basic package nor shift the complementary
 insurance to the private sector3' as initially expected. Instead, the authorities have implemented a series
 o f supply side measures to improve cost control in hospitals. Also, the authorities have committed to
 strengthen the collection of the administrative fee, and to take action if the revenues collected fall short
 o f the HRK320 million annual targets. While the second stage reform was less extensive than desired,
 the estimated fiscal savingdrevenues from all the above mentioned reforms will be close to HRKl
 billionper year.

 95.     To strengthen cost control in hospitals, the authorities have launched the reform o f the payment
 mechanism for hospitals with the introduction o f Diagnostic Related Groups (DRGs). Rather than
 paying hospitals based on inputs, under the new system hospitals will be paid the average treatment cost
 o f a case (with similar diagnoses and corriplicating factors). This payment system i s expected to improve
 the allocation o f financing, reduce disparities, and create incentives for hospitals to reduce the average
 length o f hospital stays, conform to cost norms, and control spending. It may, however, also create
 incentives for treating increased number o f cases. A parallel strengthening o f HZOZO's monitoring
 capacity and enforcement o f budget ceilings will thus be essential. The Government i s also planning to
 restructure the supply o f health care services, with the aim to increase the share o f health care funding
 going to patient care and reduce the share on administration. As the first step of reform, accreditations
 rules have been issued that classify hospitals according to the services they can provide. The aim i s to
 increase the application o f cost-effective care solutions, such as day-surgery, and long-term care
 solutions, and to reduce acute care beds currently used for these services.

 96.     Reform Strategy to Reach the Outcome Goals: PAL has supported the following actions to
 increase sustainability o f health sector financing:

             Improve efficiency and reduce drug and hospital expenditures:
              o Progress under PALI: The Ministry o f Health and HZOZO prepared a policy proposal
                  on the (i)revision o f HZZO basic benefit package; (ii)reduction o f co-payment



30About 100,000 employed people were on the list o f unemployed eligible for health co-payment exemption, since
the systemreliedon self-reporting.

31To control the overuse o f health services, the 2002 Health Insurance Law had introduced co-payments for select
services in the basic health package. However, to increase HZOZO revenues, a voluntary complementary health
insurance program was introduced at the same time to cover these co-payments. This re-introduced the moral
hazard problemthat co-payments were meant to mitigate inthe first place. It also increased administrative costs and
introduced an adverse selection problem, since the complementary insurance was purchased by beneficiaries with
hghest medical costs. Hence, to ensure the complementary insurance is priced appropriately to reflect the cost o f its
provision and excess demand controlled, shifting it to the private sector would be important.


                                                        27

                   exemptions; and (iii)   restructuring o f the complementary health insurance. To reduce
                   drug and hospital expenditures, the time required for drug registration was reduced, the
                   number o f generic drugs on the drug list was expanded, and contracts with limits on
                   prescriptionswere introduced.
              o Progress under PAL2: A new Health Insurance Act, reducing co-payment exemptions
                   and limitingthe complementary health insurance coverage has been enacted. However,
                   since the new Act only partially met the initial policy goal, the Croatian authorities have
                   undertaken following supplemental measures: (i)      two lists o f drugs-and     essential list not
                   requiring co-payments, and an additional list requiring co-payments-have                     been
                   introduced with target savingshevenues o f HRK 400-500 milliodyear; (ii)income-
                   testing of co-payment exemptions has been strengthenedby adjusting the definition o f the
                   family consistent with the definition o f the Center for Social Welfare, and by expanding
                   the definition of income inthe Basic Health InsuranceLaw; (iii)        HZOZOhas updatedthe
                   list o f unemployed eligible for exemption on a monthly basis based on unemployment
                  registry data; (iv) MoHSW and HZOZO have assessed the revenues generated by the
                   administrative fee, and intend to strengthen existing control mechanisms for the
                   collection of fees to ensure target revenues continue to be achieved; (v) MoHSW has
                  prepared draft accreditation legislation (vi) the DRGmodel has been piloted in four pilot
                   hospitals, and an initial evaluation and fiscal impact assessmento f the first few months o f
                   implementation has been completed; and (vii) MoHSW has completed the first phase o f
                  the hospital master plan. Under PAL3, means-testing i s expected to be applied to health
                   co-payment exemptions for social categories o f insurees.

                                           ,Reformof Social Benefits

 97.      Outcome Goal: Total spending on non-contributory social benefits reduced from 4.1 percent o f
 GDP in 2004 to 3.5 percent o f GDP in2008, while the share o fthe best-targeted and means-tested social
 support allowance increased.

              Progress towards thegoal: Total spending on social benefits reduced to 4.0 percent in2005
              and further to 3.8 percent o f GDP in 2006; while the share o f best-targeted (means-tested)
              benefits has remained stagnant at about 0.36 percent o f GDP in2004-2006.

 98.     Total spending on social benefits has declined since 2004, albeit m~derately.~~3.8 percent o f
                                                                                                  At
 GDP in 2006, total spending remains high compared to the EU average o f 2.5 percent o f GDP. The
 share o f spending on the best-targeted (means-tested) benefits has remained stagnant between 2004 and
 2006, and the system still fails to protect the most vulnerable members o f the society, owing to the poor
 targeting and administration o f benefits.33




32The PAL series has attempted to correct the early 2004 policy reversal int h s area. To align spending levels with
comparable countries and cut the excess, many social benefits were reduced in 2001. At the beginning o f 2004,
however, enhanced categorical benefit packages were reintroduced, including child, maternity, and war veteran
benefits, along with exemptions from taxes. As a result, total social benefit spending rose to 4.1 percent o f GDP in
2004, and spending o n less well-targeted benefits increased.

33Only half of the total social benefit spending reaches the bottom quintile of population, and half o f social
assistance beneficiaries are able bodied unemployed.


                                                        28

 99.     The Government has recently adopted a social benefit spending reform strategy, which aims to
 consolidate the over 100 existing social benefits34,strengthen their administration, and increase the share
 o f finds allocated to means-tested benefits to reduce poverty.35 The strategy will be implemented from
 2007 onwards. However, the strategy focuses only on social welfare benefits, and most categorical
 benefits, which significantly increased inearly 2004, are not covered.

  100. In late 2006, the Government also adopted a National Population Policy (NPP), which aims to
 address Croatia's adverse demographic trend and calls for, among other things, further increases inchild,
 maternity, and family benefits which are already at EU15 levels. Innet terms, the implementation o f this
 policy i s estimated to increase total social benefits spending by about 0.2 percent o f GDP in 2007, and,
 unfortunately, may decrease the share of best targeted benefits. However, the Croatian authorities are
 committed to capping total social benefit spending at 4.0 percent o f GDP in 2007, and expect further
 reductions thereafter as a result o f the implementation o f the social benefit spending reform strategy
 mentionedabove.

  101. Reform Strategy to Reach the Outcome Goal: PAL has supported the following actions to
 rationalize and target social benefits:

              Consolidateand improve targeting of cash social benefits:
              o Progress under PALl: The Government established an inter-ministerial working group
                  to prepare a strategy for reform o f social benefit spending, with the aim to consolidate the
                  benefits, reduce overall spendingon social benefits and increase the share allocated to the
                  means-testedbenefits reaching the most disadvantaged.
              o Progress under PALZ: The Government has adopted the strategy for social benefit
                  reform, and started its implementation.             Under PAL3, consistent with the strategy,
                  benefits are expected to be consolidated, share o f means-tested benefits increased, and
                  total social benefit spending reduced to 3.7 percent o f GDP.

                              Improvingthe Sustainabilityof the PensionSystem

 102.    Outcome Goal: Pension spending reduced fi-om about 12.3 percent o f GDP in 2004 to below
 11.45 percent of GDP in2008.

              Progress towards the goal: Pension spending reducedto 12.1 percent o f GDP in2005 and to
              11.9 percent o f GDP in2006.

 103.    Pension spending has been declining as projected, and the 2004 reversal o f the pension indexation
 formula has been rectified. In March 2004, the Parliament had passed amendments to the Pension
 Insurance Act, which provided for a pension supplement and indexed pensions to nominal wages,
 thereby partly reversing the 1998 pension reform. That had both fiscal and structural impacts on the
 pension system, as pension expenditures as a share o f GDP, transition costs, and the primary pension
 deficit started to balloon. Faced with that prospect, Parliament turned in 2005 the pension indexation




34In addition, local governments provide social assistance programs, which are financed from local and regional
government budgets. These programs serve the same groups as national programs, resulting in duplication and
misuse.
35The analysis suggests that in principle lifting all people out o f poverty with perfect targeting of assistance would
require reallocation o f only about 0.7 percent o f GDP worth o f less well-targeted benefits to the means-tested ones.


                                                        29

  back to the Swiss formula36,which is fiscally and socially sustainable. As a result, pension spending as a
  share o f GDP has returnedto a downward trend.

  104.    The mode and pace of repayment o f the debt to pensioners has also been settled. In July 2004,
  the Act on Implementation o f the Decision o f the Constitutional Court o f May 12, 1998 was passed
  stipulating that the Government needs to repay the so called "debt to pensioners" in relation to a
  Constitutional Court's decision o f 199g3'. According to the law, the debt will be repaidby establishinga
  Pensioners' Fund funded from existing Government-owned stocks and real estate. The size o f the debt
  was established by calculatingthe debt for each individual, and the repayment o f debt started in2006.

  105.    Pressures for further pension reform have emerged as Parliamentary elections approach.
  However, the Croatian authorities have stated that there will be no further amendments to the pension
  insurance law duringPAL.

  106. Reform Strategy to Reach the Outcome Goal: PAL i s supporting the following action to
  enhance sustainability o f the pension system:

             Strengthenfiscal and social sustainability of thepension system:
             o Progress under PALI: The nominal wage indexation of pensions was to be reversed and
                   replacedwith a fiscally and socially sustainable pension indexation formula under PAL2.
                   However, action was taken on this front earlier than anticipated.          Shortly before the
                   distribution o f PAL1 documents to the Board, the Parliament reversed the pension
                   indexationback to the so called Swiss formula.

                              Improving FiscalSustainabilityof the Railways

  107.    Outcome Goal: The HZ worlung ratio38reduced from 243 percent at end 2004 to 150-170
  percent at end 2007.

             Progress towards the goal: The HZ working ratio declined to 190 percent at end 2006, and
             projected to reach 170 percent at end 2007.

  108.    Since the launch of the PAL series, the Croatian Railways (HZ) has launched restructuring and
  there has been noteworthy improvement in HZ's financial performance. The HZ working ratio has
  declined by over 50 percentage points, and state aid to HZ has decreased from about HRK 3.5 billion in
  2004 (1.4 percent o f GDP) to about HRK2.1billion in2006 (0.8 percent o f GDP). The restructuringhas
  focused on: (i)  reduction o f labor costs through staff layoffs (about 1,100 staff retrenched in 2005-2006,
  about 600 additional staff to be retrenched in2007);39(ii)     privatization of subsidiary companies (four HZ
  subsidiaries tendered and to be sold by end June 2007); and (iii)     reduction in services or discontinuation
  of loss-malung localpassenger services (a program to be adoptedby the Government by end June 2007).




36 The Swiss formula is a mean average of the average nominal gross wage and inflation indexes.
3' The Law on Pension Increase to Eliminate Discrepancies in Pensions Acquired in Diferent Periods, which was
enacted in 2001, permanently raised the pension expenditures by over one percent of GDP, and consequently the
replacement rate, to repay the debt. According to the Article 1 of the law its execution satisfies the 1998
Constitutional Court Ruling.

38 The worlung ratio is calculated by dividing operating costs (excluding depreciation) by operating revenues
(excluding revenue from public service obligations and operating subsidy from the state budget-the   exception is
ticket discount reimbursement from the city of Zagreb, which is included inthe calculation).

39 HZhas still about 13,600 workers, while arailway the size ofHZcouldberunwith about 8,000 workers.


                                                      30

 109.   However, the reform and restructuring o f HZ i s by no means complete, and substantial further
reformi s still requiredto make HZ a financially viable company and able to withstand competition from
other European railways. In2006, HZ revenuesjust covered its labor costs, and the level o f HZ state aid
was still significantly higher than the level o f railways state aid inEUandneighboring countries.

 110. Reform Strategy to Reach the Outcome Goal: PAL has supported the following actions to
improve fiscal sustainability o frailways:

            Reduce the railwayfiscal deficit:
            o Progress under PALI: The Government adopted a medium-termbusiness plan, and HZ
                 took actions to reduce the working ratio to 220 percent in 2005. These actions were as
                 follows: (i)HZ laid-off through voluntary and involuntary retrenchment 534 staff from
                 the mother company (staff retrenched was not rehired in the HZ mother company or
                 subsidiaries as had beenthe case inthe previous round o f restructuring, and HZ closed all
                 positions left vacant); (ii)
                                            staff to retire inthe first six months o f 2005 left HZ as per the
                 retirement schedule; (iii) new hiringwas kept within a total limit o f 80 new staff in
                                            HZ
                 2005; (iv) HZ prepared a time-bound step-by-step plan for privatization o f subsidiaries in
                 2005-09, started its implementation; and the Government issued a decision on the legal
                 framework governing HZ subsidiary privatization; and (v) HZ conducted further analysis
                 to reduce services along or to close uneconomic lines in2006-09. HZ salaries were also
                 kept frozen.
            o Progress under PAL2: HZ reduced the working ratio to 220 percent at end 2005, and
                 further to 190percentbyend2006. To reachthe target, the following actions were taken:
                 (i) laid-offthroughvoluntaryandinvoluntaryretrenchment500stafffromthemother
                    HZ
                 company (staff retrenched was not rehired inthe HZ mother company or subsidiaries, and
                 HZ closed all positions left vacant); (ii)100 staff retired in 2006; (iii)   new hiring was
                 kept within a total of 100 new staff limit for 2006; (iv) HZ staff salaries continued to be
                 frozen at the 2005 level; and (v) MSTTD prepared and the Government approved a
                 program to reduce services or close uneconomic lines in 2006-09. Further, to reach the
                 working ratio target o f 170 percent at end 2007, HZ will reduce its staff innet terms by at
                 least 530 staff through a retrenchment program, natural attrition, involuntary lay-offs, and
                 limitednew hiring. Ifpart of the redundant staff chooses to go to the HZFoundation, the
                 total number o f layoffs will be increased so that all the funds available for retrenchment
                 are used in 2007.      Otherwise, state budget financing for layoffs will be reduced
                 accordingly. In addition, four HZ subsidiaries have been tendered. Their sales are
                 expected to be completedand two further HZ subsidiaries tendered by end June 2007.

111. Social impact assessment: Privatization o f shipyards may have distributional effects. Therefore,
a social impact assessment o f shipyard restructuring plans proposed by shipyard management was
conducted on two shipyards (Brodotrogr and Kraljevica) in 2006, and the results disseminated to
Croatian authorities. The assessment involved a survey o f shipyard employees, subcontractors, and a
control group o f non-shipyard employees. The results o f the assessment suggest that the social impacts
o f shipyard restructuring are likely to be relatively modest as workers are more adaptable than had been
expected. Shipyard employees expressed confidence that their skills would enable them to work in
another sector; and a large share has prior experience in non-shipbuilding. There results also indicate
that the majority o f those employed in shipbuilding do not consider it a desirable sector in which to
work. There i s evidence of a generational shift away from shipbuilding:the majority o f respondents did

not think their children will enter shipbuilding, nor did they want them to choose that profession. The
Government i s in the process o f preparing a National Shipyard Restructuring Plan, including a plan for
social mitigation measures. The results o f the social impact assessmenthave been taken into account by
the authorities initspreparation.

112.   Social consultations and mitigation measures: In the context o f a number o f other sectoral
reforms (such as, health insurance, new privatization law, HZ, social benefit spending), a series of
consultations have been conducted with stakeholders on the proposed reforms.             Social mitigation
measures, such as severancepackages inthe case o f HZ,have been taken by the authorities as necessary.

113. Introduction of mandatory social impact assessment of new laws and policies: Further, a
mandatory social impact assessment methodology has been prepared, and from 2007 onwards it will be
applied to new policies and legislation. Prior to its completion, consultations on this methodology and
the associatedusers' guides were conducted by the authorities.

                                        B.    Fiduciary Aspects

114.   Public Financial Management System: The Croatia Country Financial Accountability
Assessment (CFAA) was carried out in early 2004 and finalized inMay 2005. It concluded that overall
the central and local government financial management systems represent significant fiduciary risk. In
the areas o f treasury and cash management, accounting and financial reporting, internal control and
internal audit, the fiduciary risk was considered significant, partly due to the existence o f many bank
accounts o f budget users outside the single treasury account, delays in preparing the statutory
consolidated state budget, and the existence o f multitude accounting systems, some o f which were
outdated and did not meet the current standards for security and protection. Also, there were delays in
issuingthe rule books mentioned inthe internal control legislation, and an internal control environment
not capable to mitigate the risk of corruption and conflict o f interest. Giventhe introduction o f program
budgeting and the capacity o f the State Audit Office, the fiduciary risk was considered moderate in the
fields o f budgeting, external audit, and parliamentary oversight. However, Croatian authorities have
since carried out significant reforms to strengthen public expenditure management. The key
recommendations o f CFAA inthe areas of budget execution and internal audit have been reflected inthe
reformprogram supported by PAL, and those reforms have been satisfactorily implemented (see the sub-
section on public expenditure management, paragraphs 86-89).             Also, the EC continues providing
substantial technical assistance to build capacity for internal audit and control. Further, the EC and IMF
as well as the Bank in the context o f an IDF grant have been supporting reforms in the areas o f debt
management and budget formulation, and these functions have also been strengthened (see the footnote
24). A Needs Assessment o f Fiduciary Technical Assistance Harmonization was carried out jointly with
EC in April 2006. This study i s expected to facilitate better coordination and planning o f required
technical assistance, includingcapacity to effectively utilize post accession grant EUfunds.

115.   The Country Procurement Assessment Report (CPAR) was finalized inMarch 2005, and rated at
that time the level of risk in public procurement as average. Since then, consistent with the CPAR
recommendations, the institutional capacity o f the Public Procurement Office and the State Commission
have been strengthened with assistance from the EC, and these entities have taken the lead in
procurement reform in Croatia. The key procurement reformrecommended-a new public procurement
law (including standard tender documents and e-procurement provisions)-has          been included into the
PAL program. The new law, which has been developed with EC assistance and will be consistent with
EUrequirements, is currently at an advanced stage ofpreparation.

116. Safeguards Assessment of the Central Bank: The Report on the Observance o f Standards and
Codes o f Fiscal Transparency, which was completed by the IMF inNovember 2004, concluded that the



                                                  32

Croatia National Bank (CNB) has operational independence and that its financial relationship with the
Government is transparent. CNB i s auditedby independent auditors every year and the 2005 audit report
has unqualified opinion.

117.    The IMFconducted a safeguards assessmentof CNB in 2003, and concluded that the safeguards
are adequate. An updated safeguards assessment o f CNB was finalized inAugust 2006. The assessment
concludes that the CNB continues to maintain an effective system o f internal controls and nearly all
areas of the safeguards meet the policy's requirements, though the internal audit mechanisms could be
strengthened further. Basedon the IMF's assessment, CNB can be reliedupon to account for the World
Bank's proceeds from developmentpolicy operations.


                                     C.    DisbursementandAudit

118. Disbursement: The loan o f E m 1 5 0 million (US197.4 million equivalent) would be disbursed
in two tranches: EURlOO million first tranche, and EURSO million second tranche. The first tranche
would be made available upon Loan effectiveness, and the second tranche upon satisfactory completion
o f secondtranche conditions. The closing date o f the loan would be June 30, 2008. The proposed loan
will follow the Bank's disbursement procedures for development policy lending, and will be disbursedin
compliance with the stipulated tranche release conditions. Disbursementswill not be tied to any specific
purchases and will be without procurement requirements. When the loan becomes effective, the IBRD
will deposit the proceeds o fthe loaninto a deposit account at CNB, as designatedby the government and
acceptable to the Bank, and they form part of the general reserves of the country. N o dedicated deposit
account will be required. Prior to that, the Bank will withdraw from the Loan Account a front-end fee
amounting to one percent o f the principal amount, less any waivers. If,after depositing in this account,
the proceeds of the loan are used for ineligible purposes as defined inthe Loan Agreement, the Bank will
require the Borrower to refundthe amount directly to the Bank.

119. Accounting and Auditing Arrangements: The administration and accounting o f the loan will be
the responsibility o fthe Ministryo fFinance. The standard country rules will be followed by treasury for
administration and accounting. The government will maintain accounts and records, or ensure that such
items are maintained, showing that loan disbursements were in accordance with the provisions o f the
Loan Agreement. Such accounts and records will be maintained in a form acceptable to the Bank. The
proceeds of the loan deposited at the treasure account with CNB will be converted into local currency to
cover budget expenditures. The Ministry o f Finance will be responsible for the loan administration and
for preparing the withdrawal application, and maintaining the withdrawal application as required. The
MinistryofFinance, with the assistanceof CNB, will maintainrecords of all transactions under the loan
inaccordance with sound accountingpractices. Giventhe positive IMF's assessmentof CNB, an audit
o f the deposit account for the proceeds of the loan i s not considered necessary. The Ministry o f Finance
will provide the Bank within 30 days a confirmation letter stating that the PAL2 funds have been
received and deposited into the designated account assigned by the borrower that forms part of the
Borrower's budget management system.


                                     D.     EnvironmentalAspects

120. Environmental aspects of privatization: The proposedpolicy reforms have beenscreened inline
with OP 8.6. The area with known environment linkages concerns the privatization of state-owned
companies which require a future Industrial Pollution and Prevention Control Permit (IPPC), or known
pollution hot spotsheavily contaminated sites. The two steel mills and the aluminum plant privatized
under PAL are likely IPPC facilities, in some cases with known environmental concerns such as



                                                  33

 contaminated land. Shipyards may have legacy o f environment contamination issues, which will be
 important to clarify duringprivatization.

  121.   In2005, Croatia initiated a program to address highpriority pollution hot spots incooperation
 with the Environment Fund, and carried out feasibility studies and prepared designs o f remediation o f
 several known heavily contaminatedsites. Remedial actions have since been carried out on these sites.40

  122.   Inthe case of the two steel mills and the aluminum plant privatized under PAL, environmental
 audits were carried out prior to their tendering, and, based on the audit results, biddingdocuments issued
 call for environmental investments by potential investors. In the case o f state-owned shipyards, the
 National Shipyard Restructuring Plan beingprepared will address the environmental sustainability issues
 and mitigation measuresinthe context o f shipyard restructuring or liquidation.

  123.   Overall legislativeframework on environment: The legislative framework in Croatia to address
 environmental liability and industrial pollutionissues is not fully inplace, but it i s actively beingupdated
 to align with the relevant EUDirectives. A new Environment Protection Act was adopted in December
 2006, which established the framework for IPPC Directive implementation. The World Bank jointly
 with EC had supported a "mock" peer review o fthe IPPC Directiveto identify key challenges that would
 need to be addressed by the IPPC program. Among them was to clearly establish the environmental
 liability-continue the application o f the polluter pays principle, but clarify how and among which
 parties liability should be shared, particularly in the case o f earlier state-owned industries-and        adopt
 regulation on procedures to define water, groundwater, and soil remedial targets. The current
 privatization law does make any references to the environmental issues, and historically systematic
 reviews of environmental issues have not been carried out as a part o f the privatization process. To raise
 awareness o f this gap, the World Bank provided the authorities a policy note highlighting regional
 practice on the use o f environmental audits. As Croatia's legislative framework continues to be updated,
 there i s an opportunity to link compliance plan agreements to specific facilities undergoing privatization.
 Inthe meantime, Croatianauthoritieshaveinitiatedanadhoc process, acknowledginganeedtomovein
 this direction.

  124.   Environmental screening: PAL has proactively supported the inclusion o f environment
 screening for all new legislation and policies as part o f the public administration reforms.                The
 methodology for environment screening has been prepared, and its implementation started in 2007.
 Many public administration reforms promotedby PAL, such as depoliticization, professionalization, and
 performance budgeting are cross-cutting, and will positively affect the government's capacity to
 administer environmental legislation. Government environment effectiveness suffers from institutional
 fragmentation and weak enforcement.

 125.    Croatia has a long history o f environmental impact assessment(EN) linked with the construction
 permittingprocess. Efficiency improvements in construction permitting supported under PAL are not
 expected to affect the implementation of the E N process. Croatia has continued to align its E N
 procedures with EU, in particular focusing on expanding public participation and implementation o f
 Strategic Environmental Assessment.




40These include asbestos depot Mravinscka kava and Red mud lakes in Obrovac for which agreements for remedial
actions have been signed; and asbestos factory Salonit, hazardous waste landfill Lenic Brdo, Kastela (radioactive)
slag depot, Soviak pit near Rijeka for which remedial actions plans are currently being made. Other identified
hotspots include Coke plant Bakar and Ferro alloy factory Sibenik, which both declared bankruptcy and have been
undergoing partial remedial actions since 2004.

                                 E.     ImplementationandMonitoring

126.   Coordination of Reform Program Implementation: Successful implementation o f the proposed
reform program will require effective coordination among various ministries and agencies, and between
the Government and Bank. The Government has assigned the State Secretary o f the Ministryo f Finance
to coordinate the PAL agenda within the Government. Further, State Secretaries o f ministries and heads
of agencies involved in PAL have been responsible for coordinating reforms in each ministry, and are
members of an inter-ministerial PAL Coordinating Body. Finally, the Government, led by the Prime
Minister,will overseethe whole reformeffort andensureprompt actionon agreedreforms.

127.   Bank's Monitoring Arrangements: The reform program sets out qualitative and quantitative
benchmarks and targets for the medium-term. The Bank team monitors and follows up on progress, and
meets with Croatian authorities periodically to discuss next steps. The benchmarks are guideposts to
signal when progress i s advancing or falling behind in any given area. If progress i s considered
adequate, implementation o f the reform program will be supported through a subsequent operation,
subject to the approval of the Board of Executive Directors. Annual adjustments will be made to the
reform program as it evolves, to take into account the latest country developments, other donor support,
and feasible options to realize the intendeddevelopment goals.


                                     F.   Risks and Risk Mitigation

128.   There are anumber ofrisks that attend the operation. These are as follows:

129.   Political risks: Political risks remain highas the country has a coalition Government with a mere
one seat majority inParliament, and several proposedreforms are ambitious and politically challenging.     .
Also, the next Parliamentary elections are scheduled for November 2007, and the country i s entering a
pre-election period, which raises a risk of contemplation and adoption o f fiscally unsustainable policies
and investments. However, reforms to be supported under PAL are consistent with the EU accession
agenda, which i s expected to somewhat mitigate the risk. Further, to mitigate the risk of other policy
reversals during the 2007 pre-election period after the PAL2 Board, the whole Bank program in Croatia
has been put on the line: if the PAL supported reforms will be reversed in 2007, the Bank program will
immediately move to the low case scenario with further lendingcurtailed.

130.   Capacity weaknesses: Capacity weaknesses could impede implementation o f proposed reforms.
Capacity i s uneven and limited in several ministries, which may hinder the reform effort. However,
investment projects that complement PAL and technical assistance by other donors are designed to
mitigate some o f the capacity constraints.

131. External shocks: External shocks that have adverse effects on regional stability could seriously
harm the reform effort. Given Croatia's heavy reliance on tourism revenues, it i s vulnerable to any
deterioration inregional stability. However, PAL supported reforms to improve the investment climate
are expected to mitigate the risk through diversification of economic activities.

132.   Exchange rate risk: Given the highdegree o f euroization o f the Croatian economy, the Croatian
financial sector remains vulnerable to exchange rate risks. The Croatian National Bank has, however,
taken several measures to control the risk by discouraging foreign borrowing by banks, monitoring
foreign exchange exposures o f bank clients and strengthening supervision both for banks and jointly
with HANFAof non-bankingfinancial institutions.

 2004=2005, and in another 345 companies In 2008. We intend to sell or cancel the rcmainlng
 shares in 2007 and 2008, We ~ l a plrn to prlvctlze or liquidatecloseto 160 companies that have

 are mainly in tourism, agribusiness, ghipbuilding, and metal.proceeslng, and many of them are

 privatization process by eelling through tender or auctions ten companies 4th majority state

 have also started the process of privatfrstlonof three large loss-maken (two steel mills end one

performance and privatization of ago-kombinats, which WB have implemented from mid-2005
onwards.

5.       The Government has slso been working on drafting of the new Prlvetlzetion Law, which
would Introduce an EmployeeShere Ownanhip Plan (ESOP) model. However, it was decided to
forgo the adoption of the new Privatization h w in 2007, and to retaln the legal framework for

reformprogramfocuaes on these areas.

 13.     Slrsnglhmhg public rdminirbrtion: An efficient, skilled, and motivated public
administrationk a prmquisitefor effrctlve Implementationof tegulalioneand policies. Hem, we
need to pay attention to the size, struchrre and munenUonof our publlc seervlce. We recognize
the rbe of our public sector wage bill as a share of OW is hlgh by Internatlone1standards, and
hence plan to lake the followingdep, io nduceit M o w 10 percentof GDP by 2008, and improve
the efficiency of the public senice and adept It to the EU stenderda. At the same lime, it is
important to note that the EU accession proeesr puts infront of Croatia new chailenges In terms of
the quallflcatlon end the sire of the Croatian publicadministration:

 14.     First,we are committedto refwmlngour publicernployrnentlegislationand rationalizingthe
mwerd system, Disregard of ialrry regulations, and Inconsistant classtflcetlon of aimilar jobs
across ministries and agencies had contributed to the hlgh wage bill, whilr fragmented and too
compremedsalary structure made it dMcultto enract and retain skilled staff, As Ute flnt step to
address these problems, we enacted In 2005 a new Civil Service Law that provide6 incentives for
efficient, client-otfented,and performancebased public administration, One of our objeclives is to
dapolltklz~~rofrrraionallze clvll renrloe In 2001: that is addressed by the new Civil Service
                              the
Law (whosedepolltlclzatlon cleuses wlll become effeclive aner the 2007 Parllamentey elections),
but also through amendmenh enacted In 2008 and early 2007 to the laws on GovernmentOfficials,
Tnntfer of Power, and Conillct of Interestas well 88 the Sptom of State Adminisbetion which will
be adopted by the Parliament in AprillMay 2007. To unify and decompress salary structures, WB
Intend to submlt soon to the Patliammtthe new law on Civil Sefvice Selariea,end have It enacted
by September 2007, By September 2007, we also Intend to Introduce a new job classification
Byetem for the avilservice. Besides,we plan to do the same for the public service in 2008.

15.     Second, we are also going to ratlonallze our organizatlonal structures. The number of
minisbies and above all agencies has added to the fiscal prossum. We hamalready slarted this
process by reduclng the number of ministflea, However, we acknowledge that this is only the first
step in a wider ratknelirationproctm that should also Include the review of internalstructuresand
organization of rnlnirtries, the review d functions end organization of de-concentratedoffices of

 16.     Third, strengthening the p o l i process is one of our prloribes. To increase quality and
fiscal etfordebiYty of proposed polkie8, we amsndd In 2005 the Rulrr of P r d u r e of the

17.      InOcbber 2006, the Governmentappcovsd the policy reform proposalfor the new Law on
GeneralAdministrative Proadurn. The new law b n d e d am a legal bed8 for a modern, citizen-

comprehensively modernlad by introduction d new Inutitulee nndsolutions already attested Inthe
European dminQLnrtlve practke. Currently, there are more than 65 laws wlth speclal
edmlnbtrativeprocedunl provisions, This creates a situation confuelng for Judges, lawyers and
citizens and has negative consequencm for Iqal recurity and protection of citizens' individual

  19,     The Ministry of Finance has also been sleadily sttengthening budget oxecutlon processes,

suatainablllty of health finsnclng. Our goal will be to mduce total public spending on health to a
sustainable level of six percentof GDP by 2008. To achieve thla goal, yw haw taken twp seb of
measures lo rationalize health expenditures. First, to ruduce drug expenditures, we reduced In
2004-2005 time for dfug ngietratlon, expanded the number of eeneric drugs on the drug lid, and
implemented contracts with limib on presuiptlonsand referrals. Second and m a t importantly, to
improve fiscal wtainabilily of the health Insurance syrtcm, we decided to reduce exemptions to
cepayments, and restructure the complernmtpry health insuranca by eliminating co-payment
covcnge for drugs. We have undertaken the following actions in 2006 and 2007: (i) two lists of
drugs-wlth end wlthout co-payment requirementintroduced with target revenue8 of HRK 400-

Parliament passed amendments to he Pension Insurance Act, which integratd a pension
supplement hto the bask pension and minbbducd full nominal wage Indexatton. As a result,
pension expenditures as a share of ODP wen pmjected to Increase over the next ten yeam,
insteadofdeclining. At 13.4 percent of GDP In 2004, Croatian pension expenditureswere already
 much higher than the EU average of 10.4 percent, and replacement rates ccmparable to other
 European eounlrles at 42 percent Given other Ihcal pressures on the budget, soon to be

On February 16, 2007, the Executive Board o f the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with the Republic o f Croatia.

Background

Croatia has experienced solid growth and low inflation in recent years, with GDP growth averaging
around 4% percent in 2001-06 and headline inflation contained to 2-4 percent. But domestic demand
pressures and higher international energy prices caused the current account deficit to widen in2005-06.

Although external competitiveness appears adequate, export growth has been significantly below the
average in Croatia's peer countries, which have been more successful in attracting greenfield foreign
direct investment. Survey measures of competitiveness underscore structural weaknesses in the business
environment.

Policies in 2004-06, supported by a precautionary Stand-By Arrangement, sought to mitigate external
vulnerabilities by lowering Croatia's current account deficit and stabilizing the external debt-to-GDP
ratio. The authorities largely relied on fiscal adjustment, accompanied by measures by the Croatian
National Bank (CNB) to safeguard financial sector stability and discourage external debt accumulation by
banks. Reform of pension indexation, wage moderation, and investmentcuts contributed to a reduction in
the fiscal deficit from 6.1 percent o f GDP in 2003 to an estimated 2.8 percent in 2006. However, despite
these countervailing policy efforts, gross external debt and the current account deficit remain high.

While bank restructuring and privatization have strengthened the financial sector, strong credit expansion
and foreign exchange-induced credit risk have raised concerns. Large foreign banks own over 90 percent
o f the system, which i s well developed by regional standards. Financial soundness indicators show
adequate capitalization and asset quality. But intense competition among banks and easy access to credit
from foreign parents has contributed to a vigorous credit expansion that gained momentum over 200546.
The pace of the ongoing credit expansion increases the potential for asset quality to deteriorate in the
event of a downturn. Moreover, most households also seem exposed to currency risk: the bulk o f long-
term bank loans to households are linked to foreign currencies; and, even though households' foreign-
currency deposits are sizeable inthe aggregate, borrowers and savers may only partly overlap. Concerned
about safeguarding financial stability, the CNB responded with a series o f measures to slow the bank-
related portion o f capital inflows: a progressive increase in its marginal reserve requirement on banks'
foreign borrowing, broadening its base, and issuingvarious prudential measures and guidelines.

The large role of the state, slow progress in key structural reforms, and less-than-satisfactory conditions
for doing business have constrained economic performance. While recent progress in some transition
indicators has been significant, privatization and reform o f state-owned enterprises has lagged because o f

legal disputes, resistance o f vested interests, onerous investment and employment conditions, and a legal
fkamework favoring insiders-a      bias that the pending draft privatization law could worsen. In addition,
conditions for doing business are hampered by the heavy administrative burden and difficulties enforcing
property rights, with many problems at the local level.

The consultation focused on the interrelated issues of how to raise economic growth in Croatia and
addressingvulnerabilities.

ExecutiveBoardAssessment

Croatia's recent economic growth has been solid and inflation contained, and its progress with the EU
accession process has boosted investment prospects. However, the high external debt-to-GDP ratio, the
increase in short-term external debt, and the widening current account deficit are sources o f concern.
Directors welcomed the improvements inpolicies inrecent years, but noted that continued efforts will be
needed to address significant external vulnerabilities. They stressed the importance o f faster and deeper
structural reforms if Croatia is to boost potential growth. Progress in these areas should be high on the
agenda o f the next government.

To address external vulnerabilities and reduce the burden o f the large government on economic growth,
Directors recommended more ambitious fiscal consolidation than the authorities' medium-term plans
currently envisage. In this connection, it will be essential to resist spending pressures in the run-up to
elections in late 2007-including     through off-budget proposals to address spending demands-and         to
ensure a fiscal deficit in2007 no larger than the budget target. Measures are also needed to reduce public
expenditure permanently, with a view to providing room for cutting taxes, including social security
contributions, in order to boost growth while lowering the budget deficit. Action on the fiscal front will
also help narrow the large current account deficit and ensure a sustainable debt path. With Croatia's
expenditure-to-GDP ratio well above that o f peers, Directors saw considerable scope for savings, and
encouraged the next government to make significant progress inthis area.

Directors agreed that the present monetary framework remains appropriate for Croatia. Given the high
degree o f euroization, the openness o f the economy, and adequate external competitiveness, they
supported the tightly managed exchange rate. At the same time, noting the constraints this places on
monetary policy, Directors emphasized the importance o f other supporting policies, including structural
reforms, to strengthen competitiveness; fiscal consolidation, to redress macroeconomic imbalances; and
strong financial sector supervision, to address possible balance-sheet currency and maturity mismatches.

Directors welcomed the progress achieved by the authorities in improving financial sector supervision
and regulation. They commended the Croatian National Bank's efforts over the past few years to
strengthen the prudential regulation o f banks-which      remain profitable and well capitalized-as well as
the recent establishment and development of the independent nonbank supervisor. Directors shared the
authorities' concerns about the prudential and macroeconomic risks o f the ongoing rapid growth in bank
credit. They commended the Croatian National Bank for standing ready to address risks associated with
bank foreign borrowing and rapid credit growth. They nevertheless expressed reservations about the
recent reintroduction of direct credit controls, whose impact, including undesirable side-effects, will need
to be monitored closely. Directors encouraged the authorities to consider tighter prudential measures that
would also raise credit quality and reduce vulnerabilities.

Directors called for significant improvements in the business environment. Reducingthe administrative
burden, legal uncertainties, and corruption will be critical in the coming years for attracting a much-
needed increase in greenfieldforeign direct investment requiredto boost exports and economic growth
while lessening vulnerabilities. Noting the slow pace of recent structural reforms, Directors stressedthe
urgency of restructuring the loss-making shipyards, reforming the remaining public enterprises, and
removingimpedimentsto privatization.
