Country Background
:
Croatia’s economy has undergone a profound transformation since the 
country gained independence.  Market laws and institutions have been introduced and the real 
output decline in the first war-torn years of independence has been recovered.  In April 2004, the 
European Commission issued its opinion on Croatia’s application for European Union (EU) 
membership, recommending the European Council to open negotiations with Croatia.  In 
October 2005, EU accession negotiations were opened with Croatia. 
Since the 1999 recession, economic growth has picked up and inflation remained in single digits 
in Croatia.  Real GDP growth, after moderating in 2004 accelerated to 4.3 percent in 2005 and 
registered 4.8 percent in the first half of 2006.  Inflation has remained low at about three percent, 
despite increased oil prices.  
The economic recovery has been accompanied by growing external current account deficit, 
which increased to 6.3 percent of GDP in 2005 from 5.4 percent in 2004, and is expected to grow 
further in 2006, despite strong growth in exports of goods and services.  Gross external debt (in 
euro) stood at 81.6 percent of GDP in August 2006, up from 80 percent at end 2004, owing to 
strong capital inflows to domestic banks.  In 2005, in order to reduce foreign indebtness, the 
Government shifted to some extent from foreign to domestic sources of finance  
Fiscal policy has tightened in the past few years to arrest fast growth in public debt, but less than 
initially planned: the fiscal deficit declined from 4.9 percent in 2004 to 4.1 percent in 2005.  
While noteworthy, this is still above a sustainable level by about two percentage points of GDP, 
and the public debt-to-GDP ratio is still above 54 percent.  The 2006 revised budget targets a 
deficit of 3.0 percent of GDP, excluding one percent of GDP allocated for repayment of

pensioners’ debt, which will be financed by privatization receipts.  The size of the state remains 
high at near 50 percent of GDP, with public spending very high by international standards, and 
the wage bill, social spending, and public investment consuming more than 78 percent  
The size of the state remains significant and would need downsizing.  Private sector accounts for 
about 60 percent of the economy in Croatia, while for example in Poland, Lithuania, and 
Bulgaria the private sector share is 70 percent and in the Slovak Republic 75 percent.  In Croatia, 
a
large share of public and state-owned enterprises still remain to be privatized or liquidated, and 
direct state aid to the enterprise sector is high.    
To achieve sustained private sector led growth, the Government would need to create conditions 
that attract private investment and produce growth.  It has made substantial progress in adopting 
market and EU compatible legislation and regulations, reforming the banking sector, and 
liberalizing the trade, but serious weaknesses remain that would need to be addressed for Croatia 
to eventually accede EU.    
Project Objectives and Description: 
The Second Programmatic Adjustment Loan (PAL2) aims 
to support enhanced economic growth in Croatia through (i) improving the investment climate, 
and (ii) reducing the size and improving efficiency of the public sector.  Also, fulfillment of EU 
accession criteria and successful EU integration calls for intensive structural and institutional 
reforms.  PAL2 supports the government in this effort
.
PAL specifically supports: 
 
·
Improvements in the investment climate
 by continuing the re-launched privatization or 
liquidation of state-owned enterprises; improving financial discipline of enterprises; reducing 
the cost of doing business; and strengthening the judiciary. 
·
Efforts to improve governance
 by rationalizing and improving efficiency of public 
administration; and improving public expenditure management.  
·
Measures to enhance fiscal sustainability of sector programs 
by addressing health financing; 
rationalizing social benefits; improving fiscal and social sustainability of the pension system; 
and fiscal sustainability of railways operations.
 
Project Financing:  
Expected IBRD funding is to be determined. 
 
Environmental Aspects:
 
The proposed operation is an adjustment operation that does not 
require an ISDS or environmental assessment.  The Government will be addressing any potential 
environmental liability issues related to the privatization process and, as needed, the Bank will 
provide guidance on how this can be done in an effective manner.
