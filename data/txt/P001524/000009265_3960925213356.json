The main problem faced during the\n            implementation period was the award of the reconstruction\n            contracts for public buildings in Toamasina. The Ministry of\n            Public Works proposed to divide the first phase in small\n            contracts, in order to award these contracts to local film\n            without excessive risks, and the Bank agreed with this\n            approach. The result was relatively good, but with\n            additional costs and delays. Nevertheless, it was clear that\n            this amendment would not have been possible without the\n            decree 84/236, requested by the Bank to expedite\n            procurement. This was the only negative effect of this\n            decree, otherwise very useful."}, "docdt": "1992-05-11T00:00:00Z"}
