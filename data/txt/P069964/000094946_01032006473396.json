Colombia's current\n            economic crisis on the most vulnerable by protecting and\n            promoting poor children's human capital. This will be\n            accomplished by supporting poor families' investments\n            in their 0-17 year old children's health, nutrition,\n            and education in the face of sharply reduced incomes. The\n            project consists of six components: 1) The Educational Grant\n            Component will finance scholarships for children aged 7-17\n            years old belonging to families with SISBEN (Beneficiary\n            Selection System for Social Programs) 1 classification. 2)\n            The Health/Nutrition Grant Component will finance direct\n            cash grants to eligible families with 0-6 year old children,\n            who are not in the community nutrition and pre-school\n            program of the Colombian Institute of Family Welfare (ICBF).\n            3) The Project Management Component will finance the\n            operational activities of the temporary National\n            Coordinating Unit. 4) The Monitoring and Evaluation\n            Component will finance the external review and evaluation of\n            the performance and impact of the project. 5) The Promotion\n            and Dissemination Component will support public relation and\n            information campaign activities via mass media. 6) The\n            Health, Education, and Nutrition Services Delivery Component\n            consists of education, health, and nutrition services\n            provided by involved public institutions to eligible project\n            beneficiaries in the participating municipalities receiving\n            Bank-financed grants."}, "docdt": "2001-03-01T00:00:00Z"}
