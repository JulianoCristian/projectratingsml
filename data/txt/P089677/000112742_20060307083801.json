A\n            first loan was approved by the Bank Board on July 1, 2004.\n            The objectives of the proposed loan are to support the\n            Government's continuous efforts to improve the\n            effectiveness of public resource management, a key step for\n            increasing growth and improving the quality of public\n            services. The reform program supported by the P-DPLs\n            includes three components: (a) budgetary reforms designed to\n            improve the efficiency of public expenditure, (b) a reform\n            of civil service management, and (c) measures to keep the\n            wage bill at a sustainable level over time. All three\n            components have both short term impacts on the current\n            management systems and longer term effects resulting in a\n            structural change in these systems. In parallel, the reform\n            program is supported by a Programmatic Economic and Sector\n            Work (P-ESW) activity through which the Bank is providing\n            the Government with advice, training, and knowledge transfer\n            as required in the areas of budgetary management, civil\n            service reform, and wage bill containment."}, "docdt": "2006-02-21T00:00:00Z"}
