F. Results Framework Analysis

Program Development Objectives (from Program Document)
The original Program Development Objective of the PARL was to support the
Government#s efforts to improve the effectiveness of public resource management, a key
step for accelerated growth and poverty reduction. To achieve this objective, the PARL
was designed with components to support the medium-term objectives Government#s
Public Administration Reform Program.


                                             iv

  The aim of the PARP was to provide Morocco with a modern and gradually
deconcentrated administration that could contribute to the competitiveness of the
economy and to the sustainable development of the country while ensuring the viability
of its macroeconomic framework.
  The program#s original objectives can be summarized as follows:


  · Improving the Government#s efficiency of budget management.
  · Improving the Government#s efficiency in human resources management.

  · Consolidate and control the public payroll, so as to ensure a sustainable macro
framework in the medium term.


  To meet those three objectives, the government designed a program (see Annex 2) with
three components, which were reflected in the design of the PARL as described below.
While PARL I was mostly devoted to the creation of the MTEF committee and the
preparation of tools related to performance budgeting or the SSFs; PARL II was the
occasion for their implementation among a small group of pilot ministries, namely health,
agriculture and public works (equipment). Following such logic, PARL III was also
designed to eventually generalizing those instruments among all other ministries. Hence
whereas the original objectives remained unchanged through all loans, the actions
planned within their components were adjusted .

Revised Program Development Objectives (as approved by original approving authority)

1.     Program Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1.     Context at Appraisal

In 2002 the Government led, in cooperation with the Bank, a participative Public Expenditure
Review (PER) which showed multiple weaknesses of the budget and human resources
management systems. The findings of the PER led the government to engage in 2003 in the
preparation of a long-term Public Administration Reform Program (PARP). For that purpose, the
government requested the technical and financial assistance of both the Bank and the EU. Both
institutions agreed and helped the government design the reform program, which led to the
signing of the PARL I loan and a structural adjustment grant by the EU.

Implementation of reforms became urgent as over the years preceding the first project approval,
efforts to consolidate public finances were undermined by a series of exceptional wage increases,
subsidy expenditures mostly related to oil, arrears clearance and a weak revenue performance.
Fiscal deficits increased and remained large -- averaging 5.4 percent of GDP during 2000-04. A
rising wage bill attained 11.2 percent of GDP in 2004, up from 10.8 percent in 2000 resulting
from gradual wage increases to civil servants and security personnel. Subsidy expenditures
amounted to 1.6 percent of GDP on average over the 2000-2004 periods. Clearance of arrears
averaged 1 percent of GDP over 2001-2003. For their part, revenue performance went down
from 23.6 percent of GDP in 2000 to 21.6 percent in 2003.

The PARL I loan for  82.5 million (US$100 million equivalent), adopted by the Board on June
4, 2004, was the first in a series of three expected single-tranche Programmatic Development
Policy Loans (P-DPL) that would support the public administration reform framework initiated
by the government in 2003. Several triggers were met by December 2003 which justified the
approval of the first operation. Several key laws and decrees were prepared and their drafts
circulated into the administrative and political approval circuit. Decision on continuing financial
support for the next operations would be based on meeting triggers selected among the
benchmarks contained in the action matrix covering 2003-2005 (see Annex 2). As co-financier,
the EU granted support in the form of a Structural Adjustment Grant of 79 million, to be
disbursed in four yearly tranches.

The PARL II loan for  98.6 million (US$120 million equivalent), adopted by the Board on
March 23, 2006, was the second in the series. Its approval was based on meeting several triggers
designed under PARL I. Preparation of the PARL II loan was closely coordinated with the
European Union (EU) and a new partner: the African Development Bank (AfDB).

PARL II projected actions leading to PARL III would originally span over 2006 and 2007. This
is why December 31, 2007 was designated as the closing date of the loan.

However, PARL III was only successfully approved on May 15, 2008 as preparation took a bit
longer than planned mainly due to events related to the Moroccan elections in October 2007 and
the ensuing change of administration. For that reason, it was decided that PARL III would be the
first of a new series and that PARL II would be the last of the first series of programmatic loans
supporting the public Administration Reform program. Hence this ICR deals only with PARL I
and PARL II.

1.2.     Original Program Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (see Annexes
         2 and 3)

Public administration issues. Public administration in Morocco has been characterized by the
lack of a multi-year vision on budgeting and excessive centralization, which has resulted in slow
expenditure implementation. The culture of centralism in Morocco applies not only to budget
procedures, but also to the way central Ministries deal with the operations of their branch offices.
However, the public expenditure management system is basically sound, as was documented by
the Country Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA) completed in 2003. Expenditure
controls, reporting, and auditing are all reliable, including for human resources financial
management, which would facilitate their modernization.


Civil service is managed according to a tenure and corps system, with pay scales and grades
specific to each corps and with few performance incentives. It inhibits staff redeployment,
impedes administrative decentralization, and prevents the effective use of a merit-based
compensation system. Pay raises and promotions are usually decided based on seniority and
collective bargaining. As a result of the latter, a number of wage increases, called "exceptional
promotions" because they are not statutory, have been granted to sometimes large groups (all
teachers for instance) and have led to increases in salaries and even more so in bonuses. These
actions triggered discussions on exceptional salary realignment across the civil service to preserve
relative pay levels on behalf of staff in Ministries or corps that had not received the same
adjustment.     The last of these adjustments occurred in 2004 and ended in a process of
"competitive realignment," which spanned over five years, to reach its full impact in 2006.

For its part, the cost of the wage bill is high1 although civil service merely consists of 7 percent of
the labor force. The wage bill increase is the reflection of past recruitment policies, pay raises
resulting from collective bargaining, and "exceptional" promotions. Gross public wage increased
at a rate of 5.4 percent during 1990­2002, while the minimum wage evolved at a lower rate of 5.1
percent.    Considering the 3.8 percent inflation rate for the period, the increase for public
employees was around 1.6 percent in real terms per year after 1984.

Program overview and objectives. The original Program Development Objective of the PARL
was to support the Government's efforts to improve the effectiveness of public resource
management, a key step for accelerated growth and poverty reduction. To achieve this objective,
the PARL was designed with components to support the medium-term objectives Government's
Public Administration Reform Program.

The aim of the PARP was to provide Morocco with a modern and gradually deconcentrated
administration that could contribute to the competitiveness of the economy and to the sustainable
development of the country while ensuring the viability of its macroeconomic framework.

The program's original objectives can be summarized as follows:

      Improving the Government's efficiency of budget management.

      Improving the Government's efficiency in human resources management.



1For 1996­2000, the wage bill reached 10.7 percent of GDP, compared to an average 8.5 percent of GDP
in similar-income countries. It even rose to 12.8 percent in 2005.




                                                     2

      Consolidate and control the public payroll, so as to ensure a sustainable macro framework
         in the medium term.

To meet those three objectives, the government designed a program (see Annex 2) with three
components, which were reflected in the design of the PARL as described below. While PARL I
was mostly devoted to the creation of the MTEF committee and the preparation of tools related to
performance budgeting or the SSFs; PARL II was the occasion for their implementation among a
small group of pilot ministries, namely health, agriculture and public works (equipment).
Following such logic, PARL III was also designed to eventually generalizing those instruments
among all other ministries. Hence whereas the original objectives remained unchanged through
all loans, the actions planned within their components were adjusted.

Key Indicators

The results that were expected to be achieved in these areas are summarized below:

Improve Government Efficiency in Budget Resources Management

      A rolling medium-term expenditure framework based on sectoral MTEFs would govern
         budget design and be used to evaluate budget execution

      All ministries will have adopted flexible budgeting

      All pilot ministries will have produced performance reports

Improve Governmental Efficiency in Human Resource Management

      All ministries will have adopted recruitment plans

      All civil servants are integrated in the new pay scale

Consolidate and Control Public Payroll Decrease

      Number of budget positions created reduced to 7,000 by 2008

1.3.     Revised PDO

The program objectives remained unchanged through all two loans (see Annex 1).

1.4.     Original Policy Areas Supported by the Program

The original policy areas supported by PARL I correspond to three components, namely:


     (i) Improving the efficiency of budget management: The PARP aimed at improving the
     efficiency of budgetary management through greater budgetary visibility based on a Medium
     Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF); performance-based management supported by
     flexible budgeting and contracting arrangements between the central administration and
     deconcentrated ministerial branch units, while delegating greater responsibility to field
     managers in those units; and improved performance of public administration through the
     introduction of    new audit and control systems.          Thus, the policy measures address
     strengthening medium-term expenditure planning, adopting flexible budgeting procedures,
     delegating responsibilities to field offices, and strengthening reporting and evaluation.




                                                    3

   (ii) Improving the administration's efficiency in human resource management: The
   PARP for human resource management (HRM) aimed at: (i) reforming the management by
   reviewing and introducing strategic staffing frameworks (SSFs) as the main human resource
   planning and management tool; (ii) increasing transparency and equity in staff evaluation,
   remuneration, and promotion with the objective of improving staff recruitment, mobility,
   compensation and promotions systems, linking the evaluation of staff to his/her performance
   and career, and strengthening in-service training. The new HRM system would not only
   improve motivation, but it would also be the basis for a simplified, unified and coherent
   compensation framework compatible with the objective of keeping control over the wage bill
   in the medium term. The Policy measures aim to improve consistency between staffing and
   missions, as well as personnel management and in-service training.

   (iii)Keeping the wage bill under control: The need to correct the significant rise in the civil
   service wage bill of the mid-2000s was a central requirement of the PARP. Thus, whereas in
   the medium-term, reforms in the pay and promotion, strategic staffing, and evaluation
   systems should significantly facilitate the management of the wage bill; in the short term, the
   Government would curve the cost of the wage bill down. Measures adopted were an early
   retirement program and yearly quantitative ceilings on recruitment, promotion and temporary
   hiring. Finally, the authorities also planned to maintain the decision of zero net increase in
   the number of hired civil service staff. The policy measures address an early retirement
   program, and the setting up of recruitment and promotion caps.

The policy areas supported by PARL II continued at:

   (i) Improving governmental efficiency in budget resource management: Following the
   period of preparation, three main reforms were ready for being tested under PARP: i)
   introducing a medium-term perspective to budgeting; ii) preparing basic deconcentration
   tools and iii) introducing performance-based flexible budgeting, control and audit. Policy
   measures included developing MTEFs, introducing performance indicators, decentralizing
   budget management and streamlining public expenditure control.

   (ii) Improving governmental efficiency in human resource management: Following the
   period of preparation, the PARP worked on two fronts: (i) developing a Strategic Staffing
   Framework (Référentiel des Emplois et des Compétences-REC) in pilot ministries to improve
   consistency between staffing and missions; while (ii) continuing to develop new tools like
   creating a new job classification, preparing a new remuneration based in part on performance
   and the new job classification; and, in parallel, (iii) the current system kept streamlining by
   improving recruitment and mobility, changing rules for evaluation and promotion, and
   strengthening professional in-service training. Policy measures included introducing new
   management tools ­ strategic staffing frameworks, new job classification, new remuneration
   system - and improving the current management system.

   (iii)Consolidating and controlling public payroll: The PARP worked on three fronts: the
   predictability of the wage bill; the qualitative reprofiling of the civil service through the
   implementation of the early retirement program (ERP), the redeployment of existing staff,
   and a continuous ban on specific staff profiles; and the stabilization of the number of civil
   servants through a restrictive hiring policy. Policy measures included qualitative re-profiling
   of the civil service, and stabilization of the number of civil servants.




                                                  4

1.5.    Revised Policy Areas

There were no revised policy areas.

1.6.    Other significant changes

The only significant change adopted ex-post--and approved by OPCS--was the decision to stop
the series of programmatic loans after PARL II, due to implementation delays to meet the triggers
adopted for the third operation. Instead, PARL III was successfully prepared as a new operation
in a new series. Thus, PARL II, ended at an intermediary stage of a longer than originally
designed reform timeframe.

2.    Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1. Program Performance

The program's thrust was to continue preparing and developing new tools of public sector
management and to test them on a pilot basis, so as to generalize them to all ministries. Overall,
the program made good progress, due to strong Government ownership. Reforms have now
significantly expanded to all ministries and the new budget and human resource management
techniques are in the process of being generalized from pilot to common practice (see Table 1).
Following a successful early retirement program in 2005, the wage bill has also declined and is
under control. However, delays have been incurred in two areas: government' deconcentration
and the preparation of a new remuneration system.

Component A.1:          Greater visibility of policies and their medium-term budgetary
implications by placing budgetary allocation decisions in a multiyear framework

A global Medium Term Fiscal Framework (MTFF) was prepared for the 2007 and 2008 budgets.
In parallel, multiannual Programmatic Economic and Sector Work (P-ESW) has supported
Moroccan authorities with perspectives on MTEF best practices abroad, and helped Morocco
adapt these methodologies to its unique needs in a Methodological Guide. Through a ministerial
instruction, the Government created an Interministerial Budget Commission in charge of defining
the MTEF format and selecting ministries in charge of preparing pilot sectoral MTEFs. A
circular by the Prime Minister approved the dissemination of the methodology to all ministries,
inviting them to adopt the MTEF procedure part of their budget preparation process. Two P-
ESW-supported seminars were organized in April 2006 and in April 2007, providing an
opportunity to disseminate the MTEF methodology to all ministries. Finally, the ministries of
National Education, Housing, Health, and Equipment (Public works) first were chosen as the
pilots for draft sectoral MTEFs for 2007­09 (in 2006) (a PARL III trigger); while no less than 9
ministries prepared draft sectoral MTEFs for 2008-10 (in 2007, see Table 1).

Component A.2: Greater responsibility in budgetary programming and execution for
regional and provincial branch offices.

A.2.1      Generalizing budget flexibility and performance indicators

Twenty-seven ministries, representing about 70 percent of the government's capital expenditure
budget, had adopted flexible budgeting procedures and published performance indicators in the
2007 budget (see Table 1)2; a number well above the ministries required as a PARL III trigger.
This work is, however, at a preliminary stage: the preliminary performance indicators are too
numerous (more than 1,400) and often fail to respond to the achievement of objectives. There is
also a need to improve the quality and timeliness of the performance reports.




2According to MEF the number of ministries became 32 in 2008 and represented 78% of
the 2007 capital expenditure budget.

A.2.2    Increasing branch offices responsibility for deconcentrated budget management

Since 2007, a national strategy has been under preparation, upon the King's request, by a
Committee for Administrative De-concentration. The decision to prepare such strategy delayed,
de facto, the implementation of pilot de-concentration master plans (Schémas directeurs de la
déconcentration, SDDs), providing a detailed description of the responsibilities to be devolved to
branch offices. Thus, the national strategy became a prerequisite to mainstream the SDDs; whose
pilot implementation took place at the ministries of health and public works. Meanwhile, parallel
efforts in the budget de-concentration process is already yielding encouraging results: Over the
2005-07 period, the average rate of the de-concentrated budget rose to 38.3 percent, compared to
an average rate of 36.4 percent in 2001-04.

The Bank supported the preparation of a Methodological Guide for the SDDs through its P-ESW.
The draft guide was delivered on December 1, 2006. However, development and implementation
of SDDs by four ministries" has been postponed. Similarly, contracting arrangements between
central and branch offices is lagging in most Ministries. Only the High Commissariat for Water
and Forest and the Ministry of Health fully formalized objectives/means/outcomes contracts with
their regional offices in 2007. Accordingly, the PARL III trigger of concluding
objectives/resources/results-based contracts has not been met yet.

Component A.3: Improving public performance through internal auditing, evaluation, and
performance control

A.3.1    Introducing performance auditing

A performance audit manual that follows international standards was prepared and adopted in
December 2006. About 50 inspectors from both the General Inspectorate of Finance (Inspection
générale des finances, IGF) and 14 General Inspectorate of Ministries (IGMs) were trained using
this manual. Limited technical capacity of the IGMs constrained their development, which is
why joint IGF/IGMs performance audit missions in the 13 ministries that adopted flexible
budgeting in the 2004, 2005 and 2006 budgets started only in late 2007.

A.3.2    Improving basic financial management procedures

On budget accounting, two draft decrees revised the modalities of controls by the accountant, and
laid out a new Chart of Accounts that has yet to be adopted. The new methodology, still cash-
based introduced some elements of accrual accounting. On expenditure control, new manuals for
procurement and expenditure controls were prepared and disseminated by the Comptroller
General of Expenditures Commitments (Contrôle général des engagements de dépenses, CGED),
now merged to the General Treasury of the Kingdom (TGR) and still in charge of ex ante internal
controls. As a result, 5,200 agents were trained in both control offices and line ministries. The
TGR also completed its study streamlining expenditure control. The merging of the CGED with
the TGR is one of the main conclusions of the study. Finally, the Treasury has continued
developing integrated budget system applications. The final design for the (Integrated Budget
Management-GID) was adopted in November 2007, but it is still under testing.

Component B.1: HRM structural reform


B.1.1    Strategic Staffing Frameworks and related tools

In 2005, while the ministries of Agriculture and Equipement completed their pilot SSF (in French
known as RECs), the Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF) and the Ministry of Public
Sectors Modernization (MMSP) started their own ones as well. Those ministries have developed
tools for multiyear jobs and skills programming such as rolling jobs and skills management
scorecards (GPEECs), HR computerized databases, and rolling in-service training plans.
Completion of the RECs process took place in the first four ministries in 2006 and their initiation
in four additional Ministries in 2007 was a trigger for PARL III and met. These are the biggest
Ministries in terms of variety of jobs and staff numbers, representing at least 80 percent of total
civil service (Agriculture, Economic and General Affairs, Public Works, Economy and Finance,
National Education, Public Sector Modernization, and Water and Forest). All other ministries
started their SSfs in 2007 or 2008 and are in the process of mainstreaming this valuable activity.

B.1.2    New job classification

MMSP has worked to unify 22 statutes for all administrative jobs into three, but draft decrees
have not yet made their way to government councils. The MMSP also launched work on the job
classification in December 2006 (a trigger for PARL III).

B.1.3    New remuneration system

The Government finalized terms of reference for a one-year study on reforming the remuneration
system in 2006. The study will be informed by preliminary results of the SSFs and the GPECs.
Completion of the study (a trigger for PARL-III) has not been met as originally scheduled.
However, the study was finally launched in June 2008. Delays are partially attributable to
lengthy administrative procedures to secure financing for the study from donors and some
perceived degree of institutional resistance.

Component B.2: Current HRM system reform

B.2.1    Recruitment and mobility

A bill was prepared modifying the general civil service statutes reforming recruitment, mobility,
secondment, and external assignment. It has been voted by the Lower Chamber, but is now held
up by the Upper Chamber to explore at length financial incentives for redeployed employees.
Draft implementation decrees have been prepared, as new policies cannot be implemented
without the approval of the new law. In the meantime, a public job exchange website was
created, but with limited initial success.

B.2.2    Evaluation and promotion

Two decrees were adopted in early December 2005 reforming promotions and establishing new
and transparent procedures for performance evaluation. The first decree set quotas on promotion
opportunities and retroactively confirmed the special promotions that took place between 1996
and 2004. The second decree amplified the traditional procedure of annual rating with an
evaluation procedure that must take place at least once every two years and which is presented as
a prerequisite for any new promotion. Performance evaluation plays a determining role in
employees' eligibility for future promotions (half of the employee's rating is based on
performance). However, since no maximum quotas per rating category were defined as part of


                                                  8

the evaluation process per ministry and overall, a survey conducted by the MMSP showed that
ministries tend to push ratings to the higher levels, thus making necessary to revise the evaluation
procedure so as to introduce maximum quotas per ratings as well.

B.2.3    In-service training

A decree adopted in early December 2005 focuses on in-service training for civil servants and
government employees.        A national strategy was finalized and the MMSP identified the
engineering needs of in-service training, and disseminated a methodology for developing both an
in-service training plan and the specifications for acquiring in-service training. The formulation
of in-service training plans by sector ministries has been slower than expected, but it is
proceeding well.

Subprogram C: Consolidate and Control Public Payroll Decrease

Component C.1: Consolidation of the monitoring and control of the wage bill

A study supported by the P-ESW in 2007 concluded that the Government's model for forecasting
the wage bill is adequate, but has room for improvement. Three-year rolling projections of the
wage bill have been developed during 2005­08 and annually updated. However, increasing
deviations were registered ex post.       A comparison of actual expenditure (execution) with
appropriations listed in the budget (projection) yields the following positive forecasting
deviations: 2.6 percent for 2003, 3.2 percent for 2004, 2.0 percent for 2005, and 6.0 percent for
2006. The main reasons for deviations are unscheduled back payments originating from late and
cumulated registration of promotions and to a lesser extent, new hiring. However, coupled with
the effect of the Early Retirement Program (ERP), the wage bill decreased (see below).

Component C.2: Qualitative re-profiling of the civil service

The ERP was completed successfully in 2005/early 2006. Retirement was voluntary, although
ministries had the right to refuse applications where positions were considered crucial. More than
52,500 applications were received and about 38,600 were accepted (approximately 8 percent of
the civil service). The ERP has produced a relative improvement in the qualitative characteristics
of civil servants, especially by making the civil service younger due to the age structure of ERP
beneficiaries, the majority of whom are over 50 years of age. The ERP has also resulted in a
partial reduction of disparities in the regional distribution of civil servants at the expense of the
major regions (Casablanca, Fez, Rabat).

Component C.3: Stabilization of the number of civil servants

Beyond the prohibition on hiring low-skilled 1­4 category workers and the freeze on temporary
workers, since 2005, only the Prime Minister has now authority to open new positions. His ban
2006 letter also asked the Minister of Finance to ensure that the number of newly created
positions would strictly correspond to the average 7,000 positions freed up through normal
retirement starting with the 2007 budget. Some ministries, though, indirectly circumvented the
ceiling by filling the stock of vacant posts. As a result, and according to the Authorities, the stock
of vacant posts appeared reduced to about 14,000 positions in early 2008, down from 20,500
positions in 2005.

Overall, the status of compliance has been satisfactory with the list of prior actions (triggers)
leading to the approval of PARL I, II, and III (up to December 2007) described next (See Tables
2, 3 and 4).

2.2. Major Factors Affecting Implementation

A number of factors contributed to the broadly successful implementation of these operations and
helped to offset its risks. Some of these were associated to the operations themselves ­ including
strong Government ownership; effective donor coordination; and the valuable initial and
programmatic analytical work accompanying the operation. A few risk factors were mostly
exogenous to the loan's design, including the legislative calendar and other political events, and
were offset by proper mitigation measures.

Strong Government ownership: Government commitment has been the main factor behind the
launching of the public administration reform program and the effectiveness of its
implementation. The government has been in the driver's seat from the start and continues to
make the choices. During the initial dialogue between the donors and the government, the
government provided the main elements of the reform program, with the donors providing mostly
a realistic implementation program, based on international experience. During implementation,
the two involved agencies ­ the Directorate of Budget in the MEF and the Civil Service Reform
Directorate in the MMSP -- took charge of the program and its monitoring. Also the Prime
Minister office took a direct interest in the reform, requesting weekly reports and updates from
the implementation agency and putting pressure on members of government. The government
not only implemented the program thoroughly ­ albeit sometimes with delays ­ but added
important components, such as the reform of the control system, the fusion of the CGED and the
TGR, as well as the initiative for simplifying administrative procedures. The MMSP took the
initiative of creating the FOMAP (Fonds de Modernisation de l'Administation Publique, Public
Administration Modernizing Fund), a fund to finance innovation in public administration. The
fund is a matching fund: it co-finances projects presented by various administrations (ministries)
and matches the budget already raised by the agency.




                                                    12

Effectiveness of donor coordination: At the request of Government, this operation was prepared
jointly with the European Commission and the AfDB. The PARL I ICR has stressed, among
lessons for future operations, that donor coordination plays a major role in program success, and
the Bank should make great efforts to preserve this unified dialogue. The Bank's lending
operation and the European Commission Structural Adjustment Grants, and the AfDB support of
the Moroccan Government, are based on the same programmatic framework. This has benefited
the client by building credibility for the reforms, but also by focusing the attention and expertise
from multilateral donors on a complex program of reform. For the Bank and donors it has helped
to mitigate the risk of this type of reform and has reduced the supervisory burden on each donor.

Usefulness of initial analysis: The analytical basis for the PARLs series was mainly based on a
2002 participatory PER, which underpinned the key shortcomings in the public administration
program. An important feature of the PER was the constitution of two working groups made of
high level officials of various ministries, as well as from the MEF and MMSP as these groups
contributed to the identification of the reform agenda and engendered a willingness by entrenched
administrations to accept reform. The 2003 CFAA made a thorough review and diagnosis of the
Moroccan budgetary system and, to some extent, also contributed to identify a number of
priorities for reform.

Effectiveness of P-ESW and technical assistance: Since 2005, the companion P-ESW for public
administration reform in Morocco is the main analytical support of the Government's PARP
(programme d'appui à la réforme de l'administration publique).              The P-ESW provides
complementary policy advice, training and technical assistance. Activities so far have included,
inter alia: Support to the design of the overall reform program; a strategy paper on change
management; a workshop on performance budgeting; a guide on formulation of the MTEF and its
integration into the budgeting process; a guide on performance monitoring, the guide was
delivered to the client in June 2006; a methodological guide on de-concentration (administrative
decentralization), delivered in December, 2006, a study on the wage bill assessing modelling
capacity, delivered in 2007; and a methodological manual on the GPEC, delivered in 2008.

A few risk factors affected project design and implementation less positively. During the initial
stage of the reform, coordination to design and implement measures among ministries was
cumbersome and steering committees, which aimed to play that role, were ineffective, but with
the support of the factors described above, the Government overcame those initial difficulties.
Later on, the change of government, following the legislatives elections in end-2007, indirectly
contributed to further delays in the implementation of particular measures of the program, like
deconcentration. Indeed, the former authorities let incoming new authorities decide on the future
deconcentration strategy, and only once the promised royal directives on this topic were issued.

2.3. Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization


The design of the PARL monitoring mechanism was centered on the program's matrix of
actions and performance indicators. The PARL operations were launched before the Bank results
framework was developed and thus did not reflect that format.             For the early stages of
institutional reforms, the process indicators were appropriate, but over time, more emphasis was
needed on improvements in sector outcomes. As the QAG review of PARL-I pointed out, the
indicators were too much output indicators and not enough outcome indicators. In the course of
M&E.

The implementation was based on supervision missions by the Bank and the EU allowed a close
monitoring of the program's implementation. Whereas an inter-ministerial committee for reform



                                                 13

monitoring in fact seldom met, it de facto let the actual management of the reform to the two
implementing agencies: the Budget Directorate at the MEF and the Directorate for Civil Service
Reform at the MMSP. The poor performance of such Committee did not reflect problems of
limited ownership of the reform program, but rather inherited institutional weaknesses at
implementing coordination arrangements among government agencies.                      More specific
coordination and detailed monitoring was in fact devolved to ad-hoc committees such as the
technical committee to develop the methodology of MTEFs, or the conference of Human
Resources Directors, which led the implementation of the SSFs. No performance monitoring
organization of the program was appointed, which would have facilitated a more regular follow-
up of the matrix of indicators. Even so, the data collected during supervision missions were
reliable and useful, albeit with some delays, and Government's utilization of the data was
intensive. Over time, the Government has improved its development and slowly refined the
selection of indicators, and is using them more consistently to monitor its own program
component outputs and outcomes.

2.4. Next Phase/Follow-up Operation

PARLs I and II have been followed by PARL III, a 66 million euros (US$100 million) loan
approved by the Board on May 15, 2008. Its preparation took a bit longer than planned mainly
due to events related to the Moroccan elections in October 2007 and the ensuing change of
administration.   The new loan is considered as the first of a new series of programmatic
operations. It faces the broader challenges of: (a) generalizing and making fully operational pilot
experiences in budget management across the central government and introducing a new Organic
Budget Law; (b) completing the new HRM system, for which political decisions to approve a new
job classification and remunerations reform are now necessary for further progress; (c) pursuing
payroll cost reduction until it reaches its medium term target, and introducing budgetary ceilings
per ministry to preserve it in the medium term; and (d) introducing simplification of procedures
through e-government. All those reforms are expected to produce results from 2009 onward.
The Government has asked for continued Bank technical and financial support beyond the
completion of PARL III and IV.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

In order to define its objectives, the PARP's design remains consistent with the Government's
reform agenda and the supporting Bank country assistance strategy(CAS). The design was based
on i) government input; ii) selectivity; iii) progressiveness; and iv) flexibility, allowance for trial
and error. Most ideas in the reform program had been conceived initially by government experts
(budget flexibility cum performance indicators, strategic staffing frameworks, early retirement
program).    The discussions with EU/Bank teams were aimed at putting those ideas in a
comprehensive, consistent framework that could be implemented over time, and duly supported
by donors' country strategies, with the addition of only a few features such as the MTEF. Over
time, PARP reforms remain resilient and are in the process of consolidation. In addition,
selectivity was ensured by keeping the list of new instruments simple and limited to what could
be implemented by the Moroccan administration. All reforms have been developed over several
years, allowing for a progressive adaptation to new features. By going progressively, reforms
incurred less risk to be rejected and abandoned. Thus, most reforms (performance budgets,
strategic frameworks, performance auditing, administrative deconcentration...) were done on a
pilot basis where only a small number of ministries adopted a new instrument voluntarily, only to
be gradually joined by others in the following years. For instance, the adoption of flexible
budgeting was first piloted by the Ministry of Health. And in 2007, mostly all ministries had



                                                 14

   adopted it. Thus, the pilot approach was generally successful because it benefited from the
   learning experience of pilot ministries, allowing the mainstreaming stage to avoid errors or
   misconceptions met at the pilot stage.

   PARL I was designed as a response to the government's request for support to its Public
   Administration Reform Program addressed jointly to the Bank and the EU. The design of the
   PARL and identification of its objectives were the result of a cooperative work between the
   government, the Bank and the EU. PARL I was fully consistent with the Country Asssitance
   Strategy (CAS) 2001-04, which stressed, inter alia, the reform of the state, the heavy burden of
   the wage bill, the fiscal sustainability issue, institutional building, and the efficiency of public
   expenditures.

   PARL II was designed in consistency with the CAS 2005-08 adopted in May 2005. It
   explicitly addresses outcome 1.2: Increase efficiency of public administration as the main
   thrust of the operation. It also addresses strategic objective 2: Increase access to basic
   services by poor and marginalized groups by promoting decentralization and
   accountability for results. Finally, the PARL II is also linked to the underlying theme of
   the whole CAS, which is improved governance, transparency and accountability. The
   program documents identified a number of risks, as well as reasonable mitigating factors
   offsetting those risks, as shown in Table 5 below. The risk of not meeting the target payroll to
   GDP ratio reduction was correctly identified, because of all expected union pressures to increase
   salaries. However, this risk did not materialize because of the successful implementation of the
   ERP, careful staff recruitment management by the Prime Minister office, and reforms on hiring
   and promotion policies. The risk of stalling reforms was also correctly identified, especially
   during the 2007 election year, but it was partly overcome due to the activism of the implementing
   agencies at the MEF and the MMSP.

While the PARLs were well designed and implemented operations that was clearly aligned with
both the Bank and the borrower's objectives, they did suffer from a number of weaknesses. A
principal weakness was the fact that the program did not include a more explicit link between the
technical actions supported by the program and how these would actually impact on and improve
outcomes. The indicators of the PARL I program document (as well as for PARL II) were
essentially outputs that did little to monitor change (if any) on outcomes related to public better
service delivery. Although it is often difficult to identify suitable outcomes to be monitored
during the implementation of a public administration reform program, the project documents
should have attempted to include more explicit outcomes.

Another weakness was that the PARLs did not identify clearly enough the key reason, too high
salaries or excess number of public officials, justifying the reduction of the wage bill. While an
expensive payroll was correctly identified as a major concern, PARL documents do not explain
why wage bill reduction was only addressed through the angle of reducing the number of civil
servants and not through the level of public wages as well.

Finally, the PARLs focused on core technical aspects of PFM reforms, but it did not emphasize
enough on the need for greater budget transparency and government accountability.

3.2 Achievement of Program Development Objectives

The key policy achievements that were achieved under the PARL I and II operations are
discussed below. More detailed information on actual outputs and outcomes figures in Annex I.

Overall Outcomes of PARL I and PARL II: While it is generally difficult to identify proper
outcome indicators for public administration reform. The matrixes in PARL-I and II mostly
addressed results (outputs) in terms of reforms implemented and modernized tools adopted by the
various public entities, mostly on a pilot basis. As the reform now evolves from the pilot to the
mainstreaming stage, it is useful to look ex post at a number of indicators that may give some
insight into how well reforms have succeeded.

During 2004­07, the Government of Morocco undertook reforms on a vast front including budget
modernization, de-concentration, simplification of the expenditure control system, strategic
staffing, remuneration unification and payroll control. To do that, the Government mostly
proceeded on a voluntary/pilot basis. In a sense, the growing number of pilots for each new
instrument was an indicator of reform internalization. Some reforms have taken longer than
others to start, mostly due to political or bureaucratic constraints. This was the case for the pilot
MTEFs or performance auditing, which went against administrative traditions; administrative
deconcentration has been put on hold, while the higher authorities look for the most politically
feasible formula; officials are taking their time with reform in the remuneration system, the most
sensitive area of reform; and payroll control is decreasingly jeopardized by "exceptional
promotions" meant to appease certain categories of public servants.

Before looking at outcomes for each component of the program in Table 6, it is worth looking at
existing global comparative indicators and see if they offer some insight into how public
administration management has progressed during this decade. To this end, the Index of the
Quality of Government of the Bank's Economic Development Prospects presents country
rankings since 2000. According to this source, Morocco appears as a solid reformer in this field.
Its index, as a percentile rank relative to other countries of the world is 74 in 2007 (100 meaning
best environment), which is a significant (and steady) improvement over its rating of 58 in 2000.
This index also contrasts with the deterioration of the MENA regional index from 48 to 45 in the
same period. The index combines findings from three different sources: The Political Risk
Services, the Heritage Foundation, and the Bank's Doing Business indicators.

Outcomes by Operation:

PARL I: Overall, the PARL I program was successful in meeting its objectives, despite a few
shortcomings, discussed below. The overall macro economic framework was satisfactory with the
exception of the rise in the ratio of the wage bill (see Table 7 in section 3.4 below). Most



                                                  17

conditions, triggers and targets for 2004 identified in the policy matrix and prior actions for the
PARL II were met without modifications and few exceptions.

A. Improving the efficiency of budget expenditures by deconcentrating expenditure and
accountability and introducing performance budgeting and auditing

MTEF. The process associated with the pilot development of sector MTEFs was broadly
implemented. Its adoption required the creation of an interministerial Commission through a
letter signed by the prime Minister on June 30, 2005. Work under this Commission was framed
by the terms of reference jointly prepared with World Bank staff. The Commission included
representatives from the ministries of Finance, Education, Public Works (Equipement), Transport
and Health. The Ministry of Health first experimented with the MTEF approach in 2003. Four
other ministries ­ Finance, Planning, Agriculture and Fisheries -- adopted the approach for their
2004 budget.

Flexible Budgeting. The Minister of Health was the first to test flexible budgeting in 2002. And
in 2003-04, four other ministries followed (Planning, Finance, Fishing and Agriculture). By end
2005, a total of 14 ministries, representing 40 percent of the capital expenditure budget, had
adopted flexible budgeting.

Deconcentration. Decree No.2-05-1369 was issued on December 2, 2005 and it established the
overall guiding framework that defines the administrative organization, the units distribution, and
the personnel responsibilities between central entities and deconcentrated units. Its general
principle is that executive functions will be assigned to deconcentrated services, and central
entities will remain focused on strategic, conceptual and regulatory functions. The Decree
foresees the design of ministerial Deconcentrated Master Plans to be adopted in the next 2 to 5
years.

Performance Audit. The General Inspectorate of Finance produced a manual of performance
auditing. However, the procurement associated with the production and dissemination of the
manual showed delays due to an inconclusive tender. Regarding the strengthening of the capacity
of the IGMs on performance auditing, it was conducted in parallel as 40 inspectors within
ministries were trained.

Expenditure control. The Comptroller's office produced manuals on procurement and on
expenditure commitment procedures. About 5,200 officials were trained on the use of those
manuals. In addition, a procedural reform of expenditure commitments took place. And in 2005,
a call for tenders was launched so as to prepare a study on the reform of the expenditure control
system.

B. Implementing civil service reform

The bulk of the work in this component was in sub-component B1, devoted to the design of new
HRM instruments. This type of work tends to be extremely time and resource consuming. The
Government created an implementing structure headed by the highest levels of Government, and
which met regularly on average every six months. The requirements of component B are mostly
associated with creating a legal and regulatory framework, so as to enable reform at a later stage.
Most of these requirements were met. Only subcomponent B3 was unsatisfactory because the
Government failed to approve a draft decree on in-service training.




                                                18

C. Consolidation and control of the public payroll

Measures identified under this component aimed to keep the wage bill under control or even
reduce it in the interim. They included an early retirement mechanism, and yearly quantitative
measures on recruitment and promotion aimed at avoiding promotion bottlenecks experienced
under the current extremely restrictive system. The setting up of a voluntary early retirement
mechanism was studied by the MEF on the assumption of 20,000 to 60,000 departures and these
assumptions had been tested. However, only 6,700 civil servants retired under the initial scheme
layout for the years 2004. This number is well below the anticipated minimum level of 20,000
employees expected to exit the civil service. The early retirement scheme did not prevent the
wage bill to increase during PARL I, which was a concern.

As a result, in 2005 and in the context of PARL-II, the early retirement scheme benefits were
enhanced. Eligibility for the program was extended to all levels of civil service, contrasting with
the previous scheme which applied only to levels 1-9 and banned the participation of senior
servants. Benefits were increased from 1 to 1.5 months of gross compensation per year of service
with a ceiling of 36 months for grades 6 and over. Additionally, the 2005 Budget Law added a
pension increase of 2.5% by year of service. The new structure of the early retirement program
expected to attract 8-10,000 employees in 2005, but their actual number was almost five time
higher than that, which had a great impact on payroll. In addition, and order to enforce greater
control over the wage bill, a decree was passed for a hiring freeze at the levels 1-4 in 2004,
followed by a similar annual provision since the 2005 Budget Law. In the same vein, a ministerial
circular was produced to prohibit the hiring of temporary personnel in accordance to the gradual
elimination of such posts, which was also included annually since the 2005 Budget Law. These
measures contributed to frame hiring policies and authorities regained control over the wage bill.

PARL II: Overall, the PARL II program was also successful in meeting its objectives. The
overall macro economic framework was satisfactory. Most conditions, triggers and targets for
2006-2007 identified in the policy matrix and prior actions for the PARL III were met without
modifications and only two exceptions. The main exception was the delay in launching the study
on the reform of the remuneration system. The study is now launched. The other exception
regarded delay in the implementation of administrative deconcentration schemes due to political
constraints, as explained above.

A: Improve governmental efficiency in budget resources management

The methodology for preparing sector MTEFs was adopted on a participatory basis.               The
methodological guide was disseminated by a Prime Ministerial circular. A dozen departments
prepared three-year MTEFs in 2007. In parallel, the Ministry of Finance prepared three-year
projections of public finance aggregates with reasonably good quality of the forecasts, whose
actual deviations were 114 percent for revenue and 107 percent for expenditures). However,
MTEFs remain, with a few exceptions, indicative, have little quantitative implications and are not
adjusted on a rolling basis.    They also need to be more closely associated to the budget
preparation. Their consistency with future budgets should be measured by selected ratios to be
put in place, which would allow their adjustment on a rolling basis, followed by an explanation
on nthe reason for such a deviation.

Starting on a pilot basis in 2002 with the Ministry of Health, the joint use of budget flexibility
mechanisms (globalisation des crédits) with performance indicators has been adopted by all
departments in 2008. The use of the flexible mechanisms rapidly expanded among ministries
entitled to use it. And in a limited number of cases, a remarkable impact in terms of increased
absorptive capacity has been observed (from 34 percent and 56 percent of eligible appropriations


                                               19

for the Ministry of Health and Public Works (Equipment) in 2003, to 40 percent and 68 percent
in 2005 for both ministries respectively in 2005).

For reasons presented above, de-concentration has been lagging behind, with very few ministries
having prepared master plans for de-concentration or practicing internal contracting.           And
although all ministries present indicators together with their budget requests, their quality cannot
yet be judged adequately because performance audits only started in end-2007 and their reports
have not yet been released.

On control, the priority has been simplifying the ex ante control system.            Controllers of
commitments and payments have been regrouped, with a new methodology intended to further
simplify and shorten the control circuit.     As a result, procurement and payment lags have
diminished, but the systematic calculation of those lags has not yet been put in place. On budget
reporting, progress can be seen on the delays for preparing the final accounts: it took the MEF 4.5
years to prepare the draft 2000 final accounts; and this lag has more than halved to 2 years for the
2005 accounts.

B: Improve Governmental Efficiency in Human Resources Management

A manual on SSFs (RECs) was prepared. As of end 2007, seven departments among the largest
had prepared SSFs, with many others starting the development. Other reforms include the reform
of the system of promotions, which has streamlined promotions (goulot d'étranglement) and
gradually prevented the massive promotions of the past. The outcome indicators put in place in
that component should capture improvements in performance and management, despite these
tools are still under elaboration.

C: Consolidate and Control Public Payroll

The ERP achieved most of its quantitative and financial objectives. The number of participants
and beneficiaries exceeded expectations, with more than 50,500 of the former (or 10 percent of
the central government civil service) and almost 38,600 for the latter (7.6 percent of civil
servants). Taking into account all the positive and negative financial impacts, especially the one-
off severance payment (2.3 percent of GDP) and its effects on the pension fund, the ERP yielded
a global cumulated positive savings estimated at 5.9 percent of GDP (3.7 percent of GDP if
discounted using a 5 percent rate). On the budget, starting from 2006, net annual savings are 0.6
percent of GDP. In addition, the qualitative outcome of the ERP is quite positive: it has allowed
staff rotation in the public administration and permitted younger people to take new
responsibilities. As a result a gain in administrative efficiency should have been achieved. The
change in the geographic composition of departures has also been positive, especially for Health
and Education: in those ministries, most departures come from regions that were overstaffed,
while in the poorest places, teachers and physicians were not permitted to leave under the ERP.

3.3 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

 Rating:
 PARL I       Satisfactory
 PARL II      Satisfactory

Both operations are rated satisfactory.         The operations' development objectives were
satisfactorily achieved, and, as discussed above, the PARLs' design and outcomes were highly
relevant to country circumstances and development priorities and were highly consistent with
Bank strategies and goals. .

PARL I

The design of the operation was satisfactory for meeting the objectives of increasing the
efficiency of the management of budget resources, increasing the efficiency of HRM, and starting
to control the public wage bill. PARL II built on the work of PARL I and addressed core
development needs identified in the CAS. It strengthened institutions and local capacity for using
the instruments of new management systems as the means for increasing the efficiency of public
resources. Pilot ministries committed to performance auditing and de-concentration of budgets,
and in exchange were given greater flexibility in allocating their budgets and managing their
personnel.

The outcomes of PARL II were also satisfactory. The increases in sector budget execution rates
resulting from higher budget flexibility, the decline in delays for accounts preparation, and
simplifications in the expenditure circuit and ex ante controls demonstrated an immediate impact
on the efficiency of public spending. The ensuring publication of public accounts showed an
immediate impact on transparency and accountability. The development and dissemination of
new procedures manuals allowed the training of agents in performance auditing. Despite their
initial stages, the development of MTEFs, budget flexibility rules and performance indicators
should have also introduced modern tools to better evaluate public programs and therefore
allocate public funds more effectively. Budget de-concentration has also moved more slowly
than expected, but critical tools are ready and should eventually provide for more efficient
monitoring of performance in service delivering by involving the interested beneficiaries, once
the process accelerates.

Human Resources Management reform has moved more slowly and encountered more
institutional sensitivities. SSFs have been adopted in pilot ministries providing multi-year jobs
and skill plans, and new decrees now govern promotions and performance evaluation procedures.
These will support a professionalized and skills-based civil service. Further, the implementation
of new HRM software and in-service training strategies will improve the efficiency of public
service. Other initiatives on job classification, public wages, and modifications of the civil
service statutes are still making their way through the political system. Even in a sensitive
environment for these reforms, the PARLs have succeeded in bringing the key decisions to the
decision-makers where they must be faced eventually.

Under PARL II, following a bad outcome under PARL I, the Government finally could reverse
cause to reaching its target wage bill. The ratio of the wage bill to GDP declined from 11.7 per
cent in 2005 to 10.9 percent in 2006 and 10.7 in 2007

3.4 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Macroeconomic performance and policies              3 : The Government maintained strong
macroeconomic conditions. Real GDP growth is estimated to have fallen to 2.7 percent in 2007
due to a sharp drought-induced fall in cereal production (following a bumper crop in 2006).
However, nonagricultural GDP growth remained above 5.5 percent, driven by robust activity in
both the manufacturing and service sectors. The external position remained comfortable. With
strong demand coupled with higher food imports and fuel prices, the external current account
balance turned slightly negative for the first time in seven years. However, this was more than

offset by rising capital inflows, notably of foreign direct investment, and as a result, foreign gross
reserves of the Central Bank rose to $28 billion at end-2007, equivalent to 8.6 months of imports
(GNFS). External debt continued to decline and the standard debt sustainability analysis indicates
that external vulnerabilities were limited.

Consolidation of public finances continued in 2007. The deficit dropped to 0.6 percent4 of GDP
in 2007, from 2.5 percent in 2006, reflecting strong tax and nontax receipts, the impact of the
successful implementation of the early retirement program for civil servants, and restraint on
other categories of spending. The stock of public debt remained at about 53.6 percent of GDP,
down from 62 percent in 2005. Inflation fell in 2007, despite a surge in credit to the private sector.
Average inflation fell to 2 percent from 3.3 percent in 2006, due in part to limited pass-through

on administered petroleum and food prices. Asset prices rose sharply in 2007 and credit growth
was very rapid on the back of strong nonagricultural growth.

(b) Poverty, Gender and Social Impact Assessment5: The gender and social impact of reforms
supported by PARLs I and II are mostly related to the impact of the Early Retirement Program
(ERP): The program resulted in an overall net positive increase in savings, wealth and welfare,
particularly of ERP participants, because of the severance payments granted, thus broadly
offsetting the negative consumption effect of their wage lost. Service delivery resulting from the
ERP is expected to have gradually improved, despite minor concerns on service coverage in the
rural areas. Initially, the departure of teachers and health workers could have temporarily worsen
the shortage of the supply of public servants, especially teachers and health workers in the rural
areas. However, studies show that understaffing in those areas existed long before the ERP and
that overstaffing was rather concentrated in administrative staff located in urban areas--mainly
Rabat and Casablanca--with very low poverty incidence and relatively good access to services.

Overall, there are more gainers than losers from the implementation of the PARL reforms. Table
8 below summarizes the impact of PARL based on the existing knowledge of transmission
channels, groups or institutions be affected. Overall, the effects are not likely to be large. But
there are both positive and negative effects. For the poor, especially rural children and rural
women, the risk of negative impacts comes from the localized effects on public services (health
and education) from ERP discussed above. This is why the program only implicitly had some
minor degree of gender bias. The negative effects on the non-poor have been contained and have
not led to any serious opposition to the reform efforts. The Government is very keen to mitigate
the negative social impacts. The program of reforms itself was aiming at generating productivity
gains in the delivery of public services, increase accountability and improve quality of services,
thus mitigating temporary effects coming from the reduction of the personnel.

(c)Institutional Development Impact: The main impact of the PARL operation during the review
period has consisted in creating an environment conducive for reforms and, to a lesser extent, in
strengthening inter-ministerial collaboration. The loan and the accompanying P-ESW have served
as a vehicle for the articulation of a comprehensive medium-term framework for economic policy
and institutional reform, a rallying device to push the implementation of key measures in the
public sector reform program.

(d) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts. The irreversibility of the budget system reforms
has led to a new perception of their political role, as well as to shifting political forces hoping to
shape the next round of reforms. However, the reform is now bumping up against the need of
regulatory changes. The Loi organique de finance and statutes affecting the civil service and
contracting for services are often mentioned as candidates for revision in order to accommodate
the comprehensive vision for performance-based budgeting. In addition, when SSFs and HRM
software will have been fully implemented, the resulting information could help ensure that any
future retrenchments or broad-based salary increases are managed in way that increases
productivity and keeps the wage bill within its medium term target.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

 Rating:

 PARL I       Moderate
 PARL II      Moderate

Several factors indicate a moderate assessment of the risk to Development Outcome of PARLs.
First is the degree of government initiative in both launching and in sustaining public sector
reforms. The authorities have readily identified the constraints to moving the reform forward, but
often constrained to propose solutions that are politically feasible.

Second, several institutions have been created to support the reforms, with participation from
diverse parts of the government, but their performance has been mixed. The interministerial
committee to monitor all components, the Committee for Administrative De-concentration, and
the committee to support the design and implementation of MTEFs did not fully play their role.
Third, the reforms have contributed to maintain macroeconomic stability by providing the
government with means to manage the wage bill.

These factors notwithstanding, the reforms could still face a number of risks. The political
sensitivities surrounding change in civil service rules could delay the critical HRM reforms and
leave managers without enough tools to respond to demands to raise performance. The new
political constellation, including the relatively new Parliament, could hold up needed changes to
the Organic Budget Law and to deconcentration. Recent challenges in the international economic
environment have prompted a dialogue social on issues of subsidies and the social allocation of
public resources, and these may heighten the role of public employment in promoting social
welfare. Pressures for political spending or political promotions could be revived.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

 Rating:

 PARL I       Satisfactory
 PARL II      Satisfactory

PARL I: The Bank's performance is rated satisfactory. The design choice of a series of single
tranche adjustment which are governed by a medium term program with triggers for each
subsequent operation has allowed for flexibility in achieving programmatic objectives. This
design maintains donor leverage and reinforces the hand of the reformers in the government.
Throughout preparation and implementation the Bank played a catalytic role in gathering ideas
and people, as well as transferring knowledge and debunking problems and contentious issues.
The design of the program greatly benefited from a base of analytical work done in a highly
participatory way as part of the PER while implementation of the PARL was aided by analytical
work undertaken under the PESW and close supervision of the PARL which provided follow-up
missions, and a mid-term review.

PARL II: Overall, Bank performance was satisfactory during loan preparation and appraisal.
Continuously an active policy dialogue permitted satisfactory completion of triggers, while
effectively staging PARL II as the instrument to develop tools initiated as pilots during PARL I.
The design of the program benefited from the analytical work done under the P-ESW and close
supervision of PARL I. Lessons from PARL I and from the Quality enhancement Assessment
(QEA) were also well taken into account. For example, both recommended using information
about the civil service to improve precision on the packages offered to public employees
volunteering for early retirement. This allowed for the wage bill component to meet quantitative
targets missed under PARL I. The Bank team also accompanied the Government through flexible
adjustments in the program which helped ensure its successful implementation

(b) Quality of Supervision

  Rating

 PARL I        Satisfactory
 PARL II       Satisfactory

The PARL implementation has been supervised thoroughly by Bank and EU teams. Each
institution made about two supervision missions per year, with detailed supervision reports shared
by both institutions. The findings were discussed with government and corrective measures taken
when needed. A positive example was the close elaboration and ensuing training in introducing
new tools--like the MTEF manuals or the strategic staffing tables--jointly done with authorities.
In addition, the Bank TTL was resident in Morocco and could devote time to supervision and
assistance to the government. Further, the various members of the project team, with expertise in
different areas, followed the progress in the different components in detail. Work on improving
sectoral budgets was partly coordinated with Bank or EU staff following those sectors. This
careful supervision helped to build what is generally considered an excellent relation between the
client and the Bank.       IBRD missions systematically maintained contact with all project
stakeholders ­ government officials, unions, ­ thus removing potential roadblocks to project
implementation. The joint work deepened the cooperation with the EU, while cooperation links
were established with the AfDB, which eventually became the third partner in the program.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

As Bank performance for both quality at entry and supervision was rated satisfactory, overall
Bank performance is rated satisfactory in accordance with the ICRR harmonized evaluation
criteria guidelines.

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance

  Rating

 PARL I        Satisfactory
 PARL II       Satisfactory

PARL I: The Moroccan Government's performance is rated satisfactory. The Borrower took
ownership of the reform effort and reiterated its willingness to reform at all levels of the
executive.    To achieve the reform goals, the Government appointed top official as main
counterpart's coordinators, involved excellent professionals in the work of the P-ESW, and



                                                26

worked diligently to solve problems and arrive to a comprehensive multi faceted program. The
Government had also overcome some initial difficulty in achieving cooperation along different
ministries in the context of a multi-pronged operation, and this has improved during
implementation.

PARL II: Government performance was satisfactory. Government instigated the reforms and
took the initiative to coordinate the reforms across the various ministries in order to make the
different components work together. Government also launched other initiatives to support the
PARL II program and make it more successful. These include several initiatives in Treasury
management, HR management, and the administration of public subsidies. The design of the
Early Retirement Program, for example, was revised in order to make sure the macro targets were
met. Even so, the design of de-concentration plans could be accelerated with greater government
attention. Government also recognizes the slow pace of the HRM reforms and the political
constraints they face. They may need to focus on building coalitions and reaching the political
consensus needed to approve changes in certain basic laws.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

  Rating

 PARL I        Satisfactory
 PARL II       Satisfactory

PARL I: The MEF and the MMSP were constructive counterparts for the Bank and other donors
throughout preparation and implementation. They were effective in managing the program
despite the difficulties associated with cooperating across government departments. The reform
program placed a significant burden on the MOF, which led sometimes to incomplete reporting
practices. In those instances, the Bank was able to engage such ministry significantly and
problems were solved quickly and without controversies.

PARL II: The two implementing agencies ­ the Budget Directorate in MEF, and the Civil
Service Reform Directorate in MMSP ­ did an excellent job implementing the reform and
coordinating with each other and the numerous public administrations involved.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

 Rating:

 PARL I       Satisfactory
 PARL II      Satisfactory

This rating is rated satisfactory as both government performance and implementation agencies
performance are rated satisfactory.

This ICR is delivered with a significant delay explained by three reasons: First, the document was
originally unscheduled and only required once OPCS agreed to stop the series at PARL II; second,
unexpected lags occurred in its preparation linked to delays in its delivery to the authorities and in
the collection of their response; and third, change in the Bank task team leader.

6. Lessons Learned

Ensuring ownership at the highest levels of government as well as at the technical levels is
essential for increasing commitment to the project development objectives and facilitating
implementation.      This is particularly true for the two areas that have suffered delays:
deconcentration and reform of the remuneration system.

The link between the effects of the HRM reform program and its impact on the size of the wage
bill has not been strong and future PARLs should consider how to strengthen this linkage.
Containing the wage bill appears to have been less difficult than anticipated since program
measures were completed. Yet resisting political pressure to raise salaries is difficult for any
government and should be prevented with sound analytical capacity and adequate solutions.

Reforms requiring interministerial coordination have moved slowly; thus attention needs to be
placed on how to strengthen coordination. The spirit of public sector reform in Morocco lies in
adequate coordination across ministries.

The programmatic adjustment loan appears to be the appropriate instrument for supporting public
sector reforms in Morocco as the country is proceeding step by step in a medium term program.
Morocco is a good case of using successive single tranche adjustment loans as an effective way to
assist structural reform, provided there is a link to an agreed medium-term reform program with
well broadly defined milestones and transparent triggers per subsequent operation.

Continuing to support the program through the PESW is important but must be tailored
appropriately on a rolling basis and be flexible to short-term demands. The Bank's AAA and
ESW program have played a key part in helping Morocco prepare and internalize the necessary
reforms. This program started in 1995. Technical assistance, short policy notes or convening
roundtables or workshops are all valuable forms of assistance but need be tailored appropriately
to new demands.

Donor coordination in Morocco has played a major role in program success and the Bank should
make great efforts to preserve an unified dialogue. The Bank's lending operation, the EU
structural adjustment grants, and the AfDB's lending support of the Moroccan government are
based on the same programmatic framework. This has benefited the client by building credibility
for the reforms, but also focusing on a unified expertise from multilateral donors in support to a
complex program of reform. For the Bank and donors, this has also helped to mitigate the
reputational risk of this type of reform and has reduced the supervisory burden on each donor.

Key tools for implementing results-based management at the deconcentrated level in Morocco--
eg. contract-based services -- sometimes do not exist or might be restricted by current regulations.
Human resource authorities lack the means for performance or career management at the
deconcentrated level, and the status of some de-concentrated personnel is not clear.           Yet,
providing and contracting services at the deconcentrated level is a fundamental challenge facing
improved service delivery in many sectors. The legal and administrative constraints causing
uncertainty on this front should be addressed in a clear and participatory way in order to better
capture the advantages of the public expenditure reform.

Moroccan experience in multiplicating the number of monitoring indicators has generated an
unmanageably large number of them, which prevents their effectiveness to measure performance.
Monitoring indicators should be limited to a small number of the most pertinent measures and
performance audits should be simplified in order to make the process more manageable, and
reporting be made more timely.
