irrigation systems, improved maintenance and related on-farm\n            development; (ii) agricultural development including the\n            strengthening of the regional extension service,\n            diversification of agricultural research and expansion of\n            seed production; (iii) provision of credit for small\n            farmers; (iv) rehabilitation and construction of rural roads\n            and strengthening of road maintenance; (v) construction of\n            21 community water supply systems and 100 wells,\n            rehabilitation of 95 existing wells, and strengthening of\n            rural water supply maintenance; (vi) institutional\n            development of the Organization for the Development of the\n            North including technical assistance, studies and training;\n            and (vii) the establishment of a facility to support local\n            community development activities.
