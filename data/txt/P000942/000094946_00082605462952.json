While the project correctly identified the\n            risk that, recognition of the five coastal wetland sites\n            under the Ramsar Convention may not be achieved, it wrongly\n            assumed that this could be minimized by the availability of\n            project funds for other activities, but project funds did\n            not shorten the significant delay in government approvals.\n            Therefore, the project overestimated, both the level of\n            government ownership, and the availability of counterpart\n            funds. Lessons re-emphasize that close involvement with\n            stakeholders, and communities ensure the sustainability of\n            an operation. Stronger flexibility should have been\n            prevalent in the composition of supervision missions, to be\n            able to adjust the skills mix, to either legal expertise in\n            dealing with the delays in government approvals, or, social\n            expertise in developing suitable methods for monitoring\n            community-level trends, for the sustainable use of wetland\n            resources. Tolerance for weak government agencies'\n            performance can be avoided, by limiting agencies to a\n            defined policy agenda, and instead channel funds through\n            more dynamic, non-governmental organizations, to instead\n            submit project concepts for lesser financing, and, smaller\n            in scope."}, "docdt": "2000-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
