The main objectives of the project will be to\n            put in place the institutional and technical capabilities\n            required for effective environmental monitoring, policy\n            formulation and coordination; to support a pilot program to\n            combat soil degradation and erosion; and to help prevent\n            further destruction of the fragile resource base in the\n            coastal zone, in which issues of global environmental\n            concerns are partly involved.  The project includes three\n            components:  (a) development of an environmental resource\n            management system; (b) land resources management; and (c)\n            coastal wetlands management."}, "docdt": "1992-09-16T00:00:00Z"}
