Ratings for the\n            Natural Resources Management Project were as follows:\n            outcome was unsatisfactory; risk to the development outcome\n            was significant; Bank performance was unsatisfactory; and\n            Borrower performance was unsatisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned included from the project: it is essential to gauge\n            support at higher levels of government than the concerned\n            environmental agencies. Care has to be taken that\n            international environmental pressure, vested interests and\n            the understandable enthusiasm of the Bank's own\n            appraisal process does not lead to financing of worthy\n            causes that governments are unwilling to support. Care has\n            to be taken that individuals and community stakeholders are\n            empowered in the decision-making process, particularly over\n            allocation of rights to utilize natural resources. The\n            assessed projects clearly show that insecure property rights\n            allied with centralized, top-down award of concessions to\n            commercial operations and capture of economic rents creates\n            conflict and promotes non-sustainable natural resource\n            utilization. When partners operate on differing schedules\n            and priorities there is a danger that mixed signals will be\n            passed to the in-country stakeholders. In that respect\n            common pool budget support mechanisms have a strategic\n            advantage in bringing coherence to reform agendas.\n            Insufficient attention to addressing the causes of rural\n            poverty drives people to live off the environmental commons\n            where short-term survival interests typically outweigh\n            consideration of longer-term stability."}, "docdt": "2008-06-24T00:00:00Z"}
