World Bank performance was satisfactory, while\n            the Borrower's performance was mixed. Lessons learned\n            included the following: The project should have been\n            implemented over a longer period consistent with the longer\n            term objectives, especially in face of the need for\n            continuing monitoring and evaluation, and for developing\n            operational capacity and the regulatory framework. Projects\n            supporting environmental management should follow a program\n            approach such as the current Adaptable Program Lending\n            (APL), which provides flexibility in meeting evolving needs.\n            Efforts to integrate multiple executing agencies must be\n            supported by work across sectors to improve coordination,\n            and implementation must be preceded by awareness-raising.\n            Alternative fee arrangements under the follow-up project\n            could fill some of the gap in funding and enhance\n            sustainability of the operations. A full and thorough review\n            of government actions and financing is important when\n            assessing commitment and ownership of projects. Mechanisms\n            should have been developed which involved the private sector\n            and civil society in monitoring environmental compliance.\n            The same strategy cannot be used to obtain and sustain\n            community participation; selection criteria for pilots\n            should emphasize the willingness of communities to fully\n            participate in implementation action plans, and should\n            identify socio-cultural differences."}, "docdt": "1999-06-29T00:00:00Z"}
