      is rated highly satisfactory, with project sustainability\n            highly likely. Overall, World Bank performance is rated\n            highly satisfactory. Given the large effort during the fast\n            track preparation, the deep involvement of the implementing\n            agency, and especially the privatization committee, overall\n            Borrower performance is rated satisfactory. Lessons learned\n            included the following: Continuity in staffing of\n            supervision missions by the Bank is important. The original\n            task manager maintained her participation in the project\n            from 1995 until 1998, the railway specialist and the\n            operations officer from 1995 to 2001. This greatly\n            contributed to the project's success. The project\n            involved a large donor coordination effort, much of which\n            was successful. A landlord company is not an adequate\n            arrangement in railway concessions. Other mechanisms to\n            monitor the concession can be implemented which are less\n            costly and at lest as efficient. The rolling concession\n            arrangement--an innovative feature of this\n            concession--provides the incentive framework for private\n            participation in railway operations. Timely donor\n            contribution to finance large and costly infrastructure is\n            essential to support the launching of a concession such as\n            for railway services, which is profitable for the entire\n            economy but which does not have a very high financial viability."}, "docdt": "2002-01-31T00:00:00Z"}
