Assessment Report\n            concurs largely with the Implementation Completion Report,\n            and Evaluation Summary's ratings of satisfactory\n            project outcome, high institutional development impact, as\n            well as highly satisfactory Bank performance, and\n            satisfactory Borrower performance, though downgrades its\n            sustainability to likely from a highly likely rating.\n            Lessons drawn from the project experience, suggest that the\n            design of railway concessions should aim to avoid\n            establishing government-owned patrimony/landlord\n            corporations, since such corporations tend to interfere with\n            the management of the concession, with no clear gains for\n            the government. Therefore, selling rather than leasing the\n            equipment to the concessionaire, leads to a cleaner\n            concession arrangement, and thus precludes the need for a\n            patrimony corporation. The Bank's experience with\n            railway concessions contributes to designing, and financing\n            of such operations, in particular, in attracting private\n            investors to difficult infrastructure sectors. However, it\n            is also suggested that renegotiation of infrastructure\n            concessions should be avoided, or deferred as possible,\n            since it undermines credibility of the concession system\n            itself. And, the delicate issue of staff redundancy, should\n            be managed with adequate compensation, providing pensions\n            under exceptional early retirements, and outsourcing-company\n            work to displaced staff."}, "docdt": "2003-03-12T00:00:00Z"}
