3. Assessment of Development Objective and Design, and of Quality at Entry
3.1 Original Objective:
The objectives of the project were to contribute to the revitalization of the railway transport
service in the Borrower's territory in order to promote competitiveness and regional integration
through the rehabilitation of the railway infrastructure and equipment assets.
3.2 Revised Objective:
The objectives were not revised.
3.3 Original Components:
The components of the project were: (a) infrastructure rehabilitation covering (i) selective track
renewal (75km) and repair (41km of sleepers and 66km or rail replacement); (ii) ballasting (111.000 m3);
bridge and culvert repairs; (iv) embankment repairs; (v) installation of weighing equipment; and (vi) some
building repairs (workshops, stations); (b) equipment rehabilitation and acquisition: (i) rehabilitation of
motive power and rolling stock- (A) overhaul or rehabilitation of 20 main-line locomotives; (B)
rehabilitation of 17 shunting locomotives; (C) rehabilitation of 375 freight cars; (D) rehabilitation of 40
passenger coaches; and (E) establishment of a stock of essential spare parts; (ii) maintenance equipment:
(A) rehabilitation and acquisition of essential track maintenance equipment and tools; and (B) rehabilitation
of maintenance facilities; (iii) telecommunication: (A) rehabilitation and imporvement of the rail-to-ground
radio system; (B) installation of a radio-block operating system; (C) replacement of PABX in the four
major activity centers and five medium size stations; and (D) miscellaneous small repairs, acquisition of
maintenance vehicles and establishemnt of a stock of essential spare parts; and (iv) computers; and (c)
works supervision and training.
3.4 Revised Components:
In a March 2000 amendment to the Credit Agreement, a fifth item was added to the
telecommunication component (Part D of the Project): Part D.5. Installation of a
telecommunication trunk line. This was financed using cost savings.
3.5 Quality at Entry:
The project's quality of entry is rated highly satisfactory. The project was fully consistent with the
development objectives of the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Cote d'Ivoire discussed by the Board
on June 7, 1994. The CAS listed as a major priority promotion of private sector development through
continued liberalization of trade, financial, and labor markets, and through investments in agriculture,
industry, and transport. Implementation of the CAS was to be pursued through a lending program targeted
at infrastructure among other sectors.
The project was well designed. It provided the resources necessary to finance physical investments on
the railway track in support of the private concession of railway operations on the
Abidjan-Ouagadougou-Kaya line jointly awarded by Cote d'Ivoire and Burkina Faso. Implementation
arrangements gave most responsibilities to the private concessionnaire which had an incentive to achieve
satisfactory results. The concessioning addressed the failure of previous restructuring plans through
performance contracts which were unable to stop the drain on the State resources necessary to cover the
deficit of the public enterprises in Burkina Faso and C6te d'Ivoire and the failure of adequate coordination
between the two national railway operators of C6te d'Ivoire and Burkina. Although it took several years to
reach an agreement with the Governments of C6te d'Ivoire and Burkina Faso on the transfer of railway
operations to a private operator, this long period of time enabled consensus building among borrower
agencies and donors. Project preparation involved thorough planning and considerable effort to involve
C6te d'lvoire institutions and other donors. In 1992, authorities of Burkina Faso and Cote d'Ivoire
-2 -



announced their intention to restore the competitiveness of the Abidjan-Ouagadougou corridor by
establishing a private railway operating company (SITARAIL) with two landlord companies (SIPF in Cote
d'lvoire and SOPAFER-B in Burkina) for the ownership and administrative management of railway assets.
The concession was granted in 1993, signed in 1994 and became effective in 1995.
The project provided much needed resources to ensure the success of the concession and a smooth start
of the operations by the private investor. The lack of resources would have been a serious irnpediment for
the viability of the concession.
The environmental category of the project was not defined. While the project was not subject to an
environmental assessment, the SAR indicated that no major negative environmental impact was expected
because of the nature of the works (replacement of rails and sleepers, reballasting, repair of bridges and
culverts). It was agreed that works would be monitored by the Ministry of Environment. Staff in the
railway company would be trained in environmental assessments. Annual reports would be provided to
IDA.
A detailed traffic analysis was carried out and traffic forecasts were reasonable in view of volumes of
traffic transported on the railway in the past. The major assumption was that the new operator would
recapture freight traffic which had tranferred to road transport because of the poor performance of the
public railway companies. The positive impact of the CFAF devaluation in early 1994 was supporting the
macro-economic growth assumption behind the assumption on the traffic growth.
Quality at entry is rated Highly satisfactory
4. Achievement of Objective and Outputs
4.1 Outcome/achievement of objective:
The achievement of objective is rated highly satisfactory.
Railway operations improved dramatically after the concession became effective. Freight levels rose
from 293.000 tons in 1994 to 875.000 tons in 2000 against forecasts of 717.000 tons; gross receipts of
SITARAIL increased by 36 percent from CFAF 14 billion in 1994 to CFAF 19 billion in 2000.
Considering the high level of economnic, political and civil instability during the past eighteen months with a
coup d'Etat and three changes of Government, the performance of the railway company can be considered
as a success. SITARAIL has stabilized its revenue despite the increase in fuel prices and concession fees.
Prospects are good for 2001 with about one million tons of freight. The financial results of the 10 first
months of 2001 are excellent (+32 percent increase of revenues). The Abidjan-Ouagadougou railway
concession keeps its promises as a successful operation.
The capacity to maintain and rehabilitate transport infrastructure was greatly enhanced. The private
concessionnaire carried out a program to rehabilitate its equipment at a level adjusted to its needs: 14 of 20
main-line locomotives, 12 of 17 shunting locomotives, 247 of 311 freight cars, and 20 of 40 passengers
coach, were rehabilitated during the period of project implementation.
Although the closing date was extended by one year, the extension did not reflect unsatisfactory
performance but was largely decided to accommodate (a) the delay in the project effectiveness; and (b) the
procurement and installation of a telecommunication trunk line, which was added after the mid-term
review. This delay did not detract from the overall satisfactory outcome of the project. Despite Cote
d'Ivoire suspension of all Bank projects since October 30, 2000, almost all contracts and all eligible
- 3 -



disbursements have been completed. 93 percent of the credit was disbursed when the project was closed.
4.2 Outputs by components:
The achievement of physical, financial and institutional development objectives is satisfactory.
By-and-large, procurement and rehabilitation of railway equipment and materials (ballast, rails,
sleepers, spare parts for rehabilitation of locomotives, telecommunication equipment) was completed as
expected at appraisal. The infrastructure rehabilitation program was implemented almost in totality (with
the only exception of the ballasting program implemented at 70 percent). The railway rolling stock
rehabilitation program was somewhat scaled down as the operating needs of the concessionnaire appeared
to be less than initially expected (e.g. 14 locomotives were rehabilitated instead of 20, 12 shunting
locomotives instead 17, 247 freight wagons instead of 311) or as rehabilitation appeared not economically
justified (20 passenger coaches instead of 40). Savings on the rolling stock rehabilitation program were
used to finance a highly needed new fiber optic telecommunication trunk line. This need had not been
identified at appraisal as it was expected that the rehabilitation of the old existing cable would be
technically and financially feasible, which was not the case.
No specific performance indicators were defined at appraisal to measure the project outputs.
4.3 Net Present Value/Economic rate of return:
The overall economic rate of return (ERR) was estimated at 23 percent at appraisal, although in the
absence of a fully-developed railway traffic costing system for SICF. Economic long-run marginal costs of
rail transport were estimated in the with and without project cases and for the main products transported
(national and intemational transport of petroleum, containers, cement, clinker, manganese, and
intemational passengers). The investment cost was estimated at US$81 million, the equivalent of CFAF40
billion.
In June 2001, a new economic analysis estimated the ERR at 22 %. The investment cost is estimated at
CFAF 51 billion of which 34.7 billion during the 1995-2000 period of project execution and CFAF 16.7
billion between 2001 and 2004 on the concessionnaire's own resources. Details on the economic analysis
are provided in Annex 3.
4.4 Financial rate of return:
The financial rate of return was estimnated at 12 percent at appraisal. Financial forecasts, established
for the initial 15-year concession period, were based on traffic projections and tariff levels projected by the
concessionaire (average increase of 25 % for both freight and passengers). According to these projections,
the concessionaire would achieve positive operating result in the fifth year of activity. Net income was
estimated to remain negative for the first four years of the concession, due mainly to very substantial
amounts allocated for engineering consultancy during this period, when rehabilitation investments was
being implemented. Expected cumulative losses of about CFAF 3 billion were to be covered by the CFAF 5
billion of equity capital. In the subsequent years, net income was expected to improve and reach some
CFAF 4 billion in year 15 of the concession.
The financial rate of return has not been estimated at completion of the project. From the comparison
of actual and estimated financial forecasts, one can conclude that the concession is profitable although the
level of profitability is not very high. The actual operating revenues of the concession have been similar to
the forecasts established in constant CFAF 1995 prices at appraisal. The operating result was negative
during the first two years of the concession but became positive after that. The net operating result became
positive (CFAF 140 billion) in 1998 one year before what had been estimated at appraisal, which is a good
perfornance. Although the net operating result became negative by CFAF 1.9 billion in 2000 mostly due to
the deterioration of the political situation, excellent results are expected in 2001 where the net operating
- 4 -



result amounts to CFAF 573 million at the end of October. The forecasts established by the private
operator in June 2001, for the negotiations of the extension of the concession for an additional 5 years,
shows that the financial performance is expected to improve during the next five years starting in 2001, due
to the good prospects for freight traffic in 2001.
4.5 Institutional development impact:
The project has had a positive impact on public finance. Before the project, the public railway
companies, both in Burkina Faso and C6te d'Ivoire were receiving subisidies from their respective
Governments and were a significant drain on public resources. The debt of the railway company totalled
CFAF 100 billion (US$200 million), its accumulated deficit totalled CFAF 50 billion (US$100 million).
After the concession, the concessionnaire did not receive any subsidy and on the contrary pays all its taxes
and a concession fee for the use of the railway infrastructure, the leasing of the equipment to the landlord
companies and the service of the debt contracted out after the concession became effective.
A similar positive assessment can be made for the impact of the project on human resources employed by
the concessionnaire despite a sharp reduction in the staffing level. Before the project, conditions of
employment were poor with low salaries paid often late, lack of incentive, poor productivity, etc ...After the
concession, salaries have increased and are competitive with other salaries in the private sector. They are
paid on time. The working conditions have improved (air conditioner, computers and internet in offices,
better safety for agents on the trains, medical plan benefit with HIV/AIDS sentitization program,...).
5. Major Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcome
5.1 Factors outside the control of government or implementing agency:
After a promising start during the 1996-99 period, the operation of the concession became more
difficult due to political disturbances starting at the end of 1999. The economic and financial disarray
which resulted from these political events also impacted negatively the concession. Another difficulty was
the significant increase of petroleum prices in 1999 and 2000.
5.2 Factors generally subject to government control:
Delays in meeting the conditions for effectiveness of the AFD loan delayed the effectiveness of the IDA
credit as meeting these conditions was a condition for effectiveness of the IDA credit.
5.3 Factors generally subject to implementing agency control:
As a private operator, the concessionnaire was fully responsible for management decisions and
effectiveness. Overall, management has been satisfactory.
Performance of the landlord company has been weak. Its operating costs have been higher than initially
estimated. A better control of the costs has now been put in place. During the first years of the concession,
the relationship between the landlord company and the concessionnaire were poor, mainly because the staff
in the patrimony company, formerly from the public railway company, did not know what was expected
from the patrimony company and very often wanted to be involved in the day-to-day management of the
railway company. Due to this poor relation, implementation of the project was initially delayed by one year.
5.4 Costs andfinancing:
The actual project costs (CFAF 38 billion) are similar to those estimated at appraisal (CFAF 40
billion). All donors have contributed to the project at the level identified at appraisal.
The only major delay was at effectiveness due to cross-conditions between the various donors'
agreements preventing any credit or loan to become effective as long as all conditions for effectiveness on
- 5 -



all loans and credits were not met.
6. Sustainability
6.1 Rationale for sustainability rating:
Sustainability is highly likely. Under the concession agreement, freight levels rose from 540,000 tons in
1996 to 875,000 tons in 2000 (this figure is likely to approach I million tons in 2001). Before the
concession was granted, traffic was decreasing (from 600,000 tons in 1980 to 300,000 tons in 1994). State
subsidies are no longer needed, and a priority investment program is underway with the concessionnaire's
own resources. Some provisions of the concession were revised and agreed upon in November 2001. The
concession period has been extended to 30 years and the concession fees' level and structure have been
modified. The rolling concession arrangement which extends the concession by 15 years each time 15 years
are completed is also a contributing factor to sustainability as the operator has always enough time in front
of him to invest in the development of the company.
6.2 Transition arrangement to regular operations:
Most arrangements for transition to regular operation have already been taken in 2000 when the
concession was negotiated and extended to 30 years.
The railway company maintain regularly its statistics which can be used to monitor the concession in
the future. Freight traffic, locomotive availability, reliability and utilization, as well as infrastructure
condition (especially "slow orders" imposed on the track) are of particular importance on the technical side.
Financial results will also give an excellent measure of the global efficiency of the concession company.
A follow-up project is not envisaged in the near future. The concessionnaire intends to finance all its
investments in the years to come either with its own resources or through private financing. The purchase
of four locomotives and 50 oil tankers has already been financed by private local banks.
7. Bank and Borrower Performance
Bank
7.1 Lending:
Bank performance is rated highly satisfactory. The agenda initially outlined for the project, was well
formulated to meet Cote d'lvoire investment and institutional development needs. The Bank team took the
lead in building consensus among Government agencies and four donors in order to shape the program. The
project was key in ensuring the availability of resources necessary to start the concession on the right foot
by rehabilitating key sections of the track and equipment. It is worth to note that the concessioning of the
railway operations in COte d'lvoire was the first operation of this type in sub-Saharan Africa and
supporting it through an investment operation was key for the succes of the operation but also for its
replication in many other conoutries in the continent as well. The lending instrument was suitable in this
respect.
To insure coherence with the Burkina program prepared in parallel, the same team was used in both
countries during project preparation. The team worked closely with the PSD team supervising the
Privatization Support Project (Cr. 2363-IVC) which provided support to the railway concessioning
process.
The project was consistent with the Government's development strategy which promoted private
participation in infrastructure as demonstrated in subsequent operations (gas, electricity, power). Similarly,
the project was consistent with the Bank's country assistance strategy which listed as a major priority
promotion of private sector development as well as investment in transport.
The project preparation was complete and covered all major relevant aspects such as technical,
- 6 -



financial, economic, commercial, institutional, environmental. Preparation was good although the appraisal
team did not include a financial management specialist, a procurement specialist, nor an environmental
specialist. Implementation arrangements were innovative. The decision to use the concessionaire as
implementing agency was sound as the concessionaire had a financial incentive to execute the project
rapidly and efficiently. The concessionnaire prepared the bidding documents which were reviewed by the
landlord companies.
Although the implementation arrangements may seem complex with a railway company servicing two
countries, two landlord companies and two Governments, and several donors, this never became a major
issue because of the strong commitment of the Governments and the continuous support of the donors.
The only risk envisaged at appraisal was of delays in attracting back traffic from road transport. This
risk did not occur as traffic growth exceeded forecasts. The Bank did not identify the weaknesses of the
landlord company as a risk although these weaknesses and the fact that the staff of the landlord company
consisted of civil servants formerly in the public railway company created some initial difficulties in the
relationships between the concessionaire and the landlord company.
The financial package was appropriate. Some savings were used to finance telecommunication
equipment. The concessionnaire is not requesting additionnal financing from multilateral or bilateral
donors.
The performance indicators were adequate and characterized well the performance of the railway
company.
7.2 Supervision:
Bank performance is rated highly satisfactory. Seven supervision missions were undertaken from end
1996 to mid 2001, an average of 1.5 missions per year. Supervision reporting was clear and effective.
There was exceptional continuity in staffing. Almost all rmssions were staffed with at least one railway
specialist and a field Operations Officer, who both remained in the team until project completion. The
original task manager of the project, who had also been responsible for project preparation, remained with
the project until the supervision mission in January 1998.
Missions maintained closed contacts with the other donors. Most of the missions were joint supervision
missions with other donors. When this was not possible, the Bank mission visited donors routinely before
or after the mission. A Mid-term review was carried out in September 1998 attended by all the
co-financiers. Bank supervision showned flexibility and worked persistently to help the project to proceed
smoothly.
The advice given to the Governments, landlord companies and the concessionnaire was of excellent
quality. Supervision missions followed-up on all aspects of the concession: financial and operational
perforrmance, staffing, evolution of traffic; as well as on other aspects such as well as the adequacy of the
concession agreement because of its innovative aspects in sub-Saharan Africa.
Performance ratings were realistic. Project implementation was rated unsatisfactory at the start because
of the delays in signing the credit agreement but became satisfactory soon after the agreement was signed
because the concessionnaire managed to attract traffic back from road transport very quickly after it started
its operations. The environmental categories in the PSR were never rated.
There was not significant deviations from Bank policies and procedures.
7.3 Overall Bank performance:
Overall, Bank performance is rated highly satisfactory.
Borrower
7.4 Preparation:
Preparation of the project involved two ministries and several agencies (privatization committee,
BNETD...). The privatization committee undertook the studies which supported the decision to grant a
- 7 -



concession of the railway operations and to liquidate the public railway company. These studies formed the
basis for discussions during appraisal which led to the definition of each component. Preparation by the
borrower is rated satisfactory.
7.5 Government implementation performance:
The Government's performance is rated highly satisfactory (HS). The Government has not changed its
macroeconomic or sector policies in a way which has impacted negatively on the concession. It has
remained committed to the project although relationships between the patrimony company and the
concessionnaire encountered initial difficulties. The Government has not been involved in the designation of
key managers of the concessionnaire. The Govenmuent is responsible for appointing the General Manager
of the landlord company.
7.6 Implementing Agency:
Performance is rated satisfactory. SIPF and SITARAIL prepared quarterly and annual progress
reports, ant they commissioned annual financial audits reports. SIPF provided continuous coordination and
technical support. The two entities prepared good documentation for the Mid-term review . Only few
problems were noted with audits of project funds, which were addressed on time. Without initial conflicting
relationships between the landlord company and the concessionnaire during the first years of the project
implementation, its performance would have been rated Highly Satisfactory.
7.7 Overall Borrower performance:
Given the large effort during the fast track preparation, the deep involvement of the implementing
agency and especially the privatization committee, overall Borrower performance is rated satisfactory.
8. Lessons Learned
*   Continuity in staffing of supervision missions by the Bank is important. The original Task manager
maintained her participation in the project from 1995 until 1998, the Railway specialist and the
Operations officer from 1995 to 2001. This greatly contributed to the success of the project.
*   Donor coordination is very important. The project involved a large donor coordination effort, much of
which was successful.
* A landlord company is not an adequate arrangement in railway concessions. Other mechanisms to
monitor the concession can be implemented which are less costly and at least as efficient.
* The rolling concession arrangement - an innovative feature of this concession - provides the incentive
framework for private participation in railway operations.
* Timely donor contribution to finance large and costly infrastructure is essential to support the
launching of a concession such as for railway services, which is profitable for the entire economy but
which does not have a very high financial viability.
9. Partner Comments
(a) Borrower/implementing agency:
Summary of the Borrower's contribution
* The achievement of physical and financial development objectives is satisfactory.
By-and-large, procurement and rehabilitation of railway equipment and materials (ballast,
rails, sleepers, spare parts for rehabilitation of locomotives, telecommunication equipment)
was completed as expected at appraisal. The infrastructure rehabilitation program was
implemented almost in totality (with the only exception of the ballasting program
implemented at 70 percent). The railway rolling stock rehabilitation program was
- 8 -



somewhat scaled down as the operating needs of the concessionaire appeared to be less
than initially expected (e.g. six locomotives were rehabilitated instead of nine, two
shunting locomotives instead of nine, 247 freight wagons instead of 311) or as
rehabilitation appeared not economically justified (10 passenger coaches instead of 20).
The initial program was modified in order to finance a highly needed new fiber optic
Telecommunication trunk line. This need had not been identified at appraisal.
*   The program  has permitted to preserve a precious infrastructure asset, save lot of
employment, and turn a heavily subsidized rail transport into a commercially profitable
activity.
*   The implementation of the new public finance management system (SIGFIP) has had a
negative impact on the financial management of the project and delayed project
implementation.
* Despite the diagnostic done during project appraisal to identify the contents of the
program, new priorities occurred during the project execution, and some disbursement
categories have been overdraft , some activities abandoned. Passenger traffic targets have
not been reached (actual traffic is lower than appraisal estimates). The project objectives
have been largely reached in term of freight traffic (actual results are higher than appraisal
estimates).
*   The regular supervision missions have demonstrated the World Bank interest in the
success of the project. The supervision missions permitted to SITARAIL and SIPF to take
corrective measures and to improve the relationship between the two entities (conflict
resolution between SIPF and the SITARAIL regarding the telecommunication trunk line
opportunity)
*   The performance of consultants and private enterprises and donors was satisfactory, even
if some delays were observed during some contracts execution.
*   The project has permitted to restore the competition between rail transport and other
transportation modes. It has contributed to maintain the activities of the Port of Abidjan
which is the major import and export port for Burkina. The project impact is not very
perceptible by the population (unattractiveness of rail passenger transport).
* The project has improved the safety of rail transport.
* To avoid weaknesses listed above, the physical and financial evaluation of the system for
the future program must not only be the concessionaire's responsibility.

1.3   D6veloppement survenus pendant le deroulement du projet
Au chapitre des developpements survenus pendant le deroulement du projet, on note:
- L'apparition chez le concessionnaire de nouvelles priorites non identifiees dans le projet de base,
notamment la mise en place d'une nouvelle artere des telecommunications ainsi que l'acquisition et
- 12 -



la mise en place d'un logiciel d'exploitation ferroviaire.
- L'abandon de certaines composantes du projet, notamment l'abandon de la mise en place d'un
systeme de cantonnement par radio-bloc informatique au profit des besoins nouveaux du
concessionnaire.
- L'abandon de la poursuite des operations de rehabilitation de certains engins et materiels dont les
effectifs avaient et prealablement arretes par le diagnostic du systeme ferroviaire mene par le
Groupement Sitarail. Il s'agit notamment de la limitation de la rehabilitation du nombre de:
voitures voyageurs A dix (10) au lieu de (20 ) comme initialement prevu;
locomotives de ligne a 6 au lieu de neuf (9) comme initialement pr&vu;
locotracteurs a deux (2 ) au lieu de 9 comme initialement prevu;
wagons ballastiers acquis A cinq (5) au lieu de dix (10) comme initialement prevu.
- Des depassements budgetaires operes sur certains postes notamment sur le cofit de rehabilitation
des batiments, le cofit d'acquisition du materiel de pesage et des wagons ballastiers.
1.4 Realisation financiere du projet
Le montant total des investissements realises au 31/10/2001 dans le cadre du projet au
31/10/2001 est de 18,8 milliards de FCFA F HT.
La realisation financiere du projet a connu un retard dans son demarrage dfi essentiellement aux
difficult6s de mise en place des fonds et A la levee de certaines conditionnalites (prets lies, prets
conditionnels).
Les investissements realises sont recapitules en annexe 1.
2 .Analyse des performances
2.1 Environnement national
Le projet a permis de preserver une infrastructure precieuse et de sauvegarder de nombreux
emplois. II a permis A l'Etat de ne plus apporter de subvention A l'activite.
2.2 Performance de l'administration
La mise en place du systeme integre de gestion des finances publiques a eu un impact n6gatif sur
le compte projet no 578 01 01 01 loge A la CAA.
2.3 Performance de l'agence d'execution du projet
Un diagnostic du systeme ferroviaire a ete realise par les experts du Groupement Sitarail en
octobre 1994 aux fins de la mise en place des financements.
Toutefois, il est A noter qu'au cours de la realisation du projet, il est apparu de nombreux
- 13-



depassements budgetaires sur certaines composantes du projet, l'emergence de choix nouveaux
dits prioritaires et 1'abandon de certaines composantes prealablement identifi6es dans le projet de
base.
Au plan de 1'exploitation du trafic voyageurs, les objectifs du projet n'ont pas ete atteints car les
resultats obtenus de 1995 a 2000 sont nettement inferieurs aux previsions de base.
S'agissant du trafic marchandises, les objectifs ont ete largement atteints car les resultats obtenus
de 1995 a 2000 sont nettement superieurs aux previsions de base.
Au niveau de 1'exploitation du materiel roulant ferroviaire, au regard de la baisse constante des
parcours moyens des locomotives de ligne et de leurs taux de disponibilite, il apparait que Sitarail
n'arrive pas a utiliser les locomotives de ligne et les autres engins de ligne au mieux de leur
disponibilite.
Le non-respect par Sitarail des delais d'invitation de la SIPF aux r6ceptions provisoires des
travaux ou fournitures conformement aux dispositions de la convention de concession.
En ce qui concerne les remboursements des emprunts mis a la disposition de Sitarail, on releve
des retards importants dans le remboursement de certaines echeances.
2.4 Perfornance de la Banque
Les missions regu 1 ieres de suivi du projet a mi-parcours denotent de l'interet de la Banque pour la
reussite du projet. Ces missions de revue a mi-parcours du projet ont permis a Sitarail et a la SIPF
d'apporter des corrections a certains points du projet.
Ces missions ont ete d'un apport appreciable dans la conciliation des divergences de point de vue
entre Sitarail et la SIPF, divergences apparues au cours de l'ex6cution du projet notamment au
debut de la mise en place de la nouvelle artere des telecommunications.
2.5 Performance des consultants, des entreprises et des autres partenaires financiers
L'apport des consultants, des entreprises et des autres partenaires financiers a et tres appreciable.
Neanmoins, il convient de relever le d6passement des delais d'execution des travaux par certaines
entreprises, notamment SIC-TP et GEC-ALSTHOM.
3. Impacts du projet
3.1 Impacts sur le secteur des transports (administration, secteur prive, les populations)
Le projet a permis de maintenir des cofit de transport concurrentiels par rapport aux autres modes
de transport. II a contribue au maintien des activites du port d'Abidjan qui traite l'essentiel du
trafic import-export du Burkina. Le projet a un impact peu perceptible sur les populations
compte-tenu des conditions peu attractives d'exploitation du trafic voyageurs.
3.2 Autres impacts
3 2.1 Impact du projet sur 1'environnement
Le projet, par la refection des talus, la reprise des remblais et des plates-formes a resolu les
- 14 -



problemes de stagnation des eaux, voire d'inondation.
La remise ai niveau de la voie assure une certaine securite aux trains et reduit par la meme
occasion les deraillements qui ont un effet negatif sur 1'environnement.
4 Conclusions
En conclusion, afin de prevenir les faiblesses evoquees ci-dessus, les travaux d'evaluation tant
physique que financiere du systeme pour les programmes a venir ne devraient pas etre l'affaire du
seul concessionnaire.

(b) Cofinanciers:
1. Agence Francaise de Development (French Development Agency)
The French Development Agency, which has now closed its loans to SITARAIL, SIPF
and SOPAFER-B, entirely shares the World Bank's positive evaluation of the Railways
Abidjan-Ouagadougou-Kaya's Rehabilitation project. We could add that, according to
information collected, the cooling down of the relations between the Governments of Cote
d'Ivoire and Burkina Faso noticed in 2000-2001 in the context of the political changes in CMte
d'Ivoire, did not affect the good operation of SITARAIL ( as a bi-national private company)
which is a supplementary indication of the project's sustainability. It is advisable to indicate that
some difficulties occurred during project execution, and some of them are remain unaddressed:
*   The financial situation is still fragile; after a registered deficit of 2.5 billion CFA in 2000;
two third of the equity has been consumed and the company needs to be recapitalized. The
results of the fiscal year 2001 seem to be good, due in part to the traffic increase and also
to the important relief brought by the rescheduling of the debt, which has allowed the
extension from fifteen years to thirty years of the concession. However, this represents an
external circumstance to the company.
*   This fragility points out to the fact that: (i) there are still productivity gains to be realized
to face road competition, notably in terms of staff productivity, and (ii) traffic depends on
a small number of products with volatile behavior (part of the traffic of petroleum
products results from a statutory monopoly given to SITARAIL), while progress remains
possible in commercial management.
*   The levy ( four per cent) of patrimony companies on the turnover of SITARAIL is
unproductive and presses heavily on the profitability and/or the competitiveness of rail
transport.
*   In general, SITARAIL's reporting to donors regarding activity information and financial
results, has been satisfactory. But the quality of the reporting to AFD, specially regarding
- 16 -



procurement and contracts' execution, was low.
2. European Investment Bank (EIB)
We share the very positive overall appreciation of the report on this project and on its
implementation.
However, we wonder why the report does not consider the Burkinabe part of the project
and if all the data relate to SITARAIL or only to the Ivory-Coast part of SITARAIL? We noted
also that very few comments were made on the passenger traffic.
On the report, we also feel that the landlord company SIPF did not play a significant role
and did not fulfill it satisfactorily (as a financial intermediary for instance). We doubt that the
relationship between SIPF and SITARAIL is fully satisfactory. The landlord company represents a
significant cost to the railway system with a "raison d'etre" that can be questioned on the long
tenn. For those reasons we would have suggested a clearer differentiation between the two in
paragraph 7.6 Implementing Agency. But that might not be the aim of this paragraph.
We fully agree with all the lessons learned.

Annex 3. Economic Costs and Benefits
The overall economic rate of return (ERR) was estimated at 23 percent at appraisal. In June 2001, a
new economic evaluation was undertaken. The summary of the study is presented in the following
paragraphs. Detailed data available in the project's files.
Benefits
The main program benefits that have been quantified for the economic analysis result from the
reduction in transport costs on the long distance traffic for which rail has an economic advantage over road
transport. Important additional benefits, which were not quantified, include: the non-liquidation of SICF
and SCFB, thereby preserving an important infrastructure asset; turning rail transport from a heavily
subsidized rail transport activity into a conmnercially profitable one; and contribution to improving regional
integration through more efficient handling of intemational traffic.
Assumptions underlying the Economic Analysis.
*        "With program    )>, the whole railway infrastructure is maintained, and investments are made to
respond to rail transport traffic demand. Freight and passenger traffic is expected to increase as described
in the table below for the years 1995 to 2004.

*    " Without program", freight and passenger rail traffic is expected to continue its long-term       decline,
falling to zero at the end of three years (1997). Traffic therefore is transferred to road. In this case the
benefit for Burkina Faso and C&te d'Ivoire for the selling of the infrastructure, materials and other
assets is estimated at CFAF 5 billion. Staff salaries have not been taken into account in the economic
analysis, and was considered as a neutral operation, because the amount of severance payment of staff
to be laid off in the assumption of closing activities of rail transport would be transferred to the
economy of Burkina Faso and Cote d'Ivoire.
*    In the two scenarios, the same assumptions for the overall traffic (rail or rail plus road) are considered.
*    Long-run marginal costs of transport include : (i) operating costs and (ii) investments costs. Data and
estimates of operating costs are based on information provided by SITARAIL.
*    Road transport costs for both the " with" and " without the program" cases are based on updated
results of a study on vehicle operating costs, conducted by the Bureau National d'Etudes Techniques
(former DCGTx) in 1997, excluding taxes. The costs include depreciation and interest on loans, but
exclude infrastructure maintenance costs, for which road users pay through user charges such as taxes
on fuel, spare parts etc...
