                         The objective of the Public Sector Capacity Building Program (PSCAP)Support Project is to improve the scale, efficiency, and responsiveness of public service delivery
                         at the federal, regional and local level; to empower citizens to participate more effectively in shaping their own development and to promote good governance and
                         accountability. This overall objective will be achieved by scaling up Ethiopia's ongoing capacity building and institutional transformation efforts in six priority areas
                         under PSCAP - (i) Civil Service Reform (ii) District-Level Decentralization (iii) Urban Management Capacity Building; (iv) Tax System Reform; (v) Justice System Reform;
                         (vi) Information and Communications Technology.

                         The public Sector Capacity Building Program Support Project finances 6 core sub-programs that are directly linked to the outcomes. One or more sub-programs may contribute for
                         each of the outcomes. The project became effective at the end of 2004 and one of the binding agreements in the project is to initiate woreda/district and city level benchmarking as

                         one of the main monitoring tool. The Woreda and City Benchmarking Survey created the baselines and has been measuring progress over the years. The first supply side survey
                         was conducted in 2005/6 in a limited number of local governments. The second survey conducted in 2008 incorporated both the supply and demand side surveys. The supply-side
                         survey collected data from local government officials on financial autonomy, institutional capacity, service delivery, inclusiveness and openness of the local government affairs to
                         citizens. The supply side information is triangulated with the demand side component that collects and analyzes the views, opinions and perceptions of citizens with regard to service

                         delivery, openness, inclusiveness, and accountability of local governments. The demand side survey uses three tools: i) Citizens’ Report Card using household survey, ii) Focus
                         Group Discussion with citizens representatives; and iii) Key Informant Interviews with civil society organizations. In terms of coverage, the first round of the Woreda and City
                         Benchmarking which was carried out in 2005/6 established a baseline in a limited number of jurisdictions (10%). In the subsequent three rounds the sample size increased to 38%,
                         50%, and 33% respectively including the initial (10%) jurisdictions which were used for time series comparison. In addition the demand side of the survey covers more than 11,000
                         households in every round. The survey result indicates a confidence interval of +/- 3 % at 95% confidence interval. The results worthy of note are the following:

                         The scale, efficiency and responsiveness of public service delivery at federal, regional, and local levels have improved. Based on the Woreda and City Benchmarking Citizens Report
                         Card, 88% of the local jurisdictions are now providing all basic services compared to only 25% in 2005 which suggests that in more and more jurisdictions the public is having better
                         access to services considered basic. Similarly, satisfaction with basic services is also improving. I) Citizens using government health facilities increased from 50% to 84% in urban
                         and from 77% to 94% in rural areas in 2008 Vs. 2011. Overall satisfaction with the health services increased from 62% to 70% while households satisfied with the waiting time,
                         attitudes of the medical staff, and availability of drugs increased from 66%, 66%, 53% in 2008 to 81%, 74% and 54% in 2011 respectively. II) Overall satisfaction with primary
                         education service increased from 84% to 94%, with solid waste from 70% to 74%, with agricultural extension from 90% to 94% over the same period. Although, there is no clear
                         evidence of growing satisfaction for water supply (61% in 2008 to 58% in 2011), there has been a 16% fall over the past 18 months (from 26% to 10%) in the proportion of
                         respondents who rely on unprotected water sources.

                         The nation-wide tax system reform has contributed to service delivery improvement by increasing the predictability and adequacy of financial resources. Tax collection nationwide
                         increased five times from 12.4 to 58.9 billion Ethiopian Birr between 2005, the project’s first year, and 2011. Tax to GDP ratio has increased from 8.6 in 2009 to 11.3 in 2010 and
                         11.5 in 2011 after consecutive reduction for three years.

                         Transparency and accountability have also documented improvements. Citizens who know what taxes and fees they are legally required to pay increased from 60% in 2008 to 81%
                         in 2011. Those who know their woreda budget and strategic plan increased from 13% and 17% in 2008 to 20% and 19% in 2011 respectively. Citizens who know council meetings
                         are open to the public increased from 11% in 2008 to 32% in 2011 while those who are personally consulted on development issues increased from 17% to 20% over the same
                         period. Citizens who think an ordinary person can do something to hold local government leaders to account if they fail to keep their promises increased very slightly from 47% to
                         49% in the last 18 months. In addition, the loss of confidence that concerns raised regarding local government’s service quality will be addressed also seems to recover slightly after
                         considerable loss between 2008 and 2010. Confidence that concerns raised in relation to quality of service in health increased from 56% to 58% and in water from 8% to 14%.

                         Notwithstanding the above progress, citizens who reported paying extra money to get public service increased from 4.1% to 6.5%. Similarly, the proportion reporting extra-legal
                         payments for government health services has also risen from 5.8% to 8.5% between 2008 and 2011 which reinforces the view that there is an increase in petty corruption.
