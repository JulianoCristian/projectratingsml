                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The objective of the Public Sector Capacity Building Program (PSCAP)Support Project is to improve the scale, efficiency, and responsiveness of public service delivery
                         at the federal, regional and local level; to empower citizens to participate more effectively in shaping their own development and to promote good governance and
                         accountability. This overall objective will be achieved by scaling up Ethiopia's ongoing capacity building and institutional transformation efforts in six priority areas
                         under PSCAP - (i) Civil Service Reform (ii) District-Level Decentralization (iii) Urban Management Capacity Building; (iv) Tax System Reform; (v) Justice System Reform;
                         (vi) Information and Communications Technology.

                         This short status report is prepared to document the second level restructuring that was approved on March 6, 2012. The restructuring was required to reallocate funds from the
                         Regional Component to the Federal Component. The reallocation is necessary to meet actual projects needs during implementation and do not involve any new changes to the

                         The project has two components/categories (Federal PSCAP and Regional PSCAP) that support similar activities at different levels of government. The Federal Category has run out
                         of funds because some of the federal programs were managing procurements of capital intensive systems on behalf of the national government (federal and regions) that are

                         implemented country-wide. The total amount that government seeks to reallocate is equivalent to US$10 million. The team considers the proposed reallocation to be a minor one
                         because there is no change in the project description, development objectives, and targets. In addition the main beneficiaries of the nationally-administered systems are principally
