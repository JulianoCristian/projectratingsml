The reallocation is necessary to meet actual\n            projects needs during implementation and do not involve any\n            new changes to the original project description, objectives\n            or associated outcomes as well as use of cost of project\n            savings. In summary, the team considers the reallocation to\n            be a minor one because there is no change in the project\n            description, development objectives, and targets. In\n            addition the main beneficiaries of the\n            nationally-administered systems are principally the regions.\n            The total amount that government seeks to reallocate is\n            equivalent to US$10 million."}, "docdt": "2012-03-06T00:00:00Z"}
