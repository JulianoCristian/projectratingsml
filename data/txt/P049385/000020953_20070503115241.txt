Revised Project Development Objectives (as approved by original approving authority)
In the "Nutrition" component, a revision of the impact indicator was made as follows:

  Project specific reduction in severe and moderate malnutrition in 0-36 month old
children (<2SD, NCHS Growth Standards). Up to 2 percent points annually in project
blocks presuming a 1.1 percent point annual secular trend.

  This revision was done in consultation with the Borrower and was confirmed through
their letter dated March 26, 2004 (IRIS). This change was initiated at the formal
restructuring of the Woman and Child Development (WCD)/ICDS III project (credit
N042-IN 1999-2006-implemented in 11 states in India) in March 2002. As a result the
Implementation Status Review (ISRs) reports for both the ICDS III and the APERP-
Nutrition component reflected the revised indicators in mid 2003 (see Nutrition
component ICR for details)

  In the "PE Reforms" component, a revision in the key performance indicator was made
as follows:

  Privatization / Closure/ Restructuring of 12 companies was expanded to 19.

1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design
(this section is descriptive, taken from other documents, e.g., PAD/ISR, not evaluative)

1.1 Context at Appraisal
(brief summary of country and sector background, rationale for Bank assistance)

As in most Indian states, development expenditure in Andhra Pradesh (AP) had been crowded out
in the last ten to fifteen years by costly and poorly targeted subsidies, by a rapidly expanding civil
service and by interest payments. As a result, critical public spending on social development and
the maintenance of the essential infrastructure, especially irrigation and road networks had fallen
short of the state's needs. This led to a low level of social development, high incidence of poverty
and relatively slow rate of economic growth in AP. This was reflected in social development
indicators of the state, most of which were below the national average.

Against this background, the AP Economic Restructuring Project (APERP) was designed to
provide resources to meet priority needs in human development (nutrition, primary health and
primary education) and in the maintenance of economic assets affecting the rural poor (irrigation,
rural roads and core access roads). This investment was linked to a program of fiscal reform
aimed at creating fiscal space for new investment and bringing about a permanent shift in public
expenditures towards these priority areas, while maintaining tight control over total public
expenditure and debt. Fiscal reform and reallocating expenditure to priority areas was a key
feature of the design of the APERP.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

As mentioned above, this multi0sector investment loan was linked to a fiscal reform program of
the government. While there were no objectives at the project level, component-wise PDO's and
Key Indicators as approved are listed below:

(iii) Increase in the average achievement levels.
(iv) Reduction in differences in these indicators among gender and other social groups to less
      than 5 percent.

IV. ROADS: Improve the quality of life of the rural population through provision of basic all-
weather roads.
Key Performance Indicators:
(i)   Completion and continued maintenance of all-weather road access to about 1.5 million
      people in the three selected districts.
(ii)  Corresponding reduction in vehicle operating costs.

V. IRRIGATION: Reverse the decline in irrigated area by improving maintenance and
management of irrigation schemes and farmers' involvement in management.
Key Performance Indicators:
(i)   70 percent of Water Users' Associations (WUA) functioning.
(ii)  Strengthened cost recovery for Operation and Maintenance (O&M).
(iii) Expansion of effectively irrigated areas on existing systems.
(iv) Yield increase in irrigated crops.

VI. PUBLIC ENTERPRISE (PE) REFORMS: Reduce the fiscal burden of PEs and
cooperatives by restructuring and privatizing commercial PEs providing goods and services that
the private sector is equally or better able to provide.
Key Performance Indicators:
(i)   Privatization (bringing to the point of sale) and/or closure of 12 companies in the Phase I
      Action Plan.
(ii)  Preparation of a Phase II Action Plan.
(iii) Improvement of institutional capacity for privatization.

VII. FISCAL REFORMS: Ensure sustainable government finances while restructuring public
expenditures to reduce poverty, improve social development outcomes and strengthen growth
performance.

To measure progress on fiscal reforms, GoAP had put in place a medium term fiscal framework
(MTFF). This framework was revised and targets changed in the light of changing macro-
economic situation and unforeseen expenditures.          The MTFF was monitored under the
Development Policy Loans (DPLs) from 2001 onwards when the first DPL was under preparation.
Since the last 6 years, the MTFF has been monitored closely under the 3 DPLs which were done
in 2002, 2004 and 2007. Most fiscal targets are on track (for details see the Program Document
for DPL III - Report No.36927-IN)

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification

In agreement with the state government, in the "Nutrition" component, a revision of the impact
indicator was made as follows:

     · Project specific reduction in severe and moderate malnutrition in 0-36 month old children
        (<2SD, NCHS Growth Standards). Up to 2 percent points annually in project blocks
        presuming a 1.1 percent point annual secular trend.




                                                   2

In the "PE Reforms" component:
    · Privatization / Closure/ Restructuring of 12 companies was expanded to 19.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries,
(original and revised briefly describe the "primary target group" identified in the PAD
and as captured in the PDO, as well as any other individuals and organizations expected
to benefit from the project)

While the direct beneficiaries and target population are described in the individual components of
the project below, the primary target group was the socially disadvantaged and the rural poor in
the state of Andhra Pradesh. It was also expected that the benefits of faster economic growth,
arising from greater fiscal discipline in the public sector would benefit the entire population of the
state.

Nutrition: This component covered 251 blocks in 21 districts out of the 363 existing blocks in the
state. The 54,007 Anganwadi Centers (AWCs) cater to 2.9 million children, aged 6 months to 6
years, and 0.8 million pregnant and lactating mothers. This exceeded the 2.1 million beneficiaries
estimate identified in the PAD, by 1.6 million.

Primary Health: This component aimed to benefit the entire population of the state.

Primary Education: The main beneficiaries were the approximately 8 million children aged 5 to 9,
residing in 14 educationally disadvantaged districts of AP.

Rural Roads: The main beneficiaries were about 1.5 million people in 2,677 villages in the three
selected districts which were not accessible through motorized transport during the monsoon
season.

Irrigation: Spanning across major, medium and minor irrigation schemes, this component targeted
2.45 million farming units corresponding to a rural population of about 12 million people, mostly
poor.

1.5 Original Components (as approved)

Component 1: Nutrition (Integrated Child Development Services) (US$103.3 million): This
component had seven sub-components : (a) service quality improvement; (b) women's
empowerment; (c) staffing and infrastructure development; (d) management and institutional
development; (e) training; (f) information, education and communications; and (g) monitoring
and evaluation.

Component 2: Primary Health (US $ 70.2 million): This component had three sub-components:
(a) upgrading primary health care services; (b) capacity and institution building; and (c)
enhancing community participation.

Component 3: District Primary Education (US $ 168.5 million): This component had three sub-
components: (a) expanding access to primary education, particularly for disadvantaged groups;
(b) increasing retention and improving learning achievement in primary schools; and (c)
improving state and district capacity to manage primary education.




                                                   3

Component 4: Rural Roads Upgrading and Maintenance (US $ 199.8 million): This component
had four sub-components : (a) State Roads: heavy periodic maintenance of primary core network
of state highways; (b) upgrading; (c) maintenance of core rural road network; (d) capacity
building.

Component 5: Irrigation Rehabilitation and Maintenance (US $ 282.3 million): This component
had four sub-components (a) Scheme performance improvement consisting of minimum
rehabilitation of major and medium irrigation schemes (2.45m ha) and recurrent maintenance of
major, medium, and minor irrigation schemes (3.70m.ha); (b) Scheme Improvement and Farmer
Turnover (SIFT) covering pilot schemes in each of the three AP regions (46,756 ha); (c) Irrigated
Agriculture Intensification Program (IAIP) in all project irrigation schemes; and (d) Institutional
support to the Irrigation and Command Area Development Department (I&CADD) and the Water
Users Associations (WUAs) including the setting up of a Project Management Unit (PMU) and a
Human Resources Development (HRD) Unit for training and WUA support.

Component 6: Public Enterprise Reform (US$26.2 million): The reform program had three parts,
which were implemented over a period of five years: (a) implementation of the Phase I Action
Plan; (b) strengthening of institutional capacity; and (c) preparation of a Phase II Action Plan.
Only sub component (a) was funded under this project. Parallel DFID grant funding supported all
three sub-components.

1.6 Revised Components

Under the "Irrigation" component, at the request for GoAP, rehabilitation work on 2934 minor
irrigation schemes was added to the Minimum Rehabilitation Works.

Under the "Health" component, the scale of civil works was enhanced in view of the progress
made in this component, as well as the reduced cost of construction of the new PHC design
developed under the project. The number of PHCs to be constructed was increased from 416 to
626. In addition, in order to comply with Government of India's Bio-Waste Management and
Handling Rules, a Health Care Waste Management component was added in 2001, covering
short-term, low cost measures along with suitable final disposal solutions for medical waste
generated at the PHC.

1.7 Other significant changes
(in design, scope and scale, implementation arrangements and schedule, and funding
allocations)

The project was restructured three times during its 7-year implementation period. The first
restructuring in June 2000 included expansion of the scope of the irrigation component,
reallocation of proceeds across components and categories and amending the percentage of
disbursement for certain categories. An equivalent of US$60 million was reallocated from the
Nutrition component to the four other components.

The project was restructured a second time before its original closing date of March 2004. The
main objective of the second restructuring was to help sector components complete the unfinished
activities and take up a few additional activities critical to the overall developmental objectives of
the project. Fresh implementation plans were drawn up in line with the funds available. Given
the complex multi-sector multi-task nature of the project, there was a shift of resources within
categories and some across components in line with the requirements of the six sectors (discussed



                                                  4

below). Restructuring included an extension of the project by 18 months to September 30, 2005,
for all components.

(i) Nutrition Component: There was an overall increase of 20 percent with the entire increase
     going to incremental operating cost.

(ii) Health Component: A major shift of resources from the goods and operating costs categories
     to civil works and consultants was required. However, the overall component allocation did
     not change.

(iii)Education Component: There was a 15 percent reduction mainly coming from operating costs
     category.

(iv) Roads Component: There was an increase by 25 percent, all allocated to civil works and
     consultants.

(v) Irrigation Component: While there was no change in the overall allocation; there was a shift
     from other categories to civil works within this component.

An amount of SDR 34,600,619 equivalent was reallocated representing 19 percent of the original
credit amount. An amount of US$ 20,578,245 was reallocated representing 7 percent of the
original loan amount. Because this reallocation was more than 5 percent of the overall credit/loan,
Board approval was sought on a no-objection basis in accordance with OP/BP 13.25.

The project went through a final round of extension and reallocation in September 2005 by an
additional six months, which brought the cumulative extension of this project to 2 years. Only
two of the five investment components of the project, roads and irrigation, were extended. The
other three components, education, health and nutrition closed as scheduled, in September 2005.

Overall there was a reduction in the education component by 10 percent and an increase in roads
by 25 percent, with no change in total allocation to health, nutrition and irrigation.       This
reallocation was required for adjusting overdrawls under Education, Nutrition and Health Sectors
as well as to provide additional funds to Roads Sector. An amount of SDR 11,500,915 equivalent
representing 6.4 percent of the original credit amount; and an amount of US$ 1,573,162
representing 0.52 percent of the original loan amount was reallocated.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry
(including whether lessons of earlier operations were taken into account, risks and their
mitigations identified, and adequacy of participatory processes, as applicable)

The project components were designed incorporating lessons from several World Bank studies
and projects in the state. The entire project was prepared in line with the then CAS objectives.
Projects from which lessons were incorporated in the design of the APERP were:

1) Andhra Pradesh Primary Education Project funded by DFID.
2) District Primary Education Project I and II.
3) Andhra Pradesh State Highway Project.
4) Andhra Pradesh Irrigation II and III Projects.
5) Integrated Child Development Services I and II.
6) Tamil Nadu Integrated Nutrition Project II.
7) Andhra Pradesh First Referral Health System Project (APFRHSP).

Sector Reports considered included:

1)   Policy and Finance Strategies for strengthening Primary Health Care Services (Report No.
     13042-IN, 1995).
2)    New Directions in Health Sector Development (Report No. 15753-IN, 1997).
3)    Andhra Pradesh: An Agenda for Economic Reform (Report No. 15901. 1997).

Steps taken to enhance quality at entry included the following:

1.      Preparatory studies/participatory assessments:         Studies were conducted for all
components and some sub-components to select appropriate project site, improve safeguards and
service and staffing norms. E.g.: the Health component completed, prior to negotiations, a 'Tribal
Strategy' in line with safeguards requirement to address issues of access and availability of
services in remote areas; service norms; equipment and staffing norms for Primary Health
Centres and plans for surveillance of communicable diseases. The Andhra Pradesh Burden of
Disease and Cost Effectiveness Study undertaken under the APFRHSP helped the project chose
the interventions at the PHC and outreach levels. Participatory assessments to identify
beneficiaries were conducted for the health and nutrition components; and to define the core rural
road network and priority investments for the roads component. Also, the Central Road Research
Institute conducted a rural transport survey that helped identify rural transport and travel
characteristics and develop a database for rural transport planning.

2.      Fiduciary risks associated with social sector projects such as inadequate provisioning of
funds, flow of funds, weak procurement and financial management arrangements: These were
identified upfront and arrangements were made both at the project and component level to
address them to the extent possible at the design stage. For instance, all six components though
implemented by six different departments were coordinated centrally by the finance department,
the key department responsible for ensuring adequate and smooth flow of funds. This worked for
most part of project implementation except some periods when GoAP faced a temporary fiscal
crunch. To minimize procurement delays, procurement plans were prepared in advance in several
cases, example, the nutrition component had developed a procurement plan for the first year and
the health component had prepared procurement packages for the planned civil works with



                                                  6

standard drawings and technical specifications for all equipments to be purchased under the
project.

3.      Staffing and Project Management Issues: Inadequately empowered and inappropriate
staffing leading to implementation delays was a lesson learnt from a number of earlier operations
in these sectors. A centralized Project Management Unit (PMU) in the finance department and
decentralized PMUs at the component (department) level were a part of the project design. Apart
from this, each sector component put in place systems which were appropriate for the sub-
components that were to be implemented. For instance, the nutrition component had a Project
Director and associated Implementation Committees for day to day decision making and flow of
funds. A number of other units/societies were put in place. These included the AP State
Implementation Society, AP Prathamik Vidhyarthi Parishattu for Primary Education,
ALAMTARI for Participatory Irrigation Management and other field units. The Primary Health
Component ensured that the Project Director and Additional Project Director were in place soon
after project start up, service norms were developed during project preparation, and adequate
number of doctors' were contracted within six months of project effectiveness. The primary
education component adopted a decentralized approach focused on schools, learning and
communities. This was enabled by clear articulation of roles and responsibilities of head teachers,
Teacher Centres, Mandal Resource Centres in articulating school policy backed by appropriate
training and support.

The specific lessons incorporated in the design of the different components of the project are in
the Project Appraisal Document. The lessons led to several improvements in the design of the
sector components and development of detailed Project Implementation Plans. Risk management
issues are described component wise below. A detailed description sub-component wise is given
in the ICR for each of the components respectively.

                                                implementation.          The         component
                                                implementation was rated `Unsatisfactory'

                                                the PMU with the general ICDS Directorate
                                                ensured sustainability of project activities.
                                                Other donors such as CARE and UNICEF
                                                were invited to continue support to project

                                            financial accountability was sought to be
                                            established through release of funds into the
                                            joint account of the Head Master and School
                                            Education     Committee.    Parent     Teacher
                                            Associations were established in all the
                                            schools of the project districts. SPO staffing
                                            was strengthened and additional project
                                            director appointed before negotiation.

funding may not be available.               the District level) and GoAP could not be
                                            avoided.    Due    to    these    delays    the
                                            implementation of the annual maintenance
                                            plans was seriously affected. The GoAP also
                                            did not dedicate adequate staff for the
                                            implementation of rural roads maintenance
                                            works. Consequently, there were delays in the
                                            preparation of annual maintenance plans as
                                            well as in execution of maintenance works.

                                                 seven years of the project. Total collection
                                                 against current demand has ranged from 19

                                                 in 2005-06. The transfer of funds to WUAs
                                                 has ranged between 0 percent from 1997-98

                                                 the issuance of a new Government Order in
                                                 2005 which slowed the transfers to 10 percent
                                                 in 2005-06.

A formal QAG assessment at entry is not available but the Quality at Entry, Participatory Process
and Design are rated satisfactory for the detailed attention given to the design of the project.

2.2 Implementation
(including any project changes/restructuring, mid-term review, Project at Risk status, and actions
taken, as applicable)

The project was implemented by Women Development and Child Welfare, GoAP (Nutrition),
Department of Health, GoAP (Primary Health), Department of Education, GoAP (Primary
Education), Department of Roads and Buildings, GoAP (Roads), Irrigation Department, GoAP
(Irrigation) and Public Enterprises Department, GoAP (Public Enterprise Reforms). The overall
coordination was done by the Finance Department, GoAP and Department of Economic Affairs,
GoI.

Given the complex multi-sector, multi-team nature of this project, it was restructured three times
during its seven year implementation. Restructuring included reallocation of resources across
components and categories, and after two extensions, the project closed two years later than its
original closing date of March 2004 (see also section 1.7)

Component-wise experience during implementation varied and salient features of the same are
listed below:

Nutrition:

·      This component was included as a component of the larger project as a Centrally
       Sponsored Scheme of GoI, namely the Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS).
·      Earlier conceived as an ICDS plus activities in APERP (eg. establishing 17,000 creches and
       community nutrition fund) it was later included purely as GoI's ICDS project.
·      Implementation of this component suffered delays due to non-approval at the state level of
       services to 100 new Blocks as planned in the Project Implementation Plan.



                                                 10

·   Part of the APERP Nutrition component was included in the Second Integrated Child
    Development (ICDS II) Project (Cr. 2470-IN, 1993-2002) in September 2000, in order to
    utilize IDA savings.
·   US$ 60 million from this component was re-allocated to other investment components of
    APERP (approved by the Bank's Board on May 31, 2000). US$ 14.5 million of this
    component, the remaining amount, was utilized for activities post ICDS II.
·   The component did not attract any risk flags during implementation.

Primary Health:

·   The continuation of the project preparation team as the Project Implementation Committee
    facilitated project implementation.
·   Financial management suffered due as claims sent to the centralized PMU from the primary
    health component were not always expeditiously submitted for reimbursement. This was
    resolved in the later part of the project.
·   Interaction between the Bank and government teams was frequent helping resolve day-to-
    day problems during implementation.
·   There were also some issues with turnover of key staff during the initial years, although for
    the last three years the implementation team was relatively stable.
·   Accounting of funds released to the district level was not systematic, as result of which
    there were a number of audit disallowances pending at project closing, which were
    thereafter resolved.
·   There was minor project restructuring as a new component 'Health Care Waste
    Management' was added in 2001 to comply with Government of India's Bio-waste
    Management and Handling Rules.
·   All covenants were in compliance throughout and there were no risk flags.

Primary Education:

·   The component's implementation benefited from proactive actions from the Government
    and implementing agency. For instance, funds were released for the construction of
    Mandal Resource Centres before the project became effective.
·   More or less timely provision of funds, training, and other inputs as well as monitoring and
    follow up were carried out.
·   There were persistent problems of staffing and implementation capacity.
·   The information management system went through a long gestation period and became
    fully operational only in 2004/05.
·   An audit trail for the compiled Statement of Expenditure in the form of a register/other
    records was missing although compilation of expenditure information was regular. This led
    to a significant amount of expenditure disallowances by auditors. Financial management
    supervision was limited to a review of the audit reports as per an agreement with the
    Government of India's Human Resource Development Department.
·   Short tenures of Bank staff (six different task managers) assigned to the project resulted in
    lost knowledge and impacted the quality of contact between Bank staff and their
    Government counterparts.




                                               11

Rural Road Upgrading and Maintenance:

·     Dedicated PIU's in the implementing Departments (Roads and Building Department (RBD)
      and Panchayat Raj Engineering Department (PRED)) with sufficiently delegated powers
      facilitated effective implementation. The responsiveness is evidenced by the quality and
      timeliness of various studies that was satisfactory.
·     The component implementation suffered from time to time on account of: (i) delays in the
      release of maintenance funding preventing the timely execution of the maintenance
      component; (ii) high turnover of PRED staff compromised the implementation of the
      performance based maintenance contracts; (iii) delays in approval of the annual
      maintenance plans by Zilla Parishads and GoAP which affected the implementation of the
      annual maintenance plans; (iv) transfer of management staff (particularly the Project
      Director towards the end of the project) affected the final contract awards; and (v) PRED's
      limited capacity and experience to manage large projects, leading to long delays in decision
      making.
·     All the loan covenants and Bank's policies were complied with.

Irrigation Rehabilitation and Maintenance:

·     The component's progress was seriously affected and rated unsatisfactory from November
      2002 until March 2005 as (i) the tenure of most WUAs and DCs had ended and there were
      no elections. These institutions were critical to carrying out participatory rehabilitation
      works and for improving irrigation services; and (ii) water charge collection efficiency had
      fallen to low levels threatening the sustainability and quality of irrigation services.
·     There were delays in the procurement of consultancy services and contracting several
      studies which impeded project implementation and the quality of impact assessment and
      independent evaluation of the project. The impact of the training component could have
      been better with better coordination between the different agencies, quicker release of funds
      to the agriculture department and focused training on irrigated agriculture, on-farm water
      management, crop diversification and improving the conjunctive use of water.
·     The project underwent an expansion in scope when at the request of the Government
      minimum rehabilitation work on 2934 minor irrigation tanks were added to the Minimum
      Rehabilitation works sub-component. Project cost, including contingencies was increased
      from US$ 282.3 million at the time of appraisal to US$ 314.12 million during the mid term
      review to accommodate the additional component of minor irrigation tanks (of which
      2865 was completed) and some additional minimal rehabilitation work carried out on major
      and medium schemes. The cost of the different sub-components were rebalanced depending
      on progress and compared to the PAD the major changes were: actual costs incurred on the
      Minimum Rehabilitation Works component increased from 30 percent to 57 percent of total
      cost and recurrent maintenance expenditure reduced from 41 percent to 35 percent. Other
      sub components only saw minor adjustment.

Public Enterprise Reform:

·     Phase I involved privatization and closure of 12 medium-sized/small companies. This was
      expanded to 19 along with a social safety net for the affected workers. By the end of the
      project 18 out of the 19 units identified under the phase I program had been privatized,
      closed or restructured.




                                                 12

·      Despite the legal and management problems associated with privatization/closure,
       implementation of Phase I of the program (under this project) was completed on time.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

There was no M&E framework for the project as a whole. It was designed for some components
and not for others.      However, delays in carrying out the studies and poor implementation
probably robbed them of their full utility. While the choice of monitoring indicators in some
cases was poor (e.g. nutrition, and health, see below), even the data collected under the M&E
process appears less than optimally utilized. Some examples of the M&E process under the
different components are given below.

Nutrition: The nutrition component included the establishment of a formal M&E system with an
allocation of USD 1.4 million (about 1.3 percent) of total component cost.        The objective of
M&E was four fold: (i) improve MIS related to ICDS in the state; (ii) operational research; (iii)
continuous social assessments and, (iv) base-line, mid-term and end-line surveys. The design of
M&E was less than adequate and the implementation of the surveys robbed them of much of their
utility for the project. It took almost two years to complete the baseline survey. By that time the
project was well into implementation and the data had limited value. The numbers in the Project
Appraisal Document did not match the baseline data. The mid term survey was also delayed to
2003-04. Since the project was due to close on March 31, 2004 this survey was treated as the end-
line for the project. While the baseline survey was a beneficiary design rather than a population
based design and lacked control measurements, the mid term survey made amends with a
population rather than beneficiary survey with control groups etc. The survey results were a little
late to be used in effecting changes in implementation. However, this does not take away the
benefit the project provided by creating capacity for carrying out large nutrition surveys. A
district nutrition profile resulted from the survey. Specific software to monitor qualitative and
semi-quantitative information was installed. Several operations research studies were also carried
out on costs and efficiency of the different feeding systems under the ICDS. Other surveys
included coverage of tribal population and infant feeding practices.     The nutrition component
suffered from too many indicators which were complex and some clearly not related. For instance,
how could nutrition inputs be attributed to reducing Infant Mortality rate or Low birth rate?
Similarly, in the initial survey, internationally comparable growth indicators were not used for
impact indicators on reducing child malnutrition.

Primary Health: The health component also had a monitoring framework that was inadequate to
measure development outcomes (DOs). Several of the indicators were vague, and did not have
specified targets ("increased supply", "increased availability"); increases in allocation to drugs
were not measured in real terms. Some indicators were inappropriate: the indicators on
admissions due to pregnancy-related complications was inappropriate since PHC norms did not
include this service. Finally, measuring increased access for women and tribals was not possible
since disaggregated data was not collected; and separate surveys for this purpose were not
planned.

Primary Education: The education component initiated the establishment of an integrated
education management system. The use and analysis of data became institutionalized under the
project and the collection of data on a range of education indicators improved. Positive steps were
taken to develop research and evaluation studies to address primary education needs. Sixteen
external studies were carried out under the project. A key objective of this component was to
improve learning achievement by 25 percent over the baseline. A baseline study covering 22,000



                                                 13

students was conducted in 1998-99. A follow on midterm study and terminal study were
conducted in 2001-02 and 2004-05 respectively. Further, a study on program implementation
was carried out and corrective actions were taken by project offices and resource groups. A
number of action research studies were also carried out by teachers. Many of these studies
focused on challenges faced by teachers and the resource centres in program implementation.
However, the quality of many of these studies and their usability in planning has been limited.
Some of the large scale planning designs and impact assessment studies have data gaps. For
example, the learning achievement data does not capture alternative schools. The process of data
gathering and its management was a concern and the inconsistency of data made it unreliable to
meaningful use for planning and monitoring purposes.

Rural Roads: The rural road upgrading and maintenance sub-component included the collection
of M&E data on standard performance indicators on a regular basis. Benchmarking for the sub-
component was done through a rural transport survey at the beginning of the project. But how
well the data was used in implementation is less clear.

Irrigation: The irrigation component integrated an M&E cell with the PMU. A total of 12 studies
were completed with significant delays denying the project the utility of timely findings. The
delays also impeded the quality of impact assessment and independent evaluation of the project.
For instance a baseline study that was to be completed by September 30, 1999 was finally
completed in July 2004. Another example of relatively weak emphasis on evaluation was the less
than active follow up of the recommendations of the external evaluation by an NGO of the
training and 'On farm demonstration' program under the component.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance
(focusing on issues and their resolution, as applicable)

The project was generally in compliance with the safeguard and fiduciary standards that were set
out. The main observations relate to coordination problems between the state level PMUs and
District level implementation authorities that resulted in difficulty in reconciling accounts at the
district level. At least three components under the project (Education, Nutrition and Health)
suffered from fairly large audit disallowances and recertification with net disallowances
outstanding at project closure. Staffing issues related to financial management staff in the
different implementing authorities could have been attended to more expeditiously by the state
government. Efforts at introducing and integrating computerized financial management system
met with limited success. A few examples highlight the preceding observations are:

Nutrition: The nutrition component was funded out of various Banks credits (ICDS-II, APERP
and WCD/ICDS III) that rendered the tracking of funds flow, reimbursement claims, audit reports
and disallowances and recoveries a complex task. A computerized financial management system
developed for the component remained unused. The tool malfunctioned and its implementation
suffered from the lack of services of a financial management expert. The project therefore
maintained its accounting records through spreadsheets and manual records. Although the project
complied with accounts related reporting requirements, the lesson learnt from this episode is that
a parallel system may elicit little ownership and may not be required. There were large audit
disallowances and re-certifications leaving a net disallowance of Rs. 163 million out of which Rs.
143.39 has been recovered by the Bank from reimbursement claims.

Primary Health: Financial management in the health component suffered due to coordination
problems within the centralized PMU and implementing agency. Claims sent in were not always



                                                14

expeditiously submitted for reimbursement. This component also suffered from a number of
audit disallowances pending at project closing since accounting for funds released to the district
level was not systematic.

Primary Education: In this component, while accounts could be reconciled with banks at the
state level, the exercise at the district level needed improvement. Since accounting for settlement
of advances at the state level was done outside the books of account, there was no mechanism to
ascertain and reconcile the total funds released, expenditure incurred and balance funds at the end
of each month at the district level.

On the audit side, there were a large number of expenditure disallowances by the auditors (net Rs.
0.9 billion). While the compilation of expenditure information was by and large regular, there
was no audit trail for the compiled statement of expenditure in the form of register/other records.
No significant issues with respect to procurement emerged during project implementation.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase
(including transition arrangement to post-completion operation of investments financed by
present operation, Operation & Maintenance arrangements, sustaining reforms and institutional
capacity, and next phase/follow-up operation, if applicable)

The overall sustainability of the project is 'likely' either because: a) after project closure, different
components of the project have been absorbed into other programs run by the Government (eg.
education into Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA) and nutrition into ICDS); or b) because they have
been run through the regular operating procedures of the departments themselves (such as rural
roads, irrigation and education). However, the sustainability of the irrigation sub component
is rated as 'unlikely' mainly because user charge recovery is not yet at a level that can recover the
cost of Operations & Maintenance (O&M) expenditure.
This project has also created sufficient demand side pressure, the necessary operational
instruments and technical capacity to manage the sectors. Follow up operation in Andhra
Pradesh's road and water sector are under preparation. However, the sustainability can be affected
by under provisioning of funds mainly for maintenance and insufficient higher level supervision
and coordination where different government departments are involved.

Component-wise description of sustainability is discussed below:

Nutrition: Sustainability of this component is rated as 'likely'. This stems from GoI's Eleventh
Five year plan's proposed expansion of the nutrition program; continued donor support to fund
innovations (UNICEF,CARE) in the state; the state's commitment to fund supplementary feeding;
and GoI's contribution towards feeding costs. The project blocks were taken over by GoI's ICDS
III program which closed on March 31, 2006. The merger of the state PMU with the ICDS
Directorate assimilated and synergized project inputs with the general program inputs and
strengthened overall staff structure of the ICDS Directorate. This has enhanced the capacity at the
state level for planning and carrying out service quality improvement and program innovations.

Primary Health: Sustainability of this component is also rated as 'likely'. Since 70 percent of the
investment of the component went into hardware, mainly civil works and equipment, they will
serve as long term assets to the primary health sector. However, any attempt to under-provide for
incremental costs (estimated at Rs. 360 million at project closing) necessary for maintenance,
doctors salaries, operating costs etc can mean that certain activities such as the emergency
transport scheme will come to a halt. All PHCs have been handed over to the Directorate of



                                                   15

Health Services and procurement activities are handled by the APHMHIDC. Staffs at all levels
have gone through the necessary technical and management training. Certain activities are well
established and have been absorbed into regular operations and the drug budget enhanced.
Doctors have been absorbed by the Government. The threats to sustainability are inadequate
supervision by senior sector management, under-provisioning of maintenance funds and lack of
ongoing training.

Primary Education: Sustainability of this component is rated as 'likely' as well. The national
'Education for All' (SSA) program will carry on and expand the APERP education component
across all districts and into upper primary schools and integrate them into the regular state
structure. Some evidence of commitment to sustainability is evident from expansion of some
programme elements into non-programme districts. However, a threat to sustainability can be the
lack of flexibility in the SSA programme to continue the creative and innovative initiatives at the
village and district levels allowed by APERP education component. By decentralizing
implementation authority to district and sub-district levels and community involvement, the
project has created demand side pressure for resources to support involvement at the school level.
The fiscal sustainability of the sector for now is taken care of by funding available under the
national SSA program. However, in future there could be fiscal pressure from policies such as
regularizing 'para-teachers' that can put pressure on the state budget.

Rural Roads: Sustainability of this component is also rated as 'likely'. A new grant mechanism
from the GoI encourages full funding of maintenance requirements. Further the adoption of the
'Road Policy' and preparation of the 'Road Act' demonstrate the Government's commitment to the
policy underpinnings of the sector. A new Highway project (supported by the World Bank) will
assist in the consolidation of the reform process. The concerned departments of the Government
have the operational instruments and technical capacity to manage the road network. The
introduction of performance based maintenance contracts demonstrated the interest of the
department in an efficient contracting approach. However, presently, under-funding of
maintenance and staff rotation make it more difficult to correctly implement performance based
contracting. Since project implementation took place under regular operating procedures the
transition to regular operations is not an issue.

Irrigation: Sustainability of this component is rated as `unlikely'. Among the irrigation
component's three development objectives an important one was to make the sector sustainable
through the involvement of farmers in irrigation management and cost recovery. The overall
outcome in meeting the Development Objective has been rated as 'unsatisfactory'. The project's
achievements include strengthening participatory irrigation management through Water User
Associations (WUA), tripling of water charges to bring the water charges to a level to cover full
O&M costs, increasing irrigated area coverage by about 8-14 percent and increasing crop
productivity from 4-33 percent.      However, sustainability has been rated 'unlikely' primarily
because the availability of resources for O&M of the system either through water charges
collection and/or budgetary allocation is not yet at a sustained level to ensure adequate
maintenance of the irrigation system in the state. Further transition arrangements to regular
operation are constrained by a number of issues that need to be resolved. The most important of
which is the formation of distributary and project level committees and funding of deferred
maintenance of the irrigation system. The WUAs should be made responsible for O&M and funds
for the purpose need to be passed on to them. To increase the economic returns to irrigation
investment and to facilitate timely release of water there has to be regular dialogue between the
Agriculture and Irrigation Departments and the WUAs. This needs to be institutionalized as part
of the command area policy and operational development process. However, the project fared

satisfactorily in partially reorganizing the Irrigation and Command Area Development
Department through the creation of a PMU to monitor the departments project activities and
creating a Human Resources Development Unit to train departmental staff, office bearers of
WUAs, NGOs etc. in irrigation management.

PE Reforms: This component has been sustained beyond the project's life. GoAP not only
completed phase I under the project, but launched Phase II and III of the program. Phase II of the
program covering an additional 68 enterprises has been completed. Phase III of the program with
the most difficult and challenging enterprises is on-going and has been incorporated in
the Andhra Pradesh Development Policy Lending operations (Loan 4845-IN; Credit 4254-IN).

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
(to current country and global priorities, and Bank assistance strategy)

Increasing the level of educational achievement, reducing malnutrition, improving access to and
quality of health services, reversing the deterioration in irrigation and roads, and putting state
finances on a sustainable path, were all identified goals in the then Country Assistance Strategy
(CAS-17241-IN), and are highly relevant in the present context.     This operation was designed as
a coordinated effort to meet these goals in one reforming state. AP, was not only one of the
poorest states in India but had emerged as one of the leading reforming states in the last few years.

AP's sector and fiscal reforms were reviewed and the policy agenda was discussed in a Bank
Report, "Andhra Pradesh: Agenda for Economic Reforms" (Report No. 15901, 1997). The main
sector and fiscal issues addressed by the project were based on the policy dialogue facilitated by
the report. However, while the idea was to design a truly multi-sector project which would
address cross sector issues, it in some sense did end up as a series of investment projects under a
common umbrella. While the relevance of objectives and design had a lot of merit in individual
components, very few cross sectoral issues were addressed.

Even during implementation, each of the sector teams supervised their components individually
addressing only a few cross cutting issues linked with the overall fiscal situation of the state.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives
(Including brief discussion of causal linkages between outputs and outcomes, with details on
outputs in Annex 2)

This multi-sector project was designed to provide resources and assist the government in
implementing institutional and policy reforms in primary education and health, nutrition,
irrigation and roads sector.   Investments in these sectors were linked to a fiscal reform program
aimed at bringing about a permanent shift in public expenditure towards these priority areas,
while maintaining control over public expenditure and debt. Specific sectoral objectives and their
achievements and ratings are listed below:

NUTRITION: To improve the nutrition and health of young children, women (particularly pregnant and
lactating mothers) and adolescent girls by increasing the quality and cost-effectiveness of the Integrated
Child Development Services (ICDS) program in the State.

                                       moderate category was considered the shifting of
                                       the severe grade children into moderate and
                                       continuing to be malnourished.

3.3 Efficiency
(Net Present Value/Economic Rate of Return, cost effectiveness, e.g., unit rate norms, least cost,
and comparisons; and Financial Rate of Return)

Assessment of the efficiency of the project can only be partial in so far as they related to only
four components of the project: (i) Primary Education (ii) Rural roads (iii) Irrigation and (iv)
Public Enterprise reform. Of the four, ex post estimation of efficiency was available for only the
first three components. The last component had a very short implementation period (largely
completed by mid 2002) and its economic rate of return at project appraisal was estimated at
17.4% and a financial return of 35.3% with a payback of 2 years. No calculations are available



                                                      19

after project implementation to make comparisons of the actual returns. In so far as     the rural
roads and irrigation components are concerned achievement of efficiency objectives are rated as
'moderately satisfactory' since the economic rate of return at the time of project completion was
estimated lower due to a combination of factors described under the components below.

Primary Education: The Education component can be expected to yield substantial future
economic benefits. Many joining the workforce in Andhra Pradesh will have at least a primary
education. A simulation of five alternate earning streams of students with five years of primary
education was carried out assuming that students enter the labor market five years after
completing primary schooling. The resulting rates of return ranged from 12% in the lowest case
scenario to 23% in the best case scenario. The benefits of primary education go beyond higher
wages yielding a number of spillover social benefits ­ such as more female education which in
turn reduces infant and child mortality and fertility, has a positive influence on children's and
family health, and leads to greater female labor force participation.

Rural Roads: Sub-component 1: ­ Heavy Periodic Maintenance. No economic analysis was
done for this component at appraisal. Detailed data on traffic was collected on 15 packages,
representing about 15% percent of the total expenditure under the component. The Economic
Rate of Return (ERR) for the 15 project roads varied from 14% to 146% with a weighted ERR
average of 47%.

Sub-component 2: Rural Road Upgrading. At appraisal the ERR was calculated for black-
topping of roads in the three districts and averaged 20% for Adilabad, 24% for Karimnagar, and
26% for Warangal. In Adilabad district data was collected for 14 roads, representing about 23%
of the investment in that district. The ERR varied from 3% to 44% and averaged 20%. In
Karimnagar, data was collected for 12 roads, representing about 17 percent of the investment in
that district. The ERR varied from 9% to 29% and averaged 16%. In Warangal district, data was
collected for 13 roads, representing about 10% of black top investment in that district. The ERR
varied from -6% (had been 0% in PAD analysis) to 51% and averaged 14%. With the exception
of Adilabad district, ERRs at ICR are lower than expected at appraisal because both high costs
and lower traffic.

The provision of all-weather roads yielded substantial social and economic benefits which have
not been quantified. The empirical results from an end-of-project village and household survey
are still being analyzed but early evidence shows that the expected benefits, such as better
employment opportunities, reduction in delay of transport and lower transport costs, as well as
increased attendance at school and health clinics have materialized. Farmers have also reported
an increase a diversifications in crops and an increase in land prices.

The major expected benefits from road upgrading to black-up were vehicle operating costs
(VOC) and value of time (VOT) for both motorized and non-motorized transport. Both VOC and
VOT savings have indeed been realized, also translating into lower rates for goods and
passengers. Furthermore, there has been an increase in passenger transport, notably through
three-wheeler taxis.

Cost-effectiveness indicators: Rural population served per thousand dollars of investment was
used as the primary cost-effectiveness measure that was used for basic accessibility
improvements. Average cost-effectiveness was estimated at 111 persons per 100,000 rupees at
appraisal and confirmed at 82 persons per 100,000 rupees at the end of the project. The reason of




                                                 20

reduction are higher costs and only 2.65 million people actually served with the project roads
compared to 2.8 million estimated at the appraisal.

Financial rate of return: The project did not envisage to charge for the use of the roads and all the
funding was provided by the public sector. Since no user fees accrued on the project, financial
analysis was not carried out.

Irrigation: The estimated Economic rate of return for the project was 24% as compared to 38%
projected at project appraisal. Despite several positive impacts of the project such as expansion
of irrigated area, improvement of crop yields and increase in cropping intensity, the economic
returns were lower. The reasons are; (i) extended project implementation by one year and delayed
realization of potential benefits by three to five years, (ii) frequent occurrence of drought in four
out of seven years during the project implementation period, (iii) fall in the projected world price
for paddy by 18%, and (iv) further increase in the share of paddy from 81% to 91% of the gross
cropped area.

Financial analysis was limited to the reassessing of farm level incremental net income due to the
project for a representative farm. Analysis of farm financial income suggests that in the project
areas, average net income due to project (after netting out water costs) registered a 23% increase
following the increased irrigated area, higher cropping intensity and improved income.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
(combining relevance, achievement of PDOs, and efficiency)

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
The above rating as been arrived at by taking a holistic view of the project. There are issues
pertaining to the overall design of the project as well as the design of certain components like
nutrition. The project was designed as a multi-sector project, but did not address any cross-
sectoral issues either at the design or implementation stage. All sub-components were executed
as stand alone investment projects.

While some of the outcome indicators were not well chosen, the project has by and large met its
objectives in most sectors. The project was very relevant in the Indian context and addressed the
then and present CAS objectives. Given the complex multi-sector nature of the project, at every
stage of the project cycle there was some implementation issue or the other. However, this did
not affect the project as a whole and for most part of implementation the project was rated
satisfactory.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(if any, where not previously covered or to amplify discussion above)

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

In most of the components the beneficiaries were chosen from socially and economically
disadvantaged districts of AP. In particular Primary Education group resided in 14 educationally
backward districts. In the Primary Health sector the tribal population in the state has benefited
through induction of 8,500 Community Health Workers (CHWs) as they are the first point of
contact for treatment of 24% of tribal households. In addition, provision of Health Emergency
Transport Services in partnership with NGOs in Tribal Areas under the project has improved easy
access of the community to basic health services. In the Nutrition component constitution of



                                                 21

mothers' committees (over 50,000) and formation of 'balika mandals' with anganwadi centers,
along with other inputs, has improved awareness and welfare of women and adolescent girls of
these groups. State and rural roads connectivity, as revealed through village-level discussions,
has contributed to poverty reduction by promoting agricultural development and a change in
agricultural crop patterns towards cultivation of cash crops. Farmers have better access to
improved seeds, fertilizers, and services of veterinary surgeons and extension grants. Due to the
improvement of the roads and particularly improved connectivity, spoilage of perishable
agricultural products during haulage has been substantially reduced, access to market towns and
commercial centers has improved (specially due to construction of major bridges), and the
farmers receive better prices for their products by accessing markets directly and cutting out
middlemen. The youth of the village is finding greater opportunities of employment due to easier
and faster access to nearby towns. The villagers also reported improvement in educational
services with primary schools being opened and teacher attendance having improved. The
services at health centers also improved and women commented on the benefits of being able to
transport pregnant women to hospitals if a difficult delivery was expected. Irrigation component
helped increase the income of about 12 million rural population, mostly poor by an average of 23
percent.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
(particularly with reference to impacts on longer-term capacity and institutional development)

A number of institutional changes/practices have been introduced and sustained in all
departments implementing the project.       For example the project has improved Panchayat Raj
Engineering Department's (PRED) capacity in procurement and maintenance management and
the department has been mainstreaming road engineering, procurement and maintenance
management practices introduced under the project in their regular work as well. Apart from
enhanced departmental capacity to plan and execute similar programs, some of the specifics
include better fiscal and public expenditure management and in-house capacity to take forward
the public enterprise reform program. In the investment components, in health the three most
important institutional changes are: (i) establishment of a central agency as the procurement hub
for the entire health sector, (ii) establishment of Primary Health Center (PHC)-level Health
Management Information System (HMIS), which is now regularly used as a management tool;
and (iii) establishment of a link with the Department of Tribal Welfare (DTW) to implement the
CHW program.       In nutrition, formalization of Mothers' Committees through a government
guideline that gives them financial and management responsibility of ICDS is the most important
institutional change. In irrigation, formation of Water Users' Associations has taken water
management and repairs works to the grass root level.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

The public enterprise reform program has had a huge demonstration effect across states in India.
A number of delegations from other states visited AP to learn about the same. However, PE
reform is politically sensitive and neither the Central nor State Government in India have been
able to make much progress in this area. A few components witnessed some positive externalities.
For example coordination between the Director of Health Services (DHS) and DTW was an
unplanned benefit that flowed from the project and a decision was made that the CHW program
will be administered by the DTW through the Project Officers of Integrated Tribal Development
Area (ITDA). Similarly in the ICDS program HIV/AIDs awareness amongst the general masses
increased.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops
(optional for Core ICR, required for ILI, details in annexes)

A stakeholders opinion survey conducted during the ICR mission of the state and rural roads
component revealed significant impacts on the overall quality of life of the rural population,
better prices and increased quantum of agricultural production, increase in income level of the
rural population, better availability of motorized vehicles, better access to education and health
facilities, and better availability of school teachers and doctors due to upgrading/maintenance of
the rural roads under the project. The stakeholders also perceived significant reduction in travel
time and transport costs, and improvement in ridging quality of both the project funded state
highways and rural roads.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: Moderate
The risk to Development Outcome is categorized as moderate because the outcomes of some
components of the project are unlikely to be reversed (eg. Public Enterprise Reform). Other
components will be carried forward and expanded by dovetailing with programs run by
government supported by the World Bank through multi state projects (eg. education through
SSA and nutrition through ICDS) or state specific investment projects such as the State Roads
Project under preparation. The Andhra Pradesh DPL operations provide an opportunity to the
Bank to continue dialogue and monitor the government's performance in critical sectors covered
under this project. An additional factor for moderate risk is that some components of the project
were run through regular operating procedures of the department (eg. irrigation and rural roads)
helping their integration with the government's programs. Institutional capacity has been
strengthened and sufficient demand has been created for the government to sustain the
investments made through the project. Additionally, central government initiatives that offer
resources for maintenance of roads provide an incentive for the state to sustain the investments.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
(relating to design, implementation and outcome issues)

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
(i.e., performance through lending phase)

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
As stated earlier, while the project was designed to be the first multi-sector project, it did not
address any cross sector synergies. For example, what intervention in education, health, nutrition,
roads and irrigation would lead to improved welfare of people? Each of the sector sub-projects
were designed and implemented as stand alone investment projects. They were strung together
under the fiscal umbrella without any explicit linkage. Two of the sub-components, education
and nutrition, were actually Central Schemes, which were brought under the ambit of this project.
The Bank had little say in change in the design or funding arrangements for these components.




                                                  23

(b) Quality of Supervision
(including of fiduciary and safeguards policies)

Rating: Satisfactory
Constant interaction between the Bank and the government teams during implementation was
frequent and enabled the Bank teams to be more responsive in resolving day-to-day problems
during implementation, except those of a political nature (for instance, elections of Water Users's
Associations). Problems in implementation, as well as time-line for actions to be taken, were
specified in the aide memoires; and followed up on subsequent missions and visits. Combined
meeting of APERP component teams and the GoAP were held twice a year. The mid term review
was held close to its original schedule and the necessary restructuring was carried out to facilitate
improved outcomes. Requests by the Government for extension and reallocation of the loan/credit
were responded to promptly. The supervision team provided on-going technical assistance and
oversight with regard to overall implementations, civil works, procurement and financial
management. Actions to be taken to integrate the project into regular operations after project
closing, and the associated costs, were identified and discussed with the Government. The
quality of Bank supervision was rated as "highly satisfactory" by QAG.

Each of the sector teams supervised their component twice a year. These were coordinated with
the GoAP Project Management Unit (PMU) and with the concerned implementing department.
At each supervision, a review of financial and physical progress, procurement, audit and
compliance with legal covenants was assessed. The fiscal component was first monitored under
this project regularly and from the year 2000 was moved to the first AP Development Policy
Loan (DPL) to the state. Since then the fiscal component has been monitored under the DPL.
While separate aide-memoires and management letters were prepared for each of the sub-sectors
every six months, a consolidated ISR was prepared to give the overall implementation status.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Rating: Satisfactory
Given the unique nature of the project design, each of the sector teams worked effectively with
the client to ensure that most of the PDOs were met. The project was restructured three times to
ensure that the changing needs of the client were met and the indicators were more realistic and
relevant to the changing social and political situation in AP.

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
The above rating is in view of the fact that while most sector investment components were able to
achieve their project development objectives, there were policy related issues during project
implementation which at times took quite some time to resolve. Most difficult of these pertain to
the irrigation sector wherein re-election of Water User Associations took more than a year and
collection of water charges or providing adequate resources for operations and maintenance has
still not been addressed. In the education and nutrition components, joint responsibilities of
implementation between GoI and the state, and the rigidity of the norm based central scheme led
to lack of accountability and delays. Initially the project saw a few delays in transfer of funds,
but subsequently it was smooth.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

Implementing Agency                                     Performance

Women Development      Performance of the department is rated as moderately satisfactory as the

and Child Welfare,     first two years of the project saw fast progress on civil works, leading to

GoAP                   fast disbursements. However, progress on soft components was limited.

                       The implementing agency's performance was satisfactory as project
                       implementation was largely on track. All activities related to civil works

Dept of Health, GoAP   and procurement of drugs and equipment were expedited, thereby enabling
                       completion of several additional activities. All end-line studies were
                       initiated and managed competently, leading to timely completion of the
                       same.

                       The implementing agency's performance was moderately satisfactory. By
                       and large there was timely provision of funds, training, and other inputs, as
Dept of Education,     well as monitoring and follow up. There were, however, persistent
GoAP                   problems of staffing and implementation capacity. The information
                       management system went through a long gestation period and became fully
                       operational only in 2004-05.

                       Performance of both these agencies was satisfactory. All civil works were
                       completed, except for some small structures that PRED will finish with
                       GoAP funding. Roads and Building Department (RBD) staff successfully
Department of Roads &implemented the entire heavy periodic maintenance component and
Building               improved its business practices. Change of the Engineer-in Chief towards
                       the end of the project caused delays in the award of final contracts and in
                       the preparation of the final rural transport survey.

                       Performance of both these agencies was moderately satisfactory. The
                       I&CADD worked in close association with the farmers and Water User
                       Association (WUAs) under a completely new set of rules demanding

Irrigation Department,radically  different responsibilities for the department. There were delays in

GoAP                   the procurement of consultancies leading to a long delay in completion of
                       base-line and other studies. Coordination of the project activities at district
                       level was generally poor. While training covered many topics, there was no
                       needs assessment.

                       Performance is rated satisfactory as the tasks at hand proved to be much
                       more difficult than originally anticipated. The department build consensus,
                       taking people along before embarking on this very difficult are of reform.
Public Enterprise      The communications strategy and the social safety net played a very
Department, GoAP       important role in enabling these reforms. The department handled all
                       transactions and legal issues with due diligence making this program a
                       success story.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
Almost all the physical and financial works and planned activities in the project were completed.
In the health component, due to early completion of hardware activities, the project was able to
concentrate on software aspects, with good results. While most PDO's were achieved, they were
short of expectations in certain components like nutrition and irrigation. In nutrition, although
there were initial design issues, the implementation was good. On the public enterprise reform
component, AP emerged as the leader in India, with delegations from other states visiting the
Implementation Secretariat and Department of Public Expenditure to learn from their experience.
Overall, the borrower complied fully or partially with most of the legal covenants.

6. Lessons Learned
(both project-specific and of wide general application)

The following lessons were learned:

1.   Ownership and commitment at the highest level of government is the key to successful
     implementation and achievement of project outcomes.
2.   Synergistic opportunities presented by a multi-sector investment cum program operation
     must be identified and taken into account during implementation. Outcomes across sectors
     could have been achieved more efficiently if the project design and implementation had
     taken these potential linkages into consideration.
3.   Close coordination with the government and implementing agency helps both partners to
     pro-actively take corrective measures in the light of changing situation in the state, in order
     that the project is on track to meet the project development objectives.
4.   Proper baseline data and monitoring and evaluation systems are a must to track progress.
5.   Continuous review of information collected to ensure consistency with chosen indicators is
     important.
6.   Revising indicators as well as data collection methodologies, if indicators cannot be
     measured as stated and strengthening the feedback into implementation.
7.   Continuity of personnel, adequate and timely release of funds, training of staff and timely
     decision making go a long way in ensuring successful project implementation.
8.   Appropriate choice of indicators is a must to measure developmental impact. Outputs should
     be differentiated from outcomes and these should be measurable.
9.   Apart from the above, there are sector/component specific lessons in design and
     implementation for future education, health, nutrition, roads and irrigation projects which
     have been discussed in the component ICRs (see link).

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis
(including assumptions in the analysis)

I. EDUCATION

Project's Investment and Investment per Student
The total project cost of APERP Education Component was USD 168.5 million. There were 4.93
million students at the start of the project in the 14 districts covered by it. The project enrolled an
additional 2 million students in primary education. This resulted in an average per student
expenditure of USD 24.31 over the project period or USD 3.04 per student per year.

Economic Benefits
APERP Education Component can be expected to yield substantial future economic benefits. It
has increased primary school enrollments, and the rate of primary school completion in the state.
As a result more of the labor force in Andhra Pradesh will have at least a primary school
education. A simulation of five alternative earning streams for DPEP students with five years of
primary education was done assuming that children enter the labor market five years after
completing primary schooling. Rates of return to the project were derived using alternative
assumptions about number of beneficiaries, increase in earnings as a result of the project and
project cost per student. Under fairly modest assumptions regarding the net benefits from the
project, rates of return from the project were fairly high. They ranged from 12% percent in the
lowest-case scenario where the percentage of net beneficiaries is only 10% and primary education
increases earnings by Rs 2,400 per year, to23% percent in the best-case scenario with 20% net
beneficiaries and earnings rising by Rs. 3,600 per year.

Source: World Bank Estimates. Assumptions: Between 10% and 20% are net beneficiaries of the project and project
impact will result in incremental earnings of Rs. 2,400 to Rs. 3,600. Students join the labor force five years after
completing primary education which is when earnings stream commence, and the duration of life-cycle earnings profile
is forty years. These assumptions are based on the DPEP literature cited in Sipahimalani-Rao and Clarke (2003) and
Duraiswamy (2000).

Clearly, the future economic benefits resulting from the project are potentially high. Moreover,
the above estimated rates of return are conservative and under-estimates of the true rate of return.
As demand for post-primary education increases with the spread of primary education, an
additional benefit of the project will be to increase the supply of workers with secondary and
higher education. Also, the benefits of the project will last beyond the project period. The
infrastructure built and capacities developed under the project will benefit generations of students
who come after the direct beneficiaries of the project have passed out.

Spillover Benefits
The benefits of primary education go beyond higher wages, yielding many spillover social
benefits such as more female education. Mothers who are more education experience lower
fertility and lower infant and child mortality. More educated women are more likely to be
healthier and have healthier families, as they are more efficient producer's of health and more
likely to use modern health services. They are also more likely to enter the labor force, and send
their daughters to school.

II.IRRIGATION

Project Benefits and Rate of Return Estimated in PAD
Project economic analysis in PAD focused on quantifying benefits from irrigation component
comprising rehabilitation, operation and maintenance (O&M), Water User Associations (WUAs),
Irrigated Agricultural Intensification and Institutional support and development related
investments. The combined economic impact of irrigation component was captured through
incremental agricultural production following standard methodology. The incremental
agricultural production benefits are derived from (i) expansion of irrigated area in the irrigation
command areas, and (ii) improved yields following rehabilitated irrigation schemes, improved
maintenance and improved agricultural support services.

For economic analysis, crop budgets were formulated for field crops; paddy, cotton, sugarcane,
groundnut, sunflower, pulses, and vegetables separately for three regions (coastal, rayalseema and
telangana) covering three scheme categories (major, medium and minor). Crop budget for major
rainfed crops was formulated for sorghum, cotton and pulses. The analysis was carried out at
three levels namely; (i) irrigation component as a whole, (ii) scheme improvement and farmer
turnover alone, and (iii) combined impact of scheme performance improvement, institutional
support and irrigated agricultural intensification programmes for five representative schemes
(major-coastal region, medium-coastal region, medium-telangana regions, minor-coastal region,
and minor-telangana region). Import/export parity prices are estimated for internationally traded
farm commodities/inputs. The project analysis was done for 20-year period at 1997 prices, using
SCF of 0.9 for farm inputs/ commodities that are not traded internationally, and an opportunity
cost of capital of 12%.

The underlying assumptions of PAD-economic analysis are; (i) irrigated area in the project to
increase by 5 to 15%; (ii) crop yields in the project area to increase by 3 to 10%; (iii) increased
irrigated area and yield to be realized gradually over four years in equal increments following the
investment. The estimated ERR was as follows: overall irrigation component, 38%; SIFT, 25%;
major scheme, 98%; medium scheme-coastal region, 45%; medium scheme-telangana region,
34%; minor scheme-coastal region, 99%; and minor scheme-telangana region, 44%.

ICR Estimation Methodology
Estimation of costs and benefits for the ICR followed similar approach adopted in the PAD to the
extent feasible. Using scheme and region specific crop budgets, the incremental project benefits
are assessed for the diverse production and resource environments before aggregating for the over
all project. For farm level financial impact analysis, ICR estimation was restricted to a
representative farm for the project since no system was set up for collection of detailed
disaggregated farm level impact data during the project implementation period. Hence, project
related impacts like cropping intensity; crop yield and net income are validated to the extent
possible with the help of ICR mission's field visits as well as from the available field data
generated by the available impact studies and other published sources.

The incremental agricultural output is derived from (i) expanded irrigated area in the irrigation
command areas and (ii) improved yields. The project interventions made it possible for the
farmers to irrigate the previously un-irrigated farm plots besides improving the cropping intensity
in their farms. The ERR was estimated at 2006 prices based on the analysis of the project
achievements, the satellite based impact evaluation of selected major, medium and minor
irrigation schemes, the borrower evaluation report of the irrigation component and the data
collected during the final supervision/ICR mission's field visits and earlier Bank supervision
missions. For financial analysis, crop budgets are formulated using the data from multiple sources
that include the PAD, field visits, supervision mission reports and published data from the
Government of Andhra Pradesh and India. Besides, the cost of cultivation of principal crops
scheme run by ANGARU covering the project areas was utilized for formulating crop budgets
with and without project.

While the available scheme category wise data on irrigated area, cropping intensity and crop
yields indicate increasing but fluctuating trend over the project implementation period primarily
due to the incidence of drought in four out of seven years, projected benefits are used as
evidenced by the current year indications following good southwest and north east monsoons (11
to 43% above normal) in the project areas.

The total irrigation potential created in the project command under major, medium and minor
irrigation sources was 2.98 Mha, out of which only 2.67 Mha was getting irrigated before the
project, which was also assumed for the 'without project' situation following the PAD approach.


                                                   32

The ICR estimated incremental benefits arising from increased irrigated area, cropping intensity,
crop productivity and net income between 'with' and 'without project' situations (T-1) are used to
assess the incremental benefits due to the project.

Crop yields have improved in the project areas, with the average increase varying from 4 to 33%
for different regions and schemes. Irrigated area too expanded following the project interventions
with the expansion varying from 8 to 14% for different regions and schemes. Notably, the rabi
cropped area in the project areas has gone up by 13.5% more in favour of paddy and groundnut
and to some extent in sunflower, pulses and vegetables over the `without project' (WOP)
situation. Per hectare net income for various crops increased by 6 to 48% in the project areas as
compared to the WOP situation.

Scheme Improvement and Farmer Turnover:
The SIFT component was piloted in 46756 ha out of which only 36969 ha was getting irrigated
before the project. By the end of the project, total area covered under SIFT has gone up to 51614
ha but this component experienced delayed implementation during the project period.
Consequently, following the four-year phase wise incremental yield benefits adopted by the PAD,
full realization of the potential benefits from the expanded irrigated area will be possible only
from year 2010. More than 4/5th of the expanded irrigated area under SIFT has come under paddy.
Incremental benefits per ha are assessed at Rs. 3800 per ha at 2006 prices and used in the
economic analysis.

Combined Impact of Project Components:
Following the PAD approach, the combined impacts of scheme performance improvement,
institutional support and irrigated agricultural intensification programmes are evaluated for five
representative schemes covering major/medium/minor schemes and coastal/telengana regions.
Scheme-wise and region-wise crop budgets were used for assessing the incremental benefits due
to the project. For institutional support and irrigated agriculture intensification programmes, the
costs and benefits were adjusted in proportion to the irrigated areas for the representative schemes.

Minimum Rehabilitation of 2865 tanks:
During 2000/01, minimum rehabilitation was taken up as an add-on component covering selected
minor irrigation tanks distributed in coastal, rayalaseema and telangana regions are to be covered
under this component. Incremental benefits are expected to flow from expanded irrigated area and
enhanced crop yields. Total area to be benefited under this component was 0.377 Mha out of
which, only 0.289 Mha was getting irrigated before the project. By the project ending period, the
irrigated area by the 2865 minor irrigation tanks covered under this component has gone up to
0.353 Mha, leaving still 1/4th of the potential area uncovered. Using the minor irrigation scheme
models formulated for coastal and telangana regions, the incremental benefits due to the
minimum rehabilitation of tanks was estimated and added while evaluating the project
investments in the irrigation component. Including the minimum rehabilitation of MI tanks, the
total irrigated area with the project came to 3.34 Mha as against the irrigated area of 2.96 Mha
under WOP situation.

Economic Returns:
The re-estimated ERR in PAD for the whole project was 38% with a NPV of Rs. 11,467 million
at 12% discount rate at 2006 prices (T-2). At ICR, the ERR has come down to 24%. This
significant reduction is due to the following reasons: Delayed project implementation led to
delayed realization of the project related incremental benefits both in the scheme performance
improvement and SIFT. Even in the PAD economic analysis, the sensitivity of the ERR to



                                                 33

implementation delays has been highlighted with significant reduction from 38% to 28% when
the project implementation period spreads over seven years instead of five years and that is what
has been precisely happened. In addition to this, the parity price for the dominant crop namely
paddy used in PAD is based on the projected world price for 2005, which was 22.5% higher than
the current projected world price used in ICR analysis.

Following the PAD methodology, economic analysis was done for (i) irrigation component alone,
(ii) scheme improvement and farmer turnover alone, and (iii) combined impact of scheme
performance improvement, institutional support and irrigated agricultural intensification
programmes for five schemes representing major-coastal, medium-coastal, medium-telangana,
minor-coastal and minor-telangana regions (T-3). ICR estimated costs and benefits are lower for
all the components as compared to that of PAD for the reasons outlined below.

Reasons for lower economic returns
In case of all the components, the ICR estimated increase in irrigated area, cropping intensity and
crop productivity varied from the PAD estimations. First on the positive impacts; irrigated area
expanded by 3 to 14%; irrigated cropping intensity increased by 2.7% (T-4); limited but positive
trend in crop diversification particularly in rabi season in the project areas; and crop yields
improved by 4 to 33% as compared to the 'WOP' situation. Despite these positive impacts, the
gains are more than offset by; (i) delayed project implementation extending to seven years, (ii)



                                                34

delayed realization of potential benefits by three to five years, (iii) PAD anticipated realization of
the incremental irrigated area by year 2003 has not been realized even in the year 2006, (iv)
frequent occurrence of drought in four out of seven years during the project implementation
period, (v) fall in the projected world price for paddy by 18%, and (vi) further increase in the
share of paddy from 81% to 91% of the gross cropped area. Consequently, the ICR estimated
return on investment in the individual components as well as for the overall project turned out to
be lower than in the PAD. While 'WOP' situation would significantly worsen the irrigation
system's performance as compared to the 'no change' assumption followed both in the PAD and
ICR, poor cost recovery of only 40% as compared to 90% targeted by the project-end coupled
with delays in the re-election process of WUAs, DCs and PCs would affect the sustainability.

Financial Returns:
Financial analysis was limited to the reassessing of farm level incremental net income due to
project for a representative farm. Analysis of farm financial income suggests that in the project
areas, average net income due to project (after netting out the water costs) registered 23%
increase over WOP situation (T-4), following the increased irrigated area, higher cropping
intensity and improved income. For the reasons explained above, financial farm income is lower
than the PAD estimated levels.

Annex 5. Beneficiary Survey Results
(if any)

1. NUTRITION

The project envisaged baseline, midterm, and end-line surveys. The baseline for this component
was conducted by the National Institute of Nutrition (NIN) between 1999-01. Since the baseline
itself took a long time to complete, the project was long into effectiveness when the data was
made available. Moreover, the PAD numbers did not match to the baseline data.

Change in project leadership and procurement delays led to the second survey repeated only in
2003-04. This survey was done by Indian Institute of Health and Family Welfare (IIHFW). At
this stage the Bank and the Borrower agreed that it was not possible to do another survey in the
remaining project time (original closing March 31, 2004), so the second survey itself would be
considered the end-line for the project.

This survey was of a larger scope (population based) and not limited to beneficiary assessment as
was the case with the baseline or the other surveys conducted for IDA assisted ICDS project. It
also gathered data for child malnutrition at the districts levels. Control groups were established
through comparing households receiving ICDS services as compared to project areas surveyed in
the baseline.

Over the years of the ICDS I implementation the National Family Health Survey I (NFHS I)
(1992-93) and NFHS II (1998-99) for Andhra Pradesh indicate the overall proportion of under-
nourished children (0-36 months) to have decreased from 45% to 38% and, the proportion of
severely underweight to have decreased from 13% to 10%. This reflects the prevailing linear
secular trend of 1% annual reduction in the state.

The baseline-survey used only the IAP growth standards so strictly the repeat survey by IIHFW is
not comparable to the baseline survey results.

During the course of the project there has been only one repeat survey (IIHFW in 2004 after 5
project years). In the report children below 3 years who recorded weights between 60-69% of
expected weight for age (corresponding to grade II as per IAP classification) were considered as
moderately malnourished, and children who recorded weights between 50%-59% and less than
50% expected weight for age were considered as severely malnourished. The baseline study by
NIN had indicated 2.9% and 13.3% severely and moderately malnourished under-threes and the
IIHFW survey indicated 2.1% and 12.9% severely (<-3SD from median) and moderately (<-2SD
from median) malnourished under-threes. The survey reported larger gains in reductions in the
severe category and very modest changes in the moderate category. The reason for less decrease
in the moderate category was considered the shifting of the severe grade children into moderate
grades.

The revised PDO called for achieving an "up to 2% (percentage point)" annual reduction in child
malnutrition in project specific blocks, presuming a 1.1% (percentage point) secular trend. The
final evaluation suggests that this objective was not achieved if 2% (percentage point) annual
achievement is seen as the target or even if the minimum 1.1% (percentage point) level of secular
trend is used. It is to be noted that the results of the baseline are only available in Indian




                                                 38

Association of Pediatrics (IAP) standards and a conversion formula was used by IIHFW to
compare results in SD classifications.

According to the appraisal targets of 25% overall reductions in moderate and severe categories
and using IAP classification (IIHFW survey also uses this classification to report results) the
report seems to suggest a 26.8% change in the severe category and only 2.8% in the moderate
category. In the baseline, 2.9% and 13.3% of children were reported severely and moderately
malnourished and in the IIHFW survey it was observed 2.12 and 12.92% respectively.

Overall, the results are modest and indicate areas of concern. Areas of deficiency were lack of
focus on 0-3 year old children in terms of regular growth monitoring (this is only 58% at the end-
line as against the PAD target of 90%) and referrals to the health system ­ two processes that are
vital for properly addressing long term and irreversible damages to child survival and growth.
These results also reflect weak convergence with the Health Department, particularly through its
ability to keep in position Medical Officers (MOs) at referral points. Most importantly, growth
monitoring and promotion (improving home based caring and feeding practices), and Nutrition
and Health Education (NHED) remained areas needing improvement as pointed out throughout
project supervision.

General ICDS data for the state points to deficiencies in targeting younger children, who are most
vulnerable to under-nutrition. Program registration (less than a million children between 6 months
and 3 years of age) indicates that majority of the children participating in ICDS still belong to the
older age group (3-6 years). It is important that the unfinished agenda of improving targeting of
young children be prioritized through state-specific strategies.

2. ROADS

The road users and stakeholders perceived significant economic and social benefits from the
project. The Roads and Buildings Department (RBD) stakeholders perceived significant
improvements in riding quality, increase in traffic level, and a reduction in travel time and fuel
consumption following improvements on the state highways. The overall functioning of the RBD
and management of the road network was also considered to have improved.               Stakeholders'
perception of the Panchayat Raj Engineering Department (PRED) workshop was that roads
improved under Component 2 let to significant improvements in the overall quality of life of the
rural population, better prices and increased agricultural production, increase in income level of
the rural population, better availability of motorized vehicles, better access and quality of
education and health facilities. In addition, the stakeholders have also perceived significant
improvement in the overall functioning of the PRED and the capacity of the local construction
industry. The transport costs and travel time are also found to be significantly reduced on the
rural roads improved/maintained under the project.

During project preparation a rural transport survey had been carried out in Adilabad and
Karimnagar districts. The main impacts of village accessibility were: average yield of paddy was
1.7 tons/acre in well connected villages and only 0.6 tons/acre in poorly connected ones.
Villagers expected that roads improvements would facilitate expansion of cultivated land, higher
intensity of cultivation, and more seasonal work opportunities. Poor connectivity negatively
impacts on freight delivery, school attendance, labor productivity, and household incomes.
Village-level discussions during the ICR mission revealed that the project contributed to poverty
reduction by promoting agriculture development and a change in agricultural and animal
husbandry practices, introducing cash crops to previously isolated areas and providing farmers
with access to improved seeds, fertilizers, and veterinary services. Due to the improvement of the

roads and particularly improved connectivity, spoilage of perishable agricultural products was
reduced, access to market towns and commercial centers was improved, and the farmers receive
better prices for their products by accessing markets directly and cutting out middlemen. Some
improvements were also noted in the provision of education and health services.

Annex 7. Summary of Borrower's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR

             ANDHRA PRADESH ECONOMIC RESTRUCTURING PROJECT

Andhra Pradesh Economic Restructuring Project was a very important multi sectoral project
implemented by Government of Andhra Pradesh. The project was designed to provide resources
for the developmental programmes in social and economic sectors. The sectors covered were
Nutrition for children, Primary Education, Rural Roads, Irrigation Management, Restructuring of
Public Enterprise and Macro Economic Reforms.

The implementation of the project provided the crucial balancing fund requirement for the sectors
mentioned above. The resources provided by the project were crucial because the state was
passing through difficult phase due to large resource requirement for Power Sector Reforms. The
state was also making efforts to recover from low growth of tax revenues during the previous five
year period.

The project helped to fund the expansion of the primary health facilities to remote areas by
providing necessary infrastructure in the rural and tribal areas. The resources were also used for
starting up primary schools in remote habitations where education facilities were non existent.
The project resources were also used to improve the staff capabilities to deliver the services in
these two very important sectors. The technical support given by the staff of the World Bank in
the above two areas was of immense utility during and after the project period.

The reforms were carried out in irrigation sector by bringing about a legislation on the farmers
involvement in the management of irrigation resources and related issues which has resulted in
better management of irrigation projects. The resources also funded the long overdue repairs to
the canal systems of Major Irrigation Projects. The road sector also benefited from infusion of
resources which went mainly to build core net (work of high traffic density roads in the state).

One major benefit of the programme is the fiscal frame work developed by the State Government
for the management of scarce resources for sustainable development of the state. This involved
development of strategies for human resources management, Public Enterprise reforms, targeting
of subsidies, channelling resources for poverty reduction and other related sectors. Combined
with the APERL programme, fiscal reforms under this programme made Andhra Pradesh one of
the best fiscally governed states. The contribution of the staff of the World Bank for /the success
of the State Government's Programmes is well appreciated both inside the Government and
outside. Government of Andhra Pradesh would like to place on record the commitment of the
World Bank and its staff towards the economic development of the state and would like to thank
them for setting up one of the most successful poverty reduction efforts in the entire world.
