Ownership and commitment at the\n            highest level of government is the key to successful\n            implementation and achievement of project outcomes. 2.\n            Synergistic opportunities presented by a multi-sector\n            investment cum program operation must be identified and\n            taken into account during implementation. Outcomes across\n            sectors could have been achieved more efficiently if the\n            project design and implementation had taken these potential\n            linkages into consideration. 3. Close coordination with the\n            government and implementing agency helps both partners to\n            pro-actively take corrective measures in the light of\n            changing situation in the state, in order that the project\n            is on track to meet the project development objectives. 4.\n            Proper baseline data and monitoring and evaluation systems\n            are a must to track progress. 5. Continuous review of\n            information collected to ensure consistency with chosen\n            indicators is important. 6. Revising indicators as well as\n            data collection methodologies, if indicators cannot be\n            measured as stated and strengthening the feedback into\n            implementation. 7. Continuity of personnel, adequate and\n            timely release of funds, training of staff and timely\n            decision making go a long way in ensuring successful project\n            implementation. 8. Appropriate choice of indicators is a\n            must to measure developmental impact. Outputs should be\n            differentiated from outcomes and these should be measurable.\n            9. Apart from the above, there are sector/component specific\n            lessons in design and implementation for future education,\n            health, nutrition, roads and irrigation projects which have\n            been discussed in the component ICRs."}, "docdt": "2007-03-28T00:00:00Z"}
