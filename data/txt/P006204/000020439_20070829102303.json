The main lessons\n            learned with implementation of the Project are the\n            following: bottom-up participatory approaches can yield very\n            positive results for education; revenue sharing among levels\n            of Government can foster higher municipal investment for\n            education; interagency coordination can strengthen the\n            implementation of sector policies; institutional\n            strengthening is undermined by frequent changes in human\n            resources; creating organizations to channel participation\n            helps consolidate community and stakeholder participation; a\n            good project framework helps catalyze international\n            resources; Community involvement in the definition of\n            educational needs and priorities and in the control of their\n            achievement guarantees greater sustainability of\n            investments; and an adequate monitoring and evaluation\n            system is important to assess the project's progress\n            and to encourage informed decisions during implementation."}, "docdt": "2007-08-13T00:00:00Z"}
