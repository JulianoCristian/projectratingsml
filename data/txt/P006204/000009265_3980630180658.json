      increasing the participation of parents and teachers in the\n            educational reform; c) strengthening the ability of the\n            municipalities to plan and carry out integrated investments\n            in infrastructure and educational processes; and d)\n            developing new administrative mechanisms for an effective\n            working relation among the Ministry of Education, the\n            Municipalities and the Social Investment Fund.  There are\n            five project components.  First, Municipal Educational\n            Development Programs (PDEMs), the core of the project, will\n            improve coverage education targets at the primary level\n            through the provision of educational process inputs combined\n            with infrastructure aspects as integral fashion.  The\n            programs were based on proposals prepared by parents,\n            teachers, and directors of school nucleus.  Second,\n            institutional strengthening will provide training and\n            technical assistance at the nucleus and municipal levels,\n            and provide equipment for District Head Offices.  Third,\n            Social Investment Fund subprojects will provide funding of\n            school facilities.  Fourth, rural girls schooling will\n            develop a strategy allowing for a sustained increase of\n            female enrollment within the educational system in rural\n            areas.  Fifth, secondary and tertiary education studies will\n            support evaluation on how to expand the Education Reform\n            Program to secondary and tertiary education."}, "docdt": "1998-05-25T00:00:00Z"}
