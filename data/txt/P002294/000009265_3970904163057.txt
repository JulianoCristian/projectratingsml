SENEGAL
SECOND SEDHIOU PROJECT
(CRETIT 647-SE)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
HIGHLIGHTS
The project, which was the tenth Bank operation in the agricultural
sector in Senegal and the second in the Casamance area, aimed, over a four-
year period, at increasing yields and farmers' productivity by promoting
intensive production techniques and animal traction. At full development it
was expected to benefit 7,400 farm families or 40% of the rural population in
the project area. The project was built on the results of a successful first
Bank-assisted project (Casamance Rice Project -Credit 252-SE).   Yet its
results fell short of expectations, mainly because the conditions which
permitted the success of the first project could not be replicated.
Project activities started actua2ly even before credit effectiveness
due to the momentum of the first project.   However,  soon institutional
shortcomings accumulated: lack of administrative and financial autonomy,
inadequacy of transportation means for extension staff, lax credit eligibility
and repayment policy, unmotivating farmer organization and a generous input
subsidy policy entailing too heavy a burden on the already constrained public
finances. The persistence of these difficulties led to the decision, in July
1981, to cancel the credit with undisbursed funds of about USS1.5 million or
24% of the initial credit amount.
Despite a one-year extension of the initial completion date, physical
components were only about 20% completed. Throughout project implementation
only about half of the quantities of draft animals and related equipment
anticipated at appraisal were actually made available to farmers.
At full development, the average participant farmer's revenues were
expected to increase by 33% compared with that of a non-participant farmer.
However even during the best year, this increase was less than 10%.   The
project' s re-estimated economic rate of return is 6% compared with the
appraisal forecast of 23%.
The following points are of particular interest:
(a)    The Public  Agency  regulations,  requiring  prior  control  of
expenses proved to be unsuitable to agricultural project
management (para. 6.01);
(b)    the arrangement whereby extension staff must own a car, use it
to discharge their duties and receive an allowance in
compensation, proved unworkable and led to low morale and poor
supervision (para. 6.02);  In similar situations, the project
should buy cars, operate them and monitor their use and gas
consumption (para. 8.07);



- iv -
Cc)    despite women's overwhelming role in rice cultivation,  they
could not have access to input supply because they could not be
cooperative members and their husbands refused to take credit
for them (para. 7.06); special arrangements are required to
overcome this discrimination (para. 8.08);
(d)   monitoring and  evaluation were successfully  established and
permitted  to  assess  the  project's  impact  and  identify
constraints (para. 6.11);
(e)    comparison of  cotton yields achieved under SOMIVAC/PES and
SODEFITEX  managements   points   to  the  inefficiencies   of
SOMIVAC/PRS extension services (para. 6.03).  It also shows that
with effective extension services such as those of SODEFITBX,
cotton results in the project area compare favorably with those
of the best cotton producing areas in the country.  For this
reason, the most important and immediate prospect lies in
cotton-related development within the framework of the recently
approved Eastern Senegal Rural Development Project, (Credit
1406-SE) (para. 8.09);
Cf)    since 1970, a persistent drought has hit the project area.  Its
effect on paddies' salinisation requires that priority be given
to anti-saline dike construction for land development (para.
8.03).



SENEGAL
SECOND SEDHIOU PROJECT
(CREDIT 647-SE)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
I. Introduction
1.01     The Second Sedhiou Project, designed to be implemented over four
years, was financed by a US$6.3 million IDA Credit (Credit 647-SE) which was
signed on June 25, 1976, and became effective on November 23, 1976.   It
covered the Sedhiou District in the Middle Casamance which has one of the
highest potential, for rainfed agriculture.  The Project was the tenth Bank
operation in the agricultural sector in Senegal and the second in the
Casamance area.
1.02     The Second Sedhiou Project was built on the results of the Casamance
Rice Project (Cr. 252-SE), executed from 1972 through 1976. The first project
aimed at developing upland rice production in association with millet and
groundnuts, through the strengthening of extension and credit services.  It
deviated in several respects from the appraisal design because recommended
technical improvements proved to be inadequate and climatic conditions
required changes in cropping patterns. However it was rated, on the whole, as
successful (PPAR 2056, dated Nay 10, 1978). This success was attributed to:
(i) a drought situation which drove farmers from upland soils to grey soils,
which proved to be much more suitable for modern high-yielding rice varieties,
(ii) a competent local project manager who succeeded in correcting project
preparation flaws and alertly perceived the high potential of grey soils, and
(Uii) an effective use of competent foreign technical assistance.
1.03     This report is based on the findings of Bank supervision missions,
Project semi-annual progress reports, Project Management's completion report
of August 1982 and a completion mission in March-April 1983.
II. Project Formulation
A. Identification, Preparation, Appraisal and Negotiations
2.01     The Second Sedhiou Project was identified in December 1974 by a Bank
supervision mission of the first project. It was prepared by the management
staff of the first project with the assistance of Bank staff from Abidjan
(RIWA).  It was appraised jointly by the Bank and CCCE in September-October
1975.
2.02     No important point of disagreement with Government arose during
appraisal.   However, in the course of project processing within the Bank,
several issues were raised which are worth recalling.



-2-
2.03     Concerning the financing plan, it was first proposed that the Bank 's
contribution be an IBRD loan and that Government counterpart financing cover a
large part of total project cost. However, in view of the deteriorating trend
of world market prices for groundauts and rock phosphate --the two major
export commodities of Senegal-- the Bank conceded to make its contribution
with an IDA credit and contented itself with Government's commitment to
participate more actively in the long run in the financing of agricultural
projects.
2.04     It was questioned why all personnel and operating costs were treated
as incremental. This was justified by the 'plateau theory" which argued that
the level of technology reached by farmers under the first project did not
require, in order to be maintained, further extension services.  Therefore,
extension services under the second project were intended to bring farmers to
a higher level of technology which they would otherwise not reach. Consistent
with this argument, it was assumed that after project completion no personnel
or operating costs would be required to maintain the new performance which
would be reached.   In view of th6 precedent created with the Sine Saloum
Agricultural Development Project (Cr. 549-SE/Ln-1113-SE) 1/ , the above
assumptions were readily accepted.
2.05     Concerning  project  organization,  at  the  time  of  appraisal  and
negotiations, Government intended to set up a Regional Agricultural
Development Agency which would absorb the project management unit set up to
implement  the  first project.   The  Bank  feared  that this might hamper
satisfactory project execution.   It was agreed with Government that the
responsibility of carrying out the second project would be transferred to the
new Regional Agency only on condition that this agency had been adequately
funded and was provided with adequate financial and adminnistrative autonomy.
Experience proved that more precise and watertight conditions should have been
designed to get through Senegalese intricate administrative procedures.
2.06     Concerning cooperatives, in view of ONCAD's poor performance under
previous Bank-assisted projects, it was agreed with Government that, within
one year after the date of the Credit Agreement, the project management unit
would be entrusted with the responsibility of supervising cooperatives in the
project area. However, at the Board discussions, doubts were expressed that
the proposed project would lead to a strengthening of the cooperative
institutions. In retrospect it appears that the political dimensions of the
cooperative organization were underestimated by the Bank.
B. Objectives and Brief Description
2.07     The Project aimed, over a four-year period, at increasing farmers'
standard of living in the project area by encouraging them to adopt improved
crops and livestock production techniques.   It was anticipated to benefit
about 7,400 farm families (80,000 peo;le), representing about 40% of the rural
population of the district. At full development, annual incremental
1/   OED is preparing an audit on this project experience.



production was estimated at about: 10,000 tons of paddy, 8,000 tons of millet
and maize, 8,000 tons of groundnuts, 700 tons of seed-cotton, 1,100,000 liters
of milk and 78,000 kg of beef.
2.08     The  above  objectives  were  expected  to  be  achieved  through  the
following project components:
(i)    Strengthening  of  the  project  managi *ment  unit  by  training
extension agents and providing vehicles and equipment.
(ii)    A program for demonstrating and promoting improred mariAl, semi-
intensified and intensified farming methods.
(iii)    A program for demonstrating and promoting animal husbandry; and
the construction, equipment and operation of a feed mixing
plant.
(iv)    The construction of water control systems to cover a total area
of 1,650 ha of rice fields.
(v)    The settlement of about 400 farmers' families, including the
construction of wells.
(vi)    Organizing annual training sessions for farmers and agricultural
extension workers and organizing an adult literacy program
(vii)    The organization and distribution of agricultural inputs  to
farmers and the supply of farm implements to farmers and
blacksmiths.
(viii)    The construction, equipment of 35 rice mills and supervision of
their operation.
(ix)    The  training  of  agricultural  cooperatives' staff in credit
management, procurement, accounting and marketing; and the
construction and equipment of facilities for agricultural
cooperatives.
Cx)    Monitoring and evaluation of the project's activities.
(xi)    The establishment of a regional planning unit to be responsible
for the preparation of a master plan for agricultural
development of Casamance and for the preparation of projects
which would be included in said plan.
III. Implementation
A. Credit Effectiveness and Project Start-Up
3.01     The credit was approved on June 22, 1976.  The Development Credit
Agreement was signed on June 25,  1976.   The credit became effective on
November 23, 1976, two months later than the date scheduled in the Development
Credit Agreement.   The only condition of effectiveness in addition to the



- 4-
General Conditions was that the co-financier CCCE had notified the Bank in
writing that all conditions precedent to initial disbursement, if any, under
its Loan Agreement had been fulfilled, save only for the effectiveness of the
Development Credit Agreement.
3.02     Project activities actually started before credit effectiveness since
the project management unit was already in place and Government was able to
prefinance the minimal expenses required for project operation. Therefore the
delay in credit effectiveness had no adverse effect on project implementation.
B. Project Revisions
3-03     There were no formal revisions of the project.  However in 1979i80
important changes were made in the design and scope of some components. The
land development objectives were drastically scaled down and emphasis was put
on protecting paddies against salt incursion (para. 3.06).   In view of the
deficiencies of the credit delivery and recovery systems and the inefficiency
of the extension services, it became obvious that the implementation of the
intensification packages recommended at appraisal could not be achieved on a
large scale.   Therefore the objectives became to build viable institutions:
namely village farmers groups (sections villageoises) and a nucleus of
efficient extension services which would serve for future development. These
decisions were in line with those made at the reappraisal of the Sine Saloum
Agricultural Project (Cr. 549-SE/Ln 1113-SE), which was experiencing similar
problems.
C. Credit Cancellation
3.04     Project Management was reluctant to curtail extension staffing as
requested by the Bank. Moreover, in April 19B1, Government decided to cancell
all farmers' debts and to replace credit repayment for seeds and fertilizers
by mandatory retention on groundnuts price.   These measures took away any
chance for village groups to succeed and prevented selective access to input
supply by progressive farmers.   For these reasons, together with CCCE, the
Bank decided in July 1981 not to exterd the original closing date of June 30:
1981, except to honour commitments Government had made prior to that date.  On
March 30, 1982 the undisbursed balance of approximately US$1.5 million (or
about 24% of the initial credit amount) was cancelled.
D. Physical Progress
Land Development
3.05     The project provided  financing for land development of 1650 ha.
Works started two years behind schedule due to the delay in recruiting the
expatriate rural engineer and long procedures for bid evaluation and award.
Due to the remoteness and the dispersion of work sites, the project was able
to attract only one small local contractor with limited experience.



-5-
3-06     Soc after works had started, the Project Nanagement realized that:
(a)    studies had relied on unverified da a which proved to be wrong;
(b)    many swamps were planned to be d-ai_ed but this appeared to be
unnecessarY with the lowerxng of the water table as a result of
the low rainfalls recorded since '969;
(c)    the  most  urgent  need  was  protecting  paddies  from  salt
l.ncursXon.
. _Therefore, the program was scaled down and priority was given to
protection against salt.   'he drains which were already constructed were
obstructed with earth or gravel. The contractor was unable to implement even
this reduced program.  The contract was terminated in December 1980, with only
301 ha completed, out of the 915 ha of the original contract.  The Projec'
Nanagement Unit developed another 75 ha by force account with farmers'
participation for land leveling and other on-farm land development works.
Hence the total area developed was 376 ha or about 23% of the program
anticipated at appraisal.
3-07     In contrast to the low performance for works implemented under the
control of the Project Nanagement, farmers realized important collective
investments on their own, with only 4qchnLcal advice from the project staff.
This consisted mainly in building aacl-saline dikes to salvage large areas of
abandoned paddies.  This suggests that much more could have been achieved had
the project been able to identify farmers' priorities and to get their
cooperation in the process of project design, planning and implementation.
Crops and Animal Feed Processing Equipment
3.08     It was anticipated that 35 rice huskers would be installed at the
cooperative level. However Governzent's priority was to satisfy the capacity
of an existing commercial mill. Therefore it took two years for the Project
Nanagement to get the authorization to acquire rice huskers.  In order to
minimi e risks, the Bank proposed, and Government agreed, to limit the first
order to four units.  Specifications were provided by a consultant from the
West Africa Rice Development Association (iARDA).  Although the equipment
dellvered had a higher capacity than the one recommended, the approach proved
to be quite satisfactory.   It could be extended to projects with rice
components in West Africa in order to increase the value added at the producer
level and free women from the daily chore of hand pounding.
3.09     The project also provided financing for a feed mixing plant.  The
equipment was installed in 1980 but was still idle in April 1983 because of a
missing transformer.
Farm Investments
3-10     The promotion of animal traction was considered as an important
factor for achieving the project's objectives.   However, because of the
deficiencies of the credit system, only about one half of the equipment
anticipated was actually procured. Harrows, which are important for rice land

preparation, were not available at all.  The detail for draft animals and most
importbant implements Is provided below.

Other Investments
3.11     The project was to build 112 warehouses for cooperatives;  however,
it was impossible to attract a contractor for this program, which had to be
undertaken by force account. Yorks started two years behind schedule and were
often disrupted by shortages of cement and roof sheets resulting from
Governaent administrative procedures. In total only 44 warehouses were built.
3.12    For the same reasons, the five wells anticipated at appraisal were
eonstructed by force account and completed three years behind schedule. The
project was unable to dig the additional wells which were approved by -the Bank
and CCCE in response to cattle owners' needs.
3.13     It was also anticipated to equip 47 blacksmiths as part of the animal
trascton development program. However in order to ensure that equipment would
be used at full capacity, only ten sets of equirnent were ordered. Recipients
made a down-payment equivalent to 10% of the equipment cost and have been
paying their credit installment regularly. The only problem has been that the
Project Management has been unable to supply blacksmiths with steel of the
required quality because of adimnistrative and financial procedures.
B. Studies
3.14    The projec,t provided financing for the preparation  of a master
agricultural development plan covering the whole Casamance Region in order to
avoid  the piecemeal development lCh;ich  prevailed.   The study mobilized
considerable resources in expatriate and local staff. It brought a valuable
contribution in gathering a comprehensive inventory of existing data and a
critical review of past and on-going agricultural development projects.
However the part consisting of a definition of a strategy and proposals for
future actions was somewhat lacking.   It received little attention from
relevant Government departments and despite  the  recommendations  to  the
contrary, actions such as -the development of mangrove soils and the SODAGRI
Project were undertaken.  In retrospect the master plan did not warrant the
efforts which were devoted to it.



-7-
F. Staffing
3.15     In July 1976 the Regional Development Agency (SODIWAC) was set up and
the former Sedhiou Project Manager was appointed SOMIVAC General Nanager. The
former head of Sedhiou. Project's extension services was then appointed project
manager. A recently graduated Senegalese agronomist was appointed to fill the
position of head of extenslon services but did not perform satisfactorily and
was removed after a year In office. For more than another fuill year, the
project was unable to find a suitable Senegalese for this vacancy-  Although
it was not anticipated to fill this position with aa expatriate, the Bank and
CCCE agreed to do so on Government's request. All other upper level positions
were filled on time with civil servants on secondment.
3.,6     Concerning staff other than civil servants, PHU took advantage of the
switch to Sedhiou II to terminate their contracts and to rehire only those
that had performed well.  Thus, seventeen positions of village extension
workers were discontinued, and twenty-three other extension workers were
removed and replaced by new recruits, most of whom were agricultural school
leavers.    During  -the whole  period  of  project  implementation, Project
Management succeeded in keeping the staffing within the limits forecast at
appraisal.
3.17     Three expatriates were expected to fill the positions of (i)  head of
the monitoring and evaluation unit, (Li)  head of the civil works division and
(iii)   head of the finance and administrative division, by end of 1976.
However due to administrative procedures, these experts took up their assign-
ments six to nine months behind schedule.
G. Procurement
3.18     it was anticipated that contracts for buildings, water-control works,
equipment and vehicles, totalling about US$3.4 million would be awarded on the
basis of international competitive bidding (ICB) procedures. However only
water-control works were so procured. There was only one tender from a local
contractor.  Even though the program was scaled down (see para. 3.06)  he was
unable to complete it. Eventually only US$160,000 was disbursed under this
contract. Vehicles, paddy huskers and blacksmith equipment, which were to
have been procured through ICB procedures, were actually procured through
local competitive bidding (LCB).   Cooperative warehouses and wells were
constructed by force account because they could not attract contractors. Farm
inputs and implements, which were entirely financed by Government, were
procured under government's agreements with local industries.   Consultant
services were procured according to IDA's guidelines.
H. Project Costs
3.19     Total project costs were estimated at US$14.9 million (CFAP 3,355
million), including taxes and duties (estimated at US$2.0 million) and
physical and price contingencies. Actual costs cannot be accurately assessed,
because farm inputs and implements were procured nationwide by ONCAD and their
cost were not available. Excluding these items, actual costs and appraisal
estimates compare as follows:

Total Project costs                    9.024     11,905         76
In spite of the extension of the project completion date by one year,
actual costs were below appraisal estimates for a11 items except expatriate
staff, mainly because of: (i) additional staff not anticipated at appraisal
(head of extension services), and (ii) higher unit costs. While the project
spent all the operating budget anticipated at appraisal, it was able to absorb
only about 25% of Its capital expenditures allocation.
I. Financing and Disbursement
3.20     IDA with a credit of US$6.3 million was expected to finance 42% of
total project costs.  A CCCE loan of FF 14.2 million (US$3.2 million) was
expected to cover 21% of total project costs estimated at appraisal at US$14.9
million.  Government's contribution estimated at US$3.4 million or 23% of
total project costs had to finance 100% of taxes and civil servants's salaries
and part of investments and operating costs.  BNDS was expected to finance
farm inputs and implements, estimated   at US$1.9 million or 13% of total
project costs. Beneficiaries were expected to finance a downpayment of 10% of
the cost of rice huskers and blacksmith equipment for a total of US$0.1
million, or about 1% of total project costs.
3.21     Actual total project financing amounted to about US$9.0 million.  IDA
and CCCE financings were respectively about US$4.8 and 2.8 million or 53% and
31% of total project financing. Their shares were higher than anticipated due
to cost overrun on expatriate staff and consul+tants' costs, which they
financed at 100%. Government's actual contribution was about US$1.5 million
or  17%  of  total project  costs.    Government was unable  to  raise  its
contribution from its own resources and resorted to borrowing from the euro-
dollar market on commercial terms.  For reasons given above, BIDS' actual
financing could not be accurately assessed but was certainly much lower than
anticipated, in view of the low quantities of farm inputs and implements made
available to farmers.   Beneficiaries financial participation was negligible
because only a small fraction of the equipment intended for cooperatives was



-9-
procured and also because cooperatives' funds deposited at BUDS were not made
available for the down payment for the purebase of rice huskers, as agreed in
the Credit Agreement.
3.22     Credit disbursement started only in October 1977, eleven months after
credit effectiveness, due to the delay in recruiting the expatriate financial
analyst.  The proceeds of the first withdrawal were kept by the Treasury, in
violation of the Credit Agreement. The Bank threatened to cancel the credit
if its funds did not reach the Project Account.  For this reason Government
refrained from presenting withdrawal applications until this situation was
resolved in August 1978. Even after that the pace of disbursement remained
sluggish, with six to nine-month lags between the time the Project incurred
expenses and related funds were withdrawn.    Appralsal estimate and actual
schedule of disbursements are in the Table 2.
J. Covenants
3-23     The Credit Agreement required that PMU (PRS) would be transferred to
the Regional Development Agency (SONIVAC) only after: (i) this agency had been
established with adequate financial and administrative autonomy, and (ii) it
had been adequately funded.  In fact this integration took place even before
credit effectiveness and SOWIVAC was bound by Public Agency regulations,
implying among other obligations the  prior authorization  of the Central
Financial Controller for most expenses. The credit agreement provided also
that the Caisse d'Avance of CFAF 50 million created during the first project
would be maintained. However this amount was assigned to SOMIVAC as a whole
and only 40% of this amount was reserved for the project. Noreover the use of
this Caisse d'Avance was very restricted and therefore it could not provide
the flexibility needed for the operation of such project.
3.24     The credit agreement provided also  that the assistance to and
supervision of cooperatives in the project area would be transferred from
ONCAD to the Project Management Unit within one year after signing. However,
this transfer took place more than two years benind schedule.  Other covenants
pertaining to nationwiLde policies proved to be difficult to tackle at the
level of a particular project and were generally not complied with. They are:
(i) availability of cooperatives' funds deposited in BNDS, (ii) agricultural
credit terms and conditions, (iii) interest on agricultural credit, and (iv)
deposit by Government in the Project Account of funds covering the project's
estimate of expenditures for the following three months, and (v), timely
auditing of the project's accounts.
IV. Agricultural Impact
A. Technological changes
4.01     The project aimed at increasing agricultural production by: (i)
increasing the area cropped compared to the situation without project, mainly
through the promotion of animal traction, and (il) increasing yields through
the use of inputs and better crop husbandry practices. As indicated in para.
3.10, only about half of the draft animnls and related implements anticipated
at appraisal were actually made available to farmers. The shortfall was even



- 10 -
worse for inputs. Throughout project implementation, input supply was lower
than the pre-project situation.  Pre-project, forecast and actual supplies
compare as follows:

Total P1l-4                          1,783      4,567            39
4.02     Despite these shortcomings, surveys have shown that the project has
had some positive impact.  Participant farmers were better equipped than the
non-participant farmers and obtained higher yields as a result of timely land
preparation and sowing.  However survey data did not support the appraisal
assumption whereby promotion of animal traction would increase the area
cropped.  The reason is that area expansion was limited by the unavailability
of adequate equipment for weeding.
4.03     Surveys have also shown that participant farmers used more inputs
than non participant farmers.  Moreover, faced with input shortages, they
tended to apply the  right dosages on a reduced area simultaneously with
recommended crop husbandry practices in order to get higher returns:  see
Table 7.
4.04     Another technological change expected from the project was increased
use of improved seeds. Very little was achieved in this field. Groundnut and
rice seeds distributed by ONCAD were very often of poorer quality than those
kept by farmers themselves. The project was unable to organize a successful
maize seed multiplication scheme. Upon the recommendation of a Bank mission,
the project started in 1979 to extend the "mini-kit" technique to assist
farmers in producing and storing good quality rice seeds, taking advantage of
the auto-gamous character of the species and its high multiplication
coefficient from seed to harvest (about 100 in good conditions).
4.05     Concerning the development of livestock, performance was generally
low.    Use of mineral  supplements  and  feeding  of  lactating  cows  were
successfully  tested but  could not be  extended in view of sociological
constraints: conflicts of interest between cow-owners and herders. The Cattle
fattening program came to a deadlock, because farmers were unable to find an
outlet for their fattened cattle.   With regard to smallstock, the cross
breeding of local sheep with the northern "Djallonke" breed was not warranted,



- 11 -
as these rams and their offspring were unable to endure the high humidity
prevailing in the project area.  Introduction of an improved breed of young
roosters for crossbreeding with local poultry was successful but the project
could not meet the demand.   In retrospect, it appears that the highest
priorities for livestock development were water and drug supply, but the
project was not equipped to satisfy these needs.
B. Incremental output
4.06     Due to shortcomings in input supply and to unfavorable rainfall,
throughout project implementation, production for both  with" and "without
project" (respectively measured from the results of participant and non-
participant farmers) fell much below appraisal forecasts (see Key Indicators:
Table 3). Surveys conducted for the last three project years suggest that:
(i)  <the project did not lead to area expansion, thus its impact was
felt only on yield increase;
(ii)    Only new participants who joined the project during the second
phase contributed to incremental production;
(ili)   Incremental maize production was insignificant as a combined
effect of unfavorable rainfall, and short supply of Inputs and
seeds;
(iv)    incremental production for other crops was erratic, depending on
the rainfall and input supply.   For PY4 and 5, incremental
production of groundouts and millet were insignificant;
(v)   incremental livestock production was insignificant throughout
the project implementation.
4.07     The Monitoring and Evaluation Unit collected data for participant and
non-participant farmers which permitted to estimate productions "with' and
'without" project (see table 4).  Cumulative actual and forecast incremental
productions, for the five-year implementation period compare as follows:
Actual  Forecast   Actual/Forecast

4.08     The evolution of imported rice in the project area provides another
indication that incremental production fell short of expectations. During the
first project (1972-76), rice importations decreased sharply. It was expected
that the second project would achieve rice self-sufficiency in the project
area and would even allow a transfer of about 8,000 tons of milled rice to
other regions. However this result was far from being achieved. Instead of a

rice surplus, the district experienced an increasing deficit as shown by the
following stastics.

V. Economic and Financial Returns
A. Economic Re-Evaluation
5.01     At appraisal, the project's economic rate of return over 15 years was
estimated  at  23%.    The  calculation  included  project  expenditures  and
incremental on-farm costs. Regional Planning Unit costs were excluded because
it was assumed that they would have no direct relation with the project's
benefits.    Consistent  with  the  "plateau  theory"  (see  para  2.04),  no
incremental extension costs were included after the project development
period, as it was contended that there was no need for extension efforts to
sustain the productivity level to be achieved at project completion.   This
assumption can be disputed on two grounds: (i) it is doubtful that the high
intensity level targeted at appraisal could be sustained after only a few
years of extension advice, and (ii) the feasibility of an abrupt withdrawal of
extension staff would be slim for political and social reasons. Nevertheless,
because the project is a repeater one, and there was no build-up in staffing
compared to the first project, it can be assumed that staff requirement after
the project development period would be the same 'with" and "without" the
second project.   For this reason,  we kept the above assumptions in re-
evaluating the project economic return.
5.02     Because evaluation surveys suggest that only participants who joined
during the second phase contributed to project incremental production, only
on-farm costs and benefits pertaining to those farmers have been taken into
conideration in re-evaluating the project's economic return.  Actual costs and
production have been used up to  1981.   After this date, in view of the
collapse of the agricultural credit and input supply systems and the long time
which would be required to redress this situation, it is assumed that only
very limited quantities of fertilizers would be made available to farmers.
Incremental production after project completion is estimated at 100 kg/ha for
paddy, and 50 kg/ha for millet and groundnuts. Because cotton requires dense
and permanent extension staffing, it is assumed that after project completion
this crop would be no longer under the PRS's control.   The Bank's price
forecasts of July 1982 were used for the computation of farm-gate economic
prices. All costs and benefits are in 1981 terms. On this basis the economic
rate of return was estimated at 6% (see table 5), compared to 23% at
appraisal.   The re-estimated  rate of return is even lower than the one



- 13 -
obtained with the most pessimistic assumption made in the sensitivity analysis
at appraisal.
B. Farmers Incomes
5.03     At appraisal average partlcipant income was expected to increase by
33% in 1976 terms over a five-year period, while non-participants' income
would remain constant. This improvement did not materialize; actual incomes
evolved according to input availability and climate vagaries.   Even for
1978/79 when the best results were recorded, the avarage participant's net
revenue was not more than 10% higher than the average non-participant's
revenue, as follows:
Participant       Non-Participant
Production (kg)
Paddy                       1-98                 166
Millet and Maize            244                  186
Groundnuts                  610                  636
Seed-cotton                  32                    0
Gross Value (CFAF'o0O)           43.2                 39.7
On-farm Costs                     2.8                  2.5
Net Revenue                      40.4                 37.2
VI.  Institutional Performance
A. Executing Agency: SOMIVAC/PRS
6.01     At appraisal it was assumed that the project management organization
established under the first project, which had proved satisfactory, would
remain essentially the same. It was also expected that PhU would get greater
financial and administrative autonomy. However because SOMIVAC was put under
Public Agency regulations requiring prior control on most expenses, the
project was faced with complicated and inefficient procedures.   Concerning
staffing, the critical post of head of the extension services was vacant or
inadequately filled for most of the project implementation period.
6.02     Another problem  wnich  hampered  SOMIVAC/PRS' performance was the
inadequacy of transportation means for extension staff. The extension staff
at sub-district and district levels were supposed to buy cars on their own,
use  them  in  discharging  their  duties  and  receive  an  allowance  in
compensation.  However from the time the project was put under Public Agency
regulations no credit was made available to them for buying cars.  Moreover,
despite Bank and CCCE requests, Government refused to adjust the car allowance
rates for more than 10 years.  Only in 1980 were rates increased by 20%, but
this was far from adequate to cover actual costs. For this reason, in 1980,
out of the 30 extension workers who needed cars to perform their duties only
5 had a car in good condition. To alleviate this problem the Bank and CCCE
agreed in July 1980 to finance the purchase of 15 cars to be used under
project's control.  However, due to Government's lengthy procedures, these



- 14 -
cars were not delivered until August 1981. Hence, the mobility of high level
extension workers and the supervision of village extension workers, which were
perequisites for the project's success, were impaired throughout the project
execution period, and this led to low morale and poor supervision.
6.03     The  evolution  of  cotton  yields  gives  an  indication  of  the
inefficiency of SOMIVAC/PRS extension services.   During the first project,
SODEFITEX, --a commercially oriented mixed entreprise, enjoying a great deal
of autonomy-- was responsible for cotton extension in the project area. For
the second project, it was decided to transfer this activity to SOMIVAC/PRS,
with the agreement that SODEFITEX would continue to supply all inputs required
for intensive cotton cultivation. To ensure a smooth transfer, SODEFITEX and
PRS extension staff worked together in 1978/79. From then, PBS was solely
responsible for cotton extension activities, and SODEPITEX complied with its
obligation to provide cotton inputs.  In 1982, when external financing ended,
SOMIVAC/PRS withdrew its extension staff from cotton and requested SODEFITEX
to take over.  Therefore in 1982/83, cotton growers were assisted again by
SODEFITEX.   The table below gives the evolution of cotton cultivation from
1977 to 1983, in the project area and compares the yields obtained there with
those of the neighboring district of Kolda, which presents similar climatic
conditions and has always been covered by SODEFITEX.

From  these  figures,  one  cannot  help  but  conclude  that  with
SOMIVAC/PRS management, cotton yields in the project area deteriorated
dramatically and that this can be attributed, partly at least, to extension
inefficiency.
B. Input Supply, Credit Management and Subsidy Policy
6.04     Adequate and timely input supply was a prerequisite to the success of
the project. However high delinquency resulting from lax credit management
and the burden entailed by high subsidy rates led to large shortfalls in input
supply throughout the project implementation period and eventually to the
collapse of the entire system of input supply and credit delivery and the
dissolution of ONCAD in 1980. The following sequence of decisions illustrates



- 15 -
the  increasing  deterioration  in  credit  management.    In  December  1977,
Governuent decided to: (i) cancel 30% of all outstanding debts, (ii) grant a
one-year moratorium, and (iii) re-schedule the repayment of the remaining
debts over three years. In 1978, Government decided not to provide credit to
cooperatives which had repaid less than 65% of their mature debts. At the
beginning of the 1979/80 marketing campaign, Goversment required repayment of
all mature debts before any purchase of groundnuts for cash could be made.
After one month, Government, under pressure, lowered its requirement of debt
repayment to 70%.   Finally the decision was that 30% of the value of the
quantity of groundnuts delivered by farmers should serve for debt repayment.
However, with the connivance of cooperative presidents and ONCAD weighers,
farmers cashed the value of most of the groundnuts they delivered. At the end
of the marketing campaign, Government decided for the next campaign, to lift
all conditionalities for access to credit and to retain 3 CFAF/kg of
groundnuts or 6% for debt repayment. This represented only a small fraction
of mature debts. Besides this mandatory retention, debt repayment was left to
the farmers' good will. In 1980, following a poor groundnut harvest and in
view of farmers' high indebtedness--nationwide, total debts amounted to almost
the equivalent of an entire average annual groundaut production- Government
decided to re-schedule the repayment of arrears over five years.  It also
decided to call off credit for draft animals and farm-equipment.  In April
1981, Government decided to cancel the bulk of all farmers' debts.  It also
decided to replace credit repayment for seeds and fertilizers by mandatory
retention on groundnuts price.
6.05     Besides the lack of stringent rules for credit repayment, high debt
delinquency resulted from Government policy inducing farmers to take
unnecessary credits.  Each year Government distributed on credit the entire
needs of groundnuts seeds.  There was no technical justification for such a
large distribution since farmers could easily produce and store their own
seeds.   Although many farmers did so,  they still took advantage of the
distribution of Government' s groundnuts seeds but used them for other
purposes. Because of this generous policy, on December 31, 1980, groundnuts
seeds accounted for more than 50% of total mature debts (see Table 6).
Another case was for draft animals, for which farmers could easily receive
credit even if they actually drew animals from their own herds.
6.06     Another factor which contributed to the co"lapse of the agricultural
credit and input supply systems was the high subsidy rate on fertilizers and
seeds, entailing financing beyond Government's capability. Although from 1976
to s980, the producer price of groundnuts increased from CEAF 41.50 to 50/kg
Government kept the fertilizer price constant at CFAF 25/kg. . In 1979, the
subsidy on fertilizers represented 60% of the input cost. Meanwhile, with the
crisis of public finances, total appropriations for agricultural subsidies
were shrinking. Under the re-negotiated Sine-Saloum Agricultural Development
Project (Cr. 549-SE/Ln. 113-SE) and the Structural Adjustment Loan (Cr. 1084-
SE/Ln 1931-SE) Government agreed to progressively phase out subsidies on
fertilizers and to reduce the quantities of groundnuts seeds to be distributed
to farmers; however, this did not materialize. It is worth recalling that
since 1976, opposition political parties were authorized in Senegal.
Willingly or not, Government has been compelled to match generous electoral
promises made by those parties. The political pressure was particularly



- 16 -
intense in the months preceding general eleotions (early 1978 and 1983). The
1977 and 1981 debt cancellation and re-scheduling should also be seen against
this background.
C. Cooperative Institutions
6.07     Transfer  of  cooperative  supervision  from  ONCAD  to PMU  and  re-
structuring of cooperatives by splitting them into village farmers groups
(sections villageoises) were major institutional goals of the project.
However, as reported in para. 3.23, the transfer took place two years behind
schedule.  Immediately, PMU initiated a test on two sub-districts.  It was
found that almost all membership fees were paid but about 25% of the proceeds
were  mis-appropriated  by  some  eooperative  presidents  and  ONCAD's  ex-
officers.   Farmers requested appropriate actions for the repayment of these
misSing funds, but there has been no follow-up.  Cooperative accounts were
audited by reconciling figures recorded by ONCAD with what was aknowledged by
cooperatives members in general assemblies.   During this exercise, farmers
were very cooperative and honest in reporting equipment received by them and
misrecorded by ONCAD.   They were also able to accurately assess individual
debts.   Overall, for the two sub-districts, the total debts aknowledged by
farmers differed from ONCAD's records by only 3%.
6.08     The second step consisted in the setting-up of sections villageoises,
simultaneously with the test undertaken by the Sine Saloum Agricultural
Development Project. For both projects the test was undermined by Government
decisions, in April 1981, to cancel farmers' outstanding debts and to make a
mandatory  retention  for  the  repayment of  seeds  and  fertilizers.    This
penalized farmers and prospective sections villageoises that had already
repaid their debts and prevented selective access to inputs by progressive
farmers.   No role was left to sections villageoises.   Thus the test of
cooperative re-structuring aborted.
D. Accounting and Auditing
6.09     The Project's accounting was the responsibility of the Special Chief
Accountant (ACP) who was not under the hierarchical authority of SONIVAC
General Manager. Instead he was accountable to the Central Accounting Office
and  to  the  Financial  Controller,  both  in  Dakar.    This  administrative
arrangement satisfied Government's control requireexents but failed to provide
a management tool.
6.10     Under the Para Public Enterprise Technical Assistance Project, the
Bank financed the audit of SOMIVAC by an internationally recruited auditing
firm.  Because financial statements were not produced on time it was never
possible to have the audit reports within four months after the end of each
fiscal year as required under the Credit Agreement. In addition to auditing,
the firm prepared a manual of procedures.  It recommended the appointment of
an internationally recruited accountant to train SOXIVAC staff in the use of
the manual and fill the position of an internal auditor. However this could
not be implemented  due  to administrative  procedures and SONIVAC General
Manager's resistance. In 1980, no more funds were available in the Technical
Assistance Project for the auditing of SOMIVAC's accounts.   Bank and CCCE



- 17 -
agreed to finance these fees under the Consultant Category, but SOMIVAC took
no action on this issue until credit cancellation. Therefore only the first
three project years accounts were audited according to the standards set in
the Credit Agreement.
E. Reporting, Monitoring and Evaluation
6.11     Semi-annual reports were generally  submitted on schedule to the
Bank.   The main shortcoming of these reports was that they were often too
descriptive and not enough critical and problem-solving oriented.   On the
Bank's request Project Management also submitted a completion report which
made commendable efforts to learn from the project's low performance and draw
lessons for the future. The first Bank supervision mission assisted project
authorities in establishing the format of a "tableau de bord", designed to
compare actual achievements with appraisal forecasts.   This document was
regularly updated throughout the project implementation period. It proved to
be a very useful tool. It should be extended to similar projects.
6.12     Due to the delay in recruiting the expatriate head of the Monitoring
and Evaluation Unit, project evaluation started only with the third project
year.   It generally succeeded in disentangling project's impact, providing
guidance   for   extension   works,   identifying   costraints   and   making
recommendations to overcome them.   Foreign technical assistance helped to
build up a local capability for continuing of monitoring and evaluation
activities.
F. Consultants' Performance
6.13     Because of the lack of trained local staff, the project financed the
costs of four expatriates. They all were in executive positions. They were
recruited from two consulting firms.   Their performance was hampered  by
administrative procedures, input unavailability and a high rate of turnover:
only one position was filled by the same expatriate throughout the project
implementation.
G.  Government and Bank's Performance
6.14     The former Sedhiou Project Manager and the then Minister of Rural
Development, who were instrumental in the setting-up of SOMIVAC apparently
could not get the type of flexible administrative arrangements which had
permitted the success of the first project. When the adverse effect of the
prior financial and administrative control was felt, Government made no
serious attempt to devise any departure from these stringent rules in order to
have the project successfully implemented. In its laudable quest to minimize
public spending and prevent embezzlement, Government fell into the pitfall of
imposing unduly controls leading to inefficiencies.   A case in point is
Government's resistance to adjust car allowances for extension staff.
6.15     During  the  preparation  phase,  Bank  staff  anticipated  the  most
important problems which hampered successful project implementation. However,
the conditionality set for overcoming some of these problems was not efficient



- 18 -
For instance, in view of the critical importance of the cooperative re-
structuring and the administrative and financial autonomy for project
management, the Bank should have required that these conditions be satisfied
before credit effectivenese.
6.16     Bank  supervision  miesions  took  place  about  twice  a  year  as
envisaged. There was a great continuity of staff assigned to the project: in
six years there were only two supervision mission leaders, one of whom
participated in the appraisal mission. CCCE joined all Bank missions. During
these missions, staff went beyond routine supervision and devoted a great deal
of their efforts in a technical assistance capacity. Such inputs were much
appreciated by the project management. However the efforts to solve technical
and managerial problems at the project level were frustrated by inadequate
national policies. In realizing that, the Bank tried to complement its action
at the project level by addressing sectoral issues at the Government level:
annual consultations on fertilizer policy, monitoring of obligations deriving
from the Structural Adjustment Loan, e.g. phasing out of fertilizer aubsidy,
reduction of groundnuts seed stocks, and implementation of section villaeoise
test. However the dialogue at the national level was not successful either,
because of the dilution of responsibilty, the difficulty of identifying the
right interlocutors, and the political implications of the issues.
6.17     In retrospect it appears that the Bank underestimated the political
problems and made a taatical error in requesting the implementation of section
villageoise and seed stock reduction tests simultaneously in Sine Saloum and
Sedhiou.    Instead it should have restricted these tests to the Sedhiou
district, where the reforms would have met with less resistance because of the
district's isolation from the Groundnut Basin and the habits that most farmers
already have to store their own seeds.
VII. Special Issues
A. Weather: Persistence of drought since 1970
7.01     Despite the difficulties related above resulting from institutional
shortcomings and short supply of inputs, rainfall was the single most
important factor which affected project performance.   At appraisal,  the
analysis of data showed that average rainfall fo7 Sedhiou was 1400 mm with a
probability of at least 1200 mm in four years out of five. However during the
five-year project implementation period, average rainfall was only 955 mm,
with a maximum of only 1150 mm and a minimum of 745 mm, which was also the
absolute minimum since 1928 that rainfall has been recorded.  Low rainfall was
often compounded with poor distribution.   In looking back at rainfall data
available (see Table 8) it appears that sincea 1970, the project area has been
hit by a persistent drought. Average rainfall decreased by about 30% from
1375 mm for the 42-year period of 1928-69 to 965 mm for the last fourteen



-19-
years (1970/83). It is worth noting that since the early 1970's a similar
trend bas been observed in the wrhole country 1/  and even in the Sudano-
Sahelian Zone as a whole 2/.
7.02     This lingering drought has bad far-reaching consequences.   most
varieties used in the project area are long duration types which were suited
'to the high rainfalls which prevailed until recently but paid a heavy toll to
drought in recent years.   The effect of drought was also felt through
groundwater and water salinity in paddies, because of the environmental
characteristics of the project area.  Grey soil rice was the most successful
crop which permitted the suceess of the first project. With this type of rice
cultivation., water is supplied both by rains and shallow groundwater, which
normally comes to the reach of rice roots only a few weeks after the start of
the rainy season. This two-fold source of water supply makes for appreciable
security because the groundwater tapped by- the plant roots can offset rainfall
vagaries. However with the cumulative rainfall deficit of about 6,000 mm over
the last fourteen years, groundwater was depleted and fenl out of the reach of
rice roots, *nakdig grey soil rice cultivation as drought prone as upland
farming.
7.03    The consequences of the drought were also felt on water salinity in
paddies.  In the project area, most lowland rice is grown along the Casamance
river and the SoungrougroU, its tributary.  During the dry season, water in
these rivers is always salty, but during the rainy season, high flows normally
displace  salty  water with  fresh  water,  irhich  makes  rice  cultivation
possible. However with the prolonged droughts, flow decreased in the rivers,
and most paddies were invaded by salty water all year round. This led to the
loss of hundreds of hectares of paddies.  The only way to salvage -these
paddies would be to protect them against salt incursion by constructing a dike
and leaching the salt with rains before rice could be grown again.
B. Special role and problems of women
7.04    Rice growers are mostly women.  Among the reasons for the first
project's high performace was that the management succeeded in making inputs
ava-lable to all participants, including women.  However during the second
project, with the merging of ONCA]) and PNU's credits through the exclusive
bcannel of cooperatives, women lost access to credit because: (i) only heads
of family compounds, hence men, could be cooperative -members, and (ii)
husbands often refused to take inputs on credit for their wives, although
experience has shown that women's records in credit repayment are better than,
men's.  This situation was not only detrimental to women but also entailed
less efficiency in the overall use of the  mnall quantities of fertilizers
which were made available to the project.  In fact, women would have made
better use of fertilizers because they grew mostly swamp rice, w)tceh was less
drought prone than the other types of rice cultivation, and also because it-is
well known that weeding -which is a prerequisite to the efficiency of

- 20 -
fertilizer use- is better performed in women's paddies than in men's upland
fields.
7.05     To solve this problem, PHW envisaged to assist in setting up women's
committees within the sections villageoises in order to channel credits
especially intended for women.  This could not be implemented because the
whole re-structuring of farmers' organizations aborted for the reasons given
above.
VIII. Lessons for future projects in the area.
8.01     In spite of the dismal performance of the Second Sedkiou Project, the
fact remains that -the area is endowed with great natural resources, -akimg it
one of the most favorable regions for rainfed farming in Senegal. However
this potential could materialize only if the shortcomings which prevented
successful implementation of the Second Sedbiou Project are overcome. In this
regard, the following recommendations could be drawn from the experience of
the First and Second Sedhiou Projects.
A. Technical Aspects.
8.02     Unless there are technological breakthroughs, no further exteMsion
efforts are warranted on groundnuts, millet and rice, for which the technical
packages feasible under the present constraints of seed and input distribution
policies have already been mastered by farmers. In contrast, the results
obtained with SODEFITEX extension on cotton in one sub-district of the project
area (para. 6.05) suggest that there is a great po:tential- for cotton
development.  There are good indications that the success of cotton-based
development which has been experienced in Upper Casamance could be replicated
in the project area. The institutional arrangements for such an option will
be discussed later.
8.03     Concerning land development,, in view of the increasing salinisation
of paddies due to the drought which has been observed since 1970, top priority
should be given to dike construction to protect swamps against salt
incursion. There is a great demand for such works, the bulk of which consists
of earth moving which can be done by farmers with only topographic studies and
light civil works requiring the project's intervention.   CCCE is already
considering pilot project along these lines.
8.04     Concerning livestock development, priority should be given in the
future to drug and water supplies which lend themseves to a large physical
and financial participation from beneficiaries as experienced in Eastern
Senegal.
8.05     Institutional arrangements permitting, the extension of the mini-kit
technique would allow farmers to produce good quality seeds of paddy with only
a small flov of foundation seeds, the production of which could be contracted
to ISRE.



- 2t -
B. Institutional Aspects
8.06     The experience of the Second Sedhiou Project and that of SAED before
its reorganization in 1981, show that the existing statutes of "Etablissements
Publics"  as  they  stand  are  an  unsuitable  framevork  for  executing  an
agricultural project.   This was acknowledged by Government when it re-
structured SAED into a "Societe Nationale' in 1981.  Similar arrangements
should be made for SOMIVAC before the Bank envisages a project to be executed
by it.
8.07     In view of the high cost of car purchase and operation in comparison
with extension workers' salaries, it is no longer warranted to request them to
own a mar, and use it to discharge their duties against an allowance. Instead
cars should be bought and operated by project authorities. As for SODEFITEX,
stringent rules should be set and enforced to monitor the use of the cars and
the consumption of gas.
8.08     In view of the important role played by women in rice cultivation,
special care should be taken in the future to ensure their access to input
supply and credit delivery in determining new credit eligibility criteria and
reorganizing cooperative institutions. This could be reached by authorizing
special "sections villageoises" for women as independent borrowers.
8.09     The most Important and immediate prospect lies in cotton-related
d-evelopment. This is enhanced by the net price system, whereby all inputs
(seeds, fertilizers  and insecticides)  are  apparently  free of charge to
farmers, their cost being included in SODEFITEX cotton operating margin.
Under the recently (August 10, 1983) approved Eastern Senegal Rural
Development Project (Cr. 1406-SE), SODEFITEX has already authority to expand
cotton cultivation in the same sub-district of Bounkiling where it has been
operating.   Government and donors should be prepared for an expansion of
cotton-based development from this sub-district to the entire district of
Sedhiou.   This  could  be achieved  through  a  revision  of  the  existing
creditf/loan agreements if the additional expenses required could be
acconmodated within financing already secured or through a supplementary
credit which could be easily prepared and appraised.

Borrower Comments
Republic of Senegal
Supreme Court
Commission for the Auditing
and Control of State Agencies                Dakar, May 8, 1984
The Advisor of the Supreme Court
and President of the Commission
to:
Mr. Kapur
Director Operations Evaluation
Department of the World Bank
through the World Bank
Resident Representative in Dakar
Dear Sirs:
With reference to your letter dated March 30, 1984, I would like
to inform you that I have no  specific comments to make on the PCR on the
Second Sedhiou Project which you sent to me.
Indeed, since the commission for the Auditing and Control of
State Agencies did not participate in the monitoring of this project, we are
not in a position to pass judgement on the quality of the project management.
Nevertheless, I would like to inform you that the comm'ission
will undertake an-audit of SONIVAC 1/ beginning in July and that this will
give the commission a better opportunity to review project implementation.  We
will submil to you the commissions' observations and comments in due course.
Sincerely yours
I
Signed:
George Vandercbmitt
