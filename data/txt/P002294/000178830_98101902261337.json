The project would\n            carry the 4,150 farm families already participating in the\n            first project to higher levels of technology and induce\n            3,250 farm families now using traditional farming methods to\n            adopt the improved cropping techniques which have proved\n            effective under the first project. In addition the project\n            would encourage 4,800 families from both groups to take up\n            better livestock practices. It would also help strengthen\n            cooperatives by management training and by promoting the\n            organization of cooperative unions. The project would\n            benefit about 7,400 farm families (80,000 people in all),\n            representing about 40% of the rural population of the district."}, "docdt": "1976-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
