encourage farmers in the Sedhiou district of Casamance\n            to adopt improved crop and livestock production techniques\n            by supplying them with inputs, credit and technical\n            assistance. The project will carry the 4,150 farm families\n            already participating in the first project to higher levels\n            of technology and induce 3,250 farm families now using\n            traditional farming methods to adopt the improved cropping\n            techniques which have proved effective under the first\n            project. In addition the project will encourage 4,800\n            families from both groups to take up better livestock\n            practices. It will also help strengthen cooperatives by\n            management training and by promoting the organization of\n            cooperative unions. The project will benefit about 7,400\n            farm families (80,000 people in all), representing about 40\n            percent of the rural population of the district."}, "docdt": "1976-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
