The project, which was the tenth\n            Bank operation in the agricultural sector in Senegal and the\n            second in the Casamance area, aimed, over a four year\n            period, at increasing yields and farmers' productivity\n            by promoting intensive production techniques and animal\n            traction. At full development it was expected to benefit\n            7,400 farm families or 40 percent of the rural population in\n            the project area. The project was built on the results of a\n            successful first Bank-assisted project. The project\n            activities started actually even before credit effectiveness\n            due to the momentum of the first project. However, soon\n            institutional shortcomings accumulated: lack of\n            administrative and financial autonomy, inadequacy of\n            transportation means for extension staff, lax credit\n            eligibility and repayment policy, unmotivating farmer\n            organization and a generous input subsidy policy entailing\n            too heavy a burden on the already constrained public\n            finances. The persistence of these difficulties led to the\n            decision, in July 1981, to cancel the credit."}, "docdt": "1984-06-11T00:00:00Z"}
