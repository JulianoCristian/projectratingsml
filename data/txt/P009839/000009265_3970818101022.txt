CHANDRAPUR THERMAL POWER PROJECT
I. SECTORAL CONTEXT
A. Commercial Energy Resources
1.01    India's commercially exploitable energy resources consist of coal,
oil, gas, hydro, uranium, and thorium. Of the nonrenewable resources, coal
is the most abundant. Reserves of thermal coal have been estimated at
slightly higher than 100 billion tons, of which 25 billion tons are proven.
Although reserves are ample, the quality of coal produced is generally low
and is deteriorating. Proven and probable petroleum reserves comprise
approximately 530 million tons of oil and 390 million toe of natural gas.
Despite recent increases in domestic production, India still imports 35Z of
its oil requirements, which in 1983/84 cost the equivalent of 40Z of its
merchandise exports. Consequently, the Government of India has encouraged
exploration while attempting to contain the demand for petroleum and natural
gas, in particular through limiting the use of naturaL gas to high-value uses
such as petrochemicals and fertilizer. Because it is taking time to develop
premium uses of natural gas, substantial volumes of associated gas are being
flared. India's hydroelectric potential is about 100,000 MW. At present,
only 13,000 MW have been developed, 4,700 MW are under construction, and a
further 23,000 NW are being studied for future development. The prominent
role of hydro in regional least-cost development plans prepared in 1982 has
led GOI to emphasize the need to accelerate its development; however,
progress has been slow because limited resources are available for the
simultaneous preparation of a large number of schemes and because it also
takes time to resolve water rights and environmental issues. The country's
uranium reserves could support a modest nuclear program (8,000-10,000 MW),
and its thorium reserves are enough for a large breeder program.
1.02    Planning the best use of India's indigenous energy resources for
power generation raises a number of issues and highlights several needs.
First, the high ash content of coal, which can reach 59%, tends to. increase
transport costs, as well as power station capital and operating costs. The
development of minemouth stations, which is constrained by pollution
limitations and the availability of cooLing water, helps to solve only the
transport problem, and thus priority should still be given to more selective
mining and improved coal preparation. Even though a lower ash content might
help to alleviate transport problems, they would still persist. Two studies
included in the Dudhichua Coal Project (Loan 2393-IN) are designed to help
formulate a strategy to deal with these problems: one study will examine
ways of improving the linkages between the sources of supply and the demand,



-2-
and the other will concentrate on methods of improving handling and
transportation facilities. Second, with the recent increases in the supplies
of both associated and free gas, there is a greater need for a coherent
policy on the exploitation of gas. A Bank study planned for 1985 will focus,
among other things, on the potential for the economic use of gas in power
generation. Third, if hydro development is to accelerate, further resources,
including consultants if necessary, need to be deployed to prepare hydro
schemes. Furthermore, if water rights and environmental issues cannot be
resolved quickly, COI should initiate appropriate procedures to en ure that
an adequate number of schemes are available for development.
B. Supply and Demand of Electricity - India
1.03    Approximately 50Z of India's electricity is generated from coal, 40%
from hydro, and the rest from oil, nuclear power, and natural gas. Although
a number of large thermal projects are planned for the short term, the share
of hydro is expected to increase in the long run. Electricity losses have
risen slowly but steadily over the last few years and now exceed 26% of gross
generation. The lack of high-quality coal has been at least partly
responsible for this trend, and even coal stations themselves now consume
close to 10% of gross generation against a desirabLe 5% or 6%. Distribution
networks have been overloaded because inadequate attention has been given to
systematic analysis and planning of this part of the system. As a result,
distribution losses are high by generally accepted standards and, although
they are lower than in severaL countries in the region, they need to be
reduced. Under its lending program, the Bank has supported pilot studies to
reduce system losses, and it will continue to follow this approach in its
future lending. Such losses can only be reduced on a State-by-State basis,
however, with loss reduction targets reflecting the particular circumstances
of each State.
1.04    Over the past two decades, the consumption of electricity has grown
approximately twice as fast as total commercial energy consumption and now
accounts for more than 30% of the latter. As a result, shortages have
prevailed throughout the country and, during the last five years, averaged an
estimated 13% of electricity requirements. The principal sectoral shares of
total electricity consumption are: industrial, 56%; agricultural, 19%; and
domestic, 12%. Agriculture's share has grown steadily owing to increased
electrical irrigation pumping made possible by rural electrification and
encouraged by heavy subsidies. Total consumption has grown at an average
rate of 10% per annum during the past two decades, and the Central
Electricity Authority (CEA) has forecast growth of 9% per annum between
1984/85 and 1989/90. Whether such growth can take place will depend on the
utilities' success in installing new capacity.



-3-
C. Organization of the Power Subseccor
1.05    Responsibility for the supply of electricity is shared between the
CentraL and State Governments. The State Electricity Boards (SEBs) and the
Regional Electricity Boards (REBs) are controlled by States; the Central
Electricity Authority, the National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC), the
National Hydro-Electric Power Corporation (NHPC), and the Rural
Electrification Corporation (REC) are controlled by the Central Government.
SEBs were instituted under the Electricity Supply Act of 1948 (the Act) to
promote the development of the power subsector and to regulate private
licensees. Although, in principle, SEBs are supposed to be autonomous in
managing their day-to-day operations, in practice they are under the control
of State Governments in such matters as capitaL investmenc, tariffs,
borrowings, pay, and personnel policies. As a first step toward national
integration, the SEBs have been grouped into five regional systems, each
coordinated by an REB. Coordination responsibilities include overhaul and
maintenance programs and determination of generation schedules, inter-State
power transfers, and concomitant tariffs. CEA was created in 1950 to develop
national power policy and to coordinate the various agencies involved in
supplying electricity. It is responsible for the formulation of countrywide
investment plans for approval by the Central Government, the development of
an integrated system operation, the training of personnel, and research and
development. It maintains operational, economic, and financial data at both
the Central and State levels, and provides consulting support to SEBs. NTPC
and NHPC were incorporated in 1975 by COI to construct and operate large
power stations and associated transmission facilities. They sell bulk power
to the SEBs for distribution. NTPC has had marked success and has grown
rapidly. In contrast, NHPC is still struggling to establish a role for
itself. The States own most hydro sites and are reluctant to relinquish
these sources of comparatively inexpensive energy to the Central Government.
REC was established in 1969 to coordinate rural electrification and provide
financial and technical expertise for SEB schemes. At present, REC finances
more than half of total rural electrification investment.
D. Pricing and Resource Mobilization
1.06    GOI has, through the 1983 amendments to the Act set a financial
objective for the SEBs to produce an annual return of at least 3% on their
historically valued net fixed assets after meeting operating expenses, taxes,
depreciation and interest. Generally the minimum 3% requirement would
represent a rate of return calcuLated according to Bank methodology on
historically valued assets in the range of 10X-13Z. The Bank considers this
objective to be a reasonable minimum but believes that a number of SEBs, due
to investment requirements, need to achieve returns higher than this minimum.
Some higher returns are possible through tariff restructuring, including the
use of block tariff aLlowing a lifeline rate affordable to low income
consumers. Additional returns are achievable through tariff increases.
Present tariffs are in most -cases inadequate not only in economic but also in



-4-
financial terms, and most SEBs are unable to finance a reasonable share of
their investment programs. On average, SEB tariffs are equivalent to only
about 50Z of long run marginal cost (LRMC), in contrast NTPC's tariff
approximates LRMC. Industrial tariffs are almost 902 of LRMC but
agricultural and domestic tariffs, which are considered politically sensitive
and have been consistently subsidized, are only 272 and 36%, respectively.
State-specific programs, which provide both an increased return on investment
and simpler, efficient and affordable tariff structures are needed. These
programs will be addressed through the Bank's lending to individual SEB's.
E. Power Subsector PLanning
1.07    Because the demand for electricity has increased rapidly, GOI at
present allocates about 20% of public investment to power development. To
ensure that the subsector would be developed in the most economic manner, the
Bank encouraged GOI to prepare a comprehensive least-cost National Power Plan
(NPP), which was completed in September 1982. Although this plan represents
substantial progress, further refinement is needed. To assist GOI in this
task, the Bank has planned a study for FY85 that will review the assumptions
and methodology employed in formulating the least-cost plan. There appears
to be a need for further national integration and greater coordination
between power and other sectors, especially coal and gas. Since it will not
be possible to achieve full national integration immediately, the Bank will
continue to ensure that each Bank-financed project forms a part of an
up-to-date regional least-cost development plan. In due course, the sources
of supply considered in the formulation of each regional least-cost plan
should be widened to include the option of importing from neighboring
regions. This approach would eventually lead to integrated planning at a
national level. A further problem has arisen in the coordination of the
long-term NPP with the national five-year plan and shorter-term budgets.
Because of inadequate resources, fewer projects have been included in the
five-year plan than in the NPP and, as a result of underestimation of project
costs and delays in project implementation, still fewer have been executed.
Consequently, the shortage of power has become more and more acute, and over
the next decade, India expects its power deficit to increase severalfold.
This deficit will tend to undermine rational planning because emphasis is
likely to be placed on rapid expansion of supply rather than on least-cost
development. Furthermore, it may prompt overinvestment in captive plant and
excessive use of high-value energy products in the generation of power. In
addition to supporting GOI's efforts to increase the supply, the Bank will
continue to stress to GOI the role of pricing in eliminating the deficit and
the importance of integrating planning and pricing.
F. Management and Operations
1.08    SEBs' organization and management practices have become outmoded as
supply has expanded. The quality of service, reliability, and financial
performance are the principal areas of concern. In general, SEBs have



-5-
high-quality engineering staff, but lack experienced personnel in the areas
of financial planning and control. The relatively poor status and pay of
these personnel compared with those in the private sector makes it difficult
to recruit competent staff. At present, accounts are maintained principally
to track cash receipts and expenditures, and accounting information is seldom
used for managerial purposes. GOI has decided that a new and uniform
accounting system should be installed in all SEBs. After initiaL delays,
preparations are now proceeding and implementation was expected to begin in
April 1985.
1.09    In the area of operations, one of the main concerns has been the poor
performance of thermal plant. Factors that have contributed to this
situation are inadequate maintenance (due to capacity shortages),
deficiencies in plant manufacture, lack of spares, and the poor quality of
coal; in general, these problems have been recognized by the relevant
authorities and corrective steps are being taken. GOI is currently preparing
a rehabilitation program for thermal plant that may be financed by the Bank.
Until this program is compiled, the Bank will, whenever appropriate, include
a thermal rehabilitation component under each of the loans made to the SEBs.
G. Bank Group Participation in the Past
1.10    The Bank has made 18 loans for Indian power projects amounting to
US$1,983 million, and 17 IDA credits totaling US$2,409 million. Seventeen
projects financed under the following loans and credits have been completed:
ten generating projects, the Beas Project (Credit 98-IN), the first four
transmission projects (Loan 416-IN, Credits 242-IN, 377-IN and 604-IN), and
the First and Second Rural Electrification Projects (Credits 572-IN and
911-IN). The Fourth Transmission Project (Credit 604-IN) was completed in
1983, and the Second Rural Electrification Project in 1984. The Singrauli
(Credit 685-IN), Korba (Credit 793-IN), and Ramagundam (Credit 874-IN and
Loan 1648-IN) Thermal Power Projects are in advanced stages of
implementation. The credit for the Second Singrauli Thermal Power Project
(Credit 1027-IN) and the credit/loan for the first stage of the Farakka
Thermal Power Project (Credit 1053-IN and Loan 1887-IN) were approved in May
and June 1980. Korba II (Credit 1172-IN) was approved in July 1981,
Ramagundam II (Loan 2076-IN) in December 1981, and the Third Rural
Electrification Project (Loan 2165-IN) in June 1982. The Upper Indravati
Hydro Project (Credit 1356-IN and Loan 2278-IN) and the Central Power
Transmission Project (Loan 2283-IN) were approved in May 1983, and the
Bodhghat Hydroelectric Power Project in May 1984. The Second Farakka Thermal
Power Project (Loan 2442-IN) was approved in June 1984, and the Trombay IV
Thermal Power Project (Loan 2452-IN) in June of the same year. The Third
Rural Electrification Project is about a year behind schedule. The first
five units of the Singrauli Project and the first two units of the Korba
project were commissioned on schedule. The Farakka and Ramagundam projects
are proceeding satisfactorily, the first unit at Ramagundam having been
commissioned four months ahead of schedule. The Third Trombay Project



-6-
(Unit 5) (Loan 1549-IN) was first synchronized in January 1984, about a year
behind schedule; time was lost mainly because parts for the boiler were not
delivered on time, and because of delays in its construction.
1.11    A performance audit conducted in 1980 for the Second Power
Transmission Project (Credit 242-IN) concluded that the project has succeeded
in helping the nine beneficiary SEBs extend their transmission systems and
meet their growing power requirements. Utilization of generating capacity in
these SEBs has exceeded the appraisal forecast. The upgrading of the SEBs'
financial management practices that began under this project will continue
under subsequent projects. The audit highlighted the difficulties of
adequately supervising this project (because it consisted of many widely
scattered subprojects), and of effecting institutional improvements in the
absence of a close working relationship between the Bank Group and the
beneficiary SEBs. The Bank has therefore sought more direct involvement with
the SEBs through State-specific projects.
H. Bank Group Strategy in the Power Subsector
1.12    Over the last ten years the Bank Group has assisted GOI in
substantially expanding its centrally-owned generation capacity, which is
currently being run relatively efficiently. In the past two years, however,
the emphasis of Bank Group lending has begun to shift from supporting
projects owned and operated by the Central Government to projects owned and
operated by the SEBs. This gradual shift has come about in support of GOI's
desire to accelerate the development of India's hydroelectric power resources
(most of which are owned by the State Governments), and because of the
considerable need to improve the operational and project implementation
efficiency and the financial viability of the State-owned power sector
institutions. In parallel with this shift *n Bank Group lending, sector-wide
objectives for power system operation at both Center and State levels-such
as improving efficiency in the use of existing power generation, transmission
and distribution systems, strengthening Central and State level sector
institutions, improving country-wide power system planning, and increasing
resource mobilization within the sector--will continue to be pursued by the
Bank Group. More specifically, the principal objectives of the Bank Group's
assistance in the subsector are:
(a) the better use of existing facilities--through transmission
projects improving regional interconnections and through
rehabilitation of plant, particularly of thermal power stations
and distribution networks: these measures will improve the
efficiency of energy use and reduce system losses, and thereby
help to minimize system capital and operating costs;
(b) institution building-although the Bank will continue to maintain
an interest in Central institutions, its efforts will be
broadened to encompass individual SEBs, where substantial
efforts are needed to strengthen management, operations, and
finances;



-7-
(c) improved planning-particularly by extending the scope of
planning from the State through the regional to the national
level and through greater integration of planning with other
sectors in the economy, both those that consume electricity and
those that supply other forms of energy; and
(d) improved resource mobilization from electricity consumers - the
principal vehicle for this has been and will continue to be
financial covenants in relation to beneficiaries; however, the
Bank will also continue to stress the importance of relating
tariffs to the economic costs of supply.
1. Electricity Supply and Demand - Western Region
1.13    The Western Region, in which the proposed Project would be located,
comprises the states of Maharashtra, Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh and the Union
Territories of Goa, Daman and Diu and Dadra and Nagar Haveli. The importance
of industry in the Region is reflected in this sector's share (62%) of
electricity consumption, compared to 56% nationally. In contrast, the share
of agricultural consumption is below average at 14%, compared with 19%
nationally. However, the dominance of industrial consumption is being eroded
as agricultural consumption is growing more than twice as fast as industrial.
During 1975-1983, overall consumption grew by 8Z per annum and the
concomitant sectoral growth rates were: industrial 6Z, agriculture 14% and
domestic 12%. Maharashtra accounts for the largest share of the Region's
consumption (54%) followed by Gujarat (28%) and Hadhya Pradesh (18%).
1.14    Close to 2,000 MW of thermal capacity commissioned in FY84 has
brought the Region's totaL installed capacity to almost 12,000 MW (exclusive
of an estimated 660 MW of captive plant). Over 80% of capacity is owned and
operated by the three SEBs, the rest is the responsibility of NTPC, the
Department of Atomic Energy and the Tata Electric Companies. Although
installed capacity has grown by almost 13Z per year during 1975-1984,
available capacity has grown by less than 9% per year, indicating a
substantial deterioration in plant availability. Causes of this include the
poor quality of coal and overloading of plants due to capacity shortages.
Although the Region's SEBs are interconnected, full integration of their
operations has not yet been established. The pooling and dispatching
arrangements are coordinated through the REB and are expected to improve
substantially with the commissioning of a new load dispatch facility based
on real time computer facilities. This is currently under construction
(Annex 5).
1.15    Annex 6 shows the past and projected power supply for the Region and
the expected capacity additions during 1985-1993. Maximum demand and energy
requirements are based on the forecast prepared for the NPP, adjusted to
reflect the Latest demand observed in the Region. Currently, the power



shortage in the Region is critical, resulting in severe supply restrictions
in all three States, especially in Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh (Annex 7).
Regulatory measures involving consumption restrictions and load shedding are
imposed throughout the year and affect all classes of consumers. Due to the
existing shortage of capacity, the constrained peak demand has grown at an
average rate of 7.8% during the last five years. Demand for peak capacity is
expected to grow at an average annual rate of 8.5% until 1993. The capacity
shortage, presently estimated at about 1,280 MW or 16% of potential demand,
will be eliminated around 1992, according to current plans. New additions to
capacity during the 1980s will be predominantly thermal (Annex 8), but
between FY89 and FY93, 2,400 MW of hydroelectric capacity is expected to be
commissioned, including Bank-financed projects in the Narmada valley and
Bodhghat.
J. Electricity Supply and Demand - Maharashtra
-1.16    The total installed capacity in Maharashtra is about 5,900 MW
consisting of 77Z thermal, mostly coal-fired, and 23% hydro. During the last
six years the installed capacity grew at an average annual rate of 10.5%,
while the peak load has increased under restricted supply conditions at the
slightly lower rate of 9.2% (Annex 9). Electricity sales also grew at
9.2% p.a. during FY79-83, reaching 15,346 GWh in FY83 (Annex 10). According
to the demand forecast prepared by CEA, the unconstrained peak load in
Maharashtra will reach 7,644 MW in FY93 at an average annual growth rate of
about 8Z. Energy requirements are also expected to increase at an average
annual rate of about 8% between FY86-93, and the existing deficit in energy
availability will increase to 7500 GWh in FY93 if only committed schemes are
implemented. Of total electricity sales in FY83, 82% was for productive uses
(industry 57%, agriculture 14%, commerce 7% and traction 4%), 14% for
domestic consumption and 4% was supplied in bulk to other states (Annex 11).
While the share of industrial consumption decreased from 60% in FY79 to 57%
in FY83, the agricultural share has increased from just under 11% to just
over 14%. The total number of MSEB's consumers is about 4.2 million, of
which 2.7 million are domestic, 0.8 million agricultural, 0.5 million
commercial and 0.14 million industrial (Annex 12). In FY83, per capita
consumption in Maharashtra was 250 kWh compared to 135 kWh for the whole
country.
II. THE BENEFICIARY - MAHARASETRA STATE ELECTRICITY BOARD (MSEB)
A. Organization and Management
2.01    MSEB was constituted in 1954 under the Electricity Supply Act of
1948, and is responsible for generation, transmission and distribution of
electricity throughout the State. It constructs and operates generating



-.9-
stations and transmission and distribution networks to supply ultimate
consumers and licencees with electric power. However, MSEB is not fully
autonomous in executing these responsibilities since it is controlled,
according to statutory power, by the State Government, especially in matters
of staffing, borrowing, and tariff-setting. MSEB's capital investment
program is determined within the overall State and national planning
framework.
2.02    MSEB is a corporate body consisting of a full-time chairman and three
full-time members for accounts, administration, and generation. Two
technical directors are directly accountable to the chairman; one for
transmission and distribution operations and the other for generation
projects. MSEB's organizational charts reveal well-defined responsibilities
for its operating units in its headquarters, regional divisions and project
sites (Annex 13). Transmission and distribution responsibilities, including
comercial activities, are carried out by six regional chief engineers who
supervise twenty-four districts, each headed by a superintending engineer.
NSEB executes a considerable part of its development program, especially
transmission lines and substations, with its departmental organization and
the development works are carried out by six units organized on functional
lines each headed by a chief engineer.
B. Staffing
2.03    At the end of FY84, MSEB had about 91,800 regular employees and about
18,000 skilled workers employed on a daily basis (Annex 14). About 6,127 of
the regular labor force and all the daily wage workers are engaged in
construction activities. Operation and maintenance staff - totalling about
85,000 employees - yields a ratio of about 49 consumers per employee which,
although high, is acceptable when compared to other SEBs in India. All the
sanctioned positions at the top and aiddle management levels are filled and
vacancies at lower levels are around 3Z of the sanctioned posts.
C. Training
2.04    MSEB has established an active Training Department headed by a chief
engineer, at Nasik (a site of a thermal plant of 870 MW). Eight training
centers have been established, four for generation and four for transmission
and distribution. In addition to the training of engineers and technicians,
training programs are also conducted in finance and administration. During
the last three years, 204 training courses have been provided to 3,920
employees in eight areas of training (Annex 15). Beside these in-house
training arrangements, the Board has been sending its personnel to attend
various courses organized by other Indian institutions on managerial and
engineering aspects related to its activities. During negotiations the Indian
delegation indicated that the training arrangements for its plant operators
in 500 NW plant operation will be provided to the Bank by Pay 31, 1985,



-10-
including number of staff to be trained annually and the location and timing
for training (para 6.03(b)).
D. Transmission and Distribution Losses
2.05    MSEB has been able to reduce transmission and distribution losses
from 17.4Z of the available energy in 1978/9 to 15.14% in FY83 as a result of
introducing a number of system improvement measures during that period (Annex
16). Moreover, a program for system improvement has been prepared with the
objective of achieving gradually a system loss level of 14% by FY93 (Annex
17). This program, which was found satisfactory to the Bank, includes
specific and quantified measures to be taken annually with an appropriate
investment allocated for each fiscal year. Although an earlier achievement
of this target would be preferable, the Bank recognized the limited scope for
a rapid reduction in system losses in Maharashtra and considers that the
objective is also reasonable. During negotiations it was agreed that
Maharashtra shall cause MSEB to implement a plan, satisfactory to the Bank,
for the reduction of the losses incurred by the Board on account of its
transmission and distribution activities to 14% of the energy available to
the Board commencing fiscal year 1992/93 and thereafter (para 6.03(c)).
2.06    Under the Bodhghat Hydro Power Project, GOI agreed to carry out and
compLete by May 1986, a study of metering practices in a number of selected
States. Because of the relatively high number of unmetered connections in
Maharashtra (458,000  connections representing 11% of the total number of
consumers) and the present practice of giving an option of unmetered
connection to all agricultural consumers every three years, during
negotiations, the Indian delegation confirmed that MSEB would be included
among the selected SEBs in which the metering study will be carried out (para
6.01(c)).
E. Insurance
2.07    MSEB follows the standard practice for insuring works under
construction and equipment procured for ongoing projects against total or
partial loss. For permanent installations MSEB holds policies which conform
to the acceptable utility practice in India in terms of the nature and amount
of coverage.



-11-
III. THE PROJECT
A. Background
3.01    One of the main elements of India's energy plan involves the
development of its presently proven reserves of non-tradeable low-quality
coal for the generation of electricity (para 1.01). This has resulted in
the construction of a number of power plants built at or near the coal mines
to reduce the cost of transportation and handling. The reserves in the
Chanda-Wardha Valley are an important source of coal in India and,
consequently, a number of power plants are currently either under
construction or being planned to exploit these reserves in that area. The
Chandrapur power plant, located in the State of Maharashtra, is being
developed with a view to using the coal provided by the reserves of
Chanda-Wardha. The current plan is for the power plant to reach an ultimate
capacity of 2,340 MW, implemented in four phases. The first phase, involving
2x210 MW, was commissioned in 1984; the second phase, also consisting of
2x210 MW, would come on stream by 1986; and the third phase, comprising 2x500
MW, which constitutes the proposed Project, is planned for commissioning in
1991. The date for initiation and completion of the fourth phase has not yet
been established.
3.02    Despite the commendable efforts by the authorities in accelerating
development of the power subsector to meet the future demand for electricity,
shortages in both capacity and energy continue to result in frequent load
shedding, disruption of services and increased reLiance by the industrial
consumers on captive plants based on liquid hydrocarbons. The shortages are
primarily due to the scarcity of financial resources which limits the number
of projects under implementation. Furthermore, the operation of existing
power plants at low levels of capacity utilization, which are caused by the
frequent outages resulting from their overloading to meet demand, also
contributes to the shortages. The situation is further aggravated by the
inefficiency of the old power plants utilizing outdated technology. The
increase of MSEB's operating cost due to these inefficiencies, together with
the control of tariffs exercised by the Government of Maharashtra, has
limited the resource mobilization capabilities of MSEB and its self-financing
capabilities. The sustained efforts of GOI and the State Governments in the
Western Region would reduce the extent of power shortages in the Region,
including Maharashtra. However, deficits in electricity will continue until
the mid-1990's, when the major investments currently under consideration or
implementation, including the proposed Project, come on stream. Until then,
the options for meeting the demand for electricity at least cost to the
economy would include to rationalize the pricing of electricity to stem the
growth of demand, and to improve the efficiency of the facilities for the
generation, transmission and distribution (paras 2.05 and 3.07).



-12-
B. Project Objectives
3.03    The proposed Project would:
(a) assist in the timely implementation of the third phase (2x500 UW)
of the Chandrapur power plant to contribute to GOM's effort in
in meeting the future demand for electricity at least cost to the
economy;
(b) improve the efficiency of the power plants currently in operation by
retrofitting to maximize their contribution to the future supply of
power;
(c) contribute to the transfer of new technology to MSEB's system by
training its personnel in the construction and operation of 500 NW
units which would enhance the efficiency of the electricity board;
and
(d)  assist in the movement of MSEB towards financial viability and
operational standards consistent with internationally-accepted
utility practices.
C. Project Description
3.04    The proposed Project would include the following components:
(a) two 500 MW turbo-generator sets complete with auxiliaries;
(b) two steam generators with electrostatic precipitators and
auxiliaries;
Cc) a circulating water system with cooling towers;
Cd) a coal-handling plant;
(e) a fuel oil plant;
(f) an extension to the existing 200-kV and 400-kV switchyard;
(g) buildings for the turbo generator sets and auxiliary plant;
(h) a water conductor system;.
(i) miscellaneous electrical and mechanical equipment;
(j) other associated civil works;
(k) consulting services; and



-13-
(1) the execution of a thermal plant rehabilitation program,
including the purchase and installation of equipment and
material.
A more detailed description of the project is found in Annex 18.
D. Estimated Cost
3.05    The estimated cost of the Project, excluding interest during
construction, duties and taxes of Rs 1,294 million, is about Rs 10,984
million (US$998 million). These estimates reflect experience with contracts
recently awarded in India for equipment, material and civil works. The
foreign exchange cost of the proposed Project, both direct and indirect, is
estimated at about Rs 5,460 million (US$496 million) and represents about 38Z
of the total cost. Physical contingencies of about 10% on civil works and 5%
on equipment have been allowed which, on the basis of experience in India
with similar projects, are considered adequate. Price contingencies for
local costs for equipment and erection are assumed to be 7Z for FY85, 8% for
FY86 and FY87, and 6% thereafter. Price contingencies for foreign costs are
assumed to be 8.0% for 1985, 9.0% for each year between 1986 and 1988, 7.5%
for 1989, and 6.0% thereafter. Details of the estimated cost of the Project
are presented in Annex 19 and summarized in Table 3.1 below:

E. Project Financing
3.06    The proposed Bank loan of US$300.0 million, would finance 60Z of the
total foreign exchange financing requirement of about US$496 million, and
would cover about 30X of the total project cost net of taxes and duties. The
balance of the funds required, amounting to about US$997 million equivalent,
including about US$196 million in foreign exchange, of which about US$81
million represents interest during construction, would be covered by loans
from GOM (US$672 million), and MSEB's internalLy generated funds (US$325
million). Additional financing from external sources up to US$ 250 million,
could be secured if the successful bidder or other agency provides an
acceptable financing proposal for the package proposed for Bank financing.
In this case, the Bank would seek to reallocate its loan proceeds to other
components of the proposed Project. GOI, GOM and MSEB agreed during
negotiations that all financial resources needed for the Project will be made
available in a timely manner (para 6.02(b).



-15--
F. Project Engineering and Implementation
3.07    MSEB has adequate expertise in the engineering and construction of
thermal power plants of up to 200 MW. However, since the Project would
introduce units of 500 MW for the first time in MSEB's System, the Board
would require assistance in the engineering of the proposed Project. A
consulting service contract has been awarded to a joint venture between
Development Consultants Pvt. Ltd. (India) and United Engineers and
Constructors Inc., (USA). It would provide assitance to MSEB in basic
engineering review, optimization studies, preparation of technical
specifications, bid evaluation, review of civil design, inspection of
equipment, planning of erection and review of plant operation and maintenance
practices. This would require an estimated 500 man-days of foreign
consultants and 1,500 man-days of local consultants. The specifications for
the main package proposed for Bank finance have been prepared and reviewed by
the Bank. Moreover, a detailed program for rehabilitation of thermal power
stations, including cost estimates, was prepared by MSEB. This was reviewed
by the Bank and found satisfactory. A summary of the scope of the work
involved in rehabilitation is presented in Annex 18. The implementation
schedule for the proposed Project is shown in Annex 21. Project completion
is expected by the end of 1992 with the commissioning of the first 500 MW
unit in August 1990 and the second 500 MW in January 1991.
3.08    Coal for the Chandrapur power plant would be supplied from the
deposits in the Chanda-Wardha valley which has recoverable reserves in the
Chandrapur district of about 847 million tonnes, of which 223 milLion tonnes
are recoverable by open cast mining, and the remaining 624 million tonnes are
exploitable by underground mining. At the projected annual production of
coal, the reserves would be sufficient to meet the primary energy needs of
the 2,340 MW power plant for over 100 years. Annual coal production is
forecast to increase gradually from 1.125 million tonnes/year in 1984 to
million 6.355 million tonnes/year in 1990 which is sufficient to fully cover
the needs of the Chandrapur power plant. Coal will be transported from the
mines by a unit train system and aerial ropeway. An implementation program
for the development of the Chanda-Wardha mines has been prepared, which will
allow the Bank to monitor implementation. GOI will ensure that adequate coal
supplies will be provided for the efficient operation of the units. The
principal features of the contract that will govern the sales of coal by
Western Coalfields Limited to MSEB were reviewed and discussed during
negotiations (para 6.01(a)).
3.09    Cooling water for the first two phases of the power plant and the
first unit of 500 MW of the proposed Project will be provided from the Erai
reservoir which has been constructed by the MSEB. However, in order to
supply the second unit of 500 MW of the Project and the fourth phase of the
power plant, an additional supply of water to the Erai reservoir would be
needed. This would be provided by pumping 120 million cubic meters of water
from the Human project currently under construction by the Irrigation



-16-
Department of CON. The Department of Irrigation has given an undertaking to
supply the needed 120 m3 per year to the MSEB. As the Human reservoir is
essential for the reliable supply of the cooling water to the second unit,
CON and GOI confirmed that the reservoir will be constructed in a timely
manner. In addition, GOM agreed to provide to the Bank by June 30, 1985 a
copy of the implementation schedule for the construction of the reservoir so
that progress towards its completion can be monitored (para 6.02(c)).
3.10    MSEB has already acquired 973.0 hectares of land for the main power
station complex which could accommodate all the units envisaged for the site.
In addition, MSEB has also acquired about 336 hectares for the residential
colony for the construction, operation and maintenance staff. An additional
1,800 hectares are in the process of being acquired for ash disposal, the
water conductor system and the unit train system. GOM will ensure that this
additional land will be acquired in a timely manner and that any population
displaced by this process will be resettled in accordance with principles,
objectives, and institutional arrangements satisfactory to the Bank (para
6.03(a)).
G. Procurement
3.11    Procurement arrangements are summarized in Table 3.3.  Procurement of
the equipment to be financed under the proposed loan would be on the basis of
international competitive bidding (ICB) in accordance with the Bank's
Cuidelines. The items relating to the thermal rehabilitation program would
be subject to ICB, however, part of these items would be procured through LCB
procedures acceptable to the Bank if the amounts involved are small or the
number of suppliers is limited. MSEB will furnish in advance for Bank
approval lists of the items to be processed under LCB. The Bank would not
finance items of a proprietary nature that would be acquired through direct
purchase. All contracts worth more than US$200,000 would be subject to prior
review. The main contract to be financed by the Bank involves the steam
generators, the turbo-generator sets, power cycle equipment, instrumentation
and control equipment, a data acquisition system and coordination and
supervision services. For this contract, MSEB would prequalify bidders. The
bidding documents have already been reviewed by the Bank and found
satisfactory. Local manufacturers are expected to bid for the contracts. A
domestic preference of 15Z or the import duty, whichever is less, would be
applied in bid comparison. For consultancy services, MSEB has already
entered into a contract with consulting group formed by Development
Consultant Pvt. Ltd. (India) and United Engineers and Constructors, Inc.
(USA)(para 3.07). The planned schedule for procurement of the main equipment
is:
(a) invitation for prequalification: September 30, 1984;
(b) hid invitation to prequalified bidders: March 15, 1985;



-17-
(c) bid opening: July 1, 1985:
(d) award decision: September 30, 1985;
(e) contract signature: October 30, 1985.

H. Disbursement
3.12    Disbursement from the proposed loan would be made against 100% of the
ex-factory cost of equipment and materials manufactured in India, 100% of the
CIF price of imported goods, and 50% of local expenditures of other items
procured locally. Estimated disbursements, as provided in Annex 20, were
determined on the basis of the project implementation schedule (Annex 21).
The disbursement profile, although faster than the Bank standard for power
projects in India, is considered realistic because of the advanced stage of
project engineering and procurement.
I. Ecology
3.13    The Department of Environment, GOI and the Pollution Board, State of
Maharashtra have approved the construction of the four phases of the
Chandrapur power plant. MSEB continues to comply with all environmental
quality standards prescribed by the Indian authorities in the design,
construction and operation of the power plant. The expected concentration
levels for sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxides and dust are well below the
Bank's acceptable standards. (A report on Environmental Impact is available
in the project file.) Appropriate action would be taken during the detailed
design of the third stage to deal with the principal environmental problems
relating to:
(a)  Location.  The Chandrapur power plant is a mouth of mine type station
far from any urban area. Accordingly, there is need to ensure the
health and environment safety of nearby villages and the operating
staff who would be housed in a residential area some 4-5 km from the
power plant;
(b)  Stack Emission.  As in the case of the first and second stages
precipitators with an efficiency higher than 99Z would be installed
to take care of the high ash content of the coal. Stacks of 250 m
would ensure that particulate matter is dispersed in the atmosphere
to reduce the pollutant fall-out concentrations to
internationally-acceptable levels. The coal is of low sulfur content
(0.3%-1.OZ) and sulfur dioxide levels in the gas will be well within
the limits acceptable to the Bank;
(c)  Water.  Closed cycle cooling would be used.  Hot water from the
condenser and other equipment wouLtd be cooled in induced draft
cooling towers and cold water would be recycled. The cooling towers
blown down is the main source of waste water generated within the
power plant. This water would be used to convey both fly and bottom
ash to the disposal area. The effluents from the demineralizing



-19-
plant will be treated before discharging into the drainage system;
and
(d) Ash Disposal. The ash would be pumped as slurry through a pipeline
to an ash dump area located some 7 km from the power station.
Provision of ash water recovery system would be installed to ensure
relatively ash-free water before disposal in the natural drainage.
(e) Safety. As for the safety and occupational health of employees,
safety regulations for power stations, to which all operating
personnel must conform, would be strictly enforced. The turbine hall
would have a sound pressure level of less than 90 decibels which is
well below the maximum acceptable threshold for the normal
eight-hour/day shift worker.
J. Project Risks
3.14    No risks, other than those normally associated with this type of
project, are foreseen. All the major equipment components are manufactured
in India and there is adequate understanding of, and experience with, their
installation and ultimate operation.
K. Project Monitoring
3.15    MSEB will submit quarterly reports covering physical progress,
consultants' work, costs, disbursements and administrative aspects of the
Project. In addition, there will be annual reports on the financial position
and management situation of the Board. Progress on the system loss reduction
program will be reported quarterly and evaluated against the agreed program.
The monitoring of the rehabilitation program, including the evaluation of
results, will be made through the quarterly report and periodic inspections.
IV. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
A. MSEB's Accounts
Background
4.01    The financial operations of SEBs are regulated by the Electricity
(Supply) Act, 1948. In 1978, several amendments were introduced to enable
SEBs to reorganize their finances along commercial lines; however, these
amendments had serious shortcomings; for example, they would allow SEBs to
avoid losses by charging less than full depreciacion on assets in operation,
and would allow SEBs not to capitalize interest during construction which
understates the value of assets by not reflecting the full cost of



-20-
construction. In 1981, following discussion with the Bank Group, GOI
proposed new amendments to the Act, to address these shortcomings. These
amendments, which were approved by Parliament in 1983, called for the
introduction of a unified accounting system for SEBs, including procedures
for handling debt service and capitalization of interest during construction.
Moreoever, a rate of return on unrevalued assets of 3Z was set as a minimum
measure of financial performance; this return is determined after deducting
the interest expense from operating income. This translates approximately to
a return of 12Z when calculated using the Bank's formula.I/ Implementation of
these amendments has not taken place because of the delay in the development
of the new system of accounts. However,-under the loan for the Indira
Sarovar Hydroelectric project (Credit SF-20-IN/Loan 2416-IN) GOI agreed to
put the new amendments into force not later than April 1, 1985 (para 4.03).
4.02    In order to qualify for the use of proceeds from the Bank loan for
the Third Rural Electrification (Loan 2165-IN), fourteen SEBs, including
MSEB, agreed, with their State Governments, to introduce measures that would
improve their financial performance. These include:
(a)  the introduction of commercial accounting system by April 1, 1984;
(b) the realization of a net cash generation of not less than 20Z
of their average annual investment of three years, starting
FY83; and
Cc) the Limitation of rural electrification subsidies paid by the States
to their SEBs to a proportion of their sales revenues, acceptable to
the Bank Group. However, compliance with all the requirements by
MSEB was delayed until 1984.
4.03    MSEB's system of accounts is not fully consistent with the accepted
commercial accounting practices.  Delay in preparing the _.v accounting
system was the main reason for the inability of the SEBs to meet the agreed
target date for the adoption of this system. As a result, GOI has set a new
target date of April 1, 1985 for the introduction of the new accounting
system and outlined a schedule for monitoring its implementation by the SEBs.
MSEB has indicated that the new unified system of accounts will be
implemented soon after its ratification. A consultant will be recruited to
provide training and guidance to the MSEB staff during implementation.
During negotiations, it was agreed that GOM shall cause MSEB, cofhencing
April 1, 1985, to introduce the uniform accounting system developed by GOI
(para 6.03(d)). Meanwhile, the Indian delegation provided a copy of the terms
of reference, which was found satisfactory to the Bank, for the consultant
I/ Rate of return calculated as a ratio of operating income before deducting
interest payments, and net assets in operation.



-21-
required for the introduction of the new accounting system. Also, it was
agreed that GON shall provide to the Bank details of MSEB's accounting
procedures and formats for the proposed Project by May 31, 1985 (para
6.03(e)).
Audit
4.04    The audit of MSEB's accounts is undertaken by the Comptroller and
Auditor General of India. The audit report for FY83 was completed recently,
reviewed by the Bank and found satisfactory. The audit report paid
particular attention to the inadequacy of MSEB's financial practices in light
of the proposed changes to reorient the SEBs towards internationally-accepted
utility practices. Although the audit reports should be used as a management
tool, MSEB's accounting staff are not currently able to make full use of
them. The technical assistance associated with implementation of the new
accounting system should enhance MSEB's ability to make good use of the
reports. Notwithstanding this, the existing audit arrangements, per se, are
satisfactory and should be continued. During negotiations, COM agreed to
cause MSEB to furnish the Bank, by not Later than nine months after each
fiscal year, with its financial statements for such year as certified by an
independent auditor, and by not later than twelve months after the end of
such year the report of such audit by said auditor (para 6.03(g)).
B. MSEB's Financial Performance
The Rate of Return
4.05    According to the eligibility criteria under the Second Rural
Electrification Project (Credit 911-IN), MSEB was required to achieve a rate
of return of at least 9.5% on its net fixed assets in operation based on
their historical value. KSEB was able to meet this requirement in FY80-82.
Under the Third Rural Electrification Project (Loan 2165-IN), MSEB was
committed to realize, starting FY83, an annual net cash generation equal to
at least 20% of its three year average annual investment based upon the
previous year, the current year and the succeeding year. MSEB has steadily
improved its financial performance from FY81, and achieved that level in
FY84. In fact, its cash generation doubled in the period FY81-FY84, from a
low 10% in FY81 to 20% in FY84. During negotiations, the Indian delegation
argued that, with the introduction of a rate of return requirement in the
August 1983 amendments to the Electricity (Supply) Act, scheduled to become
effective in April 1985, it would be preferablU to link the financial
performance of the SEBs with the provisions of the Act. These provisions
require that an SEB's total revenues produce a surplus of not less than 3% of
the SEB's net fixed assets in service at the beginning of the fiscal year,
after meeting all expenses properly chargeable to revenues, including
operating, maintenance, and management expenses, taxes on income and profits,
depreciation, and interest payable on all debentures, bonds and loans. Based
on the minimum level of rate of return and the methodology of calculation



-22-
specified by the Act and according to agreed definitions of the terms
involved, the provisions of the Act would yield acceptable financial
performance for MSEB (para 4.06). Consequently, it was agreed during
negotiations that MSEB's revenues shalL produce, starting FY86, a surplus of
at least 3X of its net fixed assets in service at the beginning of the fiscal
year after covering all the expenses as specified in the Electricity (Supply)
Act and based on the agreed definitions of the terms involved (para 6.03(h)).
4.06    Table 4.1 presents MSEB's profitability indicators which are expected
as a result of meeting, starting from FY86, the 3Z rate of return requirement
as agreed during negotiations.

MSEB's Tariffs
4.07    Since 1980, MSEB's tariffs have been increased in July 1981 and
December 1982. These increases raised MSEB's average revenue from Ps. 28 kWh
in FY81 to Ps. 48 kWh in FY84, representing an average annual rate of
increase in nominal terms of almost 20%. The average revenue for the period
FY79-FY83 is shown in Annex 22.  Tariff increases in the past have favored
agricultural and household consumers and, as a result, industrial and bulk
tariffs increased between FY79 and FY83 at an average annual rate of 11% in
real terms, while low-voltage tariffs fell in real terms. In FY83, the
average rate for buLk and industrial consumers, representing about 67Z of



-23-
total consumption, was at levels ranging between 55% and 75Z of LRMC, while
that for low-voltage consumers, accounting for 33Z of total consumption, was
at 25Z of LRMC (Annex 23).  The projected regular increases in tariffs
between FY85 and FY90 would offer the opportunity for correction of some of
the distortion in the low-voltage tariff; however, further work is needed to
decide how to restructure these tariffs. This should be addressed in a study
to achieve low voltage LRMC levels by allowing for a lifeLine consumption
block at the prevailing tariff level and applying higher tariffs to
consumption in excess of the lifeline level. This would enable GOM and MSEB
to overcome some of the existing difficulties involved in closing the gap
between LRMC and the average rate applicable for low voltage consumers by
focusing the subsidy on the lifeline supply. During negotiations GOM agreed
that MSEB would start, in January 1986, a study on the restructuring of
low-voltage tariffs, and to provide the Bank with the results of the study
following its completion in June 1986. CON's views and decisions on the
recommendations of the study will be provided to the Bank by September 1986
(para 6.03(i). It was also agreed that GOI shall provide the Bank, by June
1985, its views on the uniform methodology for calculating LRMC in SEBs as
proposed by the Bank Group as a necessary input to defining the scope of the
study (para 6.01(b)).
Billing and Collection
4.08    At the end of FY83, MSEB had about 4.165 million consumers, of which
657,000 (16Z) were industrial and commercial consumers, 2,702,000 (65Z)
domestic, 770,000 (19Z) irrigation pumps and 36,000 general consumers (Annex
12). Meter reading and billing are carried out monthly for bulk and
industrial consumers who account for about 86% of MSEB's total revenues.
Residential and commercial consumers, accounting for 9% of total revenues,
are also billed monthly, with the exception of some rural areas, where meters
are read every two months. Bills for irrigation consumption, which accounts
for only 5Z of NSEB's total revenues, are prepared every three months in the
case of metered connections, and every six months for the unmetered.
Computerized billing applies to about 102 of NSEB's customers and plans are
being considered to expand the computerized processing. In FY83, about 95Z
of MSEB's consumers were billed regularly and, in the last three years,
collections represented an average of 95.5Z of the annual revenues. Based on
MSEB's information, its accounts receivable have been less than the
equivalent of 2.5 months of sales during the last three years, which is
considered an acceptable level in India. During negotiations, GON agreed that
MSEB's accounts receivable, at any time, will not exceed the aggregate amount
of electricity sales during the preceding 2.5 months (para 6.30(f)).

MSEB's Financial Projections
4.09    CEA prepared financial projections covering the period between
1984/85 and 1992/93 based on the available information provided by MSEB.
Assumptions underlying CEA's financial projections are presented in Annex 24
and the Bank's financial projections are presented in Annex 25. These are
derived from CEA's after adjustment to reflect:
(a) the rate of return targets; and
(b) the Bank's estimates of inflation.
The poor quality of the underlying data on which the projections are
necessarily based - particularly those related to current assets and current
liabilities - emphasizes the need for MSEB's new accounting system but these
data cannot practicably be improved until the new system is operational.
Despite this caveat the Bank is confident that any revision of the
projections to reflect improved data would not fundamentally undermine the
conclusions of the financial analysis.
Financing Plan
4.10    MSEB's projected financial requirements for the period FY85 through
FY92, the period of construction of the proposed project, and the sources
of funds are summarized in Table 4.2. Internally generated funds, including
capital contribution (1) and security deposits from customers (3%) are
expected to provide about 31% of MSEB's requirements for funds during the
project period (Table 4.2). MSEB will depend on borrowings from GOM and
others to meet the rest of its requirements during the period. The only firm
foreign contribution is from KFW to finance four generating gas turbines of
108 MW each with a total cost of about Rs 920 million. The financing plan is
subject to uncertainty since no arrangements have been made for most of the
borrowings. However, the plan is realistic since GOI and GOM have always
ensured in the past that funds for approved investment programs are made
avaiLable to MSEB.

arrangements for development assistance to the States. CON, in turn, will
make available these funds to MSED as a part of its contribution to the
latter's investment program. During negotiations, it was agreed that
repayment of the Bank loan by MSEB will be over 20 years, including five



-26-
years' grace, at the current Bank interest rate of 9.29% per annum (para
6.02(a)).
Taxes
4.12    SEBs are liable to income tax.  However, because of the nature and
size of the investment program, they are not charged tax payments. Due to
the intensive capital expenditure of MSEB between FY85 and FY93, no income
tax liability will arise in the foreseeable future and accordingly, a tax
equalization reserve is not necessary. Besides, GOI is now considering a
recommendation of the Committee on Power to exempt SEBs from income tax.
V. JUSTIFICATION
A. Least Cost Alternative
5.01    An up-to-date least-cost system expansion plan has been prepared by
CEA on the basis of the load forecast referred to in Chapter 1, using the
optimization model WASP-III. The assumptions used, including the load
forecast, the methodology and the results have been reviewed and found
satisfactory by the Bank. The results indicate that the earliest feasible
implementation of the Project forms an integral part of the least-cost
development plan.
B. Internal Economic Rate of Return
5.02    Although the project is crucial to the development of the power
system in the Western Region its benefit to consumers cannot be separated
from that of other necessary investments in transmission and distribution.
Therefore, having established that the project forms part of the least-cost
expansion plan it is appropriate to carry out a cost-benefit analysis on the
entire plan in order to ensure that the expansion envisaged is desirable.
For this purpose a 'time-slice' of the Western Region's investment program,
covering the period 1984-1995, has been analyzed. Capital costs of the
investment program (covering generation, transmission and distribution)
together with incremental operating and fuel costs are given in Annex 28.
The benefits of the investment program relate mainly to the incremental



-27-
consumption which it makes possible 1/. An initial measure of
benefit, which ignores consumer surplus, can be derived from the revenue
generated by the incremental sales. In the absence of adequate class
specific consumption conversion factors, the standard conversion factor
(estimated to be 0.8) has been applied to convert financial revenue to a
measure of economic benefit. On this basis the minimum internal economic
rate of return achieved by the program is 7%.
5.03    The nature of this type of estimate is such that it is frequently
more useful as a measure of the adequacy of tariffs than of the economic
merit of the investment program which includes the proposed project. The
estimated minimum economic rate of return, 7Z, is less than the established
opportunity cost of capital, and this is indicative of the fact that tariffs
are presently less than long run marginal costs. However, in reality the
program will confer benefits in excess of those described above. There will
be consumer surplus associated with the incremental consumption and typically
there will be other external benefits. The severe shortages of power
experienced at present, and expected for the foreseeable future, suggests
that consumers' willingness to pay substantially exceeds present tariff
levels.
5.04    In order to derive a more realistic, although still lower bound,
estimate for the internal economic rate of return of the program it is useful
to impute a measure of consumer surplus at least for industrial consumers.
Their willingness to pay must bear some relation to the costs of
autogeneration which many industrial firms are observed to find economic
during periods of load shedding on the public supply system. Annex 28
presents an estimate of diesel autogeneration costs at Rs. 1.12/kWh. It
would, however, be unreasonable to assume that all industrial consumers would
be willing to pay this price for the whole of their consumption from the
public supply system. Therefore, as a conservative measure, it has been
assumed that the consumer surplus attributable to incremental industrial
sales can be derived from an average of the cost of autogeneration and the
prevailing industrial tariff. This measure of the benefit of industrial
consumption, together with revenue estimates of benefits to other consumers,
results in an internal economic rate of return for the program of 11%.
However, it must again be stressed that this still represents a lower bound
1/ The program may also lead to benefits in terms of a reduction in the
cost of meeting existing demand, particularly through fuel savings.
However, the energy deficit is such that by far the greater part of
the output available from plants in the program will lead to increased
sales. Furthermore, none of the existing plants have particularly
high fuel costs (being either coal or gas fired). Therefore, fuel
savings resulting from the program are likely to be small and this
element of the 6enefits has therefore been ignored.



-28-
estimate, as domestic and agricultural consumer surpluses, together with
external benefits, have still not been included.
C. Justification for Bank InvoLvement
5.05    In addition to providing additional capacity at minimum cost, which
will help to alleviate the chronic power shortages presently experienced by
the Western Region, the project will, through Bank involvement:
(a) improve the level of self-financing achieved by MSEB, representing
progress towards financial viability and greater autonomy for
the Board;
(b)  result in improvements in the efficiency of KSEB, for example,
by ensuring the earliest possible implementation of the new
SEB accounting system; and
(c) bring about improved utilization and efficiency of existing
plants through rehabilitation, which is an element of the
wider rehabilitation program that the Bank has encouraged
GOI to undertake.
VI.  SUMMARY OF AGREEMENTS
6.01    During negotiations GOt agreed to:
(a) ensure that adequate coal supplies will be provided for the
efficient operation of the plant (para 3.08);
(b) provide the Bank, by June 1985, its views on the uniform methodology
for calculating LRNC in SEBs, as proposed by the Bank Group
(para 4.07); and
(c) include Maharashtra among the selected States in which the metering
study will be carried out (para 2.06).
6.02    During negotiations COI and CON agreed to:
(a) Onlend the Bank loan to MSEB for a term of 20 years, including five
years grace, and at an interest rate of 9.29Z per annum (para 4.11);
(b) make available, in a timely manner, all financial resources needed
for the Project (para 3.06); and



-29-
(c) construct, in a timely manner, the Human reservoir to supply cooling
water for unit 6, and provide the implementation schedule by
June 30, 1985 for the reservoir so that progress can be
monitored (para 3.09).
6.03    During negotiations GOM agreed to:
(a) undertake to carry out resettlement and rehabilitation of oustees in
accordance with principles, objectives, and institutional arrange-
ments satisfactory to the Bank (para 3.10);
(b) provide to the Bank, by May 1985, the training arrangements for
MSEB's plant operators in 500 MW plant (para 2.04);
(c)  cause MSEB to implement a plan, satisfactory to the Bank, for the
reduction of the losses incurred by [SEB on account of transmission
and distribution activities to 14% of the energy available,
commencing fiscal year 1992/93 and thereafter (para 2.05);
(d)  cause MSEB to inroduce, commencing April 1, 1985, the uniform
accounting system developed by GOI (para 4.03);
(e) provide to the Bank, by May 1, 1985, details of the MSEB's
accounting procedures and formats for the proposed Project (para
4.03);
(f) cause MSEB to ensure that its accounts receivable will not, at any
time, exceed the aggregate amount of electricity sales during the
preceding 2.5 months (para 4.08);
(g) cause MSEB to furnish the Bank, by not later than nine months after
each fiscal year, with its financial statements for such year as
certified by an independent auditor and by not later than twelve
months after the end of such year the report of such audit by said
auditor (para 4.04);
(h) ensure that MSEB's revenues shall produce, starting FY86, a surplus
of at least 3% of its net fixed assets in service at the beginning
of the fiscal year after covering all the expenses as specified in
the Electricity (Supply) Act and based on the agreed definitions of
the terms involved (para 4.05); and
(i) cause MSEB to start, in January 1986, a study on the restructuring
of low-voltage tariffs, and to provide the Bank with the results of
the study following its completion in June 1986. GOM's views and
decision on the recommendations of the study will be provided to the
Bank by September 1986 (para 4.07).
6.04    The proposed Project is suitable for a Bank Loan of US$300.0 million.

CHANDRAPUR THERMAL POWER PROJECT
Project Description
1.      The Chandrapur development, located at a distance of 6 km from
Chandrapur, a district headquarters in the Maharashtra State, is one of a
series of large coal fired power stations planned by MSEB to feed into its
transmission system and supply power to the State.
2.      The final profile of the Chandrapur power plant totalling 2,340 MW
includes four units of 210 MW and three units of 500 MW each. The first
210 MW unit was commissioned in August, 1983, the second in January, 1984.
The planned commissioning dates for the third and fourth units, comprising
the second stage, are February and August, 1985 respectively.
3.      The Project consists of the third stage of the development com-
prising two units of 500 MW each with associated mechanical and electrical
facilities and associated civil works. The fourth stage, consisting of a
third 500 MW unit, would be installed at a later stage, under a separate
project.
4.      The 500 MW turbine will be three cylinder reheat condensing type
having one HP cylinder, one double flow IP cylinder and one double flow LP
cylinder with initial steam parameters of 170 kg/cm2 and 537 C/537 C. The
generators will be water and hydrogen cooled, with a nominal output of
500 MW. The boiler will be natural/assisted circulation, pulverised coal
fixed, balanced draft type using the direct firing system. The boiler
will have a continuous evaporation rating of 1,730 ton/h with a super-
heater outlet pressure of 179.9 kg/cm2 and temperature of 540 C. Each
generating unit will have 3 single phase 200 MVA 21/400 kV transformers
and will feed power into the 400 kV system.
5.      The salient features of the development are shown below:
Power Station
Final Capacity           -  2,340 MW (4x210 MW + 3x500 MW).
Fuel                     -  Coal from the Chanda-Wardha Valley
coalfields. Consumption of the 2x500 NW
power station at 5,500 hrs of operation
per year is about 3.6 million t/year.
The average calorific value of the coal
is 3,700 kcal/kg; moisture 6-10Z;
ash 24-40%; sulphur 0.3-1.0%.

Transport of Coal        -  Unit train continuous system with bottom
discharging wagons.
Cooling System           -  The main source of water for the Chandrapur
Station, up to the capacity of 1340 MW, is
the Erai reservoir which has been constructed
by MSEB. The consumptive water requirement,
on the basis of closed cycle cooling with
cooling towers, is estimated to be 12,600 cubic
meter per hour for the four 210 MW units and
the first 500 MW unit. For the second 500 MW
unit, as well as the future third, the Erai
reservoir will be fed an additional 120 million
cubic meters per year from the Human reservoir
which will be constructed by the Irrigation
Department of COM. The two reservoirs will be
linked through canals and pipelines, and pumping
will be required. From Erai water flows through
pipelines to the power station raw water
reservoir.
Ash Disposal             -  The ash disposal area is available approximately
7 km away from the power station site. Ash
will be pumped as a slurry through pipelines.
Ash water recovery system will be provided so
that relatively ash free water flows to
natural drainage.
Land                     -  All the land needed at Project site has already
been acquired by MSEB. Additional 1600 ha
will be acquired for ash disposal purposes
which MSEB plans to acquire gradually. Also
190 ha for the water conductor system is needed.
Transmission             -  The first 210 MW unit has its power evacuated
through the 220 kV lines Chandrapur-Warona and
Chandrapur-Sicom. For the other three 210 MW
units power will be evacuated by the single-
circuit 400 kV lines Koradi-Chandrapur and
Chandrapur-Parli-Karad-Lonikand-Kalwa. The
400 kV Koradi-Kalwa was commissioned
in March 1984. The Chandrapur-Parli/seccion
of the second line will be commisssioned in
December 1984. The rest of the line will be
completed by June 1986. For the 2x500 MW
units of the Project the transmission arrange-
ment comprises a double-circuit, 400 kV line
Chandrapur-Parli-Lonikand and a single-circuit

400 kV line Lonikand-Bombay. Bids for these
two lines have already been received by the
MSEB. The comissioning ef the lines is
expected before 1989, in advance of the
commissioning of the units (1990-91) (See
attached map for details of the Kaharashtra

Financial Projections
Assumptions
1.      Station Consumption
This is provided for on the following basis:
(i)  Thermal Generation                 9.65Z
(ii)  Hydro Generation                   0.5%
(iii)  Gas Generation                       2%
Based on current experience.
2.      Operation & Maintenance Charges
-These include salaries and wages to employees, repairs and
maintenance and other establishment charges. In addition to providing for
escalations according to inflation rates given by the World Bank, additional
expenses relating to new generating stations and associate transmission and
distribution lines to be brought into operation have also been included in
the projections in the respective years.
3.      Electricity Duties
The Central Electricity Duty is being abolished with effect from 1st
October 1984. It is assumed that the State Electricity Duty will be
correspondingly increased with effect from that date. State Electricity
Duty, accordingly, is provided for at 3.50 paise per KWh with effect from
that date.
4.      Interest
Taking into account the trends already established interest rates
have been as follows.

1988           7.3                 1993             7.8
5.      Interest on Capital Works Under Construction
This is apportioned in the ratio of average net fixed assets
(excluding consumers' contributions) to average capital works in progress
computed with reference to opening and closing figures of each year. Upto
31st March 1985 (when the comercial system is expected to come into force)
capitalization of interest on works in progress is not provided in
projections for purposes of Balance Sheet in accordance with current
practice. With effect from 1st April 1985 this will be accounted for in the
books also. Accordingly, that portion of capitalized interest relating to
the assets has been accounted for under the relevant heads, namely, the fixed
assets in use and the capital works in progress, in the projected Balance
Sheets also.
6.      Net Income
With effect from 1st April 1985 the Board is expected to earn a
minimum rate of return of 3Z after providing for all charges including
interest in accordance with the amended Electricity (Supply) Act.
Accordingly, the projections provide for a clear surplus of 3% from the year
commencing from 1st April 1985.
7.      Security Deposits from Consumers
It is proposed r- collect from the consumers in cash, deposit to the
extent of 2 months' equivalent of previous year's sales by 31st March 1990
providing gradual increases from the year comencing from 1st April 1985.
8.      Average Tariff Rates
A minimum rate of return of 3% after providing for all charges
including interest in accordance with the amended Electricity (Supply) Act
to be effective from FY 19985-86, yields more than 20X net cash generation

computed in accordance with the agreed formula, in all the years FY 1985-86
to 1992-93. The resulting average tariff rates for FY 1991-92 and 1992-93,
however, are on the high side. The State Government may under the
circumstances opt for giving subsidy to the SEB not exceeding IOZ of the
Gross Sales to compensate for RE losses during these years and restrict the
tariff rates to a more practical level.
9.      Loan Repayments to State Government
The terms for most of the loans to the SEB from the Government of
Maharashtra are:
(i) Loans for Rural Electrification (RE) Schemes are
perpetual and therefore not repayable.
(ii) Loans for major generation and transmission schemes
are repayable in 24 installments after 6 years at
the rate of 6.25% compound on an equated annual
installment basis.
10.     Loan Repayment to Others
The Electricity Board Bonds have fixed maturity dates. No such bonds
mature for payment during the years FY 1990-91 to 1992-93. This will explain
the low level of repayments schedule for those years.

Financial Projections
Notes On CEA Assumptions for the Financial Projections
1.      Financial projections were prepared by CEA with assistance from MEB
and are based on audited FY83 and provisional figures of FY84. The six
Five-Year Plan ending in FY85 has been taken as base for MEB investment
program and starting from FY86 preliminary figures for the seventh Five-Year
Plan have been used.
2.      The fuel cost has been considered by MEB on constant heat value.  In
case of new units increased fuel consumption is considered. Price escalation
has been incorporated.
3.      Depreciation has been calculated - on a straight line basis - at a
rate of 3.6% i/ of gross fixed assets in operation at the beginning of each
fiscal year.
4.      Three changes have been considered by the appraisal team in the
financial projections as prepared by CEA:
5.      Assumptions prepared by CEA are attached.
a. consideration of the notional repayment of GOM perpetual
loans (4X annually) in the calculation of the net cash
generation;
b. using price escalations which are now considered by the
Bank; and
c. exclusion of electricity duty from electricity sales and
the average revenue per KWh sold.
1/ Between 3.2% and 3.5% of the average gross fixed assets in operation
at the beginning and at the end of the fiscal year.

CHANDRAPUR THERMAL POWER PROJECT
Internal Economic Rate of Return
As described in Chapter 5, the proposed Project forms an integral
part of the expansion plan for the Western Region and, therefore,
cost-benefit analysis needs to be carried out on the whole program rather
than on the Project in isolation. The Western Region's investment program
during the period 1984-1995 has, therefore, been analyzed. Capital cost,
incremental operation and maintenance, incremental fuel cost and benefit
streams are all shown in Table 1. Assumptions underlying these figures are
detailed below.
Capital Costs
Anticipated capital expenditure on generation, transmission and
distribution at financial prices has been converted to economic prices by
i) expressing the imported content at cif prices; (ii) valuing unskilled
local labor at 0.75 of the market wage rate; and (iii) applying the estimated
standard conversion factor, 0.8, to local costs.
Operation and Maintenance Costs
Incremental annual operating and maintenance costs have been
estimated as the following percentages of capital value: thermal generating
plant 2.5%, hydroelectric 2.0%, and transmission and disribution 1.0%
Fuel Costs
Incremental fuel costs arise only from coal-fired thermal plant
included in the Region's investment program. Average fuel consumption of
new coal-fired plant has been estimated at 0.7 kg of coal/kWh plus 5 ml/kWh
of fuel oil, the latter being required for flame stabilization. The economic
cost of coal at the pit head has been estimated at Rs 152/ton (based on an
Industry Department estimate in 1982 prices, adjusted for succeeding infla-
tion). It has been estimated that 65% of incremental thermal generation will
be in minemouth stations and 35% will be in load center stations. The
average economic cost of coal delivered to load center stations has been
estimated at Rs 330/ton. These estimates result in an average fuel cost for
thermal generation of Rs 0.161/kWh.
Case 1. Benefits
Case 1. benefits are based solely on incremental revenue at existing
tariff levels. Incremental sales attributable to the investment program are
shown in Table 1. These allow for system losses which are assumed to remain
constant at 16.5% of net generation. Averages of existing tariffs, together
with the State shares of Regional consumption are as follows:

Average Tariff      Share of Regional

Madhya Pradesh            53.7                   28
Gujarat                   55.9                   26
Maharashtra               48.0                   46
Weighted average financial tariff - 51.7 paise/kWh.  Applying the
standard conversion factor of 0.8 results in an economic value of revenue
41.3 paise/kWh.
Case 2. Benefits
Case 2 benefits are equal to Case 1 benefits for all, except
industrial consumption. In Case 2, the benefits of incremental industrial
consumption include an element of consumers' surplus imputed at haLf of the
difference between the average industrial tariff, Rs 0.632/kWh, and the
alternative cost of autogeneration. The latter, which has been assumed to
be diesel, has been costed on the following basis:
Purchase price (incl. installation)        Rs 4,300/kW
Life of set                                   15 years
Average utilization                             30%
Discount rate                                   12%
0 & M cost                                 Rs 215/kW per annum
Fuel and lubricant                         Rs 0.80/kWh
Average cost                               Rs 1.12/kWh
The benefit of incremental industrial sales is taken to be the
average of Rs 0.632 and Rs 1.12/kWh, i.e. Rs 0.88/kWh at financial prices,
or Rs 0.704/kWh in economic terms.
Industrial consumption accounts for 62% of total consumption in the
Region. Therefore, with this Case 2 measure of the benefit of industrial
consumption, the average benefit of incremental sales becomes Rs 0.54/kWh.
