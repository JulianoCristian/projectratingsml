       Project's aim main objective is to assist in meeting\n            the electricity demand in the Western Region of India\n            through the addition of 1,000 MW of thermal capacity at the\n            Chandrapur thermal power plant in Maharashtra.  The project\n            comprises the installation of two 500 MW generating units --\n            including boilers, turbogenerator sets, electrical and\n            mechanical auxiliary equipment, associated civil works, and\n            common services and facilities. The project also includes a\n            thermal plant rehabilitation program designed to provide for\n            more efficient use of existing thermal stations."}, "docdt": "1985-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
