Nonetheless,\n            some lessons, address issues relevant to the Borrower, to\n            the Bank, and, of general concern regarding software\n            development, and computerization. As it relates to the\n            Borrower, it is suggested that positioning the project\n            within broader public sector reforms, could have enhanced\n            government commitments for computerization budget, and staff\n            resources; and, that the complexity, and scope of the\n            project, suggest reforms of the Bureau of Internal Revenue,\n            should have included the reform of dependent agencies, to\n            become a fully functional, and credible revenue authority.\n            Lessons for the Bank, address the disbursement process,\n            since several, minor issues hindered fundamental aspects of\n            the project, instead, simplified processes, - e.g., avoiding\n            multi-currency contracting - should ease implementation. The\n            overly simplified implementation plan, for instance, which\n            lacked specific performance indicators, was conducive to a\n            plan, tailored to the supplier's suggestions. Rather,\n            existing methodologies for software development should be\n            enhanced. Software development, and computerization in\n            general, call for: realistic, and functional specifications\n            agreed by both the client, and developer; re-engineering\n            processes, to be conducted prior to computerization; and,\n            public awareness on tax administrative procedures."}, "docdt": "2000-06-29T00:00:00Z"}
