Environmental Protection and Sustainable\n            Development of the Guarani Aquifer System Project is the\n            sustainable management and use of the Guarani Aquifer\n            System. This System is situated in the eastern and south\n            central areas of South America, and underlies parts of\n            Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay. This project is a\n            first step toward achieving the long-term objective. The\n            project aims to support the four countries mentioned in\n            jointly elaborating and implementing a common institutional,\n            legal, and technical framework for managing and preserving\n            the Guarani Aquifer System for current and future\n            generations. To achieve this, seven project components are\n            envisaged: 1) expanding and consolidating the current\n            scientific and technical knowledge base regarding the\n            System; 2) jointly developing and implementing a Guarani\n            Aquifer System Management Framework, based upoon an agreed\n            Strategic Program of Action; 3) enhancing public and\n            stakeholder participation, social communication, and\n            environmental education; 4) evaluating and monitoring the\n            project and disseminating project results; 5) developing\n            regionally-appropriate groundwater management and mitigation\n            measures in \"hot spots\"; 6) considering the\n            potential to utilize the System's \"clean\"\n            geothermal energy; and 7) coordinating and managing the project."}, "docdt": "2002-05-17T00:00:00Z"}
