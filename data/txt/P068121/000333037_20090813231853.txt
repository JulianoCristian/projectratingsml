1.          Project Context, Global Environment Objectives and Design
            (this section is descriptive, taken from other documents, e.g., PAD/ISR, not evaluative)

1.1         Context at Appraisal (brief summary of country and sector background, rationale for Bank
            assistance)

1.1.1       The Guarani Aquifer System (GAS) is an important groundwater resource that is shared by
            Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay. For these four countries, groundwater, especially
            deep aquifers, constitute a strategic reserve for water supply in the face of increasing scarcity
            and pollution of surface water sources. However, what was known about the extent of the
            GAS; levels of extraction, recharge and discharge; vulnerability to pollution and
            contamination; and the transboundary impact was very limited and thus available knowledge
            was preliminary. There was a general belief that the Guarani aquifer was faced with threats
            stemming from uncontrolled abstraction, and pollution in the extraction and recharge areas.
            In addition, the prevalent thought was that the resource had the potential to be a source of
            contention among the countries since it was believed that the use of the aquifer by one
            country would be at the expense of the other riparian countries.

1.1.2       Based on the limited knowledge available, the Project Appraisal Document (PAD; p.5)
            argued that at the rate of use prevalent during project preparation and "considering the
            growing use of groundwater for human consumption, it is easy to foresee an increasing threat
            of pollution and depletion in the not too distant future. Uncontrolled use, without rules or
            regulation, can alter the status of the [GAS] from that of a strategic reserve of drinking water
            to that of a degraded waterbody that is the source of conflict among the countries."
            Therefore, this GEF supported Environmental Protection and Sustainable Management of the
            Guarani Aquifer System Project (the Guarani Project) was designed as a first step towards a
            long-term objective of sustainable, integrated management and use of the GAS. The Project
            was the first regional groundwater-related undertaking of the four countries and was
            preventive, not only from the standpoint of forestalling overexploitation, pollution and
            contamination, but also before disagreement among the countries became a reality and turned
            to the worst.

1.1.3       The Country Assistance Strategies (CASs) and the fragmented approaches in the four
            countries recognized the need for sustainable management of their water resources. Direct
            linkage to the Guarani aquifer was made in the CAS for Brazil, which identified the aquifer
            and its management as important for the country in terms of providing or potentially
            providing water for domestic and industrial purposes to more than 500 municipalities in eight
            states. The Argentina CAS mentions serious water quality problems due to aquifer "mining"
            and vertical contamination. Although the CASs for Paraguay and Uruguay attached
            importance to water resource management, linkage to the Guarani aquifer was not made. The
            PAD described specific water sector issues included in the CASs for the four countries1--
            issues that have bearings on the management of the water resources as they relate to each
            country.

1.1.4       The general sector issue related to groundwater (GW) management and specific to the GAS
            was a general lack of information and weak administrative mechanisms in all four countries.



1 The four CAS discussed by the PAD include: (i) Argentina: CAS. 2000. Report # 20345-AR; (ii) Brazil: CAS. 2000. Report # 20160-BR; (iii) Paraguay: CAS. 1997.
Report # 16346-PA; and Uruguay: CAS 2000. Report # 20355-UR.


                                                                                   1
1.1.5       The Bank's experience in implementing a large number of water projects and long-standing
            policy dialogue regarding different aspects of water management in each of the four countries
            was identified in the PAD as the rationale for Bank's involvement. Also, the Bank was a
            leading agency in implementing GEF International Water (IW) projects that resulted in
            developing a considerable in-house expertise and internationally-based knowledge of the
            main issues relating to such initiatives.2

1.2         Original Global Environment Objectives (GEO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

1.2.1       The Project Development Objective (PDO) is the sustainable use and management of the
            GAS in Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay for current and future generations,
            supported by the joint development and implementation of an adequate, functioning aquifer
            management framework, based on sustainable technical, scientific, institutional, legal,
            financial, political, and environmental grounds.

1.2.2       In conformity with the GEF M&E guideline for IW, the PAD (p.3-4)) included key indicators
            under the three categories: Process, Stress Reduction and Environmental Status. The
            indicators and actual achievement are discussed under Section 3.2 (Achievement of GEO)
            below. In addition, four indicators --(a) Pollution risks diminished or controlled: (b)
            Overdraft risks diminished or stabilized: (c) Risk of future inter-country groundwater
            conflicts diminished; and (d) Future mitigation and stabilization costs reduced-- were
            identified to measure the Global objective and are also discussed in Section 3.2.

1.3         Revised GEO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
            reasons/justification

1.3.1       The PDO was not revised.

1.4         Main Beneficiaries (original and revised, briefly describe the "primary target group"
            identified in the PAD and as captured in the GEO, as well as any other individuals and
            organizations expected to benefit from the project)

1.4.1       The targeted Project beneficiaries were the 92 million people living in the Guarani region. In
            addition, the beneficiaries include public and private institutions (mainly water agencies,
            authorities and water user organizations), Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs), civil
            society organizations, universities, professionals in the field and policy makers at all levels.
            These individuals and entities will benefit from increased knowledge, better sharing of
            information and reduced conflict in relation to a strategic resource that potentially will
            provide: (i) a sustainable supply of safe water for human populations; (ii) high-quality water
            for industry; and (iii) a sustainable supply of thermal water for tourism, industrial and
            municipal uses.

1.5         Original Components (as approved)

1.5.1       As designed the Project had seven components:

1.5.2      Component 1. Expansion and Consolidation of the Current Scientific and Technical
           Knowledge Base on the Guarani Aquifer System (US$9.91 million or 37% of total Project


      2 During the Guarani Project preparation, the Bank was involved in the implementation and/or preparation of some 23 GEF IW Projects, in addition to 15 other,
      related GEF projects dealing with coastal and marine issues, and nine aquatic biodiversity projects with IW aspects. See the PAD for the Project. p. 19.


                                                                                        2
       cost): The aim of this component was to synthesize, analyze, and expand the knowledge base
       on the GAS and had two major sub-components: (i) Aquifer studies for consolidation and
       expansion of the scientific knowledge base; and (ii) Technical socio-economic assessments of
       current and future use scenarios of the GAS.

1.5.2. Component 2: Joint Development and Implementation of the Guarani Aquifer System
       Management Framework ­ (US$7.01 million or 26.2% of total Project cost). The aim of this
       component was to develop a framework for the coordinated management (technical,
       institutional, financial and legal) of the GAS and had five sub-components: (i) Design and
       implementation of an aquifer monitoring network; (ii) Development and integration of an
       Information System (SISAG - Sistema de Informacion del Sistema Acuífero Guarani); (iii)
       Formulation of a Strategic Action Program (SAP); (iv) Institutional strengthening; and (vi)
       formulation of Transboundary Diagnostic Analysis (TDA).

1.5.3. Component 3: Public and Stakeholder Participation, Education and Communication
       (US$1.31 million or 4.9% of total Project cost). The aim of this Component was to promote
       and support the participation and involvement of the public, and to foster environmental and
       water resources education, social communication, and the dissemination of knowledge. The
       component had four sub-components: (i) Design of a Regional Communications and Public
       Participation Plan; (ii) Establishment of GAS Citizens' Fund; (iii) Creation and dissemination
       of instruments to increase awareness, interest, and commitment among stakeholders; and (iv)
       Formulation of an Indigenous Peoples Strategy.

1.5.4. Component 4: Project Monitoring and Evaluation, and Dissemination of Project Results
       (US$0.48 million or 1.8% of total Project cost). The aim of this Component was to create and
       implement a system for recording and analyzing progress achieved during the Project
       implementation period. Two subcomponents were identified under this component: (i)
       Development and implementation of a monitoring, evaluation and feedback system; and (ii)
       Dissemination of Project results throughout the region and beyond.

1.5.5. Component 5: Development of Management and Mitigation Measures within Identified
       "Hot Spots" (US$3.73 million or 13.9% of total Project cost). The aim of this Component
       was to design, apply, and evaluate the costs and feasibility of good management practices at
       specific sites within the GAS region. Four areas for pilot subprojects were identified to test the
       proposed local management practices.

1.5. 6. Component 6: Assessment of Geothermal Energy Potential (US$0.28 million or 1.0% of
        total Project cost). The aim of this Component was to evaluate the geothermal potential of the
        GAS and was designed to be implemented in two phases. During Phase I, existing
        geohydrological data were planned to be compiled and evaluated. In Phase II it was planned to
        create a task force comprised of representatives from the four countries, supported by world
        experts in the study and use of the enthalpic energy and to conduct a scientific evaluation of
        the geothermal potential of the GAS based upon the data acquired during Phase one.

1.5.7. Component 7: Project Coordination and Management (US$ 4.04 million or 15.1% of total
       Project cost). The aim of this Component was to provide organizational and administrative
       support to the Project. The Project Secretariat (PS) was expected to carry out the traditional role
       of project implementation units and the National Coordinators (NC -- composed of
       representative from each country) was expected to act as a focal point for the dissemination of
       Project results, and coordination and communication with other GEF-IW projects within the
       Latin American region.

1.6       Revised Components

1.6.1 The components of the Project were not revised. However, during implementation, due to their
      close relationship, some studies were jointly contracted to achieve economies of scale.

1.7       Other significant changes (in design, scope and scale, implementation arrangements and
          schedule, and funding allocations)

1.7.1 In terms of Project design there were no major changes. The Project had a total of five
      amendments. The first amendment was part of Bank-wide action taken to change GEF Grants
      denominated in SDR to an equivalent in US$. The second amendment changed the Special
      Account to an Operational Account. The third Amendment changed the financing percentage
      following the Bank-wide revision of percentages of financing applicable to the four
      participating countries. The fourth Amendment extended the closing date from March 31, 2007
      to January 31, 2009; made a reallocation to the Grant proceeds among categories and revised
      disbursement estimates. The fifth Amendment increased the authorized allocation to the
      Operational Account from US$600,000 to US$1.3 million.

2.        Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1       Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry
          (including whether lessons of earlier operations were taken into account, risks and their
          mitigations identified, and adequacy of participatory processes, as applicable)

2.1.1 Notwithstanding the lack of Bank operational experience in multi-country GW, good use was
      made of proven practices in aquifer management as well as GEF IW focal area experiences3 in
      designing the Project. Based on lessons from GEF IW projects, the design correctly identified
      that "a significant lag time may occur between the preparation of the ...SAP and its
      implementation. For this reason, the Project was designed as the first phase of a larger Program.
      Therefore, the elaboration of projects to implement the SAP will take place during the last year
      of the proposed Project.." (PAD, p.18). That was exactly what came to pass.

2.1.2 The design also identified an important set of risks and corresponding mitigation measures.
      One of the substantial risks that became relevant during implementation was "Project-supported
      research and analysis of the aquifer are not carried out in a timely manner, leading to delays in
      providing critical inputs to the SAP." Through the extension of the closing date this risk was
      addressed.

2.1.3 The Project was exemplary in its design of participation mechanisms that allowed for the
      involvement of learning institutions, NGOs, civil society organizations, public institutions at all
      levels and the public at large in all phases of the Project including consultation, implementation
      of Project activities and representation in local management. The evaluation report done as part
      of Project closing by the Organization of American States (OAS) indicated that in one of the
      workshops conducted during preparation more than 100 people participated representing a wide
      array of institutions of the four countries.

2.1.4 Although the Project design rightly identified the need for a proactive communication strategy,
      it did not identify it in the risk matrix. Early in Project implementation, the Project faced strong


3 Specifically, the PAD (p. 17) mentions the World Bank stakeholder consultation held during June 2000, and the GEF International Waters Conference held during
October 2000 from which lessons were drawn.


                                                                                     4
          resistance from some groups who were providing somewhat distorted information to the public
          at large about the Project objective and its activities. However, given the wide consultation
          during Project preparation conducted in the four countries, it was difficult to foresee the
          possibility of negative resistance to the Project.

2.1.5 Because of the lack of an existing institutional framework, Project design needed to put in place
      a complete framework including Steering Committee (SC), National Project Execution Units
      (NPEU) and the Project Secretariat (PS). This institutional framework and the mechanisms
      adopted proved to be highly successful and played a critical role in Project implementation.
      Details on the institutional framework and mechanisms are presented in Section 2.2 below.

2.1.6 The design, as represented in the PAD, was overly optimistic in terms of the time needed to
      implement a four-country project that covers a total area of 1.08 million Km.2 4 As a result
      disbursement estimates were also overly optimistic. An evaluation done by Independent
      Evaluation Group (IEG) in 2006, as part of Bank-wide review of regional projects, observed
      that "for the size of the Project area and the extensive list of studies planned under the Project,
      the number of Project staff planned in the PAD was unrealistic as it was found later during
      Project implementation." 5 In addition, from an operational perspective, the number of
      indicators was large, but deemed to be necessary in order to adequately monitor the different
      activities.

2.1.7 Overall, the design of the Project was sound and well articulated.

2.2       Implementation (including any project changes/restructuring, mid-term review, Project at
          Risk status, and actions taken, as applicable)

2.2.1 Project implementation was coordinated by the SC 6 at regional level, the NPEUs in each
      country, and local coordinating bodies (Pilot Local Management Commissions). The OAS was
      the executing agent and the PS, which played the role of project coordinating unit, was created
      under the administrative responsibility of the OAS. One representative from each NPEU
      formed the NCs group that worked closely with the PS in providing clearance to contract
      documents and reviewing advances in project execution. The NCs also served as a support
      body for the SC who informed their respective representatives on the advances and issues in
      project execution.

2.2.2 Initially, some time was needed to harmonize procedural differences between the OAS and the
      Bank especially in contract signing and procurement rules, among others.

2.2.3 Finding of the Mid-Term Review (MTR): The MTR:7 (i) confirmed the relevance of the Project
      objective and that it should remain unchanged; (ii) proposed to extend the Project closing date
      and thus revise disbursement estimates; (iii) accepted the need to strengthen the PS by
      increasing staffing and expanding office facilities; and (iv) recommended to deepen the
      activities of the Project in the four pilot areas through contracting four local champions
      (facilitators).

2.3       Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

2.3.1 The PAD recognized the importance of M&E given the decentralized nature of Project activities.
      It also foresaw the establishment of an Operational Monitoring and Evaluation System
      (OM&E). An M&E team and system were put in place within the PS.

2.3.2 During implementation, the Logical Framework was updated following the Results Framework
      that introduced a temporal element into the M&E process. The updated Results Framework
      served Project supervision well at each stage of Project implementation ­ such as progress in
      the wells inventory, number of people accessing the web site, number of people reached
      through the awareness building activities, among others. Some progress needed to be measured
      in terms of percent of advance in implementation, as was done in the preparation of several
      maps supported under the Project. Periodic reports from the four pilot sites and from other
      Project activities, including the Citizen Fund and the University Fund, were fed into an M&E
      system managed by the PS. Also, the NPEU reports were consolidated and provided in Project
      progress reports prepared by the PS for SC Project oversight. The Oracle based system of the
      OAS facilitated the monitoring of financial utilization and commitments and performed
      satisfactorily for Project supervision and planning.

2.3.3 During several stages of implementation, the Project conducted evaluations that were important
      in adjusting and establishing sequences and timing of Project activities. These evaluations were
      carried out in conjunction with the MTR and with preparation of the TDA and the SAP. In
      addition, the OAS contracted an external consultant to do the final evaluation of the Project.
      Throughout Project implementation, the Project benefited from peer reviews, feedback and
      quality control from the countries that was put in place by the OAS/PS. A total of 40 quality
      control interventions were conducted. In addition to the usual Bank supervision, GWMATE8
      provided important Technical Assistance (TA) by evaluating different products of consultants
      hired by the Project. GWMATE also provided close oversight and support to the pilot
      subprojects. All these interventions supported in the monitoring of Project implementation
      progress, ensuring the quality of the outputs, and assessing that the Project remained relevant
      and on track. The different stakeholder consultations also contributed to monitoring public
      attitudes about the GAS and the Project.

2.3.4 As a final product, the Project deployed the GAS Information System (SISAG), with each
      country having access to the system and an interface to directly update data (See Annex 2,
      Component 2). Through SISAG the GAS now has a state-of-the-art information system that
      will be instrumental in future monitoring and management of the aquifer.

2.4       Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance (focusing on issues and their resolution, as applicable)

2.4.1 The PAD identified three safeguards issues that apply to the Project ­ environmental
      assessment (OP 4.01), indigenous people (OP 4.10) and international waters (OP 7.50).

2.4.2 The Project9 clearly contributed to significant improvements in environmental management by:
      (i) greatly improving the knowledge base; (ii) developing and adopting manuals for well
      drilling and protection, (iii) developing groundwater models that will aide decision-making for
      sustainable management and use of the aquifer; (iv) defining criteria in the pilot areas for land


8 The Groundwater Management Team (GWMATE) is a group of international experts that provides Bank teams and client countries with technical assistance in
groundwater management, and is supported by the Netherlands and British governments.

9 For environmental assessment purpose, the project was classified as Category B.


                                                                                    6
        use and solid waste management to protect the aquifer from contamination; (v) providing
        information and guidance for locating and protecting wells in the pilot areas where they will
        reduce overexploitation and reduce the risk of contamination; and (vi) establishing the extent of
        sustainable geothermal water use that included: (a) identifying alternative use of geothermal
        water, (b) formulating and adopting guidelines to control the potential for overexploitation; (c)
        sensitizing the local users and authorities on the need for recycling water after geothermal use;
        (d) playing a catalytic role in the establishment of common standards between neighboring
        transboundary localities; and (f) defining the minimum distance required between wells.
        (Annex 2 provides detail on manuals and potential uses).

2.4.3 At the initial stage of Project implementation, as designed, the PS informed indigenous
      people's organizations in the three countries (except Uruguay where no indigenous peoples
      were identified during Project preparation) about the Project and progress in its implementation.
      Later, the Project developed an Indigenous People's Strategy that was disseminated widely.
      Beyond what was seen in the PAD, the Project specifically earmarked resources from the
      Citizen Fund to ensure the participation of indigenous organizations in awareness building ­
      two subprojects funded by the Citizens Fund focused on indigenous people issues. As a result
      of the development of this strategy, the SAP was able to identify and incorporate actions that
      the three countries should follow to benefit and ensure the participation of indigenous people in
      the future use and management of the Guarani aquifer.

2.4.4 For projects on international waterways, the requirement of (OP7.50) of the Bank is for the
      riparian states to be formally notified in regard to the proposed Project. However, since the
      four riparian countries were represented on the SC and jointly defined Project activities as part
      of approval of annual plans, separate notification was deemed unnecessary.

2.4.5 Fiduciary Compliance: The Project complied with fiduciary requirements, as the quarterly
      Financial Management Reports (FMR) and audit reports were in full compliance with Bank
      procedures. The annual Project audit was carried out within the overall annual audit of the OAS.
      This approach to auditing was pioneered by the Guarani Project and was later adopted by
      another GEF financed and Bank implemented project10 . No major problems surfaced with
      regard to fiduciary compliance. Each year procurement post-reviews were conducted by the
      Bank and no major problems were found in these reviews. However, it should be noted that
      sometimes the submissions of quarterly FMR were delayed beyond the agreed dates set out in
      the Grant Agreement.

2.5     Post-completion Operation/Next Phase (including transition arrangement to post-completion
        operation of investments financed by present operation, Operation & Maintenance
        arrangements, sustaining reforms and institutional capacity, and next phase/follow-up
        operation, if applicable)

2.5.1 The Project was designed as the first stage of a long-term programmatic intervention in the
      management of the GAS. At the end of Project implementation, the four countries decided that
      the institutional mechanisms (SC, NPEU, PS and local entities) established during Project
      preparation and enhanced during implementation will continue to operate in the future. The
      management of the GAS will be the responsibility of the line agencies in each country
      especially at local level.

2.5.2 As part of the SAP, the countries, inter alia, agreed to: (i) maintain the SC that will conduct at
      least three regular meetings annually ­ as compared to two annual meetings during Project
      implementation; (ii) reorganize the PS office that will be located in Montevideo (Uruguay) to
      facilitate coordination among the countries; (iii) assume specific responsibility for monitoring
      and coordinating follow-up activities; and (iv) finance follow-up activities from their own
      budgetary resources. In addition, the countries are seeking to set up future institutional
      arrangements that will integrate GW and surface water management in the Rio La Plata Basin
      and the Guarani aquifer region.

2.5.3 All of these arrangements bode very well for the sustainability and further development of
      Project outcomes.

3.      Assessment of Outcomes

3.1     Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation (to current country and global
        priorities, and Bank assistance strategy)

3.1.1 The long-term objective of the Guarani Project, to sustainably use and manage the GAS is still
      very relevant for the four countries. IEG (2006) made the following observation on the
      relevance of the Project:

           The Guarani Aquifer Project is very relevant to the issues of integrated water resource
           management in the region... The Guarani Aquifer Project itself appears to have strong official
           support from the four participating countries, as well as from a number (but not all) civil
           society organizations. In mid-January 2006, the National Water Resources Council of Brazil
           approved a "National Integrated Water Resources Management Plan," which includes a
           chapter on groundwater for the first time. [I.E.G. 2006: p. 6]

3.1.2 The recently modified or adopted different water regulations, decrees and laws of each country
      recognized the importance that the countries have now attached to GW management and its
      sustainable use.

3.1.3 Design relevance: The Project genesis is found in the different universities of the region who
      postulated that the Guarani aquifer was a huge regional GW system shared among the four
      countries. However, detailed and comprehensive knowledge covering the whole system was
      not readily available. Therefore, the Project was designed to focus on improving the
      knowledge base that was to be followed by preparation of a SAP that would define future
      institutional coordination mechanism among the four countries. Thus, the main design of the
      Project was and still is highly relevant.

3.1.4 The Project is in line with the GEF IW focal area that addresses, among other things, to help
      "countries to collaborate with their neighbors to modify human activities that place stress on
      transboundary water systems..." 11        In conformity with GEF IW focal area, this Project
      supported the countries in learning to work together on their key transboundary concerns and
      set priorities for joint action as reflected in the SAP and other auxiliary declarations. As a
      result of the Project, the risk of over-extraction and contamination of GW resources and any
      transboundary impacts have been significantly reduced.




      11 See http://www.thegef.org/interior_right.aspx?id=236.


                                                                 8
3.1.5 The Project was a pioneer, not only because it was designed as a preventive intervention to
      specifically support the future management of GW but also because it was the first multi-
      country GW management undertaking for the GEF together with the Bank. The relevance of
      the Project can be found in its priority in the four countries and from the current CASs. The
      CAS for Argentina12 specifically stated that regional GEF activities are focusing, among others,
      on shared water (both surface and the Guarani aquifer). The Brazil: Country Partnership
      Strategy (CPS 13 FY2008-2011) states that the Bank Group will assist Brazil in fostering
      coordinated efforts to address large transboundary issues in partnership with, among others, the
      Guarani aquifer riparian countries. Although the CASs and CPS for Paraguay14 and Uruguay 15
      did not specifically mention the Guarani aquifer, both CASs and the CPS aimed to improve
      water resource management and enhance coverage of water supply and sanitation services.

3.16 Some of the factors that collectively make the Guarani aquifer a strategic resource for the four
     countries in the future include: (i) climate change and its impact on the water resource balance;
     (ii) intensification of agriculture and the resulting increase in demand for water; (iii) expanding
     urbanization that intensifies the demand for reliable water supply, (iv) recurrent droughts; (v)
     increased pollution of surface water; (vi) the aim to improve access to potable water in the
     rural areas; and (vii) the reliance now and in the future of many settled areas on the Guarani
     aquifer for their water supply for municipal and industrial uses. Thus, assessed from the
     perspective of the four countries water development agenda, CASs, and the future strategic
     importance of the GAS, the objective of the Project is still highly relevant.

3.2     Achievement of Global Environmental Objectives (including brief discussion of causal
        linkages between outputs and outcomes, with details on outputs in Annex 2)

3.2.1 In evaluating the overall objective of the Project, the basic underlying assumptions of the
      Project design have to be considered. First, according to the PAD (p.56), the Project was
      conceived and designed as: "a first step toward achieving the long-term objective of a
      sustainable management and use of the [GAS]." Second, the Project was conceptualized as a
      protective and preventive intervention to reduce future risks of pollution, overdraft, intra-
      country conflicts, and high cost of future mitigation and stabilization measures. Third, the
      Project was conceived to usher in a cooperative framework that would lay the groundwork for
      the long-term objective of the sustainable and integrated management and use of the GAS.
      Reviews of the Global PDO indicators show that the aim of the Project was to reduce risks but
      not necessarily to reverse degradation since in general the aquifer was assumed to have limited
      contamination and little utilization relative to its potential. In light of this main conclusion
      addressing the potential risks before the onset of resource degradation was the right approach
      made during Project preparation.

3.2.2 Although the PDO might appear to be a long-term higher level objective, it provided a unique
      opportunity to put in place an adequate, functioning aquifer management framework, based on
      sustainable technical, scientific, institutional, legal, financial, political, and environmental

      grounds in order to ensure sustainable use and management of the GAS for current and future
      generations. The PDO was therefore determined to be highly relevant and achievable.

3.2.3 Establishment of an adequate, functioning aquifer management framework: One of the
      Project main outcomes is the establishment of the institutional mechanism to coordinate the
      activities of the four countries in the management of GAS that did not exist before the Project.
      The Project also extended this new culture of cooperation among specialists, universities and
      institutions in the four countries. Given results of the technical and scientific studies (see para.
      3.23 below), the adopted coordination mechanisms are very light. The responsibilities of light
      coordination mechanisms of the future PS include: (i) reviewing policy and developing
      proposals; (ii) providing for comprehensive monitoring; (iii) coordinating institutional capacity
      improvements and provision of TA; (iv) developing and improving manuals, procedures and
      guidelines; and (v) continuously updating the knowledge base.

3.2.4 Development of the technical and scientific basis: Studies conducted through the Project
      concluded that lateral movement of GW in the GAS is very slow and impacts from over
      pumping and pollution are highly localized. This conclusion determines the type of
      coordination (including political, legal, institutional and financial) that is needed because the
      actions of one country will have no impact on the resource in other countries except in very
      localized areas. Sharing of information and management approaches is beneficial and
      coordinated management is specifically needed in a few small localities where transboundary
      effects are perceived. Even though the need for coordinated management is limited to a few
      local areas, the Project significantly enhanced the capacities of the four countries to manage the
      GAS and their ability to have a rational dialogue. In fact, one of the important outcomes of the
      Project was this understanding: that management of the aquifer is essentially a local set of
      activities. During Project preparation the general opinion of governments, institutions and civil
      society was that joint coordinated management was needed for the entire aquifer. The four
      countries now have a good understanding and feel much more confident to develop and manage
      the aquifer individually without worrying about wide-ranging regional/transboundary impacts.
      This is a huge benefit. It would have been very difficult to get to this point and to have this
      shared understanding without having a regional project. There was insufficient information and
      knowledge basis (aquifer extent, geology, hydrogeology, hydrogeochemistry, flow dynamics,
      age of water, etc.) prior to the Project to be able to reach this understanding and conclusion.

3.2.5 Another important outcome of the project is the extensive knowledge and the related technical
      approaches and methodologies created that were precursor for the management of GAS and its
      sustainable use.    Continued cooperation will allow for continuously improving this
      understanding, approaches, methodologies, and sharing of data and information in the future.

3.2.6 The Project achievement could be assessed from the perspective of GEO key performance
      indicators and GEF IW indicators. As a preventive project, the key performance indicators
      basically targeted the reduction of future risks. The four global objective indicators and their
      status is given below: (details are given under Component 2).

  (a) Pollution risks diminished or controlled: Almost 90% of the resource is covered by thick
      basalt (confined aquifer) and therefore to a large extent the aquifer has little exposure to
      pollution. However, in specific localities where the sandstone formation outcrops, the potential
      risk for pollution is higher (such as the pilot regions Rivera/Santana and Ribeirao Preto). For
      these areas the Project put in place a management framework and specific actions. The
      approaches adopted for these areas and the fact that the resource is not treated as an open
      resource throughout most of its extent have resulted in diminishing the pollution risks.


                                                     10
  (b) Overdraft risks diminished or stabilized: The GAS does not show signs of overdraft except in
      very localized areas. It is estimated that the total annual volumes of recharge and discharge are
      basically in balance. The annual water extraction stands at about 1.04 billion m3/y, which is
      about 0.003% of the estimated 30 trillion m3 stored in the aquifer. Nevertheless, there are some
      specific areas that exhibit some existing and a risk of potential future overdraft. One of these
      areas is Ribeirao Preto in Brazil (one of the pilot areas) where detailed studies were conducted
      and relevant measures to reduce the risk were introduced. This risk, where it occurs has been
      addressed by putting in place, well spacing standards, and zoning for protection and extraction.
      In general, overdraft risks are now minimal due to the management framework established.

  (c) Risk of future inter-country groundwater conflicts diminished: Such risk was framed based
      on an early conceptualization that the use of GW from the GAS in one country could be at the
      expense of the other riparian countries. This concept was derived from the characteristic
      feature of surface water that exhibits upstream-downstream dynamics in a river basin.
      However, the knowledge generated through several studies dispelled this misconception in that
      the lateral flow of water is extremely slow, and is driven by natural hydraulic gradients that are
      only modified in local areas where human interventions (extractions and artificial recharge) are
      significant. For local transboundary areas with the potential risk of conflict, the Project
      developed specific actions and cooperative management frameworks that have successfully
      addressed this risk since the countries (and municipalities) are working closely together.

  (d) Future mitigation and stabilization costs reduced: The basic fact that this Project was
      preventive in nature ensures that it will be more cost effective than the alternatives.
      Remediation of water quality deterioration in GW bodies, if at all possible, is a very expensive
      undertaking. Recuperation of GW levels in overexploited areas requires drastic measures that
      are very difficult to implement. The application of improved methodologies and management
      approaches developed under the Project, including monitoring, will ensure that there are timely
      interventions if and when the resource shows signs of stress.

3.2.7 Streams, lakes, wetlands and the biodiversity covering land areas to a large extent depend on
      the sustainable discharge of GW for a healthy and flourishing ecosystem. Thus, by ushering in
      the sustainable management that meets the demand for human use, and also meets
      environmental needs, the Project will make a significant long-term contribution to the GEF
      Environmental Objective.

3.2.8 Among the relevant process indicators16 included in the PAD, the Project achievement includes:

    (a) Establishment of an institutional framework: The countries, through the SC (at multi-country
        level), the NPEUs (one per country), and the Regional Coordination Unit, has established the
        institutional framework.

    (b) Existence of SAP: The SAP was finalized and approved by the SC. The SAP has now
        become a living document to lead the joint and individual actions of the countries

3.2.9 In Stress Reduction,




    16 The GEF International Waters categorizes relevant indicators into 3 major categories: Process, Stress Reduction, and
    Environmental Status indicators.


                                                                    11
      (a) Communications campaign: An intensive communication campaign was undertaken that
          reached more than 2.5 million people. The GAS is now well known not only within the four
          countries but in international circles as well.

      (b) Water quality threats identified and quantified: Potential water quality threats were identified
          through the preparation of a vulnerability map and analyses that identified lack of adequate
          wastewater and solid waste management, intensification of agriculture and unsupervised well
          drilling (well head contamination). However, an important finding of the Project is that in its
          present state, the Guarani aquifer water quality is essentially without contamination from
          human activities. Except for the finding that showed somewhat elevated concentrations of
          nitrates or other chemicals in some wells (still within acceptable limits) and areas with high
          natural salinity or arsenic, the general conclusion was that the Guarani aquifer has very good
          water quality through most of its extent and almost no contamination.

      (c) Existence of norms for well design, construction and maintenance: Well design, construction
          and maintenance guidelines were developed and adopted for different uses of GW (domestic
          and industrial water supply, geothermal) and taking into account the specific zones of the
          aquifer (outcropping, transition and confined).

      (d) GW overuse identified together with management measures implemented and monitored in
          specific "hot spots": In the Ribeirao Preto pilot area, there is presently some overexploitation
          and a risk of a worsening overexploitation problem was identified. Management measures
          were identified and adopted.

      (e) In the Concordia-Salto area, studies indicated that there is a potential for overexploiting
          geothermal water resources and measures were designed for limiting GW competitive
          extraction through well spacing and other relevant measures for new geothermal development.

3.2.10 In terms of Environmental Status indicators, the following tasks were accomplished:

      (a) The western limit of the aquifer was not clearly understood prior to the Project. Based on
          geological criteria, it is now has been better defined. As a result the aquifer area in Argentina
          was revised from an earlier estimate of 225,500 km2 to 228.255.26 km2.

      (b) Conceptual and mathematical models that capture the hydrodynamic behavior and allow for
          the evaluation of different development, management and climate change scenarios were
          developed and are excellent tools for future management of the aquifer.

      (c) The quantity of water extracted annually from Guarani is estimated at 1.04 billion m3/year.

3.3     Efficiency (Net Present Value/Economic Rate of Return, cost effectiveness, e.g., unit rate
        norms, least cost, and comparisons; and Financial Rate of Return)

3.3.1 Estimates of investment efficiency using NPV or ERR were not made for the Project.
      However, for the pilot areas a study 17 conducted by the Project indicated that Guarani
      groundwater is an economically efficient mechanism to provide dependable public water
      supply. The analysis showed that: (i) for Ribeirao Preto the IRR was 29.8%, with a long-term
      average marginal cost of US$0.68/m3, which compares favorably with US$0.88/m3 for


      17 See report of the project: "Evaluación del Potencial de Usos Termales y No Termales del Agua del SAG". Consorcio Guaraní.
      Montevideo. Enero, 2008.


                                                                    12
        Montevideo, Uruguay; (ii) for Itapua, the IRR was 12.99% with an average marginal cost of
        US$0.84/m3; and (iii) Rivera/Santana, 30.1% with a marginal cost of US$0.86/m3.18

3.3.2 One important factor that could also serve as a proxy for the efficiency of the Project is related
      to the basic tenet on which the overall design of the Project was based, i.e., prevention is the
      most cost effective intervention in GW. In general, it is nearly impossible and very costly to
      restore a contaminated groundwater resource. It is also very difficult and costly to recover
      water levels to historical norms in overexploited areas.

3.3.3 The majority of the people who lack access to a reliable and safe water supply system reside in
      the rural areas of the four countries. 19 In areas where GW is available, it is generally the most
      efficient and cost effective method of improving coverage of access to water supply since
      scattered settlement patterns (the characteristic feature of rural areas) would require huge
      investment cost for building water delivery networks and infrastructures. Improving
      qualitatively the understanding on the dynamics of the GAS and the improved management
      mechanisms ushered in by the Project will contribute to the efficient and reliable provision of
      water supply to areas within the aquifer region.

3.4     Justification of Overall Outcome Rating (combining relevance, achievement of GEOs, and
        efficiency)
        Rating: Satisfactory.

3.4.1 The relevance of the Project is very clearly established given the action taken by the countries to
      include GW in their overall water resource agenda and collaboration mechanisms they
      established. The relevance is particularly important in the pilot areas. By identifying actions
      that the countries should implement, the Project introduced a new pattern of utilization,
      management and cooperation. In addition, the Project created the institutional framework and
      mechanisms for future management of the resource at all levels that the countries have agreed
      to continue to finance.

3.4.2 Assessed both from PDO and IW indicators, as discussed above in detail, the Project has
      successfully achieved its goal. The Project supported the four countries in the joint
      development and implementation of an adequate, functioning aquifer management framework.
      The fact that: (i) the four countries will continue to cooperate and coordinate their activities
      through the SC (for policy, decision making and budgetary aspects) and the PS ­ for technical
      matters; (ii) there are a set of detailed studies covering relevant thematic areas, a shared vision,
      and a continuously updated information system; (iii) an organizational set-up has been agreed
      for continuing with the activities initiated in the pilot localities; (iv) participation of the
      stakeholders at local, state/provincial, and national levels in GAS management is now
      functional and governments are committed to the participatory mechanism; and (v) the
      countries have committed their own budgetary resources; all demonstrate that the countries
      know and have agreed on what is necessary for the management of the GAS. This framework
      will also improve the management of other GW systems in the countries and will contribute
      towards improving integrated water resources management.


      18 The marginal cost is relatively high, which could be explained by the huge surge of energy cost during this study period. However,
      several studies have shown that energy utilization for pumping GW to be less than alternative means of water service delivery
      (recycling, desalinization & surface water purification).

      19 For example, in Brazil "lack of access to improved water supply is mainly a rural issue, with two-thirds of the 34 million people
      without services living in rural areas." See CPS, 2008, Annex p.20.


                                                                       13
3.5   Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts (if any, where not previously covered or
      to amplify discussion above)

      (a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

3.5.1 The Project was not a poverty-focused intervention and did not specifically target a gender
      theme. However, as part of Citizens' Fund some subprojects did address gender as it relates to
      GW issues, which was limited to awareness building among female-headed households. The
      Project has contributed to social development through its direct involvement of NGOs,
      universities and civil society organizations and through its development of the Indigenous
      Peoples Strategy. This Strategy identified that raising the awareness of these communities on
      the importance of clean water was found to be highly relevant. The Project supported putting
      in place a knowledge base, monitoring system and protection measures that will ensure the
      availability of good quality uncontaminated water for human consumption in the future, which
      is potentially a big benefit for the poor.

3.5.2 Further, the impact of the Guarani Project is beyond the Guarani aquifer proper. The
      methodologies developed in studying aquifers, the instructive experiences in establishing
      management frameworks, and the manuals and guidelines produced through the Project, among
      others, are results that other aquifers in the four countries will benefit from. The fact that GW
      has now become an integral part of the water agenda in the four countries attests to the fact that
      the impact of Guarani Project was beyond GAS proper. By identifying arsenic and saline areas,
      the Project has contributed to the health of the population of the region living in these specific
      areas. In addition, the Project has created huge interest in the GAS and there are now a number
      of PhD and MSc students studying the aquifer, as well as a number of environmental NGOs
      working on issues related to Guarani. The interest the Project managed to galvanize was an
      additional relevant outcome of the Project.

      (b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
      (particularly with reference to impacts on longer-term capacity and institutional development)

3.5.3 This Project had a substantial institutional impact and institutional development and
      strengthening is an important part of Project outcomes. In fact, one of the major impacts of the
      Project has been to establish an institutional framework from the local to the regional level that
      did not exist before the Project. The improved knowledge base on the Guarani aquifer and the
      enhanced technical capacity of specialists and decision makers provides a good foundation for
      improved management of the aquifer in the future. The Project involved a wide array of
      organizations through its participatory mechanisms and raised their understanding and
      awareness in GW management. Undeniably, the Project has ushered in a behavioral change in
      users and policymakers on the need for protection and management of the Guarani aquifer,
      which, before the Project, was treated as an open resource available for use with only minimal
      consideration or understanding of the resource dynamics and vulnerability.

3.5.4 Groundwater management has entered into the activities and agendas of agencies whose
      responsibilities include monitoring, regulating, administering, using or managing of water
      resources. At the regional level, the continuation of the SC, and at the country level, the
      creation of new entities or the strengthening of existing water agencies demonstrate the
      achievements in institutional development. The project also supported the creation of technical
      committees in: SISAG; Monitoring and modeling; Capacity building and diffusion; and Local
      management promotion group composed of specialists in the field from the four countries.



                                                    14
3.5.5 The Project also contributed to improving the capacity of universities. Through a BNWPP20
      grant, the Project set up a University Fund that supported nine subprojects out of a total of 29
      proposals presented for funding. A total of 21 universities and four public research institutions
      from the four countries were associated to conduct the nine studies. The combined results of
      the activities financed by this Grant included: (i) the training of high level professionals (14 in
      PhD and MSc and 16 in BSc), (ii) the support for the development of five courses in
      groundwater; (iii) high level scientific and technical analysis on the Guarani aquifer through
      nine studies; (iv) mainstreaming of groundwater issues into the academic agenda of the
      universities in the GAS region; and (v) introduction of a state-of-the-art system of monitoring
      the Guarani groundwater, such as the use of satellite remote sensing data.

3.5.6 The Project utilized several mechanisms to improve the capacity of the professionals involved
      in groundwater in the four countries, including more than 20 technical workshops. Through a
      twinning and internship program, 40 professionals were trained by working with the consultant
      firms contracted to study the Guarani aquifer and by studying specific themes related to the
      GAS. In collaboration with the US Geological Survey, professionals responsible for
      groundwater management from each country participated in a study tour to learn from US and
      Mexico experience in transboundary groundwater management.

3.5.7 The Project supported the production of several guidelines and manuals that will be the basis for
      providing permits for well drilling and development, for monitoring and for regulating the use
      of GAS water. Today, local municipalities, state/provincial governments, and national water
      agencies all share the same state-of-the-art database with a reliable data set that was made
      possible through the Project.

3.5.8 As a part of the awareness building, the need to better understand the Guarani aquifer has
      entered into the education programs of primary and secondary schools in the region although
      not into the curriculum. School children are now being sensitized about the resource and the
      need for protection of the aquifer. Educational materials were part of the outputs of the
      activities financed under the Citizens' Fund. German Geological Survey (Bundesanstaltfuer
      Geowissenschaften und Rohstoffe-- BGR), in Paraguay, also developed excellent educational
      materials on the GAS that will continue to enhance awareness building activities started by the
      Project.

3.5.9 The institutional strengthening has also benefited NGOs, civil society organizations and
      indigenous communities by improving their knowledge about the Guarani aquifer and through
      the provision of information and guidelines developed through the Project. These
      organizations now have a much better understanding of the significance of the GAS and as a
      result can better contribute to improved management of the aquifer. For example one NGO
      (Raykatu) in the Rivera/Santana pilot area has taken inventory of unlicensed private shallow
      wells, independent of the Project, with the aim to support the effort in protecting the aquifer
      from pollution-related contamination. Another organization has developed an innovative
      simple physical model to demonstrate how the GAS operates.

3.5.10 At each country level, significant advances have been made in institutional development
       relative to groundwater management, in general and Guarani aquifer management, in
       particular.

(a) In Argentina, local actors, provincial and national responsible agencies in GW management have
    developed a permanent working relationship coordinated by the new Directorate for GW in the
    Sub-Secretariat for Water Resources (Subsecretaría de Recursos Hídricos) that was created as
    an outcome of the Guarani Project. As a specific outcome of Project preparation, the National
    Government created the Inter-ministerial Committee for GW, to help improve integrated water
    resources management. In addition, provincial governments have placed GW management
    prominently on their water management agenda.

(b) In Brazil, management of the GAS was included within the Implementation of Integrated
    Management of Surface and GW Program for 2008-2011 with a budgetary allocation of $18
    million. State governments have included GW in their water agendas and have invested in
    studies, monitoring and in general improving the institutional basis necessary for sustainable
    management.

(c) In Paraguay, the Project was prepared when the country lacked a well-defined framework for
    GW management. With active participation and support by the BGR, the understanding about
    the need for the management of the Guarani aquifer was quickly enhanced. The awareness and
    the interest created provided stimulus for the passage of the Water Law by the Paraguay
    Parliament in 2007. As a further outcome of the Project, the Government created a Guarani
    Aquifer Unit within the Ministry of Environment.

(d) In Uruguay, although there was a semblance of initial management framework during Project
    preparation, the Project strengthened the existing low level awareness of the public on the socio-
    economic and strategic importance of the Guarani aquifer. A law which is under consideration
    by parliament includes the creation of Guarani Aquifer Management Unit to ensure participation
    and the sustainable use of the aquifer.

(c)    Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative, if any)

3.5.11 At the outset, the Project faced a significant amount of negative resistance from some NGO
       groups, mainly in Argentina and Brazil, that characterized the Project objective as a North
       American (government and/or international corporation) intervention to control the GAS and
       privatize its use. However, through the Project's awareness and communication campaigns
       and the active leadership of the SC, in the end, it was clearly understood that the aquifer and
       the Project were owned by the four countries, which ensured that the Project was carried out in
       order to benefit the region.

3.5.12 As an upshot of the initial negative campaign, major media interest was generated in the region.
       The aquifer and the Project continuously garnered attention from the local, national, regional
       and international media. This media attention provided a means for the four countries and the
       PS to correct misconceptions and generate significant support for Guarani aquifer protection
       and for the Project.

3.5.13 Throughout the GAS region there has been a significant increase in land prices, which is
       partially ascribed to an increased understanding that there is a vast potable water resource
       available in the area.

4.    Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
      Rating: Satisfactory

4.1   The Project objective enjoys a wide spectrum of support at regional, national and local
      government (state, provincial and municipal) levels. Such support emanates from the
      realization that the Guarani aquifer is an important strategic resource as a source of water for
      different uses. The support of the governments is clearly demonstrated, inter alia, through the
      institutionalization of GW management undertaken by all the countries and the allocation of
      budgetary resources for the Project and for follow-up activities.

4.2   The conclusion that the risk to the development outcome is low is justified by the institutional
      framework established at different levels; the improved professional capacity; the interest
      created in studying further the aquifer through universities; the different agreements reached
      among the countries; the manuals and methodologies developed by the Project; the technical
      knowledge base created; and the legal framework established by each country. .

4.3   As mentioned above the management of the Guarani aquifer is best carried out at the local
      level. A critical-mass of awareness, especially within NGOs and other civil society
      organizations has been created in each country that provides the foundation for further
      advances. In some countries, e.g. Brazil, there are strong groundwater associations that will
      ensure that GW issues and their management remain visible on the overall water agenda. The
      fact that the Project survived a negative campaign and won support at all levels bodes well for
      the future sustainability of Project outcomes.

4.4   However, there are three factors that could potentially pose a risk to the development outcome.

(a)   The fact that in general there are no potential upstream-downstream impacts and that GAS
      management is essentially a local issue may reduce the incentive for cooperation among the
      countries. However, this risk is considered to be low given that the level of interest and
      enthusiasm of the countries and the fact that they have maintained and agreed to strengthen
      their cooperation in coordinating their activities in the management of the GAS.
(b)   The negative campaign about international intervention could reemerge. The fact that the
      institutional framework put in place and the agreed SAP is now managed by the countries
      without the involvement of international organizations makes this risk negligible.
(c)   The fact that there is very little present danger of significant overexploitation or
      contamination may lessen the priority given to the aquifer's management. The mainstreaming
      of GW management into existing institutional mandates, the major awareness building that the
      Project successfully implemented, the existence of interest groups, the commitment of the
      countries to collaborate in monitoring and coordinating their activities and in general the
      behavioral change this Project has ushered in significantly lessen the risk that management and
      conservation of the GAS will disappear from the agenda of the water sector of these countries.
      Through the Project a general understanding was reached about the importance putting in
      place and carrying out preventative measures.

5.1.1 Although the Guarani Project was the first international groundwater project, supported by the
      Bank through GEF, the Bank team was able to guide Project preparation towards a well-
      thought out and balanced design. The Bank team was proactive in: (i) making use of
      available knowledge; (ii) enabling the creation of forums for participation of the stakeholders;
      (iii) identifying and focusing on different relevant management themes; (iv) strongly
      supporting the setting up of an institutional framework and mechanisms for good Project
      implementation; and (v) identifying representative pilot regions with a broad array of problems
      (the four pilots represented and emphasized overexploitation -- Ribeirao Preto; possible
      contamination and pollution -- Rivera-Santana; geothermal potential -- Concordia-Salto; and
      potential agricultural non-point source contamination -- Itapua). As noted by the IEG 21
      evaluation, stakeholders praised the substantial technical background of the first Bank Task
      Team Leader (TTL) who took an active role in Project preparation and oversaw the first two
      years of implementation.

5.1.2 Recognizing that coordinating such a complex and wide-ranging multi-country groundwater
      project would require significant diplomatic and coordination skills and recognizing that the
      Bank structure and potential for oversight and supervision could be insufficient, the Project
      preparation team and the four countries were right to select the OAS as executing agency -- an
      institution that has accumulated experience in the Region in managing international water
      projects.

(b) Quality of Supervision (including of fiduciary and safeguards policies)
      Rating: Satisfactory.

5.1.3 Overall, the Bank was able to deploy high level staff in the management of the Project
      throughout the project cycle. All TTLs (there were three) maintained effective working
      relationships with the GEF, the OAS, and with other partners. In addition, the Bank brought
      high level advisory and TA through GWMATE. As expressed by IEG: "Stakeholders give
      Bank staff high marks for its technical expertise during Project preparation and
      implementation."22 While the review of procurement documents by the four countries was
      going on, the Bank team reviewed the documents in parallel thereby reducing the approval
      period after the countries provided their clearance. The Bank team also proactively supported
      the OAS in harmonizing the two institutions' procedures in procurement, financial
      management reporting and other operational issues.

5..1.4 The Bank facilitated information exchange among the donors and partners (Bank/GEF, BGR,
       International Atomic Energy Agency ­ IAEA, and OAS) that was instrumental in optimizing
       the use of resources in data collection and in generation of high quality Project outputs. The
       Bank team also emphasized the necessity for very close coordination among the different
       consultants contracted to conduct technical studies, and supported the prioritization and
       sequencing of activities thereby helping to ensure that the output of one activity could serve as
       an input to another. The Bank team was also able to provide very important advice as
       information started to be generated. The counterpart Project team could have easily gone off
       track given the volume of information that they were receiving. The Bank team was
       instrumental in distilling what was relevant and ensuring that the Project kept its priorities
       right.

5.1.5 The Bank proactively worked to find solutions when the Project was faced with a negative
      campaign. High-level Bank communications staff worked with the countries to develop a
      communication plan, which was later successfully implemented and served to increase
      awareness and reduce concerns. In addition, the Bank, through its LCR Communication
      Advisor, provided information on the Project's objective and activities to environmental
      journalists that contributed to an observed shift in public perceptions towards a more positive
      response to the Project. The Bank team coordinated and directly contributed to dissemination
      of information about the Project, which included presenting the Project at international
      seminars as well as to Executive Directors and ambassadors of the four countries.

5.1.6 The Bank's support for increasing the capacity of the PS and in improving the procedures that
      governed the way the PS carried out its functions was very instrumental in improving the pace
      of Project implementation. Bank supervision was also innovative in suggesting that the
      Project should have a presence at the local (pilot area) level which resulted in the contracting
      of four facilitators for each one of the pilot areas. IEG made the point that the establishment
      of: "a project institutional presence at the pilot site level has been a widely recognized
      innovation."23 The supervision team also supported the development of Local Action Plans to
      guide activities at the pilot level and shape the work of local institutional set-ups.

(c)       Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
          Rating: Satisfactory.

5.1.7 Overall the Bank's performance was satisfactory. The Bank team: (i) guided the excellent
      preparation of a highly complex (both technically and institutionally) project; (ii) provided
      strong support and made timely decisions as Project implementation was faced with a variety
      of problems; (iii) provided high-level technical assistance; (iv) collaborated with partners; (v)
      worked closely with the SC; and (vi) supported and arranged the participation of high level
      professionals in international workshops and working visits to ensure that they benefited from
      top quality TA.

5.2       Borrower
(a)       Government Performance
          Rating: Highly Satisfactory.

5.2.1 The four country governments were represented through the SC. In the face of the negative
      campaign against the Project, the SC remained focused and did not waver from its support for
      the Project. This was a big achievement given the political nature of the negative campaign
      and the possible mistrust that could have emerged. During the Project implementation period,
      Argentina and Uruguay were engaged in a highly charged disagreement on the environmental
      impact of a paper mill being built on the Uruguay side of the border of the two countries. The
      fact that the SC functioned as a solid group (while two of the countries that are parties to the
      SC were engaged in hot debate) testifies to the commitment that the four country governments
      afforded to this Project.

5.2.2 The SC was very active and strongly took ownership of the Project on behalf of the four
      countries. The SC had the responsibility of approving annual plans, facilitating counterpart
      contributions by each country and overseeing the technical direction as reported to it by the


      23 IEG. 2006. ibid. p. 25.



                                                    19
       National Coordinators (NCs). The SC successfully executed its responsibilities and promoted
       the participation of all donors (BGR, IAEA and the Bank) in its regular semi-annual meetings.
       In addition to semi-annual meetings, the SC conducted extraordinary meetings as was
       necessary to discuss pending issues or approve Project documents. The SC members were
       actively engaged throughout Project implementation demonstrated by their detailed review and
       comments on Project documents and their review and approval of Project annual plans.

5.2.3 As the Project closing approached, the SC established a Working Group to study and
      recommend transition mechanisms, the financing of future activities, cooperation
      arrangements, and the division of responsibilities. The continuation of the activities initiated
      through the Project was directly due to the close involvement of the SC in Project
      implementation and the interest that was shown in sustainable management and use of the
      Guarani aquifer. The significant improvement in the institutional and technical capacity of the
      four countries, the mainstreaming of groundwater into the national water agendas, and the
      allocation of budgetary resources, both during Project implementation and after Project
      closing, are testaments to proactive and successful role that the SC played. During Project
      execution, counterpart financing reached 127% of the appraisal estimate that clearly
      demonstrated the wide support and ownership the countries attached to this project.

(b)    Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
       Rating: Satisfactory.

5.2.4 Implementing agency (or the executing agency) for this Project was the OAS. The OAS
      (including the PS staff that was contracted for implementing the Project) was able to
      coordinate the work of different consultants; respond to queries and requests from each
      beneficiary country; work with the different donors (GEF/Bank, BGR and IAEA); and support
      the work of the SC. The OAS also partnered with the Bank in harmonizing the two
      institutions' procedures in financial management, contract awards and applicable operational
      guidelines and rules. Given the involvement of governments at different levels, the OAS
      played a critical role in supporting good cooperation and in ensuring the participation of
      different stakeholders. The diplomatic skills of the OAS was in play in handling some
      perceived sensitive issues, such as the role of Local Pilot Subproject facilitators. The OAS
      also strived to maintain balanced staff composition within the PS by contracting from each
      country and also by benefiting the countries equitably from the internship and twining
      programs. It also bodes well to the OAS accomplishment that the PS was constituted by high
      level technical staff from the four countries.

5.2.5 The OAS also partnered with the Bank to proactively seek solution to problems during Project
      implementation and more importantly for showing unyielding effort in pushing for the need to
      clearly define and agree on future cooperation arrangements. The OAS experience in
      international water was also clearly demonstrated during the preparation of TDA and SAP.
      The OAS Argentina Office Chief, who was responsible for Project implementation
      coordination, was instrumental in ensuring that SAP preparation reflected the relevant
      knowledge generated from the vast information collected and that it focused on practical
      actionable items. The OAS served as a good partner to the Bank throughout Project execution.

(c)    Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
       Rating: Satisfactory.

5.2.6 Overall the combined performance of the Grant Beneficiary governments and the OAS (the
      Project executing agency) was Satisfactory.

6.         Lessons Learned (both project-specific and of wide general application)

6.1        A regional project by its very nature is time consuming in all phases of the project cycle, and
           the water sector brings additional complexity because of the numerous often fragmented
           responsibilities for government entities at different levels. It is often difficult and time
           consuming to reach consensus and move forward. Thus, future design of regional water and
           GW projects should consider a more extended period for preparation and implementation than
           is normal for a single country project.

6.2        In the absence of any other existing regional framework, regional projects have to set up their
           own project implementation framework and determining staff composition is very important.
           In the case of the Guarani Project, groundwater coordination mechanisms did not exist in the
           MERCOSUR24 region before the advent of this Project, and the institutional framework for the
           Project had to be developed from scratch including the setting-up of the SC, NPEUs, technical
           committees, pilot local management commissions and the PS. In the formation of the PS, it
           was necessary to find a balance among the countries in terms of representation of staff that
           ensured the interests of each country was well represented and helped in avoiding mistrust
           among the beneficiary countries.

6.3        In GW where management is mainly done at the local level, the presence of a local
           coordinator/facilitator/champion is very important. Cognizant of the fact that the Guarani
           Project covers a wide area, the SC, the OAS and the Bank were able to deploy facilitators at
           the local level that was later found to have been invaluable in terms of coordinating Project
           activities and organizing stakeholders participation, in the pilot areas.

6.4        It is important to consider and technically include shallow overlying aquifers in cases where a
           GW Project is working on a confined aquifer. At the outset overlying basalt formation
           aquifers on top of Guarani sandstones were not included in the Project technical and
           management scope. Although the shallow aquifers have much less storage capacity than the
           GAS, they are the first in line in groundwater use and need to be analyzed and monitored in
           order to detect the first sign of stress and contamination before the problem becomes
           widespread and reaches public wells that are normally deeper. During Project implementation
           and the technical studies and management frameworks included the integration of shallow
           aquifers, but it would have been better to have included them from the start.

6.5        In partnering with an established institution as an executing agency for a GEF project,
           harmonization of procedures between the Bank and the executing agency is important and
           should be dealt with early in project preparation and possibly addressed in the Grant
           Agreement. In case of the Guarani Project, the OAS (the Executing Agency) was an
           established institution with its own procurement, financial management and other operational
           procedures. During Project implementation, it was necessary to go through the different
           aspects of norms and procedures to align the two institutions' requirements.

6.6        A regional project should be represented by high level government officials from the relevant
           ministries of each country to ensure that relevant agreements are made and implemented. In
           addition, such a representation by high level officials will greatly support the sustainability of
           project outcomes after its conclusion, since high officials can commit their country to

       implement follow-up actions and allocate budgetary resources. The Guarani Project benefited
       from the participation of high level representatives from three ministries or agencies that
       provided the forum for dealing with technical, operational and diplomatic issues jointly.

6.7    A regional project has to continuously engage national line-agency counterparts and
       demonstrate the relevance of the project objectives and outcomes to their work programs and
       institutional mandates in order to garner active engagement and support during project
       implementation. The Guarani Project was able to demonstrate its importance starting from the
       beginning that served it well during Project implementation. Once the riparian countries of the
       Guarani aquifer realized the importance of the Project's outputs to their work, they shared
       scientific and technical information and actively participated in developing management
       approaches.

6.8    In addition to being a social good, in regard to the provision of good quality domestic water
       supplies and to meeting environmental objectives, water is also an `economic good'.
       Although there were efforts to undertake such an evaluation during Project implementation, a
       good analytical and comprehensive study was not carried out. The availability of such a study
       in the future would improve policy development and could garner the interest of decision-
       makers at the highest level.

6.9    The place of regional projects in the Bank and in LCR: The Bank's experience in regional
       projects is somewhat limited and lessons learned may not be captured fully given the Bank's
       focus on country-based interventions. Such projects may be better managed under a regional
       projects department or VPU office.

6.10   A regional groundwater project is only as good as the capacity that it creates at the national
       and particularly at the local levels because, after all is said and done, uses, contamination,
       pollution and management of groundwater occurs in space and time at the local level.
       However, this does not mean that a regional coordination mechanism is irrelevant. Small/light
       coordination mechanisms will be beneficial. In this regard, one of the achievements of the
       Project was its ability to clearly identify the role of the different levels in the future
       management of GAS.

6.11   For a regional project, a communication strategy should be developed early in project
       preparation and continuously updated to reflect the changing circumstances. Using NGOs,
       civil society organizations and learning institutions, especially those which have a presence at
       the local level, for awareness building is effective because through time these organizations
       have developed some credibility in their operational areas. Through the Citizens Fund, the
       Guarani Project successfully utilized different communication strategy mechanisms and the
       result was widely recognized as being very positive.

6.12   Groundwater studies need to clearly identify and delineate areas for conservation, sustainable
       utilization or mining. In the Guarani outcropping areas, where the major use is concentrated,
       sustainable utilization of the resource is possible due to a large amount of natural recharge.
       However, in confined areas of the Guarani, recharge is low, but storage is very high. Although
       if well managed the water in these confined areas could last for hundreds or even thousands of
       years, true sustainable utilization may not be possible (for lack of recharge) and thus the
       exploitation in these areas after a certain low limit, will need to be treated as mining.

7.    Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners
      (a) Borrower/implementing agencies

7.1   The Bank team shared the draft ICR with OAS, BGR and the IAEA. The first two provided a
      formal comment on the ICR (see Annexes 7 and 8).

7.2   The OAS agreed with the overall Bank assessment of the Project except in rating the
      Government Performance as Highly Satisfactory. The Organization recommended that the
      rating should rather have been Satisfactory. The justification given by the OAS for the lower
      rating is that the Government performance should be related to the "failure" of the countries in
      establishing a strong regional institution and to a lesser extent for not requesting extension of
      the closing date and a follow-up project.

7.3   As stated in the ICR, the project success to a large extent was a factor of the continuous
      commitment of the participating countries. The SC never failed to support the Project by
      always taking the hard decisions and sometimes by conducting extraordinary meetings.

7.4   The fact that the Steering Committee opted for a light coordination mechanism is informed
      and is anchored on the solid findings of the different technical and scientific studies, which
      firmly established that the management of the GAS is essentially a local undertaking. In such
      circumstances, what is needed at the regional level is a coordination framework (which the
      Project successfully established). Strict management should occur at the lower levels in each
      country.

7.5   The four countries needed to demonstrate to their citizens that they have a sovereign right to
      the sustainable use and management of the Guarani aquifer. It is therefore rational for the SC
      not to request funding from the GEF or any other international organization in support of their
      coordination activities. In fact, although the Bank initially was behind the idea to prepare a
      follow-up project, the team quickly dropped the idea once it was learned that in general the
      GAS is basically in a very good condition and that the countries have assumed full ownership
      of the continuing regional cooperation framework. In addition, the Bank has explicitly
      communicated that it would have been very difficult to get approval for a second extension of
      the closing date.

7.6   Finally, during the Quality Enhancement Review meeting, participants were congratulatory to
      the governments for their ability to establish a coordination mechanism commensurate with
      the management needs and characteristics of the aquifer. After receiving the OAS comments,
      the Bank project team revisited the rating, but after reviewing the role the SC played during
      project execution and the agreed framework for continuing cooperation, the team decided to
      maintain the Government Performance Rating as Highly Satisfactory.

(c)   Other partners and stakeholders
      (e.g. NGOs/private sector/civil society)

7.7   BGR agreed with the overall assessment of the ICR and concluded that "the execution level of
      the project is excellent, achieving the results and indicators previewed." (See Annex 8 for
      detail). The Bank team completely agrees with the comments by BGR. Data and comments
      provided by BGR were instrumental in improving the ICR.

Annex 2. Outputs by Component

1.         Component 1: Expansion and Consolidation of the Current Scientific and Technical
           Knowledge Base on GAS:

1.1.1      This component supported several studies for consolidation and expansion of the scientific
           knowledge base on the structure and hydrodynamic behavior of the aquifer and to synthesize
           and expand the existing knowledge base to meet specific objectives.

1.1.2      The studies resulted in creating new understanding on the dynamics of the GAS that was the
           main prerequisite for the establishment of a management framework including defining
           cooperative arrangements among the four countries and bi-national arrangements at the local
           level. The different studies conducted resulted in important outputs:

     (a)       Based on a detail study of geology and a technical analysis, the geographic area of
               coverage of the Guarani was determined to be 1,087,879 Km2 (or 92% of the original
               estimation of 1.182million km2). This improved definition of the area determined the
               western limit of the GAS that was unknown during Project preparation and also better
               defined the northern limit of the aquifer; (See Map 1). In addition, the coverage of GAS
               in each country was determined, as given in the table below.

           (b) The large extension of the Guarani aquifer is found in Brazil (constituting 68% of the
               total area coverage of the aquifer). The 735,918 km2 area in Brazil distribution among
               eight states is: Goiás ­ 39,367.72 Km²; Mato Grosso ­ 7,217.57 Km²; Mato Grosso do
               Sul ­ 189,451.38 Km²; Minas Gerais ­ 38,585.20 Km²; Paraná ­ 119,524.47 Km², Rio
               Grande do Sul ­ 154,680.82 Km²; Santa Catarina ­ 44,132.12 Km² and São Paulo ­
               142,958.48 Km².

           (c) Ninety-percent of Guarani aquifer water is good quality potable water: In great majority
               of the aquifer water quality meets potable water standards. Water samples (916--346 in
               laboratory and 580 "in situ") were analyzed in order to characterize the quality of the
               water in different parts of the aquifer. This study identified areas with four types of
               characteristics (calcium-bicarbonates, sodium-bicarbonates, sodium-chloride-sulfates,
               and sodium-chlorides). High salinities (sometimes very high over 3 times the
               concentration of ocean water) were found in some parts of the aquifer in Argentina. This
               study also identified areas with relatively high levels of arsenic occurring and in certain
               areas (from Salto-Concordia up to the boundary of the provinces of Entre Ríos -
               Corrientes in Argentina).

           (d) In terms of population distribution living in the GAS area, as depicted in the table below,
               the majority of the population of Paraguay (56%) resides in the GAS area, while the
                                                       25
    corresponding figure for Brazil is 43%. Around one-fifth of the population of Argentina
    and Uruguay lives in the GAS area. (See Table 2 below for actual figures.) Overall, at
    regional level, close to 47% of the population of the four countries live in the Guarani
    aquifer area. However, out of the total 92 million people settled in the Guarani area, 87%
    live in Brazil.

(e) The total water reserve volume within Guarani aquifer is more than 30 trillion m3 (unlike
    the original estimate of 40.000 trillion m3).

(f) The Isotope Studies demonstrated that the Guarani aquifer contains both new water and
    water as old as 38,000 years. In addition, the existence of very old water in close
    proximity to the outcropping areas of the aquifer was observed, which indicates that there
    is very limited lateral movement of water in these areas.

(g) A conceptual model was developed that identified the flow dynamics of the Guarani
    aquifer and defined four sub-sectors in terms of water flow dynamics and can be treated
    as subsystems within the GAS;

(h) In general, the capacity of the aquifer and its sustainable yield were better defined ­ the
    recharge of Guarani aquifer is estimated to be 5 billion m3/year and the total reserve
    stands at 30 trillion m3. The major user of the GAS water is Brazil at an annual
    extraction of about 684 million m3/year. (See Map 3).

(i) Most production wells in the Guarani aquifer have high extraction capacity up to
    300m3/h. On average, a well producing 75m3/h is considered to be economically and
    financially viable.

(j) A number of technical manuals were produced to standardize procedure among the four
    countries and to establish mechanisms that will facilitate the sustainable use of the
    resource, by reducing potential contamination and overexploitation of groundwater
    resource. The manuals included: (i) Tube Well Manual;; (ii) Manual on Applied
    Geophysical Techniques for the GAS; (iii) Manual for Pump Testing;.(iv) Manual for
    Protection of Wells and Reducing Vulnerability of Contamination of the GAS; (v)
    Guidelines for Hydro-chemical Sampling and Analysis; and (vi) Guideline for Studying
    Forest Areas and their Relation to Recharge of the GAS. These manuals have been
    widely disseminated and are being adopted and used throughout the region.

(k) This component also had additional outputs that added to the information base that will
    be important in better understanding the GAS environment, including:

     (i) Climate change and its impact on the GAS region was partially analyzed.
         Although precipitation is expected to increase in some areas, temperature
         increases will be on the order of 3ºC by year 2080 that will result in higher
         evapotranspiration. As a result, it is expected that some areas of GAS may face a
         water deficit balance, especially in Paraguay and Brazil between 150 and 200
         South and between 490 and 570 West, which will increase the value of the
         Guarani aquifer as a strategic reserve.
(ii)     The Project was able to form a consensus among technical specialists in the four
         countries on what constitutes the Guarani aquifer from the perspective of
         geological formations. As a result, the GAS is now well defined from geological
         perspective by identifying the geological formations that comprise the aquifer in
         the region. As depicted in Table 3 below, these geological formations are:
         Misiones (in Paraguay) Misiones/Tacuarembo (Argentina), Tacuarembo
         (Uruguay), Botucatu/Guara, Daturrita and Santa Maria (Southern Brazil)
         Botucatu and Piramboia (Central and North Brazil) ­ see Table 3 below.

(iii)                    Geological structures were identified that establish the border between freshwater
                         and saline water in the GAS. The Project determined that there is no clear
                         evidence that establishes the hydrological connection between GAS and wetlands
                         of Ibera (Corrientes province in Argentina)
(iv)                     It is estimated that the total discharge of groundwater (both natural discharge and
                         extractions by humans) is more or less equivalent to the recharge at the regional
                         level, however, at the local level there are areas where overexploitation was
                         detected and measures were identified to curb the overexploitation in order to
                         achieve sustainable extraction.

                                                        27
          (v)     The GAS directly discharges into a number of major and small river systems in
                  the region. The discharge to the Parana river is estimated at 0.9-1.8 m3/s and the
                  corresponding figure for Uruguay river is 7.4-9.8m3/s.

      (l) A study of land use changes that analyzed the evolution during three periods (1980, 1990,
          and 2007) was conducted using satellite images. The study showed that during this 34
          year period the area used for agriculture increased from 22% in 1980 to 47% in 2007; the
          land allocated to silvopasture increased from 11% to 23% during the same period; dense
          forest decreased from 9% to 2%; and areas not cultivated decreased from 23% to 18%.
          These changes in land use could have significant implications for management of the
          GAS in the future although at this point credible conclusions can not be made on the
          impact of land use changes on the quality and quantity of the Guarani aquifer water or on
          the amount of recharge. It is considered likely that plantation forests could significantly
          reduce recharge and increase water consumption (and eventually decrease discharge)
          when compared to natural vegetation but with the data and models available it was not
          possible to quantify this impact or determine if there would be a significant impact on the
          quality and quantity of the water in the aquifer or in rivers fed by aquifer base flows. A
          better understanding could be developed following a complete cycle of forestation (from
          planting to harvesting) that may require 10 to 15 years period depending on the forestry
          type.

1.2   To provide technical information for evaluation of current and future use scenarios, at the
      regional level, the Project assessed land use patterns, evaluated existing water use, reviewed
      the economy of the region and examined population and settlement patterns, among others.
      Based on these studies and the mathematical model, the Project provided the technical tools
      to assess future scenarios. In addition, detail socioeconomic studies were conducted in the
      four pilot areas that provided instructive conclusions for the aquifer management in each
      locality. The economic valuation (or the economic contribution of the GAS) was not
      quantified. However, the cost of exploitation, IRR and marginal cost of extracting additional
      cubic meter of water, under different scenarios, were estimated.

1.3   Currently, GAS is predominantly utilized to supply water for domestic and
      industrial/commercial use (an estimated 90% of the extraction). Of this, 66% is used for
      public water supply, 5% for rural water supply, 16% for industrial use and 13% for recreation
      (thermal tourism). The most diversified use of the Guarani is observed in Brazil, while the
      least diversification occurs in Argentina where existing wells are used exclusively for
      recreation/thermal purposes. In Brazil, 44% of the wells are destined for public water supply,
      25% for domestic use from private wells, 22% industrial, 7% rural and 2% for recreation. In
      Paraguay, 96% of the wells are destined for public water supply in urban areas, while the
      comparable figure for Uruguay is 93%, with an additional 5.7% being used in thermal
      recreation. The Argentina province of Entre Rios has 15 registered thermal wells that are
      exclusively used for recreation. (See Map 3)

1.4   The overall conclusion of the socio-economic analysis is that the use of the Guarani aquifer
      will predominantly remain for domestic and industrial/commercial use either through public
      water supply systems or private wells. This conclusion is based on the fact that the GW
      resource was found to be economical, as a source of public water supply, but generally not
      economical for irrigation use given other alternative water sources. In addition, in the great
      majority of the region, the GAS is confined. With existing technologies its exploitation is in
      general not economical, except for thermal recreation.

1.5      The IAEA supported this component by conducting isotope analysis on water samples from
         390 sampling points (985 analyses) in Guarani region. An assessment of hydro-chemical and
         isotope hydrology (18O, D, 14C/13C) and using data from hydro-geology map revealed that
         the GAS can be divided in to 8 zones with distinct characteristics' in flow and age of the
         groundwater. However, the three major zones are, outcropping, transition and confined
         zones. (See Map 4).

1.6      BGR did an excellent job which greatly complemented the Project. BGR conducted a
         detailed review of the Paraguay pilot area (Itapua) and worked closely with the Project by
         providing data and study results as they were produced. BGR developed a model for the
         oriental region of Paraguay including parts of Argentina and Brazil and transferred data and
         results to the model for the Itapua pilot area that clearly demonstrated the flow dynamics in
         the pilot area and areas surrounding Itapua. When the Project closing date was extended,
         BGR also accommodated the Project by extending the closing date of their activities and by
         financing related activities in Paraguay. BGR is now supporting the integration of Itapua
         pilot region with basin management activities in the country. BGR also established a
         database on Guarani aquifer in Paraguay that included an inventory of wells, extraction rates,
         quality of water, identification of vulnerable areas and related variables. In addition to a
         number of workshops that BGR organized and/or participated, the following outputs were
         reported by BGR.

2.       Joint Development and Implementation of the Guarani Aquifer System Management
         Framework ­

2.1      The objective of this component was to develop a framework for the coordinated
         management (technical, institutional, financial and legal) of the GAS. This framework was to
         be established within the SAP to be implemented in the GAS region. The SAP was expected
         to articulate the principal lines of action necessary for achieving the Project's long term
         objective. This component had five sub-components:

                                                    29
2.2   Design and implementation of an aquifer monitoring network: The Project selected 180
      wells for inclusion in the Guarani aquifer monitoring network that was deemed important for
      providing data for decision making on the status of the aquifer, to help in identifying
      emerging problems, and to support the sustainable use and management of the aquifer. A
      regional commission, composed of experts in the field from the four countries was formed to
      determine the selection criteria and to decide on the overall establishment of the monitoring
      network. The commission selected 180 wells (less than the original target of 184 wells) after
      determining that only less than 10% of the aquifer is found in outcropping areas where most
      monitoring needs to be carried out given the potential vulnerability of the aquifer in these
      areas. In areas where groundwater exploitation is showing signs of stress, governments have
      shown the willingness to include additional wells in the monitoring network. The State of
      Sao Paulo, for example, has included an additional 22 wells that have increased the number
      of monitoring wells to 202. Thus, the target was met, and the number wells that will be
      monitored will increase further given the expressed interest shown by the governments at all
      levels.

2.3   The Project design planned to install monitoring equipments in these selected monitoring
      wells. Once it was determined that the flow dynamics in the GAS is very slow, the need for
      installing such equipment was discounted in favor of periodically monitoring these wells by
      measuring water depth (or piezometric head) and by taking samples for analyses in
      laboratories in the region. Some universities (e.g. FUCAI ­ Catholic University in Itapua,
      Paraguay) have committed to doing the laboratory analysis in the future.

2.4   In areas where there exists actual or potential overexploitation, the number wells to be
      included in the regional monitoring network will be higher. For example, in Concordia-Salto,
      where there is a potential for competitive exploitation of the Guarani for geothermal use, all
      the 11 production wells presently under operation have been included into the 202 wells
      selected for the regional monitoring network. (See Map 4).

2.5   Development and integration of an information system (SISAG): Deployment of SISAG
      was delayed due to several factors including: (i) the decision to first prepare the cartographic
      map set before embarking on development of the system; (ii) the number of wells (7730)
      were found to be almost four times the original estimate (around 2000) and thus the collection
      of the data set (the backbone of SISAG) was found to take more time; (iii) procurement
      procedures to contract as one package was found to be cumbersome that later was broken-up
      between hardware and software including training in the use of the system; and (iv) the
      Brazilian government initiated its own information system and therefore some time elapsed
      until a decision was made whether to use the Brazilian system for all countries for the sake of
      compatibility or develop a separate system. The four countries finally determined that
      SISAG should be developed as a separate system, with linkages to the Brazilian system.

2.6   The original design of the Project identified the preparation of specific technical information
      such as geological and hydrogeochemical maps for priority areas as part of other technical
      studies. However, during Project implementation, it was quickly recognized that there was a
      need to include information collected through the different studies into a geo-referenced
      cartographic data set. The bidding for the contract to produce these set of maps followed the
      International Competitive Bidding method and the contract was awarded to the winning firm.
      However, actual activities of the contract were not initiated immediately due to delays in
      providing clearance by one of the countries and a formal complaint filed by one of the
      bidding firms to the Regional Procurement Advisor's office. After reviewing the procedures
      followed by the OAS/PS, the Procurement Advisor cleared the contract that was signed on
      January 31, 2005. One-hundred-ninety maps (1:250,000 scale) and one overall map (1:
      3,000,000) were produced. These maps were presented to NCs and geographic institutions of
                                                  30
           the four countries. This map production utilized a peer review exercise that improved the
           quality of the map set. The maps were made available to the countries through a web site and
           will be part of the SISAG. Thus, the Project not only supported the technical preparation of
           the maps but also involved the institutions of the countries that are future users of the
           products. Two seminars were held that provided a forum for institutions involved in
           cartographic work in each country to share their information and provide feedback to the
           Guarani aquifer maps before they were finalized. The Base Map of GAS won a second place
           in Best Data Integration category, awarded by ESRI (the company that designs and develops
           the Geographic Information System ­ GIS -- technology), in August 2008.

2.7        The implementation of SISAG followed the completion of the preparation of the cartographic
           map set and was only implemented at the time of Project closing. SISAG is composed of five
           central servers (one in each country and one for the regional coordination unit in Montevideo)
           and 28 nodes. The Project initially planned to develop only five nodes/servers. However, the
           need for connecting the institutions at all levels was determined to be of critical importance
           not only to share available information but also to provide the platform to update the database
           by all involved responsible institutions. The Project provided software and hardware and
           training in the maintenance of the information system and this database is accessible to all
           participating institutions. At present it includes data from 7730 wells. SISAG also includes
           the cartographic maps that were developed for the region, which allows for representation of
           information through a GIS. The database on wells includes depth, year of construction, and
           amount of extraction of water and the geographic location, and other data. It will be through
           the SISAG that the 202 plus monitoring wells will be updated to provide information on the
           status of the aquifer.

2.8        SISAG includes a GIS based database with information on more than 7,000 wells in the GAS
           region and detail information on several characteristics of the region, including land use
           patterns, population distribution, potential use of SAG by regions; and spatial 3-dimensional
           information (geological, geophysical, hydro-geological, hydro-chemical, isotopes, etc.) on the
           GAS.

2.9        Development of Strategic Action Programme (SAP): As stated in the PAD, the task of
           developing the SAP was carried out during the final year of Project implementation to take
           advantage of improved scientific, technical and institutional/legal information on the GAS
           that was made available in the later stages of Project implementation. The SAP is an agreed
           action plan of the four countries. It lays out future forms of management of the aquifer and
           the cooperation mechanisms, including financing of the activities identified for future
           implementation. Following the GEF procedures, the SAP was prepared with the participation
           of citizens, at the technical experts and public policy makers in the four countries and with
           close involvement by the SC members and NCs. The SAP was approved by the countries in
           November 2008 and the SC has agreed to oversee the implementation of the agreed actions.
           The main agreements included definition of institutional mechanisms at all levels, the
           assumption of specific responsibilities by each country to coordinate follow-up activities; and
           the continuation of the activities started at pilot level. In terms of specific responsibilities:
           Argentina will be responsible for the SISAG; Brazil for conceptual and mathematical model
           maintenance and further development; Paraguay will coordinate training and capacity
           improvement activities, and Uruguay will house the newly reorganized coordination unit.
           The countries also assumed the responsibility to coordinate follow-up pilot Project activities:
           Argentina for Concordia-Salto; Uruguay for Riveira-Santana 25 ; Paraguay for Itapua and
           Brazil for Ribeirao Preto.

2.10      The SAP is under wide dissemination around the region and beyond. Specific agreed actions
          include:

          (a) Update and maintain the database and SISAG to serve as decision-support system;
          (b) Maintain and further develop the GAS monitoring network and continued development
              and use of the mathematical models
          (c) Recognize the role of Local Commissions in Support of GAS management in the pilot
              areas and to replicate lessons learned from these pilots in other areas where the Guarani
              aquifer demonstrates similar characteristics and problems;
          (d) Widely disseminate the knowledge generated through the Guarani Project and develop
              the capacity of institutions of the countries in the management of GW;
          (e) Ensure that public participation in the process of decision making is maintained and
              provide priority to awareness building on environment and on the value of GW,
              especially on the GAS aimed at enhancing effectiveness of GW management;
          (f) Develop and implement shared principles for the sustainable use of the GAS with
              specificity for different zones, especially in the recharge zone;
          (g) Implement technical and scientific programs especially in the thematic areas considered
              to be strategic for the management and protection of the GAS;
          (h) Conduct an economic and environmental evaluation on the actual and future use of
              thermal and non-thermal use of the GAS
          (i) Generate technical and institutional capacity for the management of GW in coordination
              and within a regional arrangement;
          (j) Support the operational structure established for coordinating the activities of the four
              countries.

2.11      Institutional Strengthening: In addition to benefiting public water and environmental
          agencies in each country, the institutional strengthening activities benefited NGOs, learning
          and other public institutions and private operators of wells. In terms of direct hands-on
          training, a total of 44 staff from the four countries benefited from internships, out of which 9
          were twinned with consulting firms that were conducting technical field work and studies and
          35 benefited through the internship program established through the Project. The Project also
          provided several training in specialized field, which is summarized under Table 5 below. In
          addition, 75% of the consultants that worked for the consulting firms contracted to conduct
          detail scientific studies were professionals from the region thereby contributing to improving
          the in-country capacity of the four countries.

2.12   Through this subcomponent, the BNWPP supported the establishment of University Fund in
       the region to carry scientific studies in specific localities on specific themes related to the
       Guarani aquifer. Nine subprojects were selected out of a total of 29 proposals presented for
       funding. These nine studies covered three major thematic areas: (i) enhancing the existing
       knowledge base on point and non-point sources of contamination of the GAS; (ii) evaluation
       and assessment on the vulnerability of Guarani aquifer; and (iii) studies on recharge and
       discharge areas to identify areas that need protection. The result of these studies were
       published and widely distributed across the region. In addition, following the need for
       cooperative management of the Guarani aquifer, the nine subprojects supported through the
       University Fund were implemented jointly by two or three universities. A total of 21
       universities and four public research institutions from the four countries were associated to
       conduct the nine studies. The main findings of the studies financed under this fund are
       available         through         the         Project          website:        (http://www.sg-
       guarani.org/index/site/proyecto_particular/pp003b.php)

2.13   Four of the studies were carried out in areas identified as "hot spots" with a potential for
       conflicts with bordering countries and where signs of stress were evident. Because this Fund
       made possible the mainstreaming of GW into the academic agenda of the institutions, the
       activities initiated through the Grant will continue into the future ensuring the sustainability
       of the outcomes. The universities also will play an active leadership role in providing the
       necessary information for decision making and in monitoring of the resource into the future
       unlike the pre-project phase where data and knowledge was limited, scattered and unshared.
       Some of the initiatives undertaken under the University fund resulted in additional financing.
       The Government of Rio Grande de Sol, for instance financed the installation of stations for
       monitoring the region's environment.

2.14   As mentioned above, BGR and IAEA contributed to institutional strengthening. IAEA
       provided training on isotope analyses that increased the capacity of several institutions and
       professionals in the region and provided equipment to help institutions involved in GW
       management to carry out their activities. Twenty-one hydro-geologists benefited from the
       training provided by IAEA. BGR supported the new Guarani Unit in Paraguay by providing
       vehicle, field equipment for hydro-geological investigations, computer facilities, intranet and
       internet linkage and mapping and modeling software and continuous on-the-job training for at
       least several Ministry of Environment staff and supported two master level studies and three
       specific trainings in higher education.

2.15   Overall, institutions in the four countries at all levels are benefiting from the improved and
       dependable knowledge base on the Guarani aquifer, tested management practices and
       manuals for different technical aspects, improved information systems (software-and-
       hardware) working models, and trained staff, among others. In addition, the fact that the
       Project resulted in a well informed populous, in regard to the need for groundwater
       management also facilitates the work of the institutions.

2.16   Transboundary Diagnostic Analysis (TDA): As a GEF supported international water
       project, the Guarani Project developed a TDA through extensive participation of different
       segments of the population. The TDA was approved and accepted by the countries following
       intensive discussions conducted in each country through the facilitation of the NCs of each
       country. The TDA identified critical root causes in the future sustainable management and
       use of the Guarani aquifer and identified the following elements that later became the basis
       for the preparation of the SAP.

       (a) The TDA developed a framework for analyzing causes of critical issues and possible
           mitigation measures. It classified the causes as: (i) natural ­ caused by climate change,
                                                   33
           topography or soil type which in general is not amenable to mitigation measure; (ii)
           primary or technical ­ resulting from low level sanitation coverage, unsuitable well
           construction/perforation, destruction of vegetative cover; (iii) secondary or economic
           management ­ caused by attaching low value to environmental benefits, lack of priorities
           and uncontrolled use of GW, among others; (iv) tertiary or political ­ mainly due to lack
           of legal norms, absence of managing institutions; and (v) fundamental or socio-cultural ­
           resulting from lack of public participation and low level of capacity and limited
           awareness.

       (b) The TDA made some critical observations in respect to the need to strengthen public
           organizations responsible for the management, technical training and administration and
           made the recommendation to undertake activities that lead to improving: (i) the efficiency
           of institutional arrangements at the local level; (ii) the capacity of environmental and
           water regulatory agencies to take preventive measures rather than reactive measures after
           conflicts occurs; and (iii) the participation of users among the different sectoral
           organizations in the use and risk management in GW. In addition, the report confirmed
           the need for reviewing the legal regime for the management and protection of GW in the
           different national, provincial and state levels in the Guarani region to identify the strength
           and weaknesses in implementation of actual and future protection of the Guarani aquifer.
           In regard to the pilot regions, the preliminary report identified key results expected in
           each pilot subproject.

2.17   It has to be noted that the TDA was conducted before the different technical studies were
       completed. Therefore the TDA reflected available knowledge during the time and the general
       perceptions about the aquifer. Hence, some of the conclusions of the TDA were later found
       to lack a scientific basis. For example, the TDA was not able to appreciate the fact that
       existing legal frameworks in each country were sufficient for the management of the aquifer
       needing only the strengthening of enforcement mechanisms. In addition, it did not reflect
       very well the fact that management of the GAS is essentially local in nature.

3.     Public and Stakeholder Participation, Education and Communication

3.1    Design of a Regional Communication and Public Participation Plan: During Project
       preparation this became an important task when the Project was forced to deal with a negative
       campaign that was undertaken by certain groups. The Project quickly prepared a
       communication strategy with the support of the Bank's external relation department
       professionals. It was important to undertake this activity immediately to avoid the possibility
       of derailing the Project from its main tasks. However, some significant time was lost until a
       person responsible for this task was brought on board in the PS. Initially technical staff
       needed to allocate additional time to communicate Project objectives. In addition to the
       systematic implementation of the communication strategy, what also helped was the forum
       the Project created for participation. Stakeholders participation was formalized at all levels:
       At local pilot areas NGOs, universities, citizen representatives, line-ministry agents and
       private sector representatives were brought on board into the local management commission
       created as part of the pilot subprojects.

3.2    The Project also attracted a large amount of coverage by news media in the region, especially
       in print media. Although initially the coverage was negative, it quickly changed and started
       to focus on the need for sustainable management of the resource. The Project also developed
       a communication channel with Environmental journalists.

3.3    To help craft a strategy for public participation in GW, the PS organized a workshop, which
       assessed the experiences of the Guarani Project and where lessons learned were extracted.
                                                    34
       The review exercise and its conclusions and recommendations later contributed to the
       formulation the SAP's public participation mechanism.

3.4    Establishment of Citizen Fund: The Citizen Fund supported 24 subprojects of which one
       was not completed. A total of 2.3 million people are estimated to have been reached through
       the activities of this fund that implemented subprojects that educated the public on
       groundwater management issues trough distribution of learning materials and conducting
       communication campaigns. These subprojects were implemented by NGOs, universities and
       civil society organizations that proved to be an excellent mechanism to reach the population
       at large since these organizations have established credibility in their communities. The
       successful implementation of this task enhanced public understanding about the Project
       objectives at the local level. Selected materials produced through this fund (21 out of 24) are
       available for downloading at the Project web site, which has registered an average of 3,600
       downloads                  per             month.                              (http://www.sg-
       guarani.org/index/site/proyecto_particular/pp003b.php).

3.5    Overall these subprojects were evenly distributed among the four countries and some were
       implemented as joint ventures. The fund focused on pilot regions ­ out of the 24 subprojects,
       nine were in pilot regions (four in Concordia/Salto, two in Rivera/Santana, one Ribeirao Preto
       and two in Itapúa) and six were operational in transboundary areas. The beneficiaries of this
       fund were: 14 socio-environmental NGOs, nine universities, four professional associations
       and two local representatives of public organizations. In addition, there were two subprojects
       that were specifically geared to reach the indigenous community that trained local
       environmental promoters and transmitted awareness building and educational messages using
       the Guarani language.

3.6    The central theme of the large majority of these subprojects was diffusion of knowledge and
       training of educators and civil society organizations. Some subprojects also dealt on
       gender/groundwater issues. The training and educational materials produced by the
       recipients of the fund are considered to be of high quality by the PS, the OAS and by the
       professionals in the region.

3.7    Creation and dissemination of instruments to increase awareness, interest and commitment
       among stakeholders: The Project Secretariat created a monthly newsletter which reached
       4100 subscribers in its distribution list and since the initiation of this medium, a total of 70
       newsletters were produced. The web site of the Project became a good source of information
       on the Project and was very transparent in sharing important information developed through
       the Project. The web site, on average, had 23,000 visitors per month. As part of the
       communication strategy, the Project produced posters, leaflets and video clips on the Project
       objective and on the need for sustainable management of the aquifer. These materials were
       widely distributed by all agencies participating in the Project. The Project also developed
       "TV spots" in cooperation with the media but without cost to the Project, which were
       transmitted through TV and Radio in each country that reached an estimated 2.6 million
       people. In addition, the countries carried out their own communication efforts in support of
       the Project once it was determined that the NPEU should help in this task. At the pilot area
       level, local facilitators were the main driving force in communications. Some localities
       produced their own communication video clips independent to the Project that were
       transmitted through local media outlets.

3.8.   Preparation of Indigenous people's strategy: As planned, during Project preparation, the PS
       informed national indigenous people organizations in Argentina, Brazil and Paraguay on the


                                                   35
        advances made in Project execution. Later on the Project supported the preparation of an
        indigenous people's strategy that is now accessible through www.sg-guarani.org/indigenas.

3.9     In addition to the development of the indigenous people's strategy the Project helped achieve
        two main results: (i) strengthened the link among indigenous people organizations (such as
        INAI, Argentina; FUNAI, Brazil, INDI, Paraguay) and indigenous communities on the one
        hand and institutions involved in water resource management at different levels, on the other
        hand; (ii) in addition to providing information to the indigenous community leaders on the
        GAS, the Project supported the inclusion of indigenous people issue into the SAP. Also, as
        part of the indigenous people's strategy, the Project focused on what is relevant to these
        target groups, such as building awareness on the use of clean water and thus has contributed
        to future health improvement of these communities.

3.10   Further, the Citizens Fund supported two subprojects that trained trainers to enhance
       awareness within the indigenous community and prepared relevant documents in indigenous
       languages for distribution and use within the community and the school system.

4.      Project Monitoring and Evaluation, and Dissemination of Project Results (US$0.48
        million or 1.8%)

4.1     During Project implementation, the PS was able to deploy an information system for the
        management of Project implementation (Sistema Informatizado de Gestión del Proyecto --
        SIGP). This system allowed for monitoring of Project implementation and provided updates
        for SC meetings and Bank supervision missions. In addition, the system was instrumental in
        monitoring annual work plans, financial management, procurement processes and timetable
        and for accounting counterpart contributions. However, the system did not benefit from
        updates from different Project activities since some of the indicators only started to be
        realized later in Project implementation phase. For those that were monitorable, the system
        provided information on the status of the advances made in Project execution.

4.2    In addition this component supported the dissemination of Project products. However, the
       issue of import taxes delayed the distribution of the results of several scientific studies,
       especially in Brazil. Using the OAS offices in the region and each country, dissemination
       work was later enhanced. The Project also partnered with other agencies in groundwater to
       help its dissemination activity.

5.     Development of Management and Mitigation Measures within Identified "Hot Spots"

5.1    Four `hot spots' were selected to pilot local management in the GAS region. In these areas
       detailed studies on the aquifer characteristics and the related socioeconomic variables were
       conducted. The pilot regions were selected to represent areas of the GAS with actual or
       potential problems in overexploitation, and/or pollution/contamination and were identified as
       potential areas for conflict and competition in the use of GAS. Two were transboundary
       (Rivera, Uruguay /Santana, Brazil; and Concordia, Argentina /Salto, Uruguay) and the other
       two were located in a single country (Ribeirao Preto, Brazil and Itapua in Paraguay). In each
       pilot area, the Project first established a Local Management Commission composed of several
       agencies and stakeholders. Later these commissions were transformed into `Support Groups
       for Local Management of the GAS.' These local commissions now have an improved
       understanding the Guarani aquifer, which was made possible through different training
       workshops (groundwater management, isotope analysis, measuring flow mechanisms,
       communication strategy, citizen participation, well drilling, water quality monitoring,
       information system utilization and updating, etc).

                                                   36
5.2   The Project deployed information systems, provided office equipment and instruments for
      field work (such as water quality measurement devices and GPSs for geo-referencing of wells
      and other potential pollution sources) which will be instrumental in the future for monitoring
      and updating of the database. The mathematical models developed for each pilot area will be
      the main tool for deepening the understanding on the dynamics of the Guarani aquifer in the
      local areas and will support simulation of different scenarios for use and management of the
      aquifer to better inform decision-making. Thus, significant progress has been made in creating
      and strengthening the institutional basis for the future management of the aquifer in the pilot
      areas.

5.3   The pilot areas has come a long way in terms of managing the GAS ­ controlling
      contamination and pollution, such as lining of solid waste sites in Rivera; managing the risk of
      overexploitation, such as in Ribeirao Preto and Concordia/Salto and monitoring agricultural
      discharges, such as in Itapua. At the pilot level local monitoring networks will be maintained
      as a part of the follow-up activities to the Project.

5.4   In two pilot sister towns (Rivera-Santana and Concordia-Salto) there is a potential risk for
      conflicts caused by contamination or competitive exploitation and the Project supported
      significant reductions in these risks through cooperative management actions. Before the
      Project, these sister towns did not know the number of wells operating and/or the level of
      extraction in each other's localities and there was also almost no information on GW quality
      and pollution. At present they have an information system with all the relevant data on each
      other's wells characteristics, water quality, level of extraction, and other relevant data for
      monitoring the aquifer. Such sharing of detailed data and monitoring, and the creation of the
      information system played a catalytic role in building trust among the different countries at all
      levels thereby reducing the possibility for future conflicts. The two pilot areas have also
      adopted a series of measures related to well locations and spacing, sanitation, and solid waste
      management which significantly reduce the risk of contamination and overdraft.

5.5   Itapua pilot region became the primary region in the country where the new water law
      regulations are being implemented. Through the support of BGR, the function of the pilot
      region in Paraguay, Itapua, is now integrated into the basin committee where there is a strong
      intuitional basis that include a local university and NGOs with a reputation within the
      community.

5.6   The Project supported detail scientific studies on the different aspects of the Guarani aquifer at
      the local level including socio-economic analyses. Several instructive conclusions emanated
      from these detail studies:

 (a) in Ribeirao Preto, under a business as usual scenario, the groundwater resource could be
     totally depleted by 2030. Taking this into account, the Project in cooperation with the state
     government: (i) established the importance of intensive monitoring, (ii) delineated areas for
     protection, (iii) identified areas where new wells perforation should be prohibited; (iv) mapped
     areas where new wells could be constructed, (v) planned for implementation of a demand
     management program including leakage control, micro-measurement and tariff raising, and
     (vi) planned for analyzing other surface water and groundwater sources of water in addition to
     the Guarani aquifer that is presently Ribeirao Preto's only water supply source;

 (b) in Concordia (Argentina) and Salto (Uruguay) the studies determined that established that the
     aquifer has no hydraulic relationship with the freshwater of Paraguay river and intrusion of salt
     water is not a significant risk. However, because recharge is practically non-existent, there is a

                                                    37
       danger of greatly reducing the piezomteric heads in the confined Guarani aquifer if the two
       sister towns embark on competitive exploitation of the geothermal water. They therefore: (i)
       established the minimum distance necessary between geothermal wells; (ii) emphasized the
       need to limit the total number of wells and amount of extraction from each well; (iii)
       highlighted the importance of recycling geothermal water after its use in recreation/tourism;
       (iv) supported the agreement reached between the two localities in adapting similar standards
       in well perforations; and (v) include all operating wells in GAS monitoring network.

 (c) in Riveira-Santana: in general, there is no problem of contamination of the Guarani GW in
     this locality. However, some samples showed somewhat elevated concentrations of nitrates or
     other chemicals (but still within acceptable limits). Also, although there is no perceived
     overdraft in the pilot area, the mathematical model indicated that there is potential for
     overexploitation in the future without adequate management and controls. Given the low
     coverage of sanitation services (40% of the population in Santana and 30% in Rivera), the
     observed preliminary detection of quality problems, and the potential for future
     overexploitation, the Project determined that there is a need to: (i) improve solid waste
     management and sanitation coverage; (ii) monitor water levels and water quality and operate
     and maintain the local Guarani aquifer monitoring network, given that the aquifer is the main
     source of water supply for the population of the two sister towns; (iii) register and monitor
     private wells; (iv) locate new wells for public water supply in new protected areas in the two
     localities and establish a perimeter to protect the wells including land use restrictions; and (v)
     create a central location for the local commission that will facilitate public participation.
 (d) in Itapua, Paraguay, This pilot region is characterized with 50% basalt overlaying and the
     other 50% with Guarani sandstone outcropping area. There are more than 60 registered
     operating wells in this pilot region that have between 70 to 120 m depth in the Guarani aquifer
     and reach up to 300 m in the basalt covered areas. The pilot region is located in an area where
     cultivation and livestock is the main economic activity. In addition, there is a plan to help
     farmers to intensifying their farm. The specific critical issues in the management of the GAS
     in this pilot area are related to: (i) possible contamination of drinking water supply wells from
     inadequate sanitation, unplanned land use, and inadequate use of agro-chemicals; (ii)
     hydrological balance related to forestation and its potential impact on recharge; and quantity
     and quality of recharge to the aquifer that is affected by intensive agriculture and the system of
     cultivation. Thus, the Project identified the following activities for management of GAS in
     this locality: (i) protection of the source of municipal water supply by establishing a perimeter
     for the protection of these wells; (ii) evaluate the use of Guarani water for supplementary
     irrigation by first improving the capacity of the local university and then developing a
     demonstration plot for evaluating the processes of agricultural related contamination; (iii)
     develop a program for expanding the knowledge base on the local characteristics of the
     aquifer; (iv) improve the capacity of local institutions including learning, public and private
     institutions; (v) establish a local sub-committee under the local commission for
     communication, awareness building, and updating of scientific knowledge; and (vi)
     establishment of a center for public participation.

5.7    In addition, the Project accomplished the following in the pilot areas:
      (a) collected available information related to Guarani aquifer in their respective regions
            including digital maps, inventory of wells, studies on the local characteristics of the
            resource and chemical analysis of different water wells;
      (b) enhanced dissemination activities about the Project and the aquifer, as well as the need
            for its sustainable management through: (i) media outlets that included radio, TV and
            newspapers; (ii) workshops and local forums; (iii) locally produced video; and (iv) local
            web sites;


                                                   38
      (c)   expanded cooperation with relevant institutions and incorporated additional stakeholders
            in the local management commissions;
      (d)   provided representation of the Guarani Project in local basin management committees;
      (e)   strengthened the collaboration between transboundary agencies ­ in case of the
            Concordia/Salto pilot region a memorandum of understanding was signed to coordinate
            their local actions in the management of the resource;
      (f)   supported and championed tangible action to mitigate adverse impacts through control of
            deforestation, creation of ecological parks, delineation of areas for protection, for well
            drilling and for reforestation; .and finally
      (g)   developed a local management plan as part of the SAP that can be called Local SAP.

5.8    The facilitators that were later brought on board by the project, played a critical role in
       coordinating stakeholder cooperation by facilitating a regular meeting of stakeholders and
       pilot area local management commissions and by ensuring transparent information flow
       among the commission members. The facilitators and pilot commissions were instrumental in
       supporting the work of consulting firms, in dispelling inaccurate information, and in
       improving awareness. The facilitators also prepared periodic reports on the status of Project
       implementation and cooperation in the pilot areas.

5.9    In summary, a detailed study was carried out for all pilot areas to understand the dynamics of
       the GAS in each locality. The institutional basis was established and relevant trainings were
       provided to help in the management of the GAS in the specific localities. The lessons drawn
       from the experience in these pilot areas is now readily available to be replicated in other hot
       spots. The Guarani Project has identified three such new pilot areas for replicating the lessons
       learned from these pilots. These three pilot areas are (i) the surrounding zones of the town of
       Artigas (Uruguay)-Quarai (Brazil); (ii) Pedro Juan Caballero (Paraguay)/Ponta Pora (Brazil);
       and Tres Frontiera region (Brazil/Paraguay/Argentina). Through the support of BGR work has
       already began at the second pilot region that is shared between Brazil and Paraguay.

6.     Assessment of Geothermal Energy Potential

6.1    This component supported a detailed study of the hydro-thermal potential of the Guarani
       aquifer. It is now determined that the groundwater temperature of the SAG is between 250-
       800C. This signifies that the Guarani aquifer's potential as an alternative source of energy is
       limited to certain activities, such as geothermal tourism, heated greenhouses, drying of various
       products, such as wood and other agricultural products, fish farming, space heating of houses
       and buildings, among others. Based on temperature, the Guarani aquifer geothermal potential
       was classified into three zones. Table 6 shows the 3 zones and the potential use in each of the
       three zones.

6.2    Some professionals in the field made the view that the Project should not have had a
       geothermal component aimed at alternative energy sources. However, what the critics miss is
       that it is only during Project implementation that it was determined the temperatures from the
       thermal water were not high enough to economically develop the aquifer as an alternative
       source of energy.

7.      Project Coordination and Management

7.1     The Project Secretariat that played the traditional role of PIU was structured to be the Project
        operational. Under the management of the OAS, the PS was responsible for coordinating the
        different consultant activities, that included the preparation of terms of reference and RFPs,
        procurement/contracting, administration of the contracts, and monitoring and verifying the
        products. The PS also procured equipment, carried out financial management, and
        coordinated the day-to-day Project implementation activities. The PS successfully conducted
        dissemination of Project results using different medium, coordinated communication activities,
        supported the work of the SC, the Bank and other partners, prepared annual reports and plans,
        and closely coordinated the work in the pilot areas. Given the number of institutions that were
        involved in the Project and the area covered, the PS did a very good job of Project
        implementation and coordination with many pressures from different corners.

7.2     The PS was staffed with capable technical professionals from the four countries who were
        instrumental in analyzing the different consultants' products, conducting awareness building,
        and coordination of technical peer reviews. The PS dedicated a considerable time in
        coordinating consensus building effort regarding the detailed implementation of the Project
        across multiple stakeholders in the four countries. The different training workshops and
        institutional capacity improvement activities that were implemented through the Project were
        also coordinated by the PS. The staff of the PS were active in sharing outputs with
        stakeholders in the region through workshops and training events and the Project web site.
        The PS also supported the establishment of local pilot offices and managed the provision of
        office equipment, such as computers, to the four pilot regions.

Subject:       Guarani Project: Implementation Completion and Result Report (ICR)

Ref.:          Your E-mail dated July 07th, 2009


Dear Gentlemen,


your report reflects clearly the activities and the progress achieved by the Guaraní Project.

Keeping in mind that such an ambitious project with the special regional character can be
considered as a challenge, it can be stated that the execution level of the project is
excellent, achieving the results and indicators previewed.

In addition to my remarks on the draft version (I sent them to you by E-mail on Monday,
July 06th, 2009) there are no further comments of major importance on the ICR from my
side.

Please, allow me to illustrate with some words the background and the role of the BGR
project SAG-PY and its multiple functions.
                                            51
The BGR participation in the Guaraní-Project cooperating agency has been suggested and
arranged during the preparation phase with The World Bank, OAS and SEAM
(Paraguay) (see agreed meeting minutes, Washington, May 21, 2002). The area in the
triangle Encarnación - Ciudad del Este - Caaguazú has finally been declared as the "hot
spot" in Paraguay for the development of regionally-appropriate groundwater
management. Later on, the activities have been extended to the whole oriental region of
Paraguay.

BGR has been commissioned by the BMZ (Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation
and Development) to run the project SAG-PY "Sustainable Use of the Transboundary
Ground-water Resources of the Guaraní Aquifer System in Paraguay" as part of the
Technical Cooperation Project (BMZ Project No. 1994.2029.0) which provides funds for
assistance and cooperation in order to cover know-how deficits in the geo-sector.

The SAG-PY project was planned to enhance the knowledge about the Guaraní Aquifer
System in Paraguay, including also results from the Guaraní Project at a later stage. In
addition, results and products from SAG-PY were foreseen to be incorporated into the
Guaraní Project as Paraguay's national contribution.

The SAG-PY project activities started in Asunción in May 2003, a few days after
launching the Guaraní Project in Montevideo. In November 2003 the BMZ agreed to
prolong the duration of the SAP-PY project by one year (from 3 to 4 years) in
correspondence with the current SAG-GEF project phase ending in 2007. After a further
synchronization with the schedule of the Guaraní Project, SAG-PY has been completed
in February 2009.

Let us hope that the spirit of cooperation and mutual understanding between the countries
and all partners will continue during the future transboundary aquifer resources manage-
ment, recognising the experiences from the Guaraní Project,


Yours sincerely,
