It would consist of: (i) a second stage of\n            sewerage for greater Tunis which would provide additional\n            treatment capacity and facilities to improve the existing\n            sewerage and stormwater systems to serve greater Tunis; (ii)\n            a component for Sfax which would complement existing\n            treatment capacity and extend and improve the\n            sewer/stormwater system; and (iii) technical assistance to\n            strenghthen the project planning and control capability of\n            ONAS. The main benefits of the proposed project would be\n            pollution control of the Lake of Tunis, increased access of\n            urban dwellers in the target group in Tunis and Sfax to\n            sewerage facilities with a decrease in health hazards\n            attributable to poor methods of waste disposal, and\n            institutional improvements for ONAS, the Sewage Authority."}, "docdt": "1979-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
