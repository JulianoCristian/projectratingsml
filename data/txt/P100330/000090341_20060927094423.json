Bangladesh Railway Reform\n            Programmatic Development Policy Credit will improve the\n            governance structure within which Bangladesh Railway (BR)\n            operates, addressing both governance relationship between\n            the Government of Bangladesh (GOB) and BR on the one hand,\n            and corporate governance and management structure within the\n            railways organization on the other. Improving governance of\n            Bangladesh Railway will contribute to the economic\n            development of Bangladesh by improving transport services,\n            government finances, and the investment climate in\n            Bangladesh. The implementation of the reform program will\n            help to (a) clarify relationship between GOB and BR and\n            increase BR's autonomy and accountability, (b) improve\n            corporate governance and management structure within BR so\n            that BR is more commercially and market oriented, and (c)\n            create an environment conducive to investment in railway\n            operations. These will in turn yield more efficient rail\n            operations and services to users, improve financial\n            performance, and provide the basis for a growing use of\n            railway system by business passengers."}, "docdt": "2006-09-20T00:00:00Z"}
