the northeast part of the\n            tsetse cleared zone; (ii) complete the eradication of tsetse\n            flies in the target area under the first project, implement\n            a second program, and prevent the infestation of additional\n            lands; (iii) ensure adequate disease prevention and control;\n            (iv) extend technical assistance contracts for staff to\n            complete the construction of and manage the two\n            slaughterhouses, and for a financial controller to improve\n            SODEPA's financial control capacity; by providing for a\n
