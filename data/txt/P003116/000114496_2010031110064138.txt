cofinancing  coordination,  and   in  monitoring  of  multi-agency
activities at the central,  regional, sub-regional and Health Zone
levels.
 
Part E:

For each payment  made  by  the  Borrower  out of the Special
Account, the Borrower shall furnish to the Association at the time
of any request for replenishment of the Special Account, or at the
request of the Association,  such  documents and other evidence as
the  Association  shall  reasonably  request,  showing  that  such
payment was made for eligible expenditures.
 
5.   (a)
Notwithstanding the provisions  of  paragraph
3
of this
Schedule, no further  deposit  into  the  Special Account shall be
made by the Association  when  either  of the following situations
first arises:

the  Association  shall  have  determined  that all
Page  11
further withdrawals should be  made by the Borrower
directly from the Credit Account in accordance with
the  provisions  of   Article   V  of  the  General
Conditions and  paragraph
(a)
of  Section
2.02 of
this Agreement; or
(ii)
the  total   unwithdrawn   amount   of  the  Credit
allocated to  the  eligible  Categories,  minus the
amount  of   any   outstanding  special  commitment
entered into by the Association pursuant to Section
5.02 of the General  Conditions with respect to the
Project, shall be equal  to the equivalent of twice
the amount of the Authorized Allocation.
 
(b)
Thereafter, withdrawal from  the  Credit  Account of the
remaining unwithdrawn  amount  of  the  Credit  shall  follow such
procedures as  the  Association  shall  specify  by  notice to the
Borrower.
Such further withdrawals shall be made only after and to
the extent that the Association shall have been satisfied that all
such amounts remaining on deposit in the Special Account as of the
date of  such  notice  will  be  utilized  in  making payments for
eligible expenditures.
 
6.   (a)
If the Association  shall  have  determined  at any time
that any payment out of the  Special Account: (i) was made for any
expenditure or in any amount  not eligible pursuant to paragraph
2
of this  Schedule;  or
(ii)
was  not  justified  by the evidence
furnished to the  Association,  the  Borrower shall, promptly upon
notice from the Association, deposit into the Special Account
(or,
if the Association shall so request, refund to the Association)
an
amount equal to the amount of  such payment or the portion thereof
not  so  eligible  or   justified.
No  further  deposit  by  the
Association into  the  Special  Account  shall  be  made until the
Borrower has made such deposit or refund.
 
(b)
If the Association  shall  have  determined  at any time
that any amount outstanding  in  the  Special  Account will not be
required to cover further  payments for eligible expenditures, the
Borrower shall, promptly upon  notice from the Association, refund
to the Association such  outstanding  amount  for crediting to the
Credit Account.
