The\n            project consists of four components: (a) development of an\n            Information, Education and Communication (IEC) program and\n            condom distribution; (b) integration of AIDS control\n            activities in existing health and social programs; (c)\n            operational research, including the development of a\n            surveillance system; and (d) institutional strengthening of\n            the National AIDS Control Program (NACP). All the components\n            are closely inter-related and mutually reinforcing, they aim\n            at making the NACP fully operational and effective as soon\n            as possible."}, "docdt": "1988-08-11T00:00:00Z"}
