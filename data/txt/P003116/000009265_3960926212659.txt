MEMORANDUM, AND RECOHMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPHENT ASSOCIATION TO
THE EXECUTmI DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO
THE REPUBLIC OF ZAIRE FOR
A NATIONAL AIDS CONTROL PROGRAM ASSISTANCE PROJECT
1.       The following report on a proposed development credit to Zaire for
SDR 6.2 million (US$8.1 million equivalent) is submitted for approval. The
proposed credit would be on standard IDA term3 with a maturity of 40 years
to help finance an AIDS Control Project. The project would be cofinanced
by several donors, including Belgium (US$1.5 million), Italy (US$1.2
million), Federal Republic of Germiany (US$0.6 million), USAID (US$1.7
million), EEC (US$2.0 million), UNDP (US$1.0 million), UNICEF (Us$1.5
million), and WHO (US$1.0 million); for a total of US.$10.5 million.
2.       Background.  The acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)
pandemic affects millions of people in more than 130 countries worldwide.
AIDS is a lethal disease caused by the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)
which depresses the immune system and causes the infected person to become
vulnerable to opportunistic infections. In Zaire, AIDS is mainly a
Sexually Transmitted Disease (STD) among individuals with multiple sexual
partners. Other STDs (through ulcers which facilitate the viral
penetration) increase the risk of transmission. Other routes of
transmission include transfusion of infected blood, contaminated skin-
piercing instruments and motner-to-child infection. Neither a cure nor a
vaccine is likely to be developed in the near future given the genetic
complexity of the virus. Measures aimed at preventing the spread of the
disease include the adoption of lower-risk sexual practices (limiting
number of partners, use of condoms) and enhanced hygiene in health system
(screening of all donated blood, sterilization of skin-piercing
instruments). In Kinshasa, seropositivityl rates are alarming. In 1987,
42 to 82 of the general population, 102 of females aged 15-29, and 30X of
all prostitutes were infected. The disease is spreading in most urban
areas of Zaire and also to communities located near main routes. At Mama-
Yemo Hospital (the largest hospital in Zaire, with 2,000 beds), 252 of the
medical/surgical patients test positive and 302 of the deaths are AIDS-
related. Those most afflicted with the disease (20-40 year olds) are at
the most productive age. Infants die also from AIDS. World Bank
projections indicate that if the transmission rate continues, the Infant
Mortality Rate (IMR) would increase from 120/1,000 to 140/1,000 by the year
2005, instead of being reduced to 70/1,000.   The financial consequences,
in terms of direct costs (the cost of treating opportunistic infections)
and indirect costs (productivity losses), will also be large. Zaire is
facing a very grave public health problem with severe human, social and
financial implications at a time when the country is already suffering from
severe economic difficulties. The Government has shown its commitment to
1/ Seropositivityt a positive blood test showing antibodies to HIV.



addressing this public health crisis by supporting the development of an
AIDS research project (Proiet SIDA) in 1984, establishing a National AIDS
committee in 1985, and producing with WH02 support, a National AIDS Control
Program (NACP) in 1987. In February 1988, the Government and WHOIGPA
organized a donors meeting that reviewed the NACP and helped prepare a
preliminary financing strategy based on donors' pledges.
3.       Proiect Objectives.  The overall objectives of the NACP (which the
project would support) are to: (a) prevent RIV transmission through: (i)
sexual behavior changes; (ii) wide availability and use of condoms; (iii)
adequate treatment of other STDs; (iv) donated blood screening; (v)
sterilization of skin-piercing instruments; and (vi) control of perinatal
HIV transmission; (b) reduce the impact of AIDS on individuals, families
and communities, through: (i) special assistance to AIDS cases and
seropositive patients; and (ii) information to and education of people in
contact with infected persons; and (c' improve the database on AIDS in
Zaire, through: (i) strengthening and developing the laboratory
infrastructure; (ii) developing the AIDS surveillance system; (iii)
improving the knowledge of AIDS-related behavior in the general population;
(iv) developing socio-economic surveys of AIDS impact; and (v) developing
operational research.
4.       Project Description.  The proposed project has four components:
.a) Information, Education and Communication (IEC) Program Development and
Condom Distribution through: (i) the development of IEC materials for the
media, schools, social sector personnel and other relevant target groups,
(ii) the training of health staff, social workers and teachers; (iii) the
strengthening of the IEC structure with additional staff, technical
assistance, equipment and vehicles; and (iv) the establishment of condom
distribution networks and condom promotion programs; (b) Integration of
AIDS Control Activities in Health and Social Proarams through: (i) the
establishment of large scale blood screening facilities and strategies;
(ii) sterilization of skin-piercing instruments; (iii) in-service training,
operational support and supervision for case management, STD detection and
treatment and IEC activities; and (iv) social programs at the community
level through both public sector programs and NGOs; (c) Ooerational
Research and Studies, dealing with: (i) contributing factors to HIV
transmission; (ii) sociocultural dimensions of AIDS; (iii) cost-
effectiveness of control measures; (iv) constraints on condom use; (v) case
management strategies; (vi) development of diagnosis tools; (vii) economic
impact of the disease; and (viii) the development of a national
surveillance system; and (d) Institutional Strengthening of the NACP
through: (i) support to the central coordination office by providing
additional staff, technical assistance, equipment and vehicles; (ii)
operational support to increase managerial capabilities at Regional, Sub-
Regional and Health Zone levels, with specific training/supervision,
equipment and additional operating funds; and (iii) establishment of
coordination mechanisms for AIDS control activities carried out by the
2! WHO, through its Global Program on AIDS (GPA), is the leading agency in
developing global control strategies and providing technical assistance
and short term financial support to national AIDS control programs.



- 3-
governmental and n-n-governmental sectors. Project activities would be
carried out by several agencies both public and non-governmental agencies,
which are active in the social sectors. The National AIDS Committee.
assisted by its Central Coordinating Office would provide overall guidance
and ensure coordination of all activities with the support of WHO/GPA and
UNDP. The project, to be carried out over three and ore-half years, would
provide funds for equipment, furniture, materials, vehicles, training,
technical assistance, studies, research, evaluation and incremental
recurrent costs. The total cost of the project is estimated at US$21.9
million, with a foreign exchange component of US$17.8 million (812). A
breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amount
and methods of procurement and the disbursement schedule are shown in
Schedule B. Bank Group operations in Zaire are given in Schedules C and D,
respectively. A map is attached. The Staff Appraisal Report, No. 7260-ZR,
dated August 11, 1988, is also attached.
5.       Rationale for IDA involvement.  Large-scale emergency efforts are
required to: (a) make the NACP fully operational; (b) assist the Government
in reallocating resources between ongoing health activities and AIDS
control activities; and (c) coordinate donor support both financially and
technically. In all these areas the World Bank could play an important
role, given: (a) its expertise in large national programs, financial
management, and broad-baseu economic analysis; and (b) its leading role in
aid coordination as chairman of the Consultative Group. In addition, IDA's
involvement would: (a) help ensure, through our continuing dialogue about
the health sector, that AIDS control activities are fully integrated into
the national health programs, and (b) make it easier for Zaire and WHO/GPA
to mobilize and to organize the necessary cofinancing.
6.       Agreed Actions.  The following actions to be taken by the
Government would be conditions of project effectiveness: (a) establishment
of the Special Accounts (IDA revolving funds and project advance account);
(b) appointment, as the central coordinating office's deputy director, of a
specialist in health program management with qualifications and experience
satisfactory to IDA; and (c) appointment, as the Central Coordinating
Office's chief accountant, of an accountant with qualifications and
experience satisfactory to IDA. Other agreements would include: (a) annual
submission to IDA of project operation plans; and (b) annual project
performance review, including project management, to be submitted to IDA.
7.       Justification.  The proposed project would respond to a public
health crisis which has already a negative impact on health status, health
systems, health financing and the work force and has the potential for
causing severe human and economic losses in an already poverty-stricken
country. The project would contribute to: (a) establishing key preventive
measures aiming at protecting the most vulnerable segments of the
population (10-14 year olds and women in reproductive age); (b)
rationalizing the packaging of AIDS control measures; (c) making the NACP
fully operational and institutionally sound; and (d) a better understanding
of the AIDS epidemic, and ways to control it. The project would represent
the first phase of a long-term effort aimed at protecting the majority of



the population from HIV infection. Benefits would include: (a) health
benefits by (i) reducing the impact of AIDS on morbidity and mortality in
both adults and children; (ii) contributing to the control of STDs; (ili)
assisting the health systems in coping with AIDS patients; and Civ)
avoiding a major imbalance in resource allocation between priority public
health programs; (b) social benefits by providing a safety net for the
poorest families which otherwise would not have the means to take care of
AIDS patients and lose family income earners; and (c) economic benefits by
diminishing, through the reduction of HIV transmission, the direct
(treatment) and indirect (loss of productivity) costs of AIDS.
8.       Risks. The project's main risk concerns the weak managerial
capability of DOH, particularly with regard to the complexity of the
control program. The project is designed to address this risk by
distributing manage.-ial responsibilities among various implementing
entities and several coordinating/monitoring committees. In addition, the
project's institutional strengthening component would provide training,
technical assistance and operational support aimed at developing planning
and managerial capabilities at both the central and peripheral levels.
Finally WHO and UNDP will play a key role in monitoring project
implementation. The second risk is related to the experimental nature of
the control measures. Some control activities may not have the expected
impact on HIV transmission. The various project-supported operational
research programs are designed to respond to this uncertainty and to help
adjust the NACP as necessary. The third risk concerns the potential for
financing shortfalls in the long term. it is likely that the AIDS epidemic
will be a long-term problem in Zaire and there is a risk of donor fatigue
in financing the NACP. A joint coordinating and monitoring committee
(Government, WHO, UNDP, and other major donors) has been created to address
this risk.
9.       Recommendations.  I am satisfied that the proposed credit would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that
the Executive Directors approve the proposed credit.
