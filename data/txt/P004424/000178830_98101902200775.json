domestic consumption through supervised\n            credit to be administered by DBP. It would provide credit to\n            individuals and companies over a 4-year period to develop\n            (i) marine fisheries by financing the construction of\n            fishing vessels, slipways, and ice-making facilities and the\n            purchase of fish carriers and equipment; and (ii) inland\n            fisheries by financing the construction, rehabilitation and\n            improvement of fish ponds. The project also includes\n            technical assistance to provide a marine specialist, a naval\n            architect and an aquaculture extension expert to help\n            prepare a fish marketing study and a smallholder fish-pond project."}, "docdt": "1973-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
