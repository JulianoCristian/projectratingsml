PHILIPPINES
FISHERIES CREDIT PROJECT
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        This report appraises a credit project for development of the
marine and inland fisheries sector in the Republic of the Philippines, for
which a Bank loan of US$11.6 million equivalent is proposed. The project
was prepared by the Government with assistance from the FAO/IBRD Coopera-
tive Program. Total cost, over 4-year investment period, is estimated at
US$18.5 million, of which US$8.35 million, or 45%, represent foreign ex-
change requirements. The Bank loan would cover 50% of total cost for the
inland fisheries component and foreign exchange requirements of the other
items. The Bank's participation would thus be 63% of total project costs.
The continuing need to rehabilitate fish ponds after the catastrophic floods
in 1972 strengthens the general case for local cost financing in the
Philippines.
ii.       Although fisheries contributes only 4% to GNP, it is an important
economic activity in the Philippines. The archipelago with over 7,000
islands provides excellent access to fishing grounds and a natural framework
for productive marine fisheries and the coastline with its many estuarine
areas is ideal for brackish water fish farming. Fisheries employ directly
about 700,000 persons (about 5.5% of total labor force) mainly in the
traditional sector.- Further, fish is a staple in the Filipino diet and
provides about half of animal protein intake - more than milk, eggs and meat
combined. Fish imports for human consumption, mainly canned mackerel from
Japan, stand now at a value of US$18.4 million per annum and demand for
marine products is growing rapidly. Government aims at self-sufficiency in
fish production and the proposed project would help meet that objective.
iii.      The proposed project would be executed by the Development Bank of
the Philippines (DBP) and provide credit to individuals and companies for
(a) the construction of fishing vessels, ice plants and simple slipways for
vessel repair and maintenance; (b) purchase of fish-carriers and vessel
equipment to improve fishing operations; and (c) rehabilitation and improve-
ment of flood-damaged fish ponds and development of other fish ponds. It
would also finance the employment of a marine specialist and a naval architect
to design, and assist with procurement and construction, of the fishing
vessels, and an aquaculture extension expert to help train the inland fisheries
extension services and DBP's-st£ff. Financing would also be provided for
coiisul'tant-:-Fo '-assist 'wiith preparation of a future fish marketing and a
smallholder fish pond project.
iv.       Government, as borrower, would on-lend about US$11 million of the
Bank loan to DBP to be used for relending to beneficiaries. The loan would
be at the Bank's interest rate of 7-1/4% and for 17 years, including 6 years'
grace. DBP would supplement the Bank's funds with about US$4.2 million and



subborrowers would provide about US$2.6 million from their own resources to
meet total project investment costs. The balance of the Bank loan of about
US$0.6 million, supplemented by US$130,000 from Government's resources, would
remain with the Government to assist financing the training program and
future project preparation. On average, beneficiaries would contribute 14%
of investment requirements; Government and DBP, 23%; and the Bank, 63%. The
interest rate for subloans would be 12% per annum on medium- and long-term
loans of 5 to 13 years including 1 to 3 years of grace.
v.        Procurement for project vessels would be separated into (i) hull
procurement and (ii) procurement of equipment, such as engines, fishing gear,
electronic and other equipment. Since the beneficiaries must have fisheries
experience, they will usually own several vessels and therefore operation,
maintenance and standardization requirements become dominant considerations.
These requirements common to credit projects cannot be achieved under bidding
procedures for fully equipped vessels. DBP's naval architect would therefore
establish performance and design criteria for the fishing vessel hull and
equipment items for each of the two categories of project vessels. However,
the make of the specific equipment items would be subjected to the individual's
choice. It would be ordered from suppliers previously qualified through
international advertisement. The equipment thus procured would be installed
on hulls procured from pre-qualified local shipyards following competitive
bidding. To the extent practicable, bulking of sub-loan components would
be arranged by DBP. In this way, requirements of individual operators will
be accommodated without foregoing the economies through large-scale orders
from suppliers and shipyards for procurement of the project vessels.
Second-hand fish carriers would be procured from outside the Philippines through
advertising vessel specifications in potential suppliers' countries and
allowing subborrowers to choose from lists containing surveyed and suitable
carriers. Turnkey contracts for construction of ice-making facilities and
slipways would be awarded after international competitive bidding. Sub-
borrowers would procure equipment for vessel improvement through normal trade
channels because of the need to match and complement existing equipment.
Formal bidding procedures for fish pond rehabilitation and development would
not be appropriate because subloans are small and numerous, individual needs
vary, sites are scattered and the simple construction work would be mainly
performed by manual labor often provided by the operators themselves. Fish
pond operators would therefore make arrangements, approved by DBP, with
labor or contractors in their area to carry out such work.
vi.       Government considers the Fisheries Project a most important
effort in its general plan to increase fish production for domestic con-
sumption.  Implementation of the project would directly increase the major
source of animal protein in the Philippines by about 48,000 tons per annum
representing about 5% of present fish production. Furthermore, the project
would benefit about 1,100 subborrowers and their dependents, provide about
2,400 permanent positions for unskilled and semiskilled fishermen and labor
and employ about 4,000 unskilled labor per annum during the 4-year development
period. Better knowledge of marine resources through intensified research,



- iii -
demonstration effects from improved operations, training of extension staff,
sound lending practices and future project preparation would have a significalt
effect on further development of this important sector.
vii.      Financial rates of return to beneficiaries would be attractive and
the overall economic rate of return is estimated at 34% with a rate of 22%
for the marine fisheries and 43% for the inland fisheries component. The
rate of return calculations for the marine fislheries component include a
corresponding part of the investment and operating costs for the new fisheries
harbor (Navotas) to be constructed outside of this project. Without these
stupplementing investments the rate of return would be 28% for this component,
The very attractive rate for fish farming results from costs already sunk prior
to rehabilitation and improvements of fish ponds under the project. If all
ponds were to be newly constructed the rate of return would be 23% for this
component.
viii.     The project would be suitable for a Bank loan of US$11.6 million,
for a term of 17 years including a grace period of 6 years. Government would
be the borrower and would assume the foreign exchange risk.






PHILIPPINES
FISHERIES CREDIT PROJECT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The proposed project would be the eighth for agricultural develop-
ment in the Philippines 1/, but the first exclusively for the fisheries sub-
sector. It would form part of the Government's fisheries development program
and, over a 4-year investment period, assist marine and inland fisheries.
It would provide fishing vessels, fish carriers, vessel improvements and
supporting facilities, rehabilitate flood-damaged fish ponds and develop
other fish ponds. In addition, a fish marketing and smallholder fish pond
study would assist future development of the fisheries sector. Government
would be the borrower and the Development Bank of the Philippines (DBP) the
executing agency. Intensified marine research, training of extension staff
and future project preparation would be the responsibility of Government.
1.02      Generally, the Bank's experience with other agricultural projects
has been satisfactory. About US$100,000 remains to be disbursed under
Loan 393-PH (Agricultural Education), and Loan 432-PH (First Rural Credit)
has been fully disbursed. After an initial slow start, mainly caused through
economic adjustments following the 1970 Peso devaluation, Loan 607-PH (Second
Rural Credit) is moving ahead. Implementation under Loan 637-PH (Upper
Pampanga River) has been very satisfactory. Progress under Loan 720-PH (Rice
Processing) has so far not been satisfactory; subloan demand for integrated
rice processing facilities has been less than expected because of increased
cost of imported equipment and rice shortages caused by floods and crop
diseases. This has basically changed the economics of the industry since
appraisal, when it was considered that rice self-sufficiency in reach during
1969/70 would continue and domestic and export markets would demand improved
quality. The project's scope has now been expanded to include rehabilitation
of existing rice processing facilities and consideration is being given to
financing processing facilities for other grains as well. This is expected
to improve project performance. Loan 823-PH (Livestock) and Credit 349-PH
(Second Education) are just getting underway.
1.03      The project now being appraised was prepared with the assistance of
the PAO/IBRD Cooperative Program which visited the Philippines in January/
February 1972. The appraisal mission assisted the Government in reformulating
1!   393-PH, 1964, US$6 million for expansion of the University of the
Philippines (UP);
432-PH, 1965, US$5 million for first rural credit project;

the request to change the emphasis from large-scale to smaller, though viable,
operators who find it particularly difficult to obtain finance.
1,04      This report is based on findings of an appraisal mission, composed
of Messrs. P. Pohland, F. Kada, A. Seth (Bank) and L. Svoboda and T. Yamamoto
(Consultants), which visited the Philippines in November 1972. Mr. K. Sallner
(Loan Officer) assisted the mission during appraisal.
II. THE FISHERIES SECTOR -
Contribution to the Economy
2.01      In the Philippines three main components are recognized within the
sector: the marine fisheries, divided into commercial (marine fisheries)
and municipal (traditional fisheries), and the inland fisheries (fish pond
operations). Total fisheries production has been estimated at about 1.0
million (1970) tons per annum of which commercial fisheries supply about
37%, municipal 53%, and fish ponds 10%. Government estimates that fisheries
accounted for about 4% of GNP in recent years (in constant 1967 prices) and
roughly about 13% of the agricultural sector. Employment has been
estimated at about 700,000 persons (about 5.5% of total employment) most of
whom are subsistence fishermen. Fish and other marine products are a staple
in the Filipino diet and annual per capita consumption of 28.3 kg is high
compared to other countries. It is estimated that marine products provide
about half of the animal protein consumed in the Philippines. Exports consist
of shrimp and tuna (valued at US$5.4 million in 1971), while imports (valued
at US$20.2 million in 1971) are mainly canned mackerel from Japan (favored in
the interior where fresh fish is not available) and fishmeal from Peru.
Commercial Marine Fisheries
2.02      The commercial fishing fleet comprises an estimated 2,200 vessels
ranging from about 3 CT to over 100 GT. By law, their activities are
restricted to waters deeper than 12.6 m (7 fathoms). This fleet is operated
by some 1,500 fishing vessel owners. The fleet is mainly based in the Greater
Manila area (Navotas) and around the Visayan Sea, and is diversified as to
vessel size and type of gear. However, the number of larger and more spe-
cialized vessels (over 70 GT) has increased in recent years and is presently
estimated at 524, of which 217 are trawlers (1970). The proposed project
would provide these vessels which are in high demand by operators (para 3.04).
2.03      Commercial fisheries production has been estimated at about
380,000 tons in 1971. Trawl and purse-seine operations account for about
1/   Background on the agricultural sector is provided in the "Agricultural
Sector Review", Report No. 39-PH; September 6, 1972 while the economic
background is provided in "Current Economic Position and Prospects of
the Philippines", Report No. EAP-30a; May 10, 1972. An IBRD Economic
mission is currently preparing the new economic report.



-3-
70% of total catch. Four of the some 68 species which are commercially
caught account for about two-thirds of total production: round scad (40%)
slipmouth, sardines (18%) and chub mackerel (6%). Principal fishing grounds
are the Sulu Sea with 58% of total production, the Visayan Sea (24%) and
Maaiila Bay (5%). Project vessels would fish generally in the same areas
but in deeper fishing grounds with their improved equipment. See Annex 1
for further details.
2.04      FAQ estimated the potential annual catch from territorial waters
at about 1.65 million tons or almost double the estimated present catch.
According to these estimates, the commercial catch represents about 40% of
the potential. These crude judgments suggest that there is sufficient
development potential for the commercial fleet for the proposed project but
the lack of resource data is seriously hampering a rational long-term fishery
development policy and the proposed use of existing research vessels (para
2.14) would improve knowledge of marine resources and provide a basis for
future expansion. See Annex 1 for details.
Municipal Fisheries
2.05      Production from municipal fisheries, largely for subsistence,
account for about 540,000 tons per annum in fisheries statistics. This
fishery uses traditional craft (Bancas), operating near the shore. Bancas
are generally non-mechanized and employ traditional fishing methods. It is
estimated that about 80% of resources accessible to them is being exploited.
Efforts are now being undertaken to organize these subsistence fishermen
into cooperative societies and to use credit facilities of the rural banking
system (pars 2.17).
Inland Fisheries
2.06      Inland fisheries production from fish ponds has been estimated
at about 100,000 tons per annum; primarily milkfish (Bangus) for domestic
consumption. Annual yields of 570 kg/ha compare with 300 in Indonesia and
1,700 in Taiwan. However, research results show that, with improved pond
design, appropriate fertilization, pest control and intensive management of
fish populations, yields could reach 2,000 kg/ha or more per annum, but for
project purposes annual yields of 1,200 kg/ha, after a 5-year development
period, have been assumed. In general, fish pond operators enclose larger
areas (about 25 ha and above) with main dykes but, in the beginning, operate
only modules of about 10 ha and develop the remaining area subsequently.
Ore 10-ha module can be operated by family labor but hired labor is required
for larger areas.
2.07      In 1971, registered fish pond area covered some 170,000 ha (includ-
ing 6,000 ha fish water ponds). In 1972 severe floodings damaged about
13,000 ha in the Central Luzon area, most of which has been repaired, but
about 4,500 ha remain under make-shift arrangements operating at much
reduced yields. About half of the total fish pond area is leased from Gov-
ernment under long-term arrangements (up to 25 years, renewable for another
25 years) and the remainder is privately owned. Potentially, the fish pond



-4-
area could be expanded about threefold, judging from the swampland classified
as suitable for fish pond development. However, lack of infrastructure
(roads and distribution facilities) and distance from major markets reduces
this potential.
2.08      Fresh water pond culture is not yet common in the Philippines
and the technical base and management are not as well developed as for
brackish water ponds. However a research program, covering catfish cultiva-
tion, is expected to introduce modern cultivation techniques. Shrimp cul-
tivation is presently under active consideration by several research stations,
but commercial application is not expected in the near future. See Annex 2
for details on inland fisheries.
Shore Facilities
2.09      Fishing ports are not in operation as yet in the Philippines.
Even at Navotas (Greater Manila), which receives 70% of the landings, fish
is presently discharged by amphibious trucks from fishing vessels anchored
off-shore. However, a project to develop Navotas into a fishing port is
estimated to become operational in 1975 and would greatly facilitate fish
marketinig for the major consumption area. An FAO/IBRD Cooperative Program
M4ission visited the Philippines in 1972 to investigate the potential for
additional fishing port facilities. While the estimated fish landings may not
justify investments in further fishing port facilities at present, there is
an outstanding need for improvement and construction of marketing and
distribution facilities. Existing ice-making facilities, transport equipment,
cold storage facilities, auction halls and the like, are inadequate and any
large-scale increase in fish production would require expansion and provision
of new facilities (Annex 1).
2.10      Presently, there are about 33 shipyards in the Philippines, mainly
concentrated around Manila. Five to eight of these are capable of steel
vessel construction (up to sizes of 1,000 GT), while the remainder specialize
in repair and maintenance and in wooden vessel construction. Repair and main-
tenance facilities for the fishing fleet based around Manila appear adequate;
there is, however, a serious lack of slipways and simple repair and main-
tenance facilities in the southern part of the Philippines to the extent
that even the existing fleet cannot be properly served there.
Marketing
2.11      The fish production is almost entirely consumed domestically in
fresh condition. Because storage capacity is limited, fresh fish is con-
sumed daily and any surplus over daily requirements is sold immediately at
considerable discount for drying and smoking and subsequent retailing in
inland areas. Attempts to establish canneries have not been successful be-
cause raw-material prices have not allowed competition with imported canned
mackerel from Japan.
2.12      In Navotas, a form of auction prevails under which bids are
"whispered" to a few large fish brokers, so that actual transaction prices



are difficult to obtain. Fish brokers operate on commission selling fish
to wholesalers either on behalf of fishing operators or middlemen, who, in
turn, have bought the fish in some other landing center and transported it
to Manila. Further details on markets are presented in paras 5.02 through
5.04.
Extension, Education and Research
2.13      Inland fisheries research and extension services are provided
primarily by the Bureau of Fisheries (BOF). The College of Fisheries,
University of the Philippines (UP), also conducts research. Although BOF
has a large staff and its facilities are reasonably well developed, the
quality and effectiveness of its service need improvement, especially in
the inlah.d fisheries sector. Discussions between BOF and UP are currently
being held to set up a training program for BOF's extension services with
UP providing the facilities. This program together with the proposed provi-
sion of an aquaculture extension expert (paragraph 3.12) would be particularly
timely since it is proposed to use BOF's extension staff to guide and counsel
potential subborrowers in the inland fisheries sector (para 4.05).
2.14      The establishment of a marine Fisheries Training Center with UNDP
assistance is presently under discussion. This center would provide on-the-
job training for captains and fishermen in modern equipment and fishing
gear. Further training is being provided by UP and numerous fisheries schools.
BOF itself operates four training vessels which are used to demonstrate
improved fishing techniques, and to undertake experimental fishing surveys
and explorations. The recent addition of two more research vessels would
provide the means to conduct test fishing programs to determine the marine
resource base more accurately. Agreement has been reached during negotiations
that BOF would discuss and carry out a test fishing program mutually satis-
factory to the Bank and the Government.
2.15      Available statistics are not too useful for fisheries policy
formulation. There are uncertainties with regard to resources, production
and consumption. However, the 1971 Census will provide revised data for
the inland fisheries sector and abolition of the "fish-caught-fee" might
lead to much more accurate catch reporting and the proposed test fishing
programs would improve overall knowledge of the marine resources. Further,
Government assisted by the Ford Foundation is presently conducting consumption
pattern and marketing studies for fish and fish products, which would result
in more information regarding these aspects.
Fisheries Credit
2.16      The most important institutional sources for medium- and long-term
credit are the Rural Banking System (privately-owned and supervised by the
Central Bank), the Development Bank of the Philippines and commercial banks.
Non-institutional credit includes traders, equipment suppliers and oil
companies; however, due to a tight credit situation the importance of non-
institutional credit has declined and credit funds for fisheries development
are very scarce.



-6-
2.17      The rural banks have played a major role in short-term fisheries
financing, especially for inland fisheries, but a minor role in financing
medium- and long-term fisheries development, although financing (about
US$1.3 million) had been provided under Bank Loan 607-PH for the very small
operators. Disbursements have been slow so far but are improving through
promotional efforts and provision of technical assistance for project ap-
praisal. Commercial banks have also been an important source of short-term
financing, mainly for marine fisheries. However, DBP has been the major
source of medium- and long-term financing for fisheries development. Up
to June 30, 1972 loans to fisheries amounted to 1 137.4 million (US$20.3 mil-
lion (para 4.02).
Fisheries Administration
2.18      In November 1972, Government issued a Fisheries Presidential Decree
(No. 43) to provide policy guidance and to coordinate and delineate the
various activities of the participating agencies of the industry. An
important feature is the creation of the Fishery Industry Development Council
to formulate development policies for the industry. Overall responsibility
for policy coordination is vested in the Department of Agriculture and
Natural Resources, while BOF, as a Directorate under the Department, has the
primary responsibility for policy implementation. As a result, BOF's functions
include coordination of training, research and extension as well as administration
and regulation. The only major function outside BOF relates to extension
of credit, although the decree envisages the establishment of a development fund
to provide finance for special programs not yet defined in detail.
2.19      For administrative purposes, ten fisheries regions have been
established in 1972, although most statistics still refer to the former
eight regions. Each region has a Regional Office which supervises fisheries
demonstration and research stations in that region. In 1972 BOF's staff
totalled over 1,600. Of these, about 450 were employed on inland fisheries
extension and 265 on the improvement of the marine fisheries sector.
Development Policies
2.20      Government places high emphasis on increasing fish production
above the estimated present production of 1.0 million tons per year. Although
the base for fishery statistics is poor (para 2.15), crude estimates of
marine resources and research results of inland fisheries, together with a
growing demand for fresh fish (para 5.01), suggest a substantial expansion
potential. However, requirements for rapid and sustained growth of the
fishery sector would be: (a) improved knowledge of the resource base to
formulate a rational fishery policy, including sound investment criteria,
(b) additional investments in supporting infrastructure, and (c) improved
extension services, especially for inland fisheries. The proposed project
has been designed to help meet these requirements.



III. THE PROJECT
A. General Description
3.01      '"iThe objctive of the proposed project is to assist Governmcnt.
straterv (a) to increase fish production for domestic consumption, (b) to
remove constraints hampering lon g-term development of this sector, and (c)
prepare projects suitable for external iinancing.  The project would, theru
fore, concentrate on further development of viable small- and medium--sized
commercial operations and on rehabilitaticn and improvement of recently
flood-danaged fish ponds. The marine fisheries component would increase
commercial fisheries production by about 34,000 tons per annum at full
development, while the inland fisheries component would restore about 3,0J2;
tons of production lost through typhoon damiage and increase Tnilkfish precdc-
tion by about 11,000 tons per annum. The project would also improve the
knowledge of marine resources thlrough the use of existing research vessel!;.
strengthen extension services through a training program and initroduce  
lending practices.  Finally, the studies on fish marketing and distribuLion
and smallholder fish ponds would prepare investment programs for future
expansion of the fisheries sector.
3.02      Specifically, over a 4-year investment period, the project woul
(a)  provide credit to individuals and companies in the marine
fisheries sector for:
(i)  construction of 15 steel and 45 wooden fully
equipped fishing vessels;
(ii) procurement of 10 second-hand fish carriers to
increase fishing efficiency;
(iii) construction of three ice-making facilities and two
simple slipways to support fishing operations; and
(iv) procurement of vessel and fisheries equipment to
improve existing fishing operations;
(b) provide credit to individuals in the inland fisheries
sector for:
(i)  rehabilitation of 4,500 ha of flood-damaged fish
ponds to restore production to previous levels;
(ii) improvement of 7,400 ha of existing fish ponds
through introduction of improved pond layouts and
cultivation techniques; and
(iii)  construction of 100 ha of fresh water ponds;



(c) provide technical assistance and training including:
(i)  ai marine specialist and a naval architect to assist DBPts
Fisheries Group in design and procurement of fishing
vessels; fish carriers and equipment; and
(ii)  an aquaculture extension expert to assist the Bureau
of Fisheries in upgrading its extension service for
milkfish cultivration and in further training DBP's
technicaL appraisal staff.
In additiona  the project would include:
(d)  a fish marketing and distribtalon study (by consultanlts)
to prepare specific recommenidations for investment i.n
this field; and
(e) a study (by consultants) to prepare specific recommenda-
tions for investmients in a smallholder fish pond project.
3.03     'lie responsibility for credit operat-.ons would be vested in DBP,
throuc;h tne Fisheries Group (FG) wiihi.n its Agricultural Projects Department.
.C would be suitably organized and Os:  nt,haned (para 4.03) tD implement
the project. Its staff would be supported and assisted by BOF's extension
staff, particularly in preparing techn:ical appraisals in the inland fisheries
sector. Technical appraisals for marine oDerations would be assisted by the
marine specialist attached to FG. The Government, with the assistance of
consultants, would be responsible for preparing the fish marketing and the
sniallholder fish pond projects.
B. Detailed Features
5.04      Fishing Vessels. The proposed project would provide credit to
finance 60 fishing vessels, of which 15 would be of the 130-GT class, and
45 of the 70-GT class.  The 130-GT vessels would have a steel hull with
an overall length of about 28 m, be powered by a diesel engine of about 750
hp, and carry a crew of 17. The 70-GT vessels would have a wooden hull with
an overall length of about 24 m, be powered by diesel engine of about 336 hp,
ane'  -_y a crew of 15.  Both types would be equipped with trawl fishing gear,
shc'_-wave radios, fish finders, and mechanical net hauling gear.  DBP's naval
architect woculd provide the final design and specifications in cooperation
with representatives of potential subborrowers. Average investment, including
incremental wor1king capital, would be f 1.2 million (US$180,000) for the
larger vessel and ? 0.4 million (US$59,000) for the smaller one. Vessels of
comparable size and similar equipment are operated and they are in great
demand by operators.  General descriptions, outline drawings and specifications
appear in Annex 3. Agreement has been reached during negotiations that the
Bank would approve the final design and specifications of the vessel types
prior to construction.



-9-
3.05      Fish Carriers.  Present fish carriers are simple second-hand
vessels, mostly former fishing vessels from abroad, with no refrigeration or
sophisticated equipment which is quite adequate for their operations. The
project would provide credit to finance 10 second-hand fish carriers at a
cost of about half of that if constructed specifically for this purpose.
The carriers would be not more than 8 years old, have sufficient insulated
fish holds (not less than 75 tons) and a carrying capacity to support and
improve fishing operations. Most operators in Manila are fairly distant
from principal fishing grounds and either use their own or hire carriers to
supply their vessels at the fishing grounds and transport fish to the markets.
One carrier usually serves two to three vessels depending on the fishing
season.
3.06      Ice-Making Facilities.  The proposed project would provide credit
to finance three ice-plants expected to be located around the Visayan Sea.
Each facility would cost on average r 1.4 million (US$206,000) and have a
capacity of 30-tons block ice per day. The cost estimates assume that
facilities would generate their own electricity, be equipped with ice-crushers,
and serve about 20 fishing vessels each. Combined capacity of two plants
would be adequate to provide sufficient ice for the proposed fleet expansion
in the Visayan Sea. One plant would provide ice to the existing fleet.
Larger fishing operators or local companies would operate these facilities.
Local consultants engaged by the sub-borrower will prepare the detailed design,
layout and engineering of these facilities (para 3.07).
3.07      Slipways.  Although studies are in progress to establish simple
repair and maintenance facilities on the Visayan Sea, there are no special-
ized facilities at present to serve the fishing fleet based there. Vessels
in need of repair are beached at high tide and repairs carried out at low
tide. The proposed project would provide credit for two facilities estimated
to cost t 0.35 million (US$50,000) each, consisting of marine railways on
which fishing vessels would be pulled up for servicing. They would be
operated by local companies and be capable of servicing vessels up to 150 GT.
In the Philippines a number of qualified local engineering consultants,
familiar with these comparatively simple constructions, are available. During
negotiations, agreement has been reached that DBP would cause sub-borrowers
to hire competent consultants, on terms and conditions acceptable to the
Bank, to prepare design, layout, detailed engineering under turnkey arrange-
ments for ice plant and slipway construction.
3.08      Vessel Improvements.  The use of modern fishing techniques and
equipment is increasing but lack of finance is hampering rapid progress.
The proposed credit for improvements would provide finance to replace obsolete
machinery, such as net drums, winches, power blocks, generators, transmissions
and to add complementary equipment such as short-wave radios, echo-sounders,
and fish finders. BOF estimates that about 100 vessels would require such
improvements for more efficient operations. Average costs are estimated at
about ' 50,000 (US$7,500) and DBP's marine specialist would be consulted on
the suitability of the proposed equipment in each individual case.



- 10 -
3.09      Rehabilitation of Flood-damaged Fish Ponds.  The 1972 typhoon
damaged about 13,000 ha of fish ponds mainly in the Central Luzon area.
Although Government financial assistance was provided for the most urgent
repairs, it is estimated that about 4,500 ha still remain under make-shift
arrangements with a much reduced production level (Annex 3). The proposed
project would therefore assist by providing credit for rehabilitating these
ponds to restore production to former levels and increase production through
improved layouts and cultivation techniques. Average investment is estimated
at ? 2,000 (US$300) per hectare.
3.10      Development of Fish Ponds.  The proposed project would provide
finance to improve about 7,400 ha of established fish ponds and to construct
100 ha new fresh water ponds. This first phase has been based on credit
demand, the availability of banking services, provision of extension staff
to guide operations, and construction labor available in areas with easy
access to major consumption centers (Annex 3). Demand for fresh water ponds
is limited but new cultivation techniques might increase demand later (para
2.08). Their inclusion would therefore provide DBP with valuable experience
for a future expanded program. Average investments would be f 5,000 (US$740)
per hectare for development and f 7,000 (US$1,030) per hectare for construction
of fresh water ponds.
3.11      Technical Assistance.  A marine specialist and a naval architect would
be engaged by DBP and assigned to the Fisheries Group of DBP.  The naval
architect would assist in determining the final detailed specifications of the
two standard fishing vessels and pre-qualify suppliers and shipyards. The
marine specialist would prepare tender documents for local competitive bidding
for the vessel hulls, and coordinate procurement and installation of equipment
to be installed at prequalified shipyards. Periodically, the marine specialist
would visit the shipyards to ensure that construction conformed to contract
standards. Furthermore, he would design a suitable basis for international
competition to procure the 10 second-hand carriers. Be would also evaluate
the proposed vessel and gear improvements. A general work plan for these
experts appears in Annex 4. The employment of the marine specialist and the
naval architect, with qualifications and experience and on terms and conditions
acceptable to the Bank, is a condition of effectiveness.
3.12      Training.  An aquaculture extension expert would be engaged by
the Bureau of Fisheries (BOF) to assist in training its key extension
personnel and DBP's appraisal staff in the inland fisheries sector. About
100 trainees would receive training over a period of 2-1/2 years in the
University of the Philippines (College of Fisheries, Inland Fisheries
Project) in Los Banos and Iloilo City. The research staff working in these
facilities would also be available to assist in lecturing on specialized
subjects. Overseas training would be provided to five or six most promising
trainees to deepen their knowledge and provide a nucleus of instructors
after the expert's assignment expires. A general outline of the expert's
qualifications, work plan and training objectives appears in Annex 5.
Agreement has been reached during negotiations that a training program,
acceptable to the Bank, for BOF's key extension and DBP's staff in the
inland fisheries sector would be carried out; and that an aquaculture extension



expert, with qualifications and experience and on terms and conditions
acceptable to the Bank, would be employed.
3.13      Future Project Preparation.  A qualified consulting firm would be
engaged by Government to make specific recommendations towards an invest-
ment program for a fish marketing and distribution system, including high
priority proposals for the major consumption areas. An outline of the
proposed study, which is expected to last about 18 months, is in Annex 6.
Agreement has been reached during negotiations that Government would hire
within six months after the signing of the loan a qualified consulting firm,
on terms and conditions acceptable to the Bank, to perform the study.
3.14      A feasibility study of a smallholder fish pond (brackish water)
project would be financed under the project. The one-year study would
include detailed recommendations on the implementation of such a project.
An outline of such a study is in Annex 7. During negotiations agreement has
been reached that Government would hire within six months of the signing of
the loan, a suitable consulting firm, on terms and conditions acceptable to
the Bank, to perform the study.
C. Project Implementation Schedule
3.15      The project would be implemented over a four-year period as shown
in Annex 8. The development period for individual investments ranges from
one to five years. Full development would be reached eight years after
project commencement.
D. Cost Estimates
3.16      Total project cost is estimated at f 125.4 million (US$18.5 million),
of which 45%, or Y 56.6 million (US$8.4 million) would be foreign exchange.
Detailed unit cost estimates are presented in Annex 9 and summarized below.

3.17      Cost estimates are based on 1972 manufacturer's or builder's prices
including freight, insurance and installation costs.  Import duties or other
levies are not included since fisheries is a "preferred industry" and re-
gistration with the Board of Investments (para 4.06) exempts potential sub-
borrowers from import duties. A 16% contingency has been added to meet an
expected 5% annual inflation on both local and foreign cost items over the
4-year disbursement period. This rate is based on estimated domestic infla-
tion and inflation in the expected supplier's countries. Funds to finance
the technical assistance and training component have been included, although



- 13 -
Government and DBP are actively seeking bilateral assistance. Any savings
on these items would be used for further fisheries development.

Percent of Total   14%    22%   1%   63%  100%
3.19      On average, sub-borrowers would contribute about 14% of invest-
ment requirements, including incremental working capital. However, individual
contributions in the marine fisheries sector would be not less than 20%, and
for inland fisheries they would range from 5 to 15%, with the small and
medium-sized operations contributing less (para 4.10). Most of the invest-
ment in marine fisheries would be made to sub-borrowers owning less than five
vessels, while small and medium-sized fish pond operations (less than 50 ha)
would require the bulk of investments in inland fisheries. 'Incremental
working capital is essential to bridge the time between start of operations
and sales. It is usually provided from commercial banks. However, at
present such funds are very difficult to obtain. Financing arrangements,



- 14 -
therefore, stipulate that incremental working capital would be provided
partly from sub-borrowers and partly from DBP if not available from other
sources (para 4.07). Agreement to this effect has been reached during nego-
tiations.
3.20      The proposed Bank loan would contribute US$11.6 million, or 63%
of total project costs. It would cover 50% of total cost of inland fisheries
component and the foreign exchange cost of all other items. Sub-borrowers
would contribute about US$2.63 million, DBP about US$4.14 million and
Government about US$0.13 million to cover the total project costs of
US$18.5 million.
3.21      The Bank loan would be to Government for 17 years including six
years of grace at the standard interest rate. This term is based on a dis-
bursement period of four years and sub-loan repayment terms of up to 12 years
including grace periods up to 4 years. Under a subsidiary loan agreement,
Government would assume the foreign exchange risk and on-lend about US$11.0
million to DBP on the same terms for investments in the fisheries sector and
technical assistance. The balance of the Bank loan of about US$0.6 million
would remain with Government to assist in financing the training of extension
staff and future project preparation. Should funds for these purposes become
available from bilateral sources, the corresponding part of the US$0.6 million
under this item would also be on-lent to DBP for project purposes. The
execution of the subsidiary loan agreement in a form satisfactory to the
Bank, is a condition of loan effectiveness.
F. Procurement
3.22      Procurement for project vessels would be separated into (i) hull
procurement and (ii) procurement of equipment such as main engines, fishing
gear, electronic and other equipment because:
(a)  individual operators are likely to have a small fleet and
therefore aim at standardization of their equipment to
reduce the need for large and costly inventories of spare
parts and to avoid delays due to slow communications; and
(b)  individual operators are in the best position to determine
the make of the equipment most suited to their needs based
on their existing equipment and trained personnel.
These considerations common to credit-type projects preclude bidding
procedures for fully equipped vessels. DBP's naval architect would therefore
establish design criteria for standardized hulls for the two categories of
project vessels and these would be procured from prequalified shipyards
following local competitive bidding procedures (para 3.23). Transportation
difficulties and the need to match the equipment to be installed would
prohibit hull procurement from abroad. DBP's marine specialist would also
establish technical performance criteria and standards for the various
equipment items. Beneficiaries would order equipment, with the make of



- 15 -
their choice, through DBP from suppliers previously pre-qualified through
international advertisement (para 3.24). These equipment items would then
be installed at local shipyards. To the extent, practicable, bulking of
sub-loan applications would be arranged by DBP. By following these procedures
requirements of individual operators will be accommodated without foregoing
the economies of large-scale orders made possible by the project.
3.23      Local shipyards with low labor costs, and freight cost advantages
over foreign suppliers, would be the cheapest source for hulls. Quotations
obtained from foreign shipyards indicate savings of about 20 to 40% and in
extreme cases 80%, for steel vessels constructed locally. Wood is still
cheap in the Philippines and savings are even higher for wooden trawlers.
3.24      Equipment for the vessels, such as main engines, winches, fishing
gear and electronic equipment is not manufactured in the Philippines, but
suppliers from several countries, mainly USA, Japan, Germany, UK and Norway
are already established there. Through international advertisement, other
suppliers would be encouraged to establish themselves and provide adequate
service facilities and spare parts inventories, and the market would be
open to suppliers meeting project standards and specifications. The adver-
tisement would indicate the approximate type of equipment and total quantity
required and potential suppliers would quote prices on various quantities
of each type of equipment. DBP, assisted by the marine specialist, would then
order the make of equipment and quantity needed depending on subloan appli-
cations and individual operator's choice and have it installed on the hulls.
3.25      Procurement of second-hand fish carriers would be confined to
imported vessels and would contain the basic elements of international
competition. DBP's marine specialist would devise details of an appropriate
system for procurement. He would call for offers on behalf of individual
sub-borrowers from major fishing nations based on general specifications
particularly with regard to age, fish-holding capacity and suitability for
the proposed operations. After review by DBP and potential sub-borrowers,
suitable vessels would be certified at their mooring place by marine surveyors
for seaworthiness etc. A final choice would then be made after comparing
costs, delivery time and availability of spare parts.
3.26      Procurement of equipment for vessel improvements would be through
normal trade channels after DBP's marine specialist had reviewed the technical
suitability of that chosen by an individual operator. International com-
petitive bidding procedures would not be appropriate because individual
requirements would vary, and these items would either replace obsolete
machinery or supplement existing equipment. Most of the proposed items
(para 3.08) are not produced in the Philippines.  However, many manufacturers
are represented there and offer a wide variety of type and make of suitable
equipment.
3.27      Formal bidding procedures for fish pond construction, rehabilitation,
and improvements would not be appropriate because as in other credit projects
applications would be small and numerous with varying needs at scattered
sites. Investments, to be carried out in several provinces, would range



- 16 -
from f 1,000 (US$147) for simple main dyke repairs to F 50,000 (US$7,375)
for a 10-ha fish pond development. The bulk of the investments would range
from ! 3,000 (US$442) to V 50,000 (US$7,375). Construction techniques are
simple and would be performed by manual labor which, in most cases, would
be partly provided by the operators themselves. Fish pond operators would
therefore make appropriate arrangements, which would be approved by DBP
or its branch office, with local labor or contractors in their respective
area.
3.28      Procurement of ice-making facilities and slipways would be under
turnkey arrangements because several types of equipment are involved, all
of which are not made by a single manufacturer, and it would be essential
that one contractor take overall responsibility to synchronize installation
of equipment and civil works. The applications would be suitably bulked
and contract would be awarded following international competitive bidding in
accordance with Bank Guidelines. Local consultants (para 3.07) would
prepare design, layout, detailed engineering for ice-plant and slipway
construction. DBP would review sub-loan applications and prepare the tender
documents with the assistance of local consultants. They would also visit
construction sites periodically to ensure that construction conformed to
contract standards. During negotiations, agreement has been reached that
the procurement procedures satisfactory to the Bank as outlined in paras 3.22
through 3.28 would be followed.
G. Disbursements
3.29      The Bank would reimburse the estimated foreign exchange component
for all items, except inland fisheries where 50% of total costs would be pro-
vided. Against appropriate documentation, the Bank would reimburse the
Borrower for:
(a) 100% of sub-loan disbursements (excluding working capital)
for marine fisheries representing 80% of total project
component costs;
(b) 56% of sub-loan disbursements (excluding working capital)
for inland fisheries, representing 50% of total component
costs; and
(c) 100% of foreign expenditure or 90% of total expenditure for
consultant's services and fellowships abroad.
Any savings would be used to finance further fisheries development.  A
quarterly schedule of estimated disbursements is given in Annex 10.

IV. ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT
A. Development Bank of the Philippines
4.01      DBP is known to the Bank, and administration of the previous loans
(Rice Processirig, 720-PH and Livestock, 823-PIT) is satisfactory to date.
DLP's overaii financial position is still difficult but has been steadilv
iriproving under the niew management (Annex 11).  Despite present shortcomings,
DBP would be in the best position to administer the credit program (Alnex 12)
after havun,: introduced the organizational and procc.dural changes in its
Fisheries Group.  In addition, since Novenmber 1972 an advisor, seconded by
the Bank, is preparing an Operational Manual- for DBP whiich will provide
working procedures for the operations, filling an urgent need for review,
integration and codification of instructions. The organizational and
procedural proposals for the Fisheries Group have been fully discussed
with the DBP's management and its advisor and would be introduced (paras
4.03 througlh 4.07). Details on DBP organization and financial position are
provided in Annex 11.
4.02      Fisheries Loan Portfolio.  DBP is presently reviewing its
portfolio to determine accurately its loans in arrear-.  Preliminary figures
indicate that loans delinquent compared to total loans outstanding is about
27% for industry and 21% for agriculture. Wiithin the agriculture sector,
DBP has 1,912 active loans to fisheries with a total outstanding of P 36
million out of a total fisheries lending of 5,840 loars valued P 137.4 million
(US$20.3 million) up to FY 1972.  Total fisheries loans represent about 13%
of DEP's loans to agriculture. They show a relatively high rate of defaults
of 44% by amount. However, looking into the aging of these defaults, fisheries
loans with delinquencies of less than 2 years comprise 14% and less than 4
years 23% of the total. Loans with delinquencies over 5 years constitute
about 59% of total loans outstanding (Annex 11, Table 11). In summary,
recent loans show a much more satisfactory performance and with the changes
proposed under the project (paras 4.03 through 4.10), the situation is
expected to further improve. It is felt that DBP's collateral-oriented
approach (para 4.09) together with inadequate financial and technical
appraisal and virtually no supervision has often in the past led to financing
projects which were either incomplete or under-capitalized from the start.
This explains in part the defaults under the previous fisheries credit
programs. Nevertheless, there is a need to evaluate the causes of failure
to guide future operations, and to establish the non-collectable bad debts
in the fisheries loan portfolio to be written off. Agreement has therefore
been reached during negotiations that a comprehensive and individual assessment
of the fisheries loans in default, satisfactory to the Bank, would be
completed by DBP's staff within one year after loan signing.
B. Project Organization
4.03      The Fisheries Group (FG) within DBP's Agricultural Projects
Department would be responsible for the proposed credit operations. Its



- 18 -
present organizational structure and its present staff, would, however,
be inadequate to perform this task. Technical evaluations in the inland
fisheries sector are reasonably well undertaken, but marine fisheries
operations would need assistance. Supervision needs to be strengthened and
separated from lending operations because of the present number of projects
tqhich need immediate attention.  Therefore, the FG would be headed by a
senior assistant manager and comprise two divisions, project appraisal, and
project supervision. Each division would be headed by a senior officer. The
project appraisal division would comprise two senior fisheries technicians
(inland and marine fisheries) and an experienced financial analyst, who
would form the nucleus of the appraisal staff working as a team. The project
supervision division would be staffed with at least one marine fisheries
specialist and one inland fisheries specialist.  It is a -onition of
effectiveness that an assistant malager, with qualifications and experience
acceptable to the Bank, and the two division chiefs had be£n employed.
Annex 12 shows FG's organizational pattern and staffing requirements.
4.04      DBP's headquarters and its branch and agency offices would receive
loan applications. They would then be screened by FG's technirfal and
financial staff aided by supporting departments, if required, to establish
the creditworthiness of the applicant. In processing applications, one
staff member of the team (para 4.03) would carry responsibilitv for coordination
of work, preparation of the report and recommendations to the Board. The
assignment of responsibilities for a project to one senior staff member
would ensure speedy work progress and eliminate frequent dJ21ays in present
loan operations. Further details are presented in Annex 12. During nego-
tiations, agreement has been reached that working procedures as outlined
above would be introduced and that the Bank would comment on the final
proposed procedures for the Fisheries Group prior to implementation.
4.05      Improved cooperation with other Government agencies, in particular
BOF, would be required. Staff shortages in DBP would not allow adequate
counseling of prospective applicants, assisting with technical appraisals
and providing technical supervision in the inland fisheries sector. BOF's
extension staff should be used for this purpose as much as possible. With
its staff trained through the proposed training program (para 3.12) improved
operational results are expected. Agreement has been reached during nego-
tiations, that a memorandum of agreement between DBP and BOF, regarding man-
power assistance by BOF and extension services, would be executed.
4.06      Most of the marine fisheries operators are corporations, associa-
tions and partnerships. In order to qualify for incentives such as duty-free
imports for capital investments, under the "preferred" industry requirements,
these entities must register with the Board of Investments (BOI). The
registration is sometimes a rather lengthy process but experience in the
rice processing project (720-PH) has shown that this could be considerably
curtailed through cooperation between DBP and BOI. Agreement has there-
fore been reached during negotiations that DBP would assist potential sub-
borrowers to register, and would execute a memorandum of agreement with BOI
to facilitate and to speed registration procedures.



- 19 -
4.07      Efforts would also be required by DBP to give the fisheries
lending program broad publicity and to familiarize potential borrowers with
its major aspects and the credit facilities offered.  Cooperation with other
financial institutions would be sought in the promotion of the program
(especlally to avoid overlapping with financing available under Loan 607-PH)
and their financial assistance to the program. Possibilities for such
cooperation seem to exist with the rural banks and the private development
banks, in particular in financing working capital for the inland fisheries
sector, and with the commercial banks for the marine fisheries sector (para
3.19).
C. Lending Policies and Procedures
4.08      DBP would make sub-loans on the basis of investment proposals
evaluated by FG appraisal staff--and in case of the marine fisheries sector
recorneaded by the marine specialist as to technical, financial and economic
feasibility.  Sub-loans for ice-plants and slipwiays would be prepared for
sub-borrowers by local consultants (para 3.07). Evaluation of sub-loans
would emphasize management capability and experience of each applicant. An
outline of appraisal requirements appears in Annex 12. Loan disbursements
would, whenever practical, be made directly to suppliers, manufacturers and
contractors. Sub-loans or combinations of sub-loans to individual sub-borrowe
in excess of US$100,000 in the inland fisheries sector, and US$250,000 in
the marine fisheries sector, would be approved by the Bank prior to
commitment.
4.09      DBP presently requires that its loans for fisheries projects be
secured at least up to 50% with titled real estate property or property
which is in the process of being titled. This provision has greatly re-
stricted credit demand in the marine fisheries sector, since most potential
sub-borrowers do not possess sufficient real estate to satisfy these colla-
teral requirements. This aspect is even more serious in the inland
fisheries sector, where titled real estate is normally not available,
particularly for the smaller operator, since he leases his ponds under
long-term arrangements from the Government.  To expand the credit program
in the fisheries sector, DBP would therefore have to re-orient its collateral
requirements towards a more project-oriented lending policy based on thorough
technical, financial and economic evaluation of investment projects and
detailed supervision during the repayment period. With this approach, loans
for vessels, equipment and facilities would be adequately secured by the
value of the investment itself, provided suitable arrangements were made for
"all-risk" insurance during the repayment period. In the case of inland
fisheries, the assignment of the lease-hold rights together with the value
of the permanent improvements should be sufficient to secure the loans.
During negotiations, agreement has been reached that DBP would follow the
lending procedures as outlined above (paras 4.08 and 4.09) and would use
standard sub-loan agreements for fishing vessels and fish ponds, satisfactory
to the Bank.

D. On-lending Terms
4.10      Terms of sub-loans would be flexible and be based on the financial
evaluation of the investments to be financed. However, interest and repay-
ment terms would generally be in accordance with the following schedule:
Sub-                                    Repay-
borrower's  Sub-                  Grace    ment

The interest rate of 12% is DBP's current rate for medium- and long-term
lending in all sectors. The blended cost of capital to DBP would be about
7.5% per annum on the basis of a Bank loan of 7.25% and an average cost of
about 8% for DBP's own funds. This would give DBP a gross spread of 4.5%
per annum, considered to be adequate for administrative expenses and overheads
and leaving a sufficient margin for slippage and bad debts. The financial
implications of the proposed project for DBP are shown in Annex 13. During
negotiations, agreement has been reached that the foregoing on-lending
terms would be introduced.
E. Accounts and Audit
4.11      DBP's business and financial operations are under audit and in-
spection by an internal controller division. By charter, DBP is also subject
to an independent audit and examination of the Government Auditor General, who
maintains a staff of about 60 certified public accountants at DBP. Separate
project accounts would be established, maintained and audited annually by
the Government Auditor General and such audit would be acceptable to the Bank
for the purposes of this project. Furthermore, DBP would establish a cost



- 21 -
accounting system for the Fisheries Group to determine accurately its
overheads and administrative costs for this group.  Audited progect
accounts and DBP's financial statements would be submitted to the bank
within six months after the close of its fiscal year. Agreement regarding,
accounts, cost accounting system and audit has been reached during
negotiations.
F. Project Evaluation
4.12      The Fisheries Group would be responsible for evaluating the
benefits realized under the project.  It would monitor an adequate number
of representative sub-loans to make periodic evaluation of economic im-
pact of the credit program. These reporLs wqould be made available to the
Bank within six months after the close of each fiscal year.  Agreetnent
to this effect has been reached durinv,, negotintlons.
G. Future Protect Preparation
A.13      During negotiations agreement has been reached that Government
would uac~signate the Department of Agricu3ture and N;.tural Resources to
guide and supervise the implementation of the fish marketing and distribution.
and smallholder fishi pond project studies (paras 1.13 and 3.14).
V.  PRODUCTION, MARKETS AD OPERAT:ING RESULTS
A. Production
5.01      The proposed fishing vessels would produce about 34,000 tons of
fish annually at full development, representing about 9% of present total
commercial marine production. The fish pond rehabilitation component would
restore about 3,000 tons of lost milkfish production due to typhoon damage
and increase production by about 2,000 tons through improved ponds and
cultivation techniques. The fish pond development program would increase
milkfish supply by about 9,000 tons at full development. The latter increase
would represent about 9% of Government's estimates of total present produc--
tion.
B. Markets
5.02      A continuation of present trends in population and income growth
would result in about a 5% annual demand increase for marine products. These
increases, averaging some 56,000 tons a year in 1970-75 and 68,000 tons in



- 22 -
1975-80, are substantially above increases in output in recent years (Annex 1).
In addition, most of the recent increase has come from municipal (traditional)
fisheries, whaere only a small proportion enters commercial trade and for which
annual production is estimated at 540,000 tons. Cheap marine fish is usually
consumed daily by lower income groups, while comparatively high prices for
milk fish make it a speciality. Retail prices for fish increased more rapidly
:i-n any other component of the retail price index of foodstuffs in Manila,
stg'esting faster growth of demand as against supply.  Fresh fish has also
i:,sited substitution possibilities, because canned fish is bought for its
shrlf-lfe and frozen fish has very low consumer acceptance.  Present trends,
tiwerefore, indicate an increasing fresh fish deficit over the coming years.
All.nost the entire production would therefore be consumed domestically (Annex
14).
5.03      The southern Luzon region, which includes the Greater Manila area,
accounts .or about 70% of total fish trade.  Existing landing and marketing
facilities are overloaded but the completion of the Navotas fishing harbor
in 1975 with adequate landing and marketing facilities would easily accommodate
expected increases.
5.04      Wholesale price data are difficult to obtain (para 2.12) but
available information suggests that average ex-vessel prices are P 1,400
(US$207) per ton in the Greater Manila area and V 1,100 (US$162) in other
major landing centers. Ex-pond prices for milkfish are about V 3,000 (US$442)
per ton. These prices have been used for project evaluation. Further details
on markets and prices are presented in Annex 14.
C. Operating Results
Sub-borrowers
5.05      A summary of the financial benefits, derived from representative
investment models, is given in the following table, while the details are

5.06      Net income and financial return would be sufficiently high to make
the proposed investments atractive. In calculating these returns current
prices for both inputs (including imputed value of family labor) and outputs
were assumed to continue at their present levels. The time to reach full
development ranges from one year for carriers and vessel improvements to
five years for fish pond development. In general, fishery is a risky
activity because control over catch is imperfect and yields are affected by
pests and diseases. Therefore, the models for fishing vessels and fish
ponds, which would determine the success of the project, have been tested
against foreseeable risks. The analysis (Annex 15) indicates that there is
a 4%, 10% and 11% probability that financial rates of return would drop
below 15% for the 70-GT trawler, the 130-GT trawler and new fish pond
construction, respectively. The probabilities that financial rates drop below
10% are negligible.
5.07      The value of total production would be about US$13.2 million per
annum at full development. Incremental income tax returns would be on
average US$1.3 million annually, based on current levels of income taxes.
It is expected that some of the net income generated by the project would
be retained by sub-borrowers to increase consumption of basic items like
clothing, housing, food and education. The remainder is expected to be



- 24 -
invested in expanding these relatively small operations through self-financed
growth.
VI. ECONOMIC BENEFITS AND JUSTIFICATION
6.01      Under the project total estimated landings of the proposed new
vessels would be about 34,000 tons per annum valued at US$6.0 million. Proposed
suppporting facilities, such as fish carriers, ice plants and slipways would
have sufficient capacity to support these expanded fishing operations and
provide additional services to the existing fleet valued at US$0.2 million.
The inland fisheries development program would restore about 3,000 tons of
lost production by rehabilitating flood-damaged fish ponds not properly
repaired, and would increase milkfish production by about 11,000 tons per
annum at full development including 360 tons of shrimp for exports from fish
ponds. The total estimated value of fish pond production is about US$7.2
million.
6.02      The economy should realize a rate of return of 34% from total
project investments with a rate of 22% for marine and 43% for inland
fisheries. The calculations for the marine fisheries component include a
corresponding part of investment and operating costs for the new fisheries
harbor at Navotas which is financed from other resources. Without these
supplementing investments the rate of return would be 28% for this component.
The very attractive rate of return for fish farming results from costs
already incurred prior to rehabilitation and development of ponds. If all
ponds were to be newly constructed the rate of return would be 23% for these
investments.
6.03      To test the project components against changes in investment costs
and production results, a sensitivity analysis has been carried out.  By in-
creasing the cost of project investments by 15% without increasing the value
of the benefits, the overall rate would drop to 30%, and to 19% and 37% for
marine and inland fisheries, respectively. By decreasing the value of the
benefits by 15% without changing the costs of the project investments, the
overall rate would drop to 24%, and to 11% and 31% for investments in marine
and inland fisheries, respectively. See Annex 16 for details.
6.04      At full development, the marine fisheries component would generate
about 870 new permanent jobs on fishing vessels and 70 in ice-making and
repair facilities. The fish pond rehabilitation and development program
would provide about 1,400 permanent positions either for family members
or hired labor presently greatly underemployed or unemployed. Further,
during the construction period, shipbuilding activities and civil works for
ice plants and slipways would provide employment opportunities estimated to
total 840 man-years. Due to labor intensive construction methods, the reha-
bilitation and development of fish ponds would require about 4,000 man-years
of unskilled labor per year during the development period.
6.05      The project's incremaatal production would improve the diet of
mostly lower income groups through increased availability of animal protein



- 25 -
and the results of the proposed test fishing program would determine further
exploitable marine resources. The training program for the extension service
would assist the small and medium-sized fish pond operators to carry out
their investment programs. The economy would also benefit in the long-run
through the fish marketing and smallholder fish pond studies to be carried
out under this project guiding future fisheries development.
6.06      Finally, through strengthened management and organization, the
project would provide valuable experience to DBP in fisheries credit
operations. It would help introduce credit discipline in an important part
of the Philippine fisheries sector and prepare it for future expanded credit
on a financially sound basis.
VII. RECOMMENDATIONS
7.01      During negotiations, the Government agreed to the following
principal points:
(a) it would discuss with the Bank and carry out a test fishing
program on terms and conditions satisfactory to the Bank
(para 2.14);
(b) it would carry out a training program, acceptable to the
Bank, for the extension staff of the Bureau of Fisheries
(BOF) and DBP's appraisal staff in the inland fisheries
sector (para 3.12); and
(c) it would employ an aquaculture extension expert with
qualifications and experience and on terms and conditions
acceptable to the Bank, to carry out such training program
(para 3.12).
7.02      In addition,DBP has agreed to the following principal points:
(a) it would procure fishing vessels, carriers, vessel equipment,
ice-plants, slipways and fish pond rehabilitation and develop-
ment satisfactory to the Bank as outlined in paras 3.22
through 3.28;
(b) it would complete within one year after loan signing through
its staff, satisfactory to the Bank, a comprehensive and
individual assessment of the fisheries' loans in default
(para 4.02);
(c) it would follow lending policies and procedures as outlined
in paragraphs 4.08 and 4.09 and would use standard sub-loan
agreements for fishing vessel and fish pond operations,
satisfactory to the Bank, for investments; and



- 26 -
(d) it would introduce on-lending termus to sub-borrowers as
outlined in para 4.10.
7.03      Conditions of effectiveness of the proposed loan are that:
(a) DBP has employed a marine specialist and a naval architect
with qualifications and experience and on terms and conditions
acceptable to the Bank (para 3.11);
(b) a Subsidiary Loan Agreement, satisfactory to the Bank, has
been executed between DBP and the Government (para 3.21); and
(c) DBP has employed an assistant manager to head FG with qualifi-
cations and experience acceptable to the Bank and two division
chiefs (para 4.03).
7.04      The project is suitable for a Bank loan of US$11.6 million for a
period of 17 years including six years of grace. The borrower would be the
Government of the Republic of the Philippines.

Marine Fisheries
1.        Commercial Marine Fisheries involves the operations of vessels over
3 tons (GT) operating mostly in the waters between the islands. By law their
activities are restricted to waters deeper than 12.6 m (7 fathoms). These
operations have shown considerable progress in the past decade through the
use of improved equipment and methods of fishing and now provide about 37%
of the 1.0 million tons total production. Other marine fisheries, operating
near the shore with small traditional vessels, involve mainly subsistence
fisheries (municipal fisheries) and their production is estimated at 53% of
the total.
Fishing Methods, Fish Species and Fishing Grounds
2.        In the last 10 years, there has been a substantial reduction in
the number of small vessels (less than 10 tons) and an increase in the number
of vessels 70 tons or more (Table 1). Most of the fish is now caught by this
latter group.

3.        Most fish are caught by trawl, bagnet and purse seine, methods
common to all sizes of vessels. The beach seine, gillnet and round hull are
restricted to the smaller vessels, as is most fishing by hook and line.

4.        The Bureau of Fisheries (BOF) publishes production data for some
68 types of fish, but four species represented about two-thirds of the total
catch by commercial vessels in 1970. Round scad accounted for almost 40%,
slipmouth and sardines represented 9% each and chub mackerel accounted for
5-1/2% of the total catch.
5.        The Sulu Sea (along Palawan Waters), which is the major source of
round scad, provided 58% of the total fish catch in 1970 and production rose
from 136,000 tons in 1965 to 222,000 tons in 1970. Catch in the Visayan Sea
increased from 70,000 tons to 90,000 tons, and in 1970 represented 24% of
the total. Production of Manila Bay was essentially the same in 1970 as in
1965, and in recent years accounted for about 5% of the total catch. Together,
these three fishing grounds produced 87% of the total catch. See Table 2
for species and fishing grounds.
6.        Most of the other fishing grounds produced less in 1970 than in
1965, with the most pronounced reductions in the relatively small area of
Guimaris Strait between Panay and Negros, and in most of the waters around
Luzon (particularly Sibuyan Seas, Tayabas Bay, Ragay Gulf, Lingayen Gulf,
Lanan Bay and San Miguel Bay). On the other hand, the fish catch increased
off Southern Mindanao (Davao Gulf and Sibuguey Bay).
The Resource Base
7.        The territorial sea of the Philippines, according to Republic Act
3046 and based on the so called "archipelago principle", encompasses some
1.6 million km2 within an area 540 nautical miles wide (118°E to 127°E) and
1,640 nautical miles long (21t25'N to 4°45'N). Only a few commercial fisher-
men operate outside these limits -- mainly in the South China Sea -- and
their catch makes only a small contribution to the total. The Philippine
Islands are marked by an extremely narrow continental shelf and a precipitous
continental slope, so that most of the sea area is deep water (over 180 m).
Far more suitable for fishing are the shallower waters which cover an area of



ANNEX 1
Page 3
only about 185,000 km2 (of which about 100,000 km2 are shallow areas in
internal waters). The largest shallow water areas are the Sulu Sea (68,800
km2), the South China Sea (36,100 km2), part of the Pacific (34,800 km2), and
the Visayan Sea (12,000 km2). The marine fishery is mainly concentrated
in these areas (Map).
8.        The FAO/UNDP/SF Deep Sea Fisheries Development Program which became
operational in 1965 and is now completed, aimed at carrying out experimental
fishing and training of fishermen on its two research vessels.  The Program
estimates the potential annual catch within Philippines Territorial Waters
at about 1.65 million tons, almost double the actual catch in 1970. The
potential consists of 700,000 tons of demersal fish (bottom-associated species)
and 950,000 tons of pelagic fish (surface-associated species). 1/
9.        According to the FAO project estimates, the subsistence (municipal)
catch in 1970 represented 80% of the potential in the waters dominated by
this category, and the commercial catch about 40% of the potential as pre-
sented below:

10.       Data presently available suggest that there is a development poten-
tial for further expansion of the commercial fleet. The FAO/UNDP Program
states that most productive fishing areas to exploit are the southern part
of the Sulu Sea, the northern side of the Celebes Sea, the South China Sea off
Luzon, and the Pacific off Bicol and Samar. However, it should be stressed
that little actual test fishing programs have been carried out in Philippines
waters and these estimates of potential resources are judgements based on
information for similar areas. The proposal to use the two research vessels
released from the FAO/UNDP/SF Program for a resource base study of the
Philippine waters would permit more accurate estimates to assist in formula-
ting future fleet expansion proposals.
Shore Facilities
11.       Fish production is almost entirely consumed within the Philippines,
and the major part of the commercial production is landed in the Greater
Manila area. BOF estimates that about 70% of the total commercial catch
(about 270,000 tons) is landed in Navotas. Other important landing centers
are Iloilo City and Cadiz City. In addition, there are some 100. landing
sites - usually without specialized facilities and handling only small amounts
for local consumption.
12.       There are no fishing ports presently operating in the Philippines.
Even at Navotas, which handles the bulk of the landings, fish is discharged
by amphibious trucks from fishing vessels anchored off-shore. However, a
project to develop Navotas into a fishing port, involving dredging an approach
channel, and constructing wharves and a fish market building, is presently
being implemented with financial assistance from the Asian Development Bank.
This project is behind schedule but expected to become operational in 1975,
which would greatly facilite fish marketing for this major consumption area.
Ai FAO/IBRD Cooperative Program mission visited the Philippines in 1972 to
investigate the potential for additional fishing port facilities. While
estimated fish landings may not justify further investments in specialized
fishing port facilities at this stage, there is an outstanding need for
improvement and construction of marketing and distribution facilities.
Throughout the islands BOF owns a small number of small ice-plants with
limited capacity but some are not operating. Private entrepreneurs provide
the bulk of the ice but the existence of local monopolies (through a govern-
ment licensing system) has led to high-priced and inferior products. How-
ever licensing requirements have recently been abolished by the Fisheries
Decree and increased competition will probably improve the situation.
Existing ice-making facilities, insulated transport, cold storage facilities,
auction halls and the like, are inadequate and any substantial increase
in fish production would require expansion and provision of such facilities.
13.       Presently, there are about 33 shipyards in the Philippines, mainly
concentrated around Manila. Five to eight of these are capable of steel
vessel construction, while the remainder specialize in repair and maintenance
and wooden vessel construction. Repair and maintenance facilities for the
fishing fleet based around Manila appear adequate; there is, however, a
serious lack of slipways and simple repair and maintenance facilities in



ANNEX 1
Page 5
the southern part of the Philippines, to the extent that even the existing
fleet cannot be properly served there.
Administration
14.       In November 1972, Government issued a Fisheries Presidential
Decree (No. 43) to provide policy guidance and coordinate and delineate
the various activities of the participating agencies of the industry.
An important feature is the creation of the Fishery Industry Development
Council to formulate development policies for the industry. The chairman is
the Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources and other members include
the Director of Bureau of Fisheries (BOF), Secretary of Defense, Chairmen
of Government's lending institutions and representatives of the private
sector. Overall responsibility for policy coordination is vested in the
Department of Agriculture and Natural Resources, while BOF as a Directorate
under the Department has the primary responsibility for policy implemen-
tation. As a result, BOF's functions include coordination of training,
research and extension as well as administration and regulation. The only
major function outside BOF relates to extension of credit, although the
decree envisages the establishment of a development fund to provide finance
for special programs not yet defined in detail.
15.       For administrative purposes, ten fisheries regions have been
established in 1972, although most statistics still refer to the former
eight regions. Each region has a Regional Office which supervises fisheries
demonstration and research stations in that region. Each Regional Office
has administrative, extension and fisheries law enforcement staff. In
1972, BOF's staff totalled over 1,600, including about 550 classified as
"fisheries'technical", 100 as "non-fisheries technical" and the remainder
as "non-technical". Of these, about 450 were employed on inland fisheries
extension and 265 on the improvement of the marine fisheries sector.
Extension, Education and Research
16.       In the marine fisheries sector the training is provided almost
exclusively by BOF through its four training vessels, demonstrating improved
techniques and undertaking experimental surveys and exploration. Up to 1972,
the FAO/UNDP Deep Sea Fisheries Development Program, now terminated, pro-
vided about 800 fishermen with some basic technical training through its
two research vessels. At present the establishment of an UNDP Deep Sea
Fisheries Development Program to provide intensive training of short
duration is under consideration. The training effort is expected to be
aimed at captains, master fishermen and fishermen with at least five years'
experience in order to introduce the application of modern equipment and
gear.
17.       The College of Fisheries at the University of Philippines offers
degree and diploma courses in fisheries which also include some general
education and a four-month on-the-job training course. At the secondary
level, vocational education is provided through about 40 Fishery Schools
offering courses in fish culture, fish capture and fish preservation.
While enrollment in these courses has shown a faster growth than vocational



ANNEX 1
Page 6
training in general, the quality of education is generally poor due to lack
of equipment and materials. A recent IDA Credit 349-PH, the second one
for education, would benefit the agricultural sector, including fisheries,
through laboratory and workshop equipment, technical assistance, introductiot
of a revised curriculum and, also, professional development of agricultural
personnel at two colleges. The proposed project vessels would require about
60 qualified captains, 60 masterfishermen and about 810 unskilled fishermen.
Special training would not be required because such fishing operations as
proposed are already practiced in the Philippines. With regard to captaiins
and masterfishermen, present training facilities and persons presently under
training on fishing vessels are expected to provide sufficient personnel.
Unskilled fishermen would be readily available, mostly from among the sub-
sistence fishermen who prefer steady employment.
Fisheries Statistics
18.       Such fisheries statistics as have been collected in the past by
BOF's staff have not been very useful for fisheries policy formulation.
Statistics for municipal fisheries are based on an inadequate sample survey;
for inland fisheries, on the registered fish pond area, irrespective of the
areas actually under production; and for marine fisheries, on the reports of
the vessel owners. Up to 1972 a fee was levied on the fish caught which
tended to lead to under-reporting. Consequently, there are uncertainties
with regard to resources, production and consumption. However, a number of
projects have been started recently to improve the data base. In the inland
fisheries sector, the 1971 Census will provide revised data, while abolition
of the "fish-caught-fee" might lead to much more accurate reporting of the
marine fisheries sector and proposed intensified research would improve
knowledge of marine resources. Furthermore, Government assisted by the Ford
Foundation, is presently conducting consumption pattern and marketing studies
for fish and fish products, which should result in more information regarding
these aspects.

Inland Fisheries
Species
1.        There are two principal types of fish culture practiced in the
Philippines: brackish water and fresh water culture. Brackish water cul-
ture, which is by far the more important, has a history of over 300 years.
The species cultivated is milkfish (Bangus), which is found in the warm
coastal waters of the Indian and Pacific Ocean. Fully grown they weigh up
to 20 kg, but commercially cultivated species are marketed at about 250-350
gram. Some tilapia, mullet, shrimp and crab also enter the pond with the
inflow of water.
2.        Milkfish spawn in the seas and the fry drift with the current to
the coastal areas. Spawning of this fish under controlled conditions has
not been successful. Fry are caught by professional collectors with special
nets, mainly hand-operated, during certain seasons and at certain localities.
Fry collected are sold either directly to pond operators, or to nurseries
which grow them to fingerling size and then sell them to operators.
3.        Cultivation and consumption of milkfish flourishes only in the
Philippines, Taiwan and Indonesia since other countries have difficulties
obtaining fry in sufficient quantities. International trading is very small
due to limited acceptance of milkfish in other countries.
Fishpond Construction and Layout
4.        Generally, brackish water ponds are constructed in an estuarine
mangrove swamp area by bunding of its perimeter, removal of existing trees,
levelling of the bottom, construction of water supply and drainage canals
and gates for water control. Construction methods mainly involve manual
labor often provided by the operator himself. The ponds are filled with
water during high tide, and by manipulating the water gates, water can be
retained or drained. During the typhoon season, ponds, especially in Central
Luzon, are subject to strong wave action and flooding which causes damage
to the perimeter dyke and allows the fish to escape. The perimeter dykes
should have a height of approximately 1.0 to 1.5 m above the highest tidal
levels and be strong enough to resist wave action.  Removal of trees and
bottom levelling is laborious and is usually done in stages.  Generally, a
larger area, about 25 ha, is enclosed but development is carried out in 10
ha self-contained modules. Ponds not fully developed usually have tree
stumps, which may occupy 25% of pond space, thereby considerably reducing
the productivity of the pond.



ANNEX 2
Page 2
5.        In most cases, the operating pond area is divided by secondary dykes
into a nursery pond, one, or several, transition ponds and rearing ponds. A
typical pond layout is shown in Figure WB-7309. It comprises a nursery pond,
covering about 2% of the total pond area, a transition pond with 10% of total
pond area; the remainder would be used for rearing ponds.
Fish Pond Operations
6.        For reasons of economy the growth of fish is attained by depending
as much as possible on natural fish food organisms produced in the pond and
as little as possible on supplemental feeds. Milkfish appears to be a
bottom algae feeder and, to a lesser extent, a plankton feeder. Therefore,
the principal food is bottom algae (lab-lab) and promoting and maintaining
this algae growth is essential. This has to be done by providing adequate
plant nutrients to the pond (organic and inorganic fertilizer), proper
management of the water conditions in the pond (depth, salinity, temperature,
transparency, etc.), control of algae pests (snails, worms) and prevention
of overgrazing either through fish population control or supplemental feeding.
7.        The organic fertilizer most commonly used in the Philippines is
chicken manure, but in Taiwan rice bran, peanut cake, soybean cake, sesame
cake, copra legumes and pig manure are also used. In addition, various
nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium-based inorganic fertilizers are applied.
HIowever, standard procedures are difficult to formulate because they vary
with water and soil conditions. For instance inorganic fertilizer was
widely used in Taiwan, but it was discontinued because of ineffectiveness.
On the other hand, the use of insecticides was introduced in 1959 and found
to be very effective. More recently, rice bran has been successfully used
as direct supplementary feed in Taiwan.
8.        Two methods of stocking are practiced:  stocking with single size
fingerlings, which is more common, and stocking with mixed size groups.
In the first case, the fry are reared in the nursery pond and the fingerlings
grow in transition ponds. The fingerlings, all of uniform size, are then
transferred to the rearing pond where they grow to marketable size and a
complete harvesting is done. When well managed, 2-3 harvests per year can
be expected. The second method, introduced more receiitly, involves the
stocking of fingerlings of usually three different sizes in one rearing
pond. After a lapse of about 1-2 months the first marketable size group is
harvested (with specific mesh size nets) and .a new group of fingerlings is
introduced. Through selective harvesting and repeated stocking 4-6 harvests
can be gathered in a year.
9.        Freshwater culture is not yet common in the Philippines, and the
technical base and management are not as well advanced as for brackish
water ponds. Potentially, over time, the Chinese carp and catfish in fresh
water could produce yields as great as those of milkfish in the brackish
water ponds. A constraint is the limited demand for freshwater fish in
Central Luzon. Nevertheless, about one-fourth of the total undeveloped
fish pond area is suitable for freshwater ponds, and large areas could
be developed in Cotabato and Agusan del Sur on Mindanao and in Pampanga.



ANNEX 2
Page 3
10.       Shrimp (prawn) cultivation is of great interest to fish pond
operators, especially in the Southern Philippines where local demand for
milkfish is not high and the distance from major markets is considerable.
However, the technical base for shrimp culture is not yet developed and not
expected to emerge in the near future. For instance, in Japan, 10 years
have elapsed since shrimp (penaeus japonica) cultivation was developed
and while hatching of eggs from naturally fertilized shrimps has been
successful, experience with shrimp cultivation from the fry stage to com-
mercial size has not been successful because of high production costs and
mortality. Total production of cultivated shrimp in Japan in 1971 was about
300 tons per annum - compared with an annual consumption of about 130,000
tons.
Fishpond Areas
11.       BOF estimates that in 1970, fishponds covered some 168,000 ha, almost
all of brackish water (perhaps 6,000 ha are fresh water ponds) and produced
about 100,000 tons of milkfish for domestic consumption. About half the area
is leased from Government under long-term arrangements (up to 25 years, renew-
able for another 25 years) and the remainder is privately owned. The leased
area has increased by some 9,000 ha since 1968, whereas the privately owned
area has remained more or less unchanged. Table 1 shows the distribution
of the present fishpond area and productivity by region and the swamplands
still available for development. Potentially, the fishpond area could be
expanded about threefold. At present, some 60% of the area and over 70%
of the output are concentrated in Regions III and V where yields rank high. 1/
More than half of the swamplands available for development are in Regions VI
and VIII, where present yields are among the lowest. 2/ The latter region
has most of the potential area for fresh water fish ponds. There is also con-
siderable room for further expansion in Region III (Palawan, Quezon and Pampanga
Provinces). In looking toward large-scale development of swamplands, it should
be noted that much of the potential fishpond swamplands are located in remote
areas with very poor access to potential markets.
Fishponds Yields
12.       There is, however, a large production potential by increasing yields
of fishponds. Although milkfish yields in the Philippines approach 600 kg/ha,
compared with 300 kg/ha in Indonesia, they are far below the 1,700 kg/ha
yields obtained in Taiwan. Such high yields in Taiwan are obtained by the
use of fertilizers (and manure), pesticides, supplemental feed, and scientific
stocking and harvesting. Soil, water and climatic conditions of Philippine
ponds are extremely favorable to growth of milkfish and its natural food
organisms. Recently, some leading operators, with technical assistance from
various research projects, have been experimenting with alternative cultiva-
tion techniques. Preliminary results are encouraging and this approach might
1/   Area and production are largely in Bulacan, Quezon and Pampanga Provinces
in Region III and in Iloilo, Cadiz and Negros Occidental.
2/   Particularly Northern Samar in Region VI and Agusan del Sur and Davao del
Norte in Region VIII.



ANNEX 2
Page 4
be of great value to the overall development of milkfish culture in the
Philippines since leading operators, encouraged by research and technical
assistance, might help to spread appropriate cultivation methods applicable
to their specific region. A program of fertilization and pest control is
expected to raise yields in Philippine brackish water fishponds to 1,200 kg/ha
per annum which is the target for the project fishponds to be achieved over
a 5-year development period. With supplemental feeding and intensive manage-
ment of fish populations, annual yields could possibly exceed 2,000 kg/ha. 1/
However, the economics and technology for supplemental feeding for the Philip-
pine conditions are still uncertain.
Extension, Education and Research
13.       Research and extension services for aquaculture are provided by
the Department of Agriculture and Natural Resources through the Bureau of
Fisheries and, to some extent, by the National and Agricultural Council.
The College of Fisheries of the University of Philippines conducts research
through the Inland Fisheries Project (IFP). IFP's research and training
centers, one in Central Luzon and one in Panay Island, are under construction
now and when fully operational by the end of 1973, they would greatly assist
in increasing fishpond productivity by developing modern fishpond management
methods and teaching them to research trainees, extension workers and fish
farmers. While the BOF has a large number of personnel who are organized
into many field offices, the quality and effectiveness of the extension
service are inadequate and need to be improved. BOF and IFP are presently
discussing establishment of a training program aimed at upgrading BOF exten-
sion service. This program and the proposed extension expert would be of
importance to the project. In addition, the demonstration fish farms of
the BOF and the private operators' cooperation with the IFP in demonstration
and experimentation could provide effective means for dissemination of the
research benefits.

Descrition of M4ajor Pro ct Components
A.  Description of the Proposed Project Vessels
1.        During the past decade, the trawling fleet expanded by about 15-20
vessels per annum, mostly in the 70 gross-ton class.  However, fishing
operators find it increasingly difficult to finance fleet expansion. Funds
from operations are mainly used for replacement of obsolete vessels but
financial resources for additional vessels are difficult to obtain.
2.        In general, prior to fleet expansion the followinig factors would
have to be considered: (a) marine resources; (b) qualified personnel;
(c) marl:ets; (d) distribution facilities; and (e) fleet supporting facilities.
Based on estimated credit demand and the above-mentioned factors, it is
proposed to finance about 15 trawlers per annum over a 4-year investment
period. The incremental production of about 34,000 tons per annum from
the projcct vessels is well below the overall resource limit. As far as
specific fishing grounds are concerned, the proposed vessels would be
equipped to trawl in deeper grounds not yet exploited. The development of
Navotas into a fishing harbor and the proposed provision of ice-plants
would assist in distributing the increment. Repair and maintence facilities
are adequate around Manila and the proposed provision of simple slipways
would allow servicing the proposed fleet expansion.
3.        The commercial fishing fleet is mainly based around Manila
(Navotas) and the Visayan Sea. Operators from Navotas prefer larger steel
vessels because of long distances to the fishing grounds and adequate repair
and maintenance facilities at their base. ilowever, operators around the
Visayan Sea prefer smaller wooden vessels because of short distances to
fishing grounds, lower investment costs (cheap wood), and inadequate faci-
lities and skilled personnel to maintain steel vessels. The naval architect,
to be attached to DBP, would therefore -- in cooperatioi;  with potential
subborowers -- provide thie final technical specifications for fishing ves-
sels: (a) a 130-GT vessel, having a steel hull with an overall length of
27.5 m and powered by a 750-hp diesel engine; and (b) a 70-&T vessel, having
a wooden hull with an overall length of 24.3 m and powered by a 335-hp diesel
engine. Both vessels would be equipped with short-wave radios, fish finders
and mechanical hauling gear. Vessels of comparable size and equipment are
fishing in the Philippines and are in great demand by operators. The
attached Charts No. WB-7310 and No. WB-7308 show preliminary outline and
drawings for the two standard vessels.



ANNEX 3
Page 2
Description of the Inland Fisheries Component
The inland fisheries component has the main objective of rapidly
increasing milkfish production for local consumption. Durine this first
stage, rehabilitation (of typhoon-damaged ponds) and development of existing
ponds would be emphasized, although new construction would not be excluded.
5.        The 1972 typhoon damaged about 13,000 ha of fish ponds in Central
Luzon. Government estimates that about 35% would either remain damaged or
only partly repaired. Rehabilitation of about 4,500 ha would restore about
3,000 tons per annum of lost milkfish production and provide about 2,000 tons
of incremental production through better pond layouts and improved cultiva-
tion techniques.
6.        Expansion of milkfish production through improvements of existing
ponds would require adequate extension and banking service and ready access
to major consumption areas because of the limited distribultion facilities
available. Therefore, demand for fish pond credit is expected to be con-
centrated in Central Luzon and Panay Islands. It is estimated that a total
of about 39,500 ha would require improvement and development. However,
taking into account credit demands, manual construction methods and the
modular approach (i.e. a 50-ha development would be generally divided into
modules of 10 ha each), it is estimated that about 7,500 ha could be developed
anid improved over a 4-year investment period (including 100 ha fresh water
ponds). The incremental production would be about 9,000 tons per annum at
full development.
,.        Annex 9 gives a description of work to be performed and unit
costs for rehabilitation, development and new construction, while Table 1
of this annex summarizes the estimated regional distribution of the fishponds
under this -roject.

FISHERIES CREDIT PROJECT
Terms of Reference for an Aguaculture Extension Expert
Need for a Training Program
1.        Fish ponds now produce about 10%, or 100,000 tons, of total fish
production in the Philippines. Fish pond production per hectare averages
only 570 kg/ha per annum, against a potential of 1,200 kg/ha and more. These
differences arise because no standard management practices -- even in local
areas -- are applied. Each operator seems to have his own practices, es-
pecially in fertilizer applications which is the most important aspect of
milkfish cultivation. An operator knowing what fertilizer to use and when
to apply it can hardly fail in his operations. Fertilizers are the most
expensive input and fish pond operators are now being advised by extension
staff to use both organic and inorganic urea (nitrate) fertilizer with no
evidence that these are as efficient as less costly inorganic fertilizers.
With proper techniques the production could be greatly improved; however,
to realize this potential an intensive extension program would be required.
General Scope of Work
2.        The Bureau of Fisheries (BOF) requires technical assistance for
its extension service in the inland fisheries sector:
(a) to update knowledge of recent developments in
aquaculture;
(b) to demonstrate cultivation methods to fish pond
operators; and
(c) to assist fish pond operators with technical
aspects of subloan applications.
3.        BOF would hire a qualified individual to perform the following
duties and responsibilities during his 2-1/2 year assignment:
(a) Training program development. The aquaculture
extension expert would work directly under the
Deputy Director of BOF and with the senior exten-
sion staff. In cooperation with the University
of the Philippines (Fisheries College) and its
Inland Fisheries Project, he would develop an
appropriate training program (including the cost)
for BOF's senior extension staff and DBP's



ANNEX 5
Page 2
appraisal staff to keep them current on new
development in aquaculture.
(b) Local instructors. He would select five or six
promising staff and train them to become the nucleus
of Filipino personnel to take over and expand the
training operation after his departure. This staff
may also benefit from overseas training (fellowships)
before the experts completes his assignment (2-1/2
years).
(c) Literaturepreparation. He would be responsible for
the preparation of semi-technical literature for
extension personnel and non-technical literature
designed specifically for the fish pond operators.
(d) Demonstration project preparation. He would help
plan, execute and evaluate demonstration projects
in the private sector to demonstrate new techniques
as they are developed through research in the
Philippines.
4.        Training activities would include:
(a) Lectures and laboratory demonstrations:
(i) refresher courses on principles of aquaculture;
(ii) pond environment--chemical analysis and control;
(iii) fertilizers and fertilization;
(iv) optimal pond layouts;
(b) Application of technical knowledge:
(i) each participant would conduct his own trials in
cooperation with the private sector;
(ii) the participants would be responsible for recording
their trials;
(c) Evaluation of demonstration trials:
(i) results of trials would be compiled, analyzed and
discussed by the trainees and the instruction staff
and made available to the private sector.



ANNEX 5
Page 3
5.        Participants would include about 80 senior extension staff from
BOF and 20 appraisal staff from DBP. Courses would be held in research
facilities of the Fisheries College. Training Courses would run for approxi-
mately four months.

FISHERIES CREDIT PROJECT
Terms of Reference for a Proposed
Fish Marketinu and Distribution Study
Introduction
1.        Fresh fish is a staple and the largest source of animal protein
in the Filipino diet and demand is rapidly growing with increasing population.
Government therefore plans to increase production by some 5%, or 50,000 to
70,000 tons a year, during the plan period from 1972 to 1975. These estimated
production increases are higher than those achieved in the past and the major
obstacle to increased fresh fish production seems to be the inadequate mar-
keting and distribution system. In addition, high marketing costs due to in-
efficient transport and handling and excessive middlemen tend to lead to un-
attractive prices for both the producers and the consumers. The situation
is further aggravated by unstable supplies and prices because of a poor com-
munications system and the lack of cold storage. Excess supplies of fresh
fish result in drastic discounts for the producers, because the fish is then
bought for processing, such as salting, drying or smoking, resulting in low
value products.
2.        In view of Government's plans to increase fish production, the
strong consumer's preference for fresh fish and the present inadequate
marketing facilities and system, a study, to make specific recomendation
with regards to an investment program for marketing and distribution facili-
ties, is proposed.
OjUecives
3.        The principal objectives of this study would be:
(a) To review the existing fish marketing and distribution
system. Particular attention would be given to its
inefficiencies and the bottlenecks to the marketing
of increased production;
(b) To reach realistic estimates of national and regional
production and consumption by major species, as well
as landings at various locations over the next 10 years;
(c) To recommend an integrated physical system necessary
for the efficient distribution of the total production,
to complement or replace the existing network; and
(d) To formulate a phased investment program suitable for
external financing.



ANNEX 6
Page 2
Scope
Review of the Marketing System
4.        An examination of the existing system and its physical components
of landing, handling, servicing, distributing, etc., would be made mainly
with regard to capacity to handle additional production.
5.        A fishing port for Navotas, financed by the Asian Development
Bank (ADB), is due for completion by 1975. A study of its existing opera-
tion and the proposed port operations would be used to identify inefficien-
cies, avoidable costs, lost fishing time, and wasted resources in the present
marketing system. The FAO/IBRD Cooperative Program mission of 1972 recom-
mended a further analysis of Zamboanga and General Santos for possible devel-
opment as fishing ports. Other landing centers would be included in this
review.
6.        All modes (river, road, rail, air) of the physical transportation
and trans-shipment system would have to be analyzed with regard to handling
costs and capacity. The cost component has many aspects: the quantity
shipped, the distance moved and the preservation cost, including any loss
in value due to loss in quality. Similarly, capacity has two aspects --
the quantity that can be moved, and the markets that can be reached in the
time that the product is still in good condition.
7.        Short-term over-supplies occur frequently with prices reacting
rather sensitively. The supply situation needs to be studied for its rela-
tion to the physical system, such as ice supply, freezing and storage, and
transport as well as for its price effect on the producer and the consumer.
8.        An outstanding issue within the marketing system is the number
and role of the middlemen and the effect of the selling method on the price,
availability and production of fish. Price margins and price control by
middlemen would be analyzed. Advantages due to a centralized marketing
organization for fish and similar products would be evaluated. In this con-
text, the present market information system needs to be reviewed.
Production and Consumption Projections
9.        Based on the Government's programs and the expansion of fish
operations in the private sector, estimates of the national and regional
production and consumption would be essential. Important landing sites
and the volume and type of their operation would need to be projected over
the next 10 years. The consumption estimates would have to take into
consideration factors, such as population, urbanization and income growth
and others, as appropriate. The national nutritional targets could serve
as a guide. Flowing from these considerations would be the estimates of
regional surplus or deficits, inter-regional movements, possible transport
modes and investment requirements.



ANNEX 6
Page 3
An Integrated Physical System
10.       Based on regional production and consumption patterns, an integ-
rated physical system would be defined. Included in the recommendations
would be the type, size and optimum locations of the physical facilities
like landing sites, handling equipment, ice and storage facilities, trans-
portation modes, fish markets, etc. Capital and operating cost estimates,
identifying the foreign exchange components, would also be included.
Organizational and Institutional Arrangements
11.       Organization of the various marketing functions of the proposed
system would be considered and included in guidelines for the Government.
Institutional changes, such as centralized marketing system or cooperative
marketing, would be analyzed. Particular attention would be given to staff
ing and training requirements. Government policy guidelines regarding a
market information system, price policy, production incentives and others
would also be evaluated.
Benefits of the Project
12.       A quantitative analysis of the benefits from the integrated
distribution and marketing system would be carried out.  Benefits such as
achievement of nutritional targets and improvement of geographical distri-
bution as well as the consumers' and producers' benefits due to lower
marketing costs should be stated.
Preliminary Outline of the Proposed Study
13.       The following areas would be dealt with:
I.   Existing Distribution and Marketing System:
A.   Fishing ports and landing sites:
1.   location, volumes, fish species;

FISHERIES CREDIT PROJECT
Terms of Reference for a Proposed Smallholder Fish Pond Project Study
Introduction
1.        To accelerate the development of fish ponds, the Government has
declared a policy to identify public lands to be divided into family size
fish ponds and leased to landless individuals (Fisheries Decree). However,
location, organization and integration with the sector have not been consid-
ered. Thus, the fish pond estate concept needs to be studied in relation
to the distribution and marketing study and the fisheries credit project.
The proposed study would formulate a project, consistent with the existing
sector and its development, suitable for external lending.
Objectives
2.        The principal objectives of this study would be:
(a) To review the available studies and data regarding the
existing and future production, distribution and con-
sumption patterns as well as the potential areas for
fish pond development including production, production
costs, markets and market access;
(b) To recommend the location, size and construction method
for the estate(s), keeping in view the relevant factors
of milkfish production and demand, adequate income levels
to participants, supporting services and the employment
potential of manual construction;
(c) To recommend the organization for the activities of the
fish pond estates, including technical support and train-
ing for local staff, transport and marketing, operation
and maintenance, and project costs and benefits;
(d) To recommend the terms and conditions for the selection of
beneficiaries and subloans; and
(e)  To prepare a program for implementation including policy
guidelines for the executing agency.



ANNEX 7
Page 2
Scope
3.        The study would attend, inter alia, to the following issues:
(a) Estates: Size and Location
4.        The study would make recommendations regarding the size and loca-
tion for a single estate or a complex of smaller estates with due regard
to marketing of their production. Technical factors, such as soil, water
and weather conditions; marketing factors, such as demand and price levels;
roads and refrigerated transport; and production factors, such as technical
service and cost of inputs, would all be analyzed for the various potential
fish pond areas to ensure optimum location. Other studies, already completed
or ongoing, would be consulted in order to achieve an understanding of the
existing sector and how it would change as a result of government programs
and policies. Especially, changes in consumption patterns with an improved
distribution network would be taken into consideration.
(b) Individual Smallholder Units
5.        Within an estate, the area is to be subdivided into fish ponds of
a size that could provide an average family with an adequate income, taking
into account alternative employment, such as small-scale agriculture. This
income should cover the requirement of food, shelter, clothing, schooling
for the children and provide a surplus sufficient to tide over uncertain-
ties of production. These requirements should be set, taking into account
existing living conditions in small-scale agriculture. Based on the above
definition the study should arrive at a target income figure for Philippine
conditions. For a smallholder fish pond, the labor input would mostly be
in the form of family labor, but considering other operational costs and
financial obligations under its proposed terms and organization, the study
would recommend an appropriate pond size. If technical, marketing and other
conditions are found to differ significantly among the locations, pond sizes
may differ according to these variables and more than one may be recommended.
(c) Estates: Organization
6.        Operating cost would depend significantly on the form of organization
of the various activities of the estates. Sharing of marketing and transpor-
tation functions would result in savings and improve market access at the same
time. Pooling of labor for harvesting would eliminate the normal short-term
labor shortage at this time. Bulk purchasing through a cooperative operation
would lead to reduced costs for operating inputs. Equipment and resource
sharing in other areas may be possible.
7.        The cooperative concept above is considered desirable from the
viewpoint of operational costs; however, restraints and the Philippine ex-
perience with cooperatives would be taken into account prior to recommending
the organizational framework of the estate. The objective is to ensure effi-
cient management of activities without suppressing the initiative and re-
sponsibility of the individual fish pond operators under the project and al-
ternatives would be explored.



ANNEX 7
Page 3
8.        Depending on the size of the estates, the technical support func-
tion could be performed through Government extension officers, a resident
expert or an experimental station on the estate.
9.        The issue of organization is considered to be the single most im-
portant issue for the success of the project. The study would deal with this
in great detail and separately analyze each of the estate activity to de-
monstrate that it will be performed efficiently under the proposed arrange-
ments. It would also assess manpower needs and training requirements at
various management levels.
10.       The study should also identify other needs of the estates not
directly related to fish pond operations. Items such as housing, schooling,
roads and utilities should be considered in recommending the location of
estates.
(d) Construction Methods of Fish Ponds
11.       Besides recommending the optional pond layout which minimizes the
total excavation and dyke building, the study should compare mechanical
against manual construction methods. Capital costs, operating costs, speed
and quality of construction and employment potential, as well as availability
of trained manpower would be taken into account. In addition, related fac-
tors, as to organization of the construction, pooling of, and compensation
for, the labor of beneficiaries and ownership and payment for the shared
resources, especially if costly mechanized equipment is involved, would also
be evaluated for the two modes of construction. The study would, after com-
parison, recommend a mode of construction for the estates, giving schedules
and cost estimates. Phasing of construction might be desirable for effective
use of mechanized equipment; however, it would delay the increase in fish
production.  The trade-offs here would be considered.  Similarly, trade-offs
between the employment potential of manual mode of construction and the speed
and cost benefits from mechanized mode would be suitably covered in the study.
(e) Terms and Conditions
12.       Conditions for selection of a potential beneficiary and the proposed
terms of leasing and financing would be dealt with in the study. The study
would specify what constitutes adequate operational knowhow. If a prior
training course would be required, recommendations for implementation would
be made. Especially for a phased development program, the study would also
recommend means of ranking beneficiaries in order of priority for the allot-
ment of fish pond areas.
13.       The number of potential beneficiaries would be estimated for each
proposed project. The study would also estimate the loan amount required for
the establishment and operation of the smallholder fish ponds, taking into
account the proposals regarding estate organization, cost sharing and con-
struction methods. Terms and conditions of subloans would be recommended.



ANNEX 7
Page 4
14.       Government policy and operations in this sector would be important
to implement these estates and the study would recommend guidelines for the
Government as they relate to the goals of such a project. Issues relating to
leasing procedures and delays, technical service or others would be high-
lighted, if considered crucial.
(f) Project Financing
15.       Subloans would be made to smallholder under this project, and proper
loan supervision would be made. A suitable lending institution and its poli-
cies and operation with respect to this project would be recommended.
(g) Benefits from the Project
16.       Benefits from the project would be estimated.  Increased produc-
tion, nutritional benefits and social benefits would be quantified.  The
economic implications of increasing production through sallholder fish pond
estates as compared to large commercial operations would be examined, with
particular emphasis on income and employment effects.

The Development Bank of the Philippines 1/
Introduction
1.        DBP was established by statute in 1958 as a successor to the post-
war Rehabilitation Finance Corporation which in turn was an offshoot of the
Agricultural and Industrial Bank created in 1939. The nature and character
of the Bank has developed over a span of more than 30 years to become by
far the most important development finance institution of the Philippines.
2.        DBP has been vested with powers to engage in a wide range of
activities of which the principal ones are the following:
a)   Loans, guarantees and equity investments in private
enterprises in agriculture, industry and public
utilities.
b)   Loans to provincial and municipal authorities for self-
liquidating or income producing projects;
c)   Financing of purchasing, production and marketing
activities of cooperatives;
d)   Investments in the capital stock of private development
banks.
DBP may re-discount loans of the Philippine National Bank (PNB)
and of private development banks; it may underwrite, and do business in secu-
rities and lend for acquisition of shares of corporations by employees of
such corporations. Moreover, the Bank, under Government direction, from
time to time, has engaged in special lending programs for financing voca-
tional education and training, hospitals, schools and hotels, reconstruction
of housing and commercial buildings of calamity victims, and it has engaged
in other Government controlled undertakings, such as establishment and man-
agement of the Greater Manila Terminal Food Market, participation in the
National Housing Corporation manufacturing low cost housing units, etc.
3.        Subject to Presidential approval, DBP may issue its own bonds
and other debt instruments which are fully guaranteed by Government. It
1/ An exploratory Bank mission (DFC-Asia) visited DBP in May 1972 to enlarge
the Bank's knowledge of DBP. This annex is partly based on the findings
of the mission.



ANNEX 11
Page 2
may guarantee acceptance credits, loans and other obligations, local and
foreign, but the aggregate of DBP's direct obligations may not exceed
10 times its capital and surplus.
Management
4.        The DBP has a Board consisting of the Chairman and four full-time,
and four part-time Governors (2 positions vacant at present) appointed for a
period of 7 years by the President of the Republic with the consent of
Parliament. But, any change in the administration will normally cause the
entire Board to resign, to enable the incoming President to make any new
appointments he may desire. Presently the Chairman of the Board is the Chief
Executive Officer and he is assisted by three full-time Governors carrying
supervisory authority over groups of departments assigned to them. All
executive authority is vested in the Chairman and the three supervising
Governors. Delegation of authority to the Staff below the level of super-
vising Governors so far has been negligible.
5.        Table 1 gives the composition of the Board of Governors.  The
present Chairman of the Board, Mr. Leonides S. Virata, was appointed in
February 1970. Formerly a high official of the Central Bank, in the recent
past he has occupied prominent positions in private business. Energetic,
resourceful and capable, Mr. Virata since acceding to office, has endeavored
to reorganize the institution and to improve the standards of its operations.
Organization
6.        DBP has a large Head Office in Makati, approximately 10 miles south
of Manila, and a countrywide network of 26 branches and 29 agencies. As of
June 1972, the Bank had a total personnel complement of approximately 2,400
of which about half was assigned to the Head Office and half to the branches
and agencies. About 70% of the total work force are college graduates with
academic background and work experience in various professional fields such
as business management, accountancy, engineering, architecture and law.
There are 175 agriculturalists assigned to the Head Office and branches.
About 40% of the staff occupy managerial or professional positions.
7.        An Organization Chart of DBP is given in Chart No WB-7311.  Opera-
tional duties are allocated by function between several operational depart-
ments dealing with agriculture, industry, private development and rural
banks, real estate and local Governments. Supporting services are provided
by a large number of departments, including Accounting and Control, Treasury,
Administration, Credit Department, Collections and Acquired Assets Department
and the Economic Research Unit. The Legal and Auditing Departments are in a
special position since their managers and staff are appointed by, and respon-
sible to, the Department of Justice and the Auditor General of the Philippines
respectively. A large central unit titled Office of the Chairman, headed by
a Consultant to the Chairman, plays an important role in the decision making
process and in the coordination of DBP's overall operations.
8.        Operational procedures in general follow a standard pattern, al-
though there are considerable variations in the methods of project appraisals.



ANNEX 1 1
Page 3
Most operations departments have so far been guided in their investment deci-
sions primarily by security considerations and availability of collateral.
In the financial appraisal, they have extensively relied on the assistance
of the Credit Department which is in charge of the credit investigations.
The Industrial and the Investment Banking Departments are exceptions basing
their recommendations for proposed loans and investments on a complete and
comprehensive appraisal of the project. Under the bank's new project-oriented
loan policy, greater emphasis is being placed on comprehensive project
studies with adequate coverage of the economic and financial aspects of the
projects. After loan approval each operations Department monitors disburse-
ments, while collections are handled by the Collection Department. There
has so far been little supervision, if any, of the projects financed by DBP
loans.
9.        In general, DBP at present, has a complex organizational need stream-
lining structure and its operating procedures. There is much overlapping
and duplication in supervisory positions and lack of adequate delegation of
operational responsibilities to senior staff. The DBP staff appears reason-
ably competent and, with adequate training it can develop good standards of
operating efficiency as proven by its Industry and Investment Departments.
The IBRD advisor, seconded to DBP, is preparing an Operating Manual which
will set out work-flow and procedures for operations, filling an urgent need
for review, integration and codification of existing numerous, and in part
obsolete, instructions.
Financial Terms and Conditions
10.       The terms and conditions of DBP's loans, guarantees and investments
are set by the Board within the authority of the Charter, or they are de-
termined by Government direction in case of special financing programs. DBP's
interest rates, until August 27, 1970, were 9% on loans up to F 100,000 and
10% on loans above this amount. They have since been increased to 12% ir-
respective of the size of the loans, except when lower rates are stipulated
by law. Preferential interest rates have been allowed under DBP's special
lending programs, such as the programs for rice, piggeries and fowl produc-
tion, which carry staggered interest rates of 9% and 12% over fixed time
periods, or the DBP Jubilee Loan Program which provided for 9% interest
on all small loans up to t 5,000 during 1972, the bank's 25th anniversary.
The bank charges an additional 2% penalty interest per month on past-due
amortization. As security for the loans, DBP will accept collateral in
the form of real estate, machinery, livestock and leasehold rights on Gov-
ernment lands. Usually the bank will require 50% of the loan to be secured
by real estate mortgage and the balance by other collateral such as machinery,
livestock, etc. Up to 70% of the appraised value of the titled real estate
property and 50% of the untitled property are allowed as collateral for the
loans. In exceptional case of small loans (foreshore and river fishermen)
the guarantee of two solvent guarantors is accepted in place of real estate.
11.       Agriculture.  The terms and conditions of agricultural loans vary,
depending upon the type of project and nature of the investment, but fall
into two basic categories, straight loans and loans granted under special
financing programs. There are many special lending programs including 6



ANNEX 11

for the fisheries industries. Generally, repayment terms range from 9 months
to two years for working capital including the purchase of seeds, fertilizer
etc. to a maximum of 15 years for long term capital investments in coconut
and rubber plantations. Periods of grace for payment of principal and
interest range from 1-3 years and may be extended up to 7-9 years in the
exceptional case of loans for coconut and rubber plantations.
12.       Industry.  Maturities of industrial loans range from one to five
years for working capital loans, and five to ten years for financing of
capital investments. Due to repayment difficulties, many loan accounts
have been "reconstructed" i.e. converted from short-term into medium-and
long-term or have been given extended maturities. Repayment terms on foreign
credits guaranteed by DBP are usually short-term, generally about one year.
Any payment made by DBP on a defaulted loan guaranteed by DBP becomes an
"!advance on guarantee" which theoretically is repayable on demand. In 1971,
the Central Bank established minimum repayment periods, ranging from 5 to
15 years, for all foreign credits. DBP's standard interest rate of 12% p.a.
is generally applicable to all industrial lending, except for loans up to
i 5,000 which, during the bank's anniversary year 1972, have been allowed
a rate of 9%. Interest rates on DBP's preferred shares, fixed by law, range
from 1% for the first five years to 2% during the following five years and
3% thereafter. The going market rate for preferred shares of private
companies is 12%. On guarantees, DBP charges 1% one time commission on
face value of the guarantee, plus 1% p.a. on the unutilized amount and 1-1/2%
p.a. on the outstanding amount.  Advances on guarantees carry 12% p.a. in-
terest. The Bank also charges a processing fee on all applications for in-
dustrial loans and guarantees ranging from V 15 to V 5,000.
Operational Progress
13.       DBP provides a great variety of financial services, including
loans, equity investments and guarantees, covering most sectors of the
economy, with industry and agriculture topping the list.  Aggregate finan-
cial assistance, including Reconstruction Finance Corporation (RFC) operations,
since its inception in 1947, to June 30, 1972, amounted to V 12.2 billion
(see Table 2). Of this over 82% was for industry, 8% for agriculture,
5% for real estate, and the balance for other sectors including private
development banks and Government projects. DBP's operational build-up is
relatively recent, dating back to 1966, shortly after DBP began implementing
its program of guarantees of suppliers' credits; about 70% of the V 12.2
billion total investments mentioned above have been approved in the past
five years. Guarantees, although undertaken only since 1965, now repre-
sent r 7.1 billion or 58% of total DBP approvals, loans and equity invest-
ments accounting for V 4.5 billion (37%) and V 0.6 billion (5%) respectively.
14.       The annual volume of operations has fluctuated widely.  Due in
part to lack of resources and partly to the prudence of the new management,
approvals of industrial guarantees in FY 1970/71 dropped to $61 million
and loans to f 9 million from a peak of $267 million and F 341 million
respectively in the preceding year. Loans to agriculture showed a less
drastic decline from t 71 million in 1969/70 to V 24 million in 1970/71.



ANNEX 1 1
Page 5
In 1971/72 there has been a moderate recovery in DBP financing activities,
with approvals of guarantees and loans to industry totalling $196 million
and V 61 million respectively and loans to agriculture ' 55 million. As of
June 30, 1972 DBP's portfolio of outstanding loans, guarantees and invest-
ments totalled 1 5.7 billion in regard to 105,550 clients (See Table 3).
Agricultural Financing
15.       As a Government Bank, DBP has directed its lending to support
government policy of national programs to increase production of food crops
and animal proteins. Its lending policies are influenced by economic guide-
lines set by the Central Bank, the National Economic Council, the National
Food and Agricultural Commission and the Fiscal Committee of Government.
In 1972, DBP launched a Countrywide Development Program to implement the
Government's plan to disperse economic activities to the countryside, to
meet food production targets and to provide for the establishment of small
and medium scale activities. Traditionally, DBP's annual lending has been
20-25% for agriculture, 65-70% for industry and the balance for real estate,
local government and miscellaneous loan programs.  This pattern of 25 years
operations was drastically changed as a result of DBP's guarantees of
foreign loans for industries (para 15). The distribution was then 82% for
industry, 8% for agriculture and 10% for other sectors. The sectoral dis-
tribution of DBP loans to agriculture is given in Table 4, of which 13% has
been for fisheries (salt production, fish ponds and marine fisheries). Up
to June 30, 1972, DBP approved loans totalling ) 1,070 million to 174,901
borrowers. Annual lending which had ranged between 10,000-15,000 farm loans
dropped to an average of less than 9,000 in 1969/70 and 1971/72 after reach-
ing a low of 5,000 in 1970/71. Average loans for food crops have been under
j 5,000; commercial crops about 1 7,500 and livestock, about t 15,000.
16.       Fisheries.  Loans to the fisheries industries to June 30, 1972,
amounted to r 137.4 million representing 12.8% of DBP's total loans to agri-
culture. This includes 5,343 loans for the inland fisheries sector and 497
loans for deep-sea fishing. Financing of the inland fisheries sector was
either in the form of straight loans (y 21.0 million) or it was covered
under special credit programs including the Special Fishpond Financing Plan
and the Large Scale Fishpond Financing Program, the former taking by far the
largest share in total credits extended to the inland fisheries sector
(1 42.5 million). These programs provide for the financing of projects for
the expansion or improvement of existing fishponds or the establishment of
new ones ranging in size from 1 ha (small scale) to 50 ha and above (large-
scale). Terms of the loans generally are for 10 years including 2 to 3 years
grace periods, at 12% p.a. interest. DBP requires that these loans are
secured by titled or untitled real estate property of a loan value of not
less than 50% of the loan. Assignment of leasehold rights is accepted only
as supplementary security on projects located on leased land. The requirement
of real estate collateral as security for the loans has had adverse effects
on the progress of these credit operations, as most of the potential borrowers
operate ponds on land leased from the Government and lack the necessary real
estate required as security. There are other special financing programs for
the inland fisheries sector providing, inter-alia, credits for fingerling-pond



ANNEX 1 1
Page 6
operations, fishpond fertilization, shrimp production and for small foreshore
and river fishing. The combined total of credits extended under these pro-
grams amounted to Y 4.7 million. DBP's loans to the marine fisheries sector
oover the acquisition of various types of fishing vessels, of ship machinery
and equipment, and fishing paraphernalia used largely in deep sea fishing.
The loans are normally for a term of 5 years at a rate of interest of 12%.
To secure the loans, DBP requires collateral of real estate for half of the
value of the loan, the other half to be covered by chattel mortgage of the
vessel or the equipment to be acquired. These security requirements, similar
bo those in DBP fishpond-financing, have been an impediment to an expansion
of credits in this sector. In addition, the lack of proper insurance made it
difficult for the financial institution to assert its rights in the case of
default.
17.       In the past 3 fiscal years, DBP credits to the fisheries sector
have been at low levels, declining from an average of t 11 million in the 3
year period of FY's 1965/66 to 1967/68 to I 3.9 million in FY 1971/72 after
reaching a low of ' 0.9 million in FY 1970/71. This was due in part to the
Lack of funds and also to DBP's strict security requirements based on
real estate collateral.
Industrial Financing
18.       Financing of industry in the form of loans, guarantees and equity
investments has so far been the major part of DBP's financial operations.
The bank's financial assistance practically covered all industrial activity
including mining and utilities. In spite of the proliferation of small
accounts, the bulk of DBP's portfolio is heavily weighed with a small number
of large loans. Up to June 30, 1972, DBP had approved V 10,261 million
for industry in regard to over 18,000 financial transactions as follows:
Number              Total
(Peso Million)
Loans                              17,760                2,544

*    Converted into Pesos at exchange rate 1 6.50 = US$1.0.
19.       Loans.  Food processing and trade have been the biggest beneficia-
ries of DBP financing, with the rice and corn sub-sectors receiving the
largest share, followed by sugar and other food products industries. In



ANNEX 11
Page 7
the manufacturing field, textiles, metal working, cement and electrical
industries took the major share. Loans for public utilities and services,
in particular for land transportation and shipping are also important. DBP's
credits to industry, until 1966, were mainly in the form of straight loans
in local currency. A considerable part of the proceeds of these loans
was converted by the borrowers into foreign currencies for financing imports.
In 1966, after it has begun its program of guarantees of foreign credits,
DBP stopped granting loans for imports. Due to financial difficulties re-
sulting from the guarantee operations, DBP in 1970 practically suspended
its lendings. Loan approvals dropped from t 341 million in PY 1969/70 to
r 9 million and they have continued at a low level of V 61 million in FY
1971/72.
20.       Equity Investments.  Up to June 30, 1972, DBP had made equity in-
vestments in the aggregate amount of V 610 million. Investments in private
industry totalled V 354 million including V 149 million common shares and
V 205 million preferred shares. The latter shares were acquired by DBP in
the course of a program of "rehabilitation of distressed industries" started
in 1965. The Program was initiated at a time when, as a result of a general
rela,xation of economic controls, many industries financed by DBP were in fi-
nancial difficulties because of competitive imports. It involved large scale
conversion by DBP of some of its important industrial accounts into preferred
shares convertible into common shares of these subscriptions. It also re-
quired a massive extension and rescheduling of repayment terms of problem
accounts. DBP, on the other hand, floated V 500 million of "Progress Bonds"
convertible into preferred shares of the industries held by DBP. Progress
bonds, however, have been placed mainly with various Government agencies
and institutional investors. DBP has also made investments in preferred
shares of four government corporations totalling 1 227 million and in 31
private development banks totalling 1 29 million.
21.       Guarantees.  In 1965, DBP launched a program of guarantees of
foreign loans and credits as a means to enable its clients to secure
suppliers' credits for the importation of equipment and raw materials.
Guarantees rapidly became the main instrument of DBPs financing of industrial
projects aggregating as of September 30, 1972, on an approval basis, $1,089
million. About 88% of the guarantees made by DBP were "regular" guarantees
granted to cover foreign suppliers' credits and 12% representing guarantees
given by DBP as administrating agency of two foreign government credits,
i.e. the US Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) and the Canadian Wheat Board
(CWB), for the importation of raw cotton and tobacco and of wheat flour
respectively. Under all these foreign guarantees the borrowers bear the
foreign exchange risk. DBP has also made guarantees of Peso borrowings
of its clients from local commercial banks totalling 1 114 million, of which
r 39 million was outstanding as of September 30, 1972 (see Table 5).
22.       The large volume of guarantees made by DBP in 1966/69 coupled
with the difficult economic position of the Philippines in 1970 has had a
profound adverse effect on DBP's financial position and operations. The
introduction of the floating exchange rate in February 1970 created a
general liquidity crisis for Philippine industry producing primarily for



ANNEX 1 1
Page 8
the domestic market and depending heavily on imported inputs. As a
result of the de-facto devaluation of the Peso the industries which had
foreign exchange liabilities, faced an increase in their liabilities of over
60%. Moreover, many foreign creditors invoked "economic disorders" in
the Philippines early in 1970 as a reason to demand immediate repayment of
cash loans guaranteed by DBP. These difficulties created massive defaults
on the part of the DBP clients forcing DBP to make good on its guarantees
by repaying foreign creditors and converting DBP guarantee accounts into
"radvances on guaranteed loans". At the time of the Peso devaluation in
February 1970, DBP's outstanding foreign liabilities amounted to $610
millioe of which $547 million was represented by debts guaranteed by DBP.
During the 15 months ended June 30, 1971, DBP made repayments in foreign
exchange totalling $236 million of which $205 million was for guaranteed
debt.
23.       To make these payments DBP had to make use of almost all its
loan collections and emergency funds obtained from the Government and the
Central Bank, virtually stopping all new lending to industry in FY 1970/71.
Important remedial steps have been taken since resulting in a considerable
improvement in the situation. The Central Bank has issued guidelines and
strict regulations regarding foreign borrowings and suppliers' credits.
The Board of Investment has been set up to approve private sector industrial
projects on the basis of pre-determined priorities. DBP in the light of
past experience and under the new management, has considerably tightened up
its approval procedure and has reduced its overall exposure in foreign
credit guarantees.
Other Financing
24.       Real Estate Loans.  Loans in this category, covering construction
of low cost housing and commercial buildings, in earlier years received
high priority in DBP operations, but recently appear to have been losing
importance. As of June 30, 1972, total real estate loans outstanding
numbered 13,021 for an amount of r 148 million, representing about 2-1/2%
of the total of DBP's loans, investments and guarantees outstanding. This
included loans for about 8,000 low cost housing projects, 45 hotels and
30 schools.
25.       Government Loans.  These loans are made to provincial and municipal
governments, with the approval of the Finance Secretary, for the financing
of income producing projects such as markets, slaughter houses, waterworks,
power plants, telephone systems and transportation projects. As of June
30, 1972, DBP had outstanding 1 54.5 million in respect of 241 such projects.
The loans are usually guaranteed by local governments, and DBP has a claim
on these government's share of the federal income.
26.       Private Development Banks (PDB).  The promotion and establishment
of private development banks in cities and provinces is a major function
of DBP under its Charter, with the principal objective of bringing financing
facilities to small enterprises in remote locations. DBP's assistance is
given through subscription of shares, and through rediscount privileges.



ANNEX 11
Page 9
As a principal shareholder (DBP usually holds 50% of the share capital),
DBP is represented on the Board of the PDB's and assists in the selection
of their managers and sometimes provides training facilities for their
staff. Since the introduction of the program in 1960, DBP has helped to
establish 35 private development banks of which 31 are operative. As of
December 31, 1971, DBP has invested in the PDB system ' 24 million as
preferred shares and V 27 million in re-discount notes. Total resources
of the PDB's aggregated about V 182 million, with a combined loan portfolio
of i 145 million. Agricultural lending accounted for about 60% and loans to
small industries about 30%. The banks charge interest rates of 12%, and loan
terms are from 3 to 10 years, depending on the nature of the enterprise and
kind of 4nvestment.  Agricultural loans average between ' 5,000 to ) 6,000.
Total lending of the system in 1971 amounted to I 49 million, representing an
average of r 1.5 million for each institution. This would indicate that the
PDB's have so far played a minor role in the rural credit structure.
27.       Greater Manila Terminal Food Market.  In 1967, DBP was given the
responsibility to promote, develop and operate a combined producer-transit-
wholesale market. Located about 20 miles south of Manila, the project is
intended to become a vast distribution center for agricultural produce, ini-
tially serving 1 million farmers from principal supplier provinces in Luzon,
Visayas and Mindanao. It is believed that the project cost, originally es-
timated as Y 150 million, will reach ) 500 million before completion. Con-
struction progress appears largely to depend on availability of adequate
finance, the sources of which have as yet to be clearly established.
28.       Miscellaneous Operations.  The DBP, under Government direction from
time to time, has carried out a number of other special operations. Jointly
with other Government finance institutions, the bank has helped to establish
and finance the National Housing and Finance Corporation, the Trade Corpora-
tion, The National Export Trade Corporation etc. It has invested in Rural
Banks on behalf of the Government out of allocations of income of the Central
Bank. DBP also has been assigned by the Government to act as the Adminis-
trator of the two IBRD loans for the Grain Processing and the Livestock proj-
ects (720-PH and 823-PH).
Capitalization (Table 6)
29.       DBP's Peso resources as of September 30, 1972, consisted of the
following:



ANNEX 11
Page 10
Peso Million
Capital (authorized F 2 billion),
;reserves and provisions                          525
Export tax receipts                                 282
Bonds and notes                                   1.,453
Time and savings deposits                           340
Borrowings from Government                          424
Trust funds                                         196
Total Peso funds
30a       Capital and Sources.   The paid in capital was V 398 million well
below the authorised amount V 2,000 million.  DBP's Charter provides for
only two automatic sources for pay-in of DBP's capital i.e. (i) transfers
to capital account of 20% of DBP's annual income, and (ii) transfer of 50%
of War Reparation collections. The two sources have generated very small
amounts in tne past and they may not be expected to increase significantly
in the future. To achieve a sound financial structure, additional sources
of capitalization would have to be sought, including the possibility of
conversioa of funds already made available to DBP by the Government or the
Central Bank in the form of loans, advances, bonds or deposits.
31.       Export Tax Receipts.  Under the Export Tax Law of 1970, 24% of
proceeds of the export tax are transferred to DBP for granting loans to
export industries and for agricultural projects. Transfers to DBP of this
tax to date, total V 282 million. The export tax is levied for a period
of four years and is expected to generate for DBP an estimated V 400-500
million. As no repayment obligation seems to exist for DBP, these funds
may be considered as quasi-equity.
32.       Bonds and Notes.  Outstanding DBP bonds totalled V 1,185 million,
consisting of F 724 million "Ordinary Bonds" carrying interest rates varying
from 0 - 9%, and V 461 million "Progress Bonds", all guaranteed by Government.
The major part of the ordinary bonds is held by the Central Bank and the
balance by various Government agencies which under the DBP Charter are re-
quired to invest 25% of their investable funds into DBP bonds. Progress
bonds have maturities of 8 to 10 years and are convertible into preferred
shares subscribed by DBP in industrial companies. The interest rate of
these bonds has been raised in 1971 from 7% to 9%. Of the V 500 million
Progress Bonds originally issued, V 461 million was outstanding, of which
about 65% was held by government institutions, 25% by institutional investors
and about 10% by private individuals.
33.       Peso Borrowings and Deosits.  Borrowings are stated as V 424 mil-
lion of which a 405 million represent loans from Government made in 1970/71.
This includes a long term Government loan of V 93 million payable in 1990,
and a short term loan from the Central Bank of F 312 million, which falls
due in 1973. Of the deposits totalling V 340 million, all but V 19 million
comes from the Government with apparently no clear repayment arrangements
made. Most of these loans and deposits from the Government and the Central



ANNEX 11
Page 11
Bank were made in 1970/71 to help DBP in an emergency situation. DBP's
long-term notes, maturing in 1972 to 1980, are at varying interest up to 7%.
The outstanding notes in the amount of j 268 million are held by various
Government institutions, notably the Social Security System (SSS).
34.       Trust Funds.  DBP, under special legislation, has the responsi-
bility of administering 16 trust funds of various Government agencies and
institutions. These funds are invested in loans, securities and other in-
vestments as authorized by their respective charters and all earnings there-
from accrue to the funds, after deduction of a nominal DBP administration
fee. As of September 30, 1972, the combined outstanding balance of these
funds amounted to ) 196 million. By far the largest of the funds were the
Postal Savings Bank Fund and the Rural Bank Trust Fund, sharing about * 79
million and V 74 million of the combined total balance. The Rural Bank Trust
Fund was established in 1952 for the purpose of subscribing to the capital
stock of rural banks from Government contributions. It has been receiving
yearly appropriations from net profits of the Central Bank with DBP serving
as a channel.
Foreign Borrowings
35.       DBP's total foreign borrowings have grown from a level of $74 mil-
lion in June 30, 1967, to US$93.1 million of March 1972. The small increase
was due to the availability, starting in 1970, of commodity credits from the
Canadian Wheat Board, (CWB) and the US Commodity Corporation (CCC). Other
foreign borrowings are being amortized without additional drawings, so that
the balances have been declining. DBP, since its inception, has availed
itself of only two credit lines guaranteed by the Government. The first
were credit agreements with 14 US banks drawn in 1963, in an authorised
amount of $114 million, which, but for a balance of $4 million, has been
fully repaid. The second was a credit line from the Kreditanstalt fuer
Wiederaufbau, drawn in 1967-1968 in the amount of DM 40 million, of which
DM 35.3 million is outstanding. All other foreign borrowings of DBP have
been for lendings to specific firms or for the financing of equipment imports
used in specific projects. Such lines of credit include the two IBRD agri-
cultural loans and the CWB and CCC commodity credits. In November 1972, DBP
contracted a loan from a syndicate of foreign banks in the amount of $50 mil-
lion. While no details were available to the mission on this new foreign
credit, it is understood that the loan is for 5 years at an interest rate of
7% p.a.
Earnings Record
36.       Summary Income Statements for fiscal years 1966/67 to 1971/72
and the 3 month period ended September 30, 1972, are given in Table 7.
DBP's net income has been fairly stable at about t 28 million p.a. until
FY 1970/71 when it declined to a level of V 19 million at which it has
continued in 1971/72 (annual rate). This decline was caused mainly by an
increase in the bank's financial charges due to higher interest paid, and
partly by higher administrative overheads. Net income before tax, measured
as percent of average loans and investments outstanding, declined to 1.7%



ANNEX l1
Page 12
in FY 1969/70 and 0.7% in FY 1970/71 from an average 2.3% in the preceding
three fiscal years (1966/67 to 1968/69). If contingent assets underlying
guarantees are included in the portfolio, the ratio would be about 0.3 for
the past two years compared to average 2.1% for the preceding 3 year period.
Administrative charges while increasing in absolute amounts, have actually
declined in relative terms in the past three years to an average 2.2% of
average total investments compared to 2.7% in the preceding three year pe-
riod. This is due to the magnitude of DBP operations and in part to a
general economy drive recently started by the bank's management (see Table 8).
Financial Position
37.       Comparative balance sheets for June 30, 1967 to 1972 and
September 30, 1972 are shown in Table 9. On September 30, 1972, DBP's
total assets amounted to F 4.1 billion and total liabilities V 3.6 billion
representing an increase over the position in June 30, 1967 of 2.4 times
and 2.8 times. However, contingent liabilities reached a total of t 2.5
billion, an increase of 12.5 times, due to the massive expansion of DBP's
foreign debt guarantee operations in the past 3-1/2 years. Outstanding
guarantees on February 29, 1972 totalled t 2,534 million 1/ (all but V 39
million of which was foreign guarantees) representing 63% of DBP's total
assets. This huge volume of guarantee commitments represents a serious
potential financial risk, considering the poor repayment record of DBP's
guaranteed clients in the past (see paragraph 40).
38.       Net worth stood at V 525 million representing an increase over
the 5 year period of only V 100 million derived mainly from allocations to
contingency reserve and from accumulation of yearly surpluses. The ratio
of net worth to total liabilities over the past 5 years has shown a con-
tinuous deterioration. If contingent liabilities are included, the ratio
on September 30, was 11.3 : 1, exceeding the ceiling set by the bank's
Charter of 10 : 1. However, the ratio would decrease to about 7.0 : 1, if
the Export Tax receipts (t 282 million), already given to DBP, are included.
But even this lower ratio appears rather high, considering the relatively
poor quality of DBP's loan portfolio and the inadequate level of reserves
(see paragraphs 39-42).
Quity of Portfolio
39.       Loans.  There are no complete data available, at present, on DBP
loans in arrears. However, calculations based on statistics of the bank's
Electronic Data Processing Center, which serves about half of DBP's indus-
trial loans, and one third of its agricultural loans (by amounts) indicate
a high proportion of defaults in particular on industrial and agricultural
loans. A review of the position as of March 31, 1972 revealed that of the
industrial loans served by the Center, 89% were affected by defaults, and
1/ Foreign accounts converted into Pesos at V 6.50 - US$1.0.



ANNEX 1 1
Page 13
that the principal in default represented 27% of the total of loans outstand-
ing in this sector. The corresponding figures for agriculture were 72% and
21% respectively. Within the agricultural sector, loans to the fisheries
industries have shown a relatively high rate of defaults, apparently, in
large part related to lendings extended to these industries in DBP's earlier
years of operations (para 44 and Table 11). The DBP's Treasurers and Control
Department has under preparation a comprehensive statistical statement on
DBP's defaulted loans containing an analysis of the loans in arrears accord-
ing to type, size, maturities, and aging of the loans. Pending completion
of this statement, the above mentioned figures can be taken only as indica-
tive of the problem. Acquired Assets and Litigation Accounts as of March 31,
1972, amounted to 1 211 million including 1 145 million, representing loans
foreclosed whose collateral has been taken over by DBP, and 1 66 million,
representing loans foreclosed in regard to which legal action was underway.
By comparison, DBP's reserves and surplus amounted to 1 121 million.
40.       Guarantees.  Of the total r 1,376 million guarantee instalments
falling due in the post-floating rate period, March 1, 1970, to March 31,
1972, only 1 132 million was paid by DBP clients as due, while 1 1,126 mil-
lion (90%), had to be advanced by DBP in payments on behalf of defaulting
clients or converted into long-term loans. Up to September 30, 1972, these
advances totalled 1 1,512 million, of which 1 421 million had been repaid,
and 1 245 million was converted into long term loans, leaving a balance of
r 846 million "due and repayable" on demand (see Table 10).
41.       Defaults.  The high proportion of loans in default to some extent
may be attributed to past lax collections. Since 1970, DBP's management has
considerably stepped up its collection efforts and it has introduced a black
listing system, whereby DBP defaulted borrowers are denied foreign exchange
and credit facilities by the Central Bank until their accounts with DBP have
been straightened out. As a result, collections of principal and interest
have increased from 1 279 million in FY 1969/70 to t 495 million in FY 1970/71
and f 412 million in the first nine months of FY 1971/72. The major part of
defaulted loans appear generally to be well secured by collateral, although
the final recovery of this debt will nevertheless depend on the ultimate
success or failure of the enterprises financed.
42.       From DBP's records it is not possible, at present, to establish
the extent of possible losses inherent in its portfolio. The statistical
analysis now under preparation, should provide some clarification of the
magnitude of the problem. It could be the first step in a thorough examina-
tion and evaluation of DBP's entire portfolio of loans guarantees and equity
investments, which needs to be undertaken to provide the basis for a realistic
assessment of the amount of bad debts in the portfolio, and a considered judg-
ment of the necessary provisions required to cover it. Appropriate compre-
hensive action in this matter is clearly indicated, and should be given the
earliest consideration by DBP's management.
43.       Defaults Fisheries Loans.  For example, on June 30, 1972, the
total of loans past due in amortization amounted for this sector to 1 15.8
million, representing 44% of total loans outstanding compared to an estimated



ANNEX I 1
Page 14
21% for loans to Agriculture as a whole and 27% for industry.  Loans to
foreshore fisheries showed the highest proportion of defaults (60%) followed
by marine fisheries (48%) and fishponds (38%), the largest number of accounts
in arrears being in the category of small loans (f 1,000 to V 2,000) and
medium sized loans (r 10,000 to r 50,000). However, looking into the aging
of these defaults, loans with delinquencies of less than two years contribute
14% and less than four years 23%. Loans with delinquencies of over five
years comprise about 59% of total loan amounts outstanding (Table 11).
44.       No comprehensive data are available at present on bad debt-liquida-
tion, altlhough from the following fragmentary figures it appears that gener-
ally slow progress has been made in requisite legal action:
Loans Past Due in Fisheries Sector
% of Total
Number       t '000         Past Due
Total Delinquencies        1,484        15,858           100
of which:
-  five years and over  1,109         12,178            77
-  loans in litigation    220          3,038            20
Similarly, there is no complete record on assets acquired in bad-debt-liquida-
tion, and Cll the rate of financial recoveries. Figures for recent years, how-
ever, would seem to indicate that net loss from sales of acquired assets so
far has been moderate being in part off-set by profits realized in such sales.
45.       Fisheries Guarantee Fund.  Government and DBP are presently
discussing to use the Fisheries Guarantee Fund for covering potential bad
debts for loans in the fisheries sector. If the fund were to be used in
this further clarification would be required. In particular: (1) estimated
total resources of the Government's Guarantee Fund, (2) the size of provi-
sions for bad debt required in DBP's fisheries operations, (3) the percentage
of coverage of losses from write-offs of defaulted loans in these operations,
and (4) the methods of transfer to DBP of Fund contributions in covering
these losses.
(a)  The Fisheries Industry Development Decree provides that
all revenues accruing to the Government from dues, levies
and other payments to Government by the marine fisheries
industries shall be assigned to the Fisheries Guarantee
Fund. The estimated total of annual accruals from this
source has as yet to be established, as well as the
availability of additional allocations from an agricul-
tural fund administered by the Ministry of Agriculture,
which has been tentatively discussed as a possible sup-
plementary source of support to the fisheries industries.



ANNEX 11
Page 15
(b) A thorough examination and evaluation of the DBP's fisheries
loan portfolio should be made, to establish a realistic
estimate of the amount of bad loans in the portfolio. A
review would also be needed of the bank's policy in the
liquidation of defaulted loans in the fisheries sector and
the amount of losses recorded in the process. This could
form the basis for determining the size of provisions required
for covering DBP's potential losses from future write-offs
of bad loans, taking into account the expected improvement
in the borrower's performance under new loans, granted on
the basis of improved lending and follow-up procedures.
(c) In the light of this analysis, an agreement would have to
be reached between DBP and government on the extent and
the size of the Funds contributions in covering losses
from the liquidation of defaulted loans.
(d) Appropriate arrangements would have to be made concerning
the methods of transfer of Fund allocations to DBP in
covering losses from potential write-offs on defaulted
fisheries loans. This could be done by refund to DBP of
the agreed proportion of the Fund's share in these losses
on an annual basis. Alternatively, consideration could
be given to DBP setting up a Special Reserve for Bad Debts
of the Fisheries Industries which would be provided by
initial contributions of the Government's Guarantee Fund
and the DBP respectively in agreed proportions, based on
a realistic estimate of potential losses on the fisheries
credit operations over a foreseeable time period. Supple-
mentary allocations to the Reserve Fund could be made, as
and when indicated by the level of its balance.
Audit
46.       DBP has an independent audit system, the manager and staff of
the department being appointed by, and responsible to, the Auditor General
of the Republic. Equipped with a large staff located in the head office
and the branches of DBP, the Department engages in fairly detailed
auditing procedure, involving day-to-day checks of accounts and records
and some pre-audit in the operation. For the purposes of this project
present internal audit procedures and quality would be adequate.

FISHERIES CREDIT PROJECT
Project Organisation and Management
DBP's Fisheries Group
General
1.        The Appraisal Mission has explored the possibility of alternative
channels for the proposed Bank loan for the Fisheries Credit Project. These
investigations have generally confirmed that DBP would be the institution
best suited to serve as a channel for the loan, particularly since DBP:
(a) is the principal development finance agency of Government
funds for the development of the country's agriculture and
industry;
(b) acts as the Government's agent in international operations,
including relending of Government borrowings from foreign
Governments and international institutions;
(C) is the principal source of medium- and long-term finance
for agriculture and industry;
(d) has professional staff to set up a suitable organization
for the administration of the project;
(e) maintains a wide network of branches enabling the distri-
bution of its credits on a broad geographical basis; and
(f) has gained considerable experience in fisheries credit
operations from earlier large scale lendings, covering
most of the medium- and long-term credit requirements of the
inland fisheries sector, and a large part of those of the
marine fisheries sector.
Organization of the Fisheries Group
2.        The DBP Agricultural Project Department would be responsible for
the Fisheries Credit Project, with the Fisheries Division in charge of
the operation. The Agricultural Projects Department has recently been
reorganized along functional lines and now comprises 4 functional Groups
(with different subdivisions) including the Fisheries Group, the office of
the Manager and a Management Services Group. APD has a staff of over 220,
mostly agriculturalists and agricultural economists, with academic degrees,



ANNEX 12
Page 2
and agricultural technicians trained in various fields of agricultural
activity. An Executive Officer, with long time service and administrative
experience in the DBP, carries over-all responsibilities and some executive
functions delegated to him by the Supervising Governor, in the operation
of the Department. The Manager, in charge of the Department, is assisted
by several Assistant Managers responsible for the respective functional
Groups.  (See Organizational Chart, No. WB-7313.  A draft Manual of Procedures
has been prepared for the Department, but most of the proposed changes have
yet to be implemented and details will have to be worked out in regard to
comprehensive procedures for project appraisal and loan supervision.
3.        The Fisheries Group, consisting of two Sections serving the
inland fisheries and marine fisheries sectors respectively is headed by an
Assistant Manager who reports to the Manager of APD. The Assistant Manager
is assisted by a Division Chief supervising the two Sections, each of which
is headed by a Head Project Supervisor. Each Section has a complement of
Loan Analysts and Loan Processors responsible for preparation of the project
appraisal and loan recommendations, and Project Supervisors in charge of
supervision of loan releases and follow up on projects. (See Organization
Chart No. WB-7314.)
4.        The organizational set up and lending procedures of the Group
raise a number of aspects bearing on the requirements of an efficient ope-
ration:
(a)  The project appraisals presently carried ct solely by
technical staff, based on the contributions of the Credit
and Rural Estate Departments, lack completeness and usually
comprise only a limited financial analysis;
(b) Investment decisions are largely based on the availability of
collateral of the borrowers, in disregard of the financing
requirements of the project, often resulting in under-
capitalization of projects and their subsequent financial
failure;
(c) There is a preponderance of senior supervisory staff, often
in duplicating functions and lacking adequate delegation of
responsibilities, resulting in slow operational progress and
frequent delays in loan approvals;
(d) There is need for a greater diversification of professional
staff and for some staff reinforcements particularly in the
financial field;
(e) A review of senior staff assignments is needed and some
replacements in supervisory positions should be considered
based on managerial capacities and professional skills; and



ANNEX 12
Page 3
(f) There is no clear separation of operational functions from
those of loan follow-up, both activities in each section
being supervised by common project head supervisors.
5.        The Mission has discussed these shortcomings with management
and made proposals for organizational improvements. The management has
agreed in principle to these proposals, the final details of which will
have to be worked out:
(a) The Fisheries Group would be divided into two separate
units (divisions); i.e. (i) a Project Appraisal Division
responsible for the appraisal of projects and processing
of loan applications, and (ii) a Project Supervision
Division responsible for the loan supervision and project
follow-up. Each division would be headed by a senior
officer responsible to the Assistant Manager. The Assistant
Manager, or a capable officer of equal seniority, would have
full responsibility for the entire Fisheries Credit operation
both on the lending and the loan follow-up side. (See Organi-
zational Chart No. WB-7312.)
(b) The Project Appraisal Division would have a key staff of two
experienced senior fisheries experts (specialists in marine
fisheries and in-land fisheries operation respectively)
and one senior financial analyst experienced in financial
planning under a senior Chief Supervisor. This group would be
responsible for processing loan applications for fisheries
projects received by the Head Office and for review and
endorsement of loan proposals submitted by the branch
offices. In addition, as required by the operation, there
would be a complement of fisheries graduates and technicians,
specialized in inland and marine fisheries, and a small
number of financial analysts who would form working teams in
the appraisal of projects. Each team would consist of one
technician and one financial analyst, the senior member
carrying responsibility for coordination of work and the
preparation of the report and recommendations to the Board.
The teams would receive supporting services from the Credit,
Real Estate and Economic Research Departments in regard to
credit appraisals of borrowers, valuation of the collateral
offered, and resources-and market reviews, as needed. The
assignment of responsibilities for the project to one senior
officer would ensure efficient and speedy work progress and
eliminate frequent delays in the loan operation. Preparation
of legal documents, maintenance of loan accounts and disburse-
ments and collections of the loans would, as at present, be
the responsibility of the Legal, Accounts, Treasurers, and
Loan Collections Departments. (See Chart No. WB-7386 for a
prcposed work-flow.)



ANNEX 12
Page 4
(c) The Project Supervision Division would carry responsibilities
for project follow-up after approval of the subloan, in
cooperation with the Management Services Division of the
APD in charge of subloan administration. The Division would
have a small technical and administrative staff working
under a senior Chief Supervisor, which would report through
the Division Chief to the Assistant Manager. This Division
would be assigned the responsibility for supervision
of the projects financed by the Head Office and would
supervise the loan follow-up of the branch offices. In
the review of the physical and financial progress of the
projects, the supervisor personnel would avail themselves,
wherever needed, of the professional assistance of the
operational staff. Appropriate records would be set up
in the Supervision Section of the Fisheries Division and
in the branch offices on the status of the projects
financed under the fisheries credit project, based on
field visits to the projects and periodical progress
reports furnished by the borrowers.
6.        In line with the general re-orientation of DBP's lending policies,
loan approvals under the Fisheries Credit Project would be based on a com-
prehensive appraisal of the technical feasibility, economic viability and
financial soundness of the projects (See Appendix 1). The bank's security
requirements would remain an important, though not overruling consideration,
in the final investment decision. Supervision of the loans would be newly
organized to provide for a continuous follow-up on the projects during their
construction and operations during the repayment period. Projects encounter-
ing construction difficulties or financial or operational problems would be
placed under special surveillance and prompt and comprehensive measures
would be taken for extended technical advice and assistance, or additional
financial support if needed. The Loan Supervision Section would maintain
appropriate overall records on the status of all projects financed under
the Fisheries Credit Project. Moreover, DBP would monitor a number of
selected projects under the subloans for periodical evaluations of the
economic impact of the Fisheries Credit Program. It would submit regular
reports to the IBRD on the status of the projects financed from the subloans
and on the overall progress of the Credit Program.   The Mission maintained
close contact with the IBRD Adviser, seconded to DBP concerning its organi-
zational proposals, and he will follow up on these proposals.
Staffing Requirements
7.        At present the Fisheries Group has only a skeleton staff of seven,
including the Assistant Manager, the Division Chief, two Head Project Super-
visors, two Loan Analysts and one Loan Processor. With the exception of
the Division Chief, who has commercial background, and the Loan Processor
who is an administrative officer, all members of the Division are fisheries
graduates or technicians. In addition, there are 22 fisheries technicians



ANNEX 12
Page 5
posted at various branch office engaged in fisheries credit operations 1/.
To carry out the fisheries credit project, staff reinforcements at profes-
sional levels would be needed, including one marine fisheries specialist
and one senior financial analyst with investment banking background. Also,
the consultant services of a marine specialist and a naval architect would
be required. Some strengthening of the senior staff on executive and super-
visory levels is indicated, most of which could be effected by drawing on
some of the senior experienced personnel available in the DBP. A capable
senior bank officer would be appointed as Assistant Manager. Training of
junior staff would be provided by the DBP's Industrial Department and arrange-
ments would be made for participation of the technical staff in a special
fisheries training course to be organized by the Bureau of Fisheries in
cooperation with the University of the Philippines.
Technical Cooperation with other Agencies
8.        In the implementation of the Credit program, the DBP would be able
to avail itself of the guidance, cooperation and assistance of other Govern-
ment agencies in related fields.
9.        The Fishery Industry Development Council (FIDC) is the supreme
body responsible for the implementation of the broad government policies in
regard to the development of the fisheries sector. The seven-member Board,
chaired by the Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources with the
Director of the Bureau of Fisheries as Vice Chairman and Executive Officer
includes the Secretary of Defense, the Governor of the Central Bank, the
Governor of the DBP, the President of the Philippine National Bank (PNB)
and the Chairman of the Board of Investments (BOI) as its members. The
Council's principal task is to provide policy guidance and create an
investment climate for the development of the industry and delineate and
coordinate the various activities of the participating agencies of the
industry.
10.       The Bureau of Fisheries (BOF) is the research, advisory and
executive arm of the FIDC with prime and direct responsibility for the
execution of the fisheries development. The BOF performs important regula-
tory functions over the industry, including the granting of fishpond leases,
the licensing and registration of fishing vessels, the issuance of permits
for the importation of marine products, and it undertakes applied fishery
research, maintains fishery statistics and organizes and coordinates
fisheries training programs. A broad understanding has already been reached
with the Bureau of Fisheries on its extended cooperation with DBP including
common staff training as well as technical advice and assistance to the
sub-borrowers, in particular in the inland fisheries sector. Training
would be provided by the University of the Philippines in connection with
1/   Five BOF fisheries technicians have recently been seconded to DBP to
assist in the processing of loan applications from fish pond operators
affected by heavy flood damage.

the USAID-financed Inland Fisheries Project. Contacts would be established
with Customs Authority and the Coast Guard for their close cooperation and
assistance in the follow-up on marine projects of delinquent borrowers.
Financial Cooperation with other Institutions
11.       A special effort would be required to give the fisheries lending
program broad publicity and to familiarize potential borrowers with its
major aspects and the credit facilities offered. Cooperation with other
financial institutions would be sought in the promotion of the Program,
and their financial assistance to the Program. In particular, there appears
to be room for joint financial ventures in support of some of the larger
categories of projects, with DBP assuming the medium-and-long-term financing
of the capital investments, and the local institution the short-term loans
for working capital. This combined approach should prove mutually beneficial
in enabling the economical use of financial resources and providing the basis
for a rational use of scarce resources of specialized skills and business
experience, with DBP providing the specialized technical knowledge in the
project appraisals, and the local banks the local business experience in the
credit assessment of the borrowers. Possibilities for such cooperation seem
to exist with the Rural banks and the Development banks, in particular in
financing the inland fisheries sector, and with the commercial banks in the
marine fisheries sector.

FISHERIES CREDIT PROJECT
Outline of Project Appraisal Requirements
1.        In the fisheries credit operations, DBP's methods of project
appraisal in regard to all major aspects of the technical feasibility, eco-
nomic viability and financial soundness of the projects would be reviewed.
In particular, they would include:
(a) detailed description of the project and a critica;
appraisal of its principal technical features, the pro-
posed construction methods and the estimated construction
period; the capabilities and competence of the management
(owner), the adequacy of the work force, the administrative
arrangements and ancillary, or complementary facilities
required by the project including infrastructure, utilities
and public services;
(b) project cost estimates comprising (i) estimated capital
expenditure in appropriate breakdown in reference to para
(a) above, and (ii) the working capital requirements, i.e.,
the estimated amount of permanent working capital for new
projects, or the required incremental amount of working
capital for expansion projects;
(c) estimates of available funds for financing the project,
specified by borrowings and owners contribution in the form
of cash and equity;
(d) estimates of production costs, working capital require-
ments, inventory requirements, sales prices, sales volume,
market outlets and competitive position;
(e) estimates of income for the project and cash flow pro-
jections, giving estimated sources and application of
funds over the projected period including the project
as well as all other business activities forming an
integral part of the operation. Where appropriate, pro-
forma summary balance sheets should be prepared showing
the financial position on completion of the project and
in a year of normal operations;



ANNEX 12
Appendix 1
Page 2
(f) credit reports comprising an assessment of the borrowers
existing assets and liabilities and his networth, and
an appriasal of the assets offered as collateral for the
loan.
2.        A review of present methods and techniques of project appraisal
of the Fisheries Division in particular in the financial field, would be
required. It should be made with the help of a senior financial analyst/
investment banker with some experience in agricultural credit. New guide-
lines should be issued for project appraisals together with revised forms
of summary balance sheets and cash-flow and earnings projections as re-
quired for the study. 1/ These together with a credit appraisal of the
borrower, would provide the basis for an analysis in depth of tne project
and of the financial conditions of the borrower. Somewhat simpler forms
and procedures would apply to the smaller projects. In each case, ade-
quate consideration should be given to comments on the figures and the
underlying basic assumptions of the financial forecasts in regard to the
operational and earnings prospects of the project and the past record
and financial performance of the borrower. Financial ratios may be used,
wherever indicated, to demonstrate special points or problems of particular
importance. These observations would form the basis of the conclusions
and recommendations in the final report on the suitability of the project
for DBP financing.
1/   The sample forms of the Summary Appraisal and Development Report for
the Livestock project might in part be used as a model in the drafting
of these documents.

FISHERIES CREDIT PROJECT
DBP: Project Financial Statements
1.        The estimated income statement and the cash flow for project
operations under the proposed financing pattern are presented in Tables 1
and 2. The disbursement period is four years and the Bank's standard
commitment fees and interest rates are applied. A cost of 8% per annum
for the DBP counterpart funds has also been assumed. The repayment period
for the Bank loan and DBP's.counterpart funds is 17 years, including a six
year grace. SubloaDs, at an interest rate of 12%, have repayment terms from
5-12 years, including a grace period of one to five years. In accordance
with DBP practices, interest during the grace periods has been capitalized.
Cash flow projections in Table 2 are conservative because they are based on
fully extended terms for repayments of subloans.
2.        DBP's net income from project operations after debt service and
administrative expenses, is estimated at Y 42.3 million over the project
life. In addition, the project accounts surplus is invested at 8% per
annum (the deficit being costed at 8% per annum), and the total net income
is then projected at r 88.3 million. Bad-debts and costs associated with
delinquent loans would have to be met from this income. The margin is con-
sidered to be adequate for bad-debts and slippage in repayments.

Marketing and Prices
Role in the Economy
1.        During the past decade, fish output of the Philippines more than
doubled to about 1.0 million tons and per capita consumption increased
almost 50%. In contrast, output of meat (beef, pork and poultry) lagged
slightly behind the growth of population. It is estimated that fish and
other marine products provide about half of the animal protein consumed
in the Philippines -- as much as meat, eggs, milk and milk products com-
bined.
2.        Despite rapid increases in fish production, domestic demand has
outpaced supply and retail prices have risen faster than other food commodities
(Table 1). In 1971 exports were valued at V 36.7 million (about US$5.4 million)
and imports at F 137.0 million (about US$20.2 million). Exports consist mostly
of shrimp to Japan and the U.S. (a growing item but still in quite small volume)
and tuna to the U.S. Canned mackerel from Japan, favored in the interior
where fresh fish is unavailable, constitutes the bulk of the imports. Similarly,
low priced imports of fishmeal from Peru supply most of the Philippines market
for this animal feed product (Table 2).
Demand Projections
3.        Demand for fish and fish products is expected to continue to rise
very substantially in the decade ahead. Projections based on best assump-
tions as to population, urbanization, and the effect of rising income on
consumption of fish and fish products are summarized below:

Demand Projections for Fish

/1    Assumes increases in per capita real income of 3.4%
in 1970-1975 and 3.7% in 1975-1980. Income elasticity
of fish is estimated at 0.55 based on calculations
of Z. Russeck, FAO/UNDP Fisheries Development Program
in the Philippines.
B. Projections of Domestic Demand
Year             Total Demand        Per Capita Demand
('000 tons)             (kg)
1970                 1,040                28.3
1975                 1,320                30.9
1980                 1,660                34.0
4.        Estimated increases in requirements, averaging some 56,000 tons
every year in 1970-75 and 68,000 tons in 1975-80, are substantially above
increases in production in recent years. Substitution possibilities for
fresh fish are limited becaused canned fish is bought where fresh fish is
not available and frozen fish has a low consumer's acceptance. Present
trends therefore indicate an increasing fresh fish deficit over the coming
years. Domestic demand would therefore easily absorb the estimated in-
cremental production from the project (48,000 tons at full development) based
on population growth alone.
Marketing
5.        Most of the fish is sold in the fresh condition because of strong
consumer preference. Where fish is iced for transport, the ice is removed
prior to sale to give it a fresh appearance. Because of limited storage
and distribution capacity and low acceptance of frozen, chilled or iced
fish, fresh fish markets are easily saturated despite existing unsatisfied
demand in the vicinity. The excess fish is sold for processing (drying
and smoking) at a considerable discount.
6.        Wholesale markets in the Manila area are the Navotas, Malabon
and Divisoria fish markets. Most fishing vessels discharge fish in Navotas.
Sorting takes place on board and sales are by tray or tubs. The auctioning



ANNEX 14
Page 3
takes place at all three markets by a method of secret oral bidding, the
buyers whispering their bids to the broker who decides whom to sell the fish
to. There are only very few large brokers who control the marketing. The
brokers charge a 3-6% comission depending on the services performed like
loading and unloading, provision of containers, supply of ice, especially
to fishpond operations, and advances for working capital. The Divisoria
market handles most of the arrivals by trucks, jeeps and rail or intra-island
vessels. There is no market hall and the sales take place in the streets
and sidewalks. The Malabon market handles almost all the milkfish arriving
in the Manila area.
7.        Wholesale markets in the provinces exist only in some of the big-
ger cities with access to the sea and these are small compared to Navotas.
However, in most places sale is by an open auction system.
8.        Retailing in the Manila area takes place through 30-40 central
markets with special fish sections, and also through door-to-door vendors.
Retail of processed fish takes place in the grocery sections. There is
a substantial demand for processed fish in the inland areas and it is
estimated that about 25Z of the total catch is diverted to salting, drying,
smoking and making of fish paste and fish sauce. Low value fish like
anchovies and round scad are the raw materials for this processing. No
canning is done, but freezing of tuna and shrimp for exports is increasing.
Prices
9.        Wholesale prices fluctuate daily during the main fishing season
when the dealers have purchased their immediate fresh fish requirements
and the remaining fish is sold for processing. Retail prices however, are
less sensitive to short term supply fluctuations. Tables 3 and 4 show the
trends the wholesale and retail prices over the period of 1965 to 1971.
10.       Present trends in production and demand would indicate that domes-
tic fish prices would continue to increase in real terms. However, for the
purposes of financial calculations, present ex-vessel and ex-pond prices of
? 1,400 (US$207) and f 3,000 (US$442) for marine fish and milkfish, res-
pectively, have been assumed to continue.

ANNEX 15
Page 1
PHILIPPINES
FISHERIES CREDIT PROJECT
Proiected Financial Results
General
1.        Table 1 summarizes the projected financial results for beneficiaries.
Rates of return after taxes range from 20% for fish pond construction to 82%
for improvements to existing fishing vessels. The high rates of return for
vessel improvements and fish pond rehabilitation are for the incremental in-
vestment only and do not reflect the "sunk" costs already incurred. New
trawlers (70-GT) and new fish pond construction have rates of return of 25%
and 20%, respectively.
2.        Production results are based on existing operations for marine
and inland fisheries. For marine fisheries the development period has
been assumed at one year because Philippine fishermen are familiar with
these vessels, while a 4-year development for the small- and medium-sized
fish pond operators has been estimated.
3.        Operating costs are based on existing records and include fuel,
lubricants, ice, maintenance, wages, insurance, overheads and others as
appropriate for investments in marine fisheries. Operating costs for
investments in inland fisheries vary; they have been based on existing
records, field discussions and research results and averaged for calculation
purposes. Labor has been fully costed using the minimum wage rate determined
by law which is sometimes higher than the prevailing wage rates.
4.        Based on available records, the average ex-vessel price has been
assumed at about r 1,400 (US$206) per ton in the Greater Manila area and
t 1,100 (US$162) per ton in landing centers around the Visayan Sea. Ex-
pond prices for milkfish are fairly uniform because of the geographic con-
centration of production and have been estimated at 1 3,000 (US$442) per ton.
5.        The projected cash flows have been used to determine subloan terms
and they indicate that sub-borrowers would be able to repay their loans,
equivalent to 80 percent of total project costs (including incremental work-
ing capital) for marine fisheries and 90 percent on the average for inland
fisheries, without undue difficulties under the proposed terms. As presented
in paragraph 4.10 of the main text, repayment and grace periods show a range.
For purposes of financial calculations the shorter terms have been used,
although DBP would have the option of allowing longer terms if required in
individual situations. DBP's income statements and cash flow (Annex 13) are
based on fully extended terms to demonstrate the potential financial impact
on DBP's project account.



ANNEX 15

Risk Analysis
6.        In general, fisheries is rather risky because control over catch
is limited and fish pond yields are affected by pests and diseases. There-
fore, an analysis has been carried out to test the financial returns of
fishing vessels and fish ponds (which would determine the success of the
project) against foreseeable risks with regard to investment costs and net
benefits.
7.        The analysis gives an indication of the probability at which the
return for an individual investment would drop below a chosen cut-off rate.
This method calculates the standard benefit/cost ratio (BCR) discounting
at the cut-off rate. Then BCR's of all possible cost/benefit variations
are calculated. The cumulative probabilities of cost/benefit combinations
which yield BCR's of less than unity represent the chance that the rate of
return falls below the cut-off rate.
8.        A cut-off rate of 15% and 10% has been used and Table 2 gives a
sample calculation for a 70-GT trawler. The critical inputs are the proba-
bility distribution assigned to investment costs and net benefits. Both
distributions are based on empirical data and technical judgments. The
rather narrow probability distribution for investment costs reflects the
greater confidence in the estimates, while net benefits (catch or yields)
have a much greater chance to be off the best estimates.
9.        To summarize the results, there is a 4%, 10% and 11% probability
that the rates of return for the 70-GT trawler, 130-GT trawler and fish
ponds, respectively, would fall below 15%. The probability that rates of
return would fall below 10% is negligible for all three investments under
the above assumptions.
Marine Fisheries
10.       130-GT Steel Trawler.  Tables 3 and 4 show projected fishing
operations. The proposed vessel would have a useful life of 15 years. It
would carry a crew of 17, skipper included, and fish with trawl gear. Effec-
tive fishing time would be 320 days per annum, made possible through carrier
operations which would supply the vessels at the fishing grounds and trans-
port the catch. Catch rates have been conservatively estimated at 2.55 tons
per effective fishing day from the second year of operations onward.
11.       70-GT Wooden Trawler.  Tables 5 and 6 show projected fishing
operations. The proposed vessel would also have a useful life of 15 years
(with increased maintenance from year 8 onwards). It would carry a crew
of 15, skipper included, and fish with trawl gear. Effective fishing time
would be 270 days per annum dropping to 250 because of increased docking
time from year 8 on. Catch rates have been assumed at 1.5 tons per fishing
day.
12.       Fish Carrier.  Tables 7 and 8 show projected carrier's operations
if operated independently from fishing operations. Generally, entrepreneurs
operating their fishing vessels out of Navotas (Manila) use either their



ANNEX 15
Page 3
own carriers or hire carriers for a fee from other enterpreneurs. One
carrier usually serves two fishing vessels and Table 9 shows the financial
results of a combined operation under single ownership.
13.       Vessel Improvements.  Vessel improvements would include investments
in more efficient gear, fish finding and communications equipment. Indi-
vidual investments would vary with needs but it has been assumed that with
an average investment of t 50,000 the catch of individual vessels could be
increased by 10% because of reduced gear handling time and improved resource
location. An average useful life of 10 years has been assumed for the
vessel itself. Table 10 shows the incremental financial results.
14.       30-Ton Ice Plant.  Tables 11 and 12 show financial results of
projected ice plant operations. Each plant would have a daily capacity of
30 tons of ice. It would have a useful life of about 15 years and sales
revenues and operating costs are based on existing operations. Generally,
ice plants are operated independently from fishing operations and each
plant can serve about 20 fishing vessels (70-GT class). Surplus capacity
would be used for existing fishing operations.
15.       Marine Slipway.  Tables 13 and 14 show projected financial results
of a marine slipway. Each slipway would have the capacity to serve the
45 project vessels estimated to be based in the Visayan Sea twice a year
and the surplus capacity would be used to serve the existing fishing fleet
based there. Revenues and operating costs have been based on similar opera-
tions in the Philippines.
Inland Fisheries
16.       New Fish Pond Construction.  Tables 15 and 16 show the projected
financial results of a 10-ha newly constructed fish pond module. As
explained in Annex 3, fish pond operators rarely develop their total area
at one time. They generally enclose a larger area with a main dyke, uproot
some trees, level the ground and only fully develop modules of approximately
10 ha. However, the new construction model has been included to demonstrate
the viability of newly constructed fish ponds, while in all other models
sunk costs, mainly for uprooting of trees and bottom levelling, have been
excluded. The life of a fish pond has been assumed at 15 years before major
investments in dykes and gates would be required.
17.       Rehabilitation of Fish Ponds.  Tables 17 and 18 show the projected
financial results of a severely flood-damaged fish pond, and Annex 10 pre-
sents type and unit costs of work to be performed. Present level of produc-
tion has been estimated at zero because of damage to dykes and water control
system.
18.       Development of Fish Ponds.  Tables 19 and 20 show projected finan-
cial results of a 10-ha fish pond. Yields would increase from 500 kg/ha to
1,200 kg/ha per annum over a 4-year development period.  Revenues and operating
costs have been based on existing operations with labor fully costed at the



ANNEX 15
Page 4
4nimum wage rate of r 8.0 per man-day rather than on the prevailing rates
wpich vary from 1 4.0 to ' 6.0 per man-day.
19.       Freshwater Ponds.  Tables 21 and 22 show projected financial
rqsults of a 25-ha freshwater pond. The species cultivated is carp with
ag average ex-pond price of P 3.0 per kg. Yields would increase from 500
to 1,000 kg per hectare per amnnu  over a 3-year development period.

FISHERIES CREDIT PROJECT
Economic Rate of Return Calculations
1.        Primary project benefits to the Philippine economy would consist
of (i) increased fish production for domestic consumption, (ii) some shrimp
production for exports, and (iii) services for existing fishing fleet opera-
tions resulting in increased fishing time because of speedier repairs and
timely provision of ice.
2.        Key assumptions and adjustments made were that:
(a) the price of investment items and operating cost items
would remain, in real terms, at current price levels;
(b) the prices of all outputs, in real terms, would remain
at current price levels;
(c) domestic ex-vessel and ex-pond prices reflect the economic
value for fresh fish because (i) the species caught or
produced are not internationally traded, (ii) they cannot
be substituted with either frozen fish because of low
consumer's acceptance and limited distribution facilities,
or canned fish which is only bought in interior regions
where fresh fish is not available; however, international
prices (f.o.b. Manila) have been used to evaluate shrimp
production for exports;
(d) the prevailing official exchange rate is equal to the
shadow rate of exchange because the peso is relatively
free to float in foreign exchange markets since February
1970;
(e) the labor component is costed at the financial wage rates;
(f) cost of DBP's administrative and technical services were
charged to the project;
(g) cost of training services provided to BOF's and DBP's
staff were charged to the project;
(h) costs of future project preparation were not charged to
the project.



ANNEX 16
Page 2
3.        Based on these assumptions, the overall economic rate of return
would be about 34% with a rate of 22% for the marine and 43% for the inland
fisheries component. The calculations for the marine fisheries component
include a corresponding part of the investment and operating costs for the
new fisheries harbor (Navotas) to be financed outside this project. With-
out these supplementary investments the rate of return would be 28% for this
component. The comparatively high rate of return for the inland fisheries
components is a result of sunk costs already incurred prior to rehabilitation
and development of these fish ponds. If all ponds were to be newly constructed,
the rate of return would drop to 23% for the inland fisheries component.
Details are presented in Table 1.
4.        A sensitivity analysis has been carried out with respect to in-
vestment costs, operating costs and gross benefits. The project has only
been tested against increased costs and reduced benefits. The results are
presented in Table 2. To summarize, the rates range from 24 to 31% for the
overall project, from 11 to 20% for the marine fisheries component and from
31 to 40% for the inland fisheries component. The lower ranges appear only
under the assumption that gross benefit would be reduced by 15% with standard
investment and operating costs.
