"The Land Administration Project has the\n            following objectives: 1) to regularize land registration for\n            El Salvador's estimated 1.6 million parcels of rural\n            and urban land; and 2) to create an efficient, streamlined,\n            and financially self-sustaining nationwide cadastral\n            mechanism for mapping and land registration - the new\n            National Registry Center. Land registration will provide\n            land owners - particularly the vast majority of smallholders\n            who lack clear tenure - with the security that will enable\n            them to sell or rent at fair market prices, and pass on\n            their holdings as inheritances. Improving tenure security\n            will also increase smallholder access to credit, raising\n            incentives to invest and to manage land properly. The\n            project has two major components: 1) institutional\n            strengthening and decentralization; and 2) land data\n            acquisition, which includes three subcomponents: (a)\n            mapping; (b) land records regularization; and (c) alternate\n            dispute resolution mechanisms."}, "docdt": "1996-01-31T00:00:00Z"}
