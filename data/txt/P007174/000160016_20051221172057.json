sustainability is highly likely;\n            institutional development impact is high; Bank performance\n            is satisfactory; and Borrower performance is satisfactory.\n            These lessons were cited: 1) Continuous high level support\n            is critical: it was critical that the Project quickly\n            delivered results (e.g., maps, cadastre, computerized\n            system, financial surplus) that would show its positive\n            social and economic impact to decision makers and\n            politicians. It was also key that the project could provide\n            timely and important information to decision makers in the\n            aftermath of the 1998 Hurricane Mitch, the 2001 earthquake\n            and the 2002 drought. Finally, the macroeconomic stability\n            that El Salvador has enjoyed during the last fifteen years\n            has created a favorable environment for Project\n            implementation. 2) The single land agency model is the\n            preferred option for land administration projects: This\n            model significantly improves the efficiency of registration\n            and the maintenance of updated information, thereby\n            increasing tenure security and, as a result, public support.\n            It greatly contributes to the financial sustainability and\n            profitability of land administration services. Further, the\n            integration of the cadastre, property, intellectual and\n            commercial registries contributes to an improved investment\n            climate in the country. Finally, it improves project\n            implementation. 3) Land records management through an\n            integrated cadastre-registry system has enormous potential\n            for supporting a growing and dynamic land market and an\n            effective and local revenue collection system. However,\n            tenure security through regularization alone does not spur\n            land investments and facilitate land access. Synergies and\n            sequencing with other sectors (e.g., judicial, rural\n            finance, decentralization) need to be supported and\n            maintained. 4) Broad and active involvement and\n            participation of major stakeholders is key for project\n            success. In particular, active communication toward and\n            participation by civil society are important to ensure the\n            quality of regularization work. Local governments also play\n            a very significant role 5) A pragmatic and incremental\n            approach to legal reforms is often the best approach. 6)\n            Automation and internet access to land records provides a\n            more efficient service and improved access to data and\n            information. 7) Pro-actively involving the private sector\n            through competitive contracting, as was done through the\n            Project with the surveying industry, can generate\n            substantial efficiency gains and cost savings. In fact, use\n            of the private sector and NGOs for land regularization\n            instead of force account for field work has proven to be\n            significantly more effective and efficient. 8) Strong\n            institutional reforms and clarification of responsibilities\n            are key for successful project implementation."}, "docdt": "2005-12-12T00:00:00Z"}
