F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
The Project Development Objective is to expand sustainable rural water supply and
sanitation (RWSS) service coverage by: (i) introducing a demand-driven and
participatory approach to RWSS development; (ii) assisting the Government in
building and strengthening local RWSS capacity; and (iii) helping Government
formulate the agreed demand-driven and participatory principles in a coherent
national RWSS strategy.

Revised Project Development Objectives (as approved by original approving authority)
The revised PDO as reflected in the Consolidated Results Framework following the
approval of Additional Financing is to achieve (i) sustainable improvement of rural
water supply and sanitation services and hygiene habits in the project area, and; (ii)
adoption by Government of a new RWSS strategy based on the Project's demand-
driven and participatory approach and under implementation in the project area.

1.        Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1      Context at Appraisal

Main Sector Issues:

1.      Yemen's rural population, approximately 70% – 80% of Yemen's total population (approximately 16
million in the year 2000), suffered from low rural water supply and sanitation (RWSS) service coverage and
high rural child mortality, reported to be in the range of 120 to 150 per 1,000 live births, among the worlds’
highest at the time of appraisal.
2.      About half of the piped rural water supply systems were either not working or not providing safe
drinking water, and, at best, only 10% of all wells and boreholes were adequately protected to yield safe water.
Little was done in the area of safe wastewater and excreta disposal, hygiene education and safe drinking water
storage. These obstacles constrained reaping the full potential health benefits of new water supply systems.
The main sector issues were:
      a. Inadequate institutional arrangements and Project sustainability:
        i. Community level: There was insufficient community involvement in water systems design, and
           government and donor-supported schemes usually fell short of developing effective community
           participation and management mechanisms. Water committees became imposed local institutions,
           often affected by internal management conflicts, leading to neglect of O &M of water and sanitation
           infrastructure, which resulted in frequent break-downs. More than 50 percent of systems at the time
           were either in disrepair or total failures.
        ii. Government level: The General Authority for Rural Electricity and Water (GAREW) under the
            Ministry of Electricity and Water (MEW) was the implementing agency for the RWSS program in
            Yemen. GAREW, a highly centralized government agency with about 400 staff based in Sana’a,
            failed to enforce the decentralization strategy envisaged by the government. GAREW was reluctant
            to delegate either financial or operational authority to the governorate branch offices and did not
            recognize the value of community participation. Most contracts were controlled by GAREW in
            Sana'a.
       iii. Political interference: Frequently political and tribal leadership demands on GAREW to allocate its
            limited resources to particular projects of choice interrupted contracts in progress. The result was
            that GAREW had a large demand for new projects and larger number of incomplete ones (several
            hundred, according to the 1996 RWSS review). The Government's RWSS budget resources (about
            US$15 million to US$20 million per year) were not sufficient to catch up with the contract backlogs.
      b. Inadequate financial arrangements:
         RWSS schemes were financed by the Government's RWSS budget and implemented by GAREW.
         Most of the projects required a contribution from the beneficiaries and an up-front down payment
         (varying between 5% and 30%) towards investment costs But GAREW did not respond to the wishes
         of the beneficiaries regarding choice of technical and service options assessed by willingness to pay
         (WTP) surveys. Projects were often initiated because they were requested by a local sheik or
         government official. In most cases, post-implementation follow-up such as ongoing technical and
         hygiene advice, as well as monitoring, were not addressed. Most systems used some form of cost-
         recovery, either based on metered water use or a flat rate. However, RWSS systems were often over-
         designed. They tended to cover large areas with little social cohesion, and users could not afford to
         pay the full operating costs of the schemes, let alone produce the financial surpluses required to
         purchase spare parts or make major repairs.
      c. Inadequate sanitation:
         Unsafe water storage, unsanitary wastewater (WW) and excreta disposal, and poor hygiene education
         undermined the impacts of drinking water supply investments in the RWSS program. Diarrhea and
         other fecally-transmitted diseases were major causes of infant mortality in Yemen, which was reported
         to account for about 50 % of child mortality. Good examples of sanitation systems advances were seen

                                                        1
           in some community-driven RWSS schemes where latrines were constructed as a prerequisite for
           household water connections. The Social Assessment (SA) carried out as part of Project preparation
           indicated that people were willing to accept this prerequisite for household connected water supply.

3.       Government Strategy at Appraisal. In ratifying various RWSS Policy Statements, in particular Cabinet
Decree #21, the Government agreed to three key principles for RWSS: i) demand responsiveness; ii)
decentralized community-based management and iii) cost recovery. However, these principles were not
translated into a clearly formulated sector strategy at the time the Project was prepared. Through the RWSS
Project, with co-financing from the Dutch Government, technical assistance was to help the GoY formulate a
comprehensive RWSS development strategy. Furthermore, the GoY had recently legislated Local
Administration Law no. 4 – yr. 2000 (decentralization) whose precepts complemented the principles of a
demand responsive approach (DRA).
4.      Rationale for Bank Assistance: The RWSS Project supported key development focal areas expressed
in the GoY’s Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper, DPPR, and Five Year Plan as commensurately amplified in
the Bank’s Country Assistance Strategies (CASs) from 1999 to the present time. Early CASs recognized the
need for more balanced water resource management and sanitation, health and hygiene and education as vital
components to reap maximum health benefits from potable water supply. The RWSSP would address these
objectives through creating more rural-urban equity in improving rural health and hygiene in the country. It
would also improve access to safe-drinking water to households, freeing women and girls from time-
consuming and painful chores of fetching water; hence, allowing children, particularly girls, to attend school
regularly and women to dedicate more time to economic activities.

1.2        Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators
5.      In the RWSSP Development Credit Agreement (DCA), 22 December 2000, the Project was to assist
the Borrower in expanding sustainable water supply and sanitation service coverage in the Project area. The
overall objective, as stated in the PAD, was to expand sustainable rural water supply and sanitation service
coverage to about 400,000 mostly poor rural dwellers in ten governorates. This was expected to be achieved
by:
    a. Introducing to Yemen a globally tested demand-responsive, decentralized, community-managed,
        RWSS development approach;
    b. Assisting the government in building and strengthening local RWSS capacity; and
    c. Helping government to integrate the agreed demand-responsive approach (DRA) principles in a
        coherent RWSS strategy and prepare a long-term (10-15 year) national RWSS investment program
        that could be supported by the Bank and other donors.

 6.         Key indicators included:
      a.    Sustainability:
             i. established and functioning water user associations (WUA);
            ii. proper financial arrangements in place (mainly operation and maintenance (O&M) cost recovery
                from beneficiaries); and
           iii. adequate physical and O&M status of RWSS systems
      b.    Capacity building:
             i. ten PIUs at governorate-level established and capable of applying the DRA;
      c.    Formulation and implementation of RWSS strategy:
             i. new RWSS strategy is applied country-wide in all RWSS development activities
      d.    Long-term national RWSS development investment program:
             i. program is ready for implementation
      e.    Health and Education Improvement:
             i. reduce significantly child morbidity and mortality; and
            ii. increase school attendance, particularly of girls.

1.3       Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators
7.     Second phase Grant Funding: In February 2008, a second project phase with additional grant financing
was approved. It included a consolidated results framework which stated the revised PDOs to be:
      a. Sustainable improvement of RWSS services and hygiene habits in the Project area,
      b. New RWSS strategy based on the Project’s demand-driven and participatory approach is adopted by
         Government and under implementation in the Project area.

8.        Key performance indicators were:
      a. Number of RWS systems built and operational under water user association management; The end of
         project target was 225 sub-projects serving 650,000 people, with 90% of systems “functioning well”
         and 75% with user fees that cover operation and maintenance costs.
      b. Number of beneficiaries with improved sanitation and hygiene habits at Project completion. The
         target was 350,000 people provided with hygiene training, hygiene improvement evaluated, 150 latrine
         blocks at schools and mosques, 15,000 household latrines constructed, six small sewer systems
         installed, and 140 health promoters trained.
      c. RWSS strategy formulated, adopted, and used to inform the design and preparation of the RWSS
         component of the national “sector-wide approach” formulated for the water sector. Related to this
         were targets to provide at least 15 training activities for GARWSP staff and integration of RWSS
         reporting by GARWSP branch offices to include progress on all systems, including both RWSSP and
         RWSS national program systems.

1.4       Main Beneficiaries
9.       The original primary target group (credit phase) was 400,000 mostly poor rural dwellers in ten
governorates. No estimate of how many water supply and sanitation sub-projects this would require was
indicated. The 2008 Consolidated Results Framework incorporating additional grant financing amended the
total beneficiary target to a population to 650,000.

1.5       Original Components
10.     The components as defined in the Project Appraisal Document for the original IDA credit of SDR
15.7 million provided to finance the project were:

      a. Water Supply (US$19.1 million equivalent in SDR): The water supply component was to provide a
         minimum service level including the construction and rehabilitation of RWSS systems consisting of a
         range of technologies, i.e. hand dug wells and hand pumps, spring protection and gravity supply, rain
         water catchments, piped schemes from boreholes equipped with either diesel or electrical pumps, and
         supplying communal stand posts. Incremental costs for building metered yard or house connections
         were to be entirely borne by the beneficiaries.

      b. Environmental Sanitation (US$2.1 million equivalent in SDR):The sanitation component was to
         include; (i) incentives to households for the construction of household systems, i.e. simple dry pit
         latrines, pour-flush latrines, flush toilet and septic tanks. Demonstration latrines would be constructed
         at village centers. Block latrines for schools and health centers would also be built. If justified by
         waste water flows and population density, one or two centralized wastewater treatment systems
         (communal septic tank and/or waste stabilization ponds) were to be built as pilots. "Sanitation marts",
         where latrine components can be purchased, where technical advice can be sought and builders
         located, were to be tested in one or two locations; and (ii) hygiene education was to be provided
         through training of community based hygiene specialists and teachers, and helping design simple
         school hygiene education programs.

      c. Institutional Strengthening. Project Management, Studies and Training (US$8.2 million equivalent in
         SDR): This component would include: (i) equipment and running costs, as well as technical support

                                                         3
        and training at central/governorate/community levels, PMU, PIUs, SMTs and WUAs; and (ii)
        Technical Assistance, sector review and studies to formulate a RWSS sector strategy, as well as
        training to support decentralized RWSS units at governorate levels.

1.6     Revised Components
11.     The Additional Financing Grant of SDR 12.6 million retained the original components and geographic
scope. It provided an additional US$19.00 million equivalent for rural water supply, US$2.9 million
equivalent for rural sanitation and hygiene, and US$2.3 million equivalent for project management support.

1.7     Other significant changes
12.      During project preparation the rural water sector was in a state of institutional flux. In part as a result
of the ratification of Decentralization Law no. 4 – 2000 the GoY chose to place management of the RWSSP
under the Ministry of Local Administration (MLA) rather than under the Ministry of Water and Electricity
(MEW) with the General Authority for Rural Electricity and Water (GAREW). This arrangement was seen as
way to support decentralization and bring the DRA methodology to governorate and district levels.

13.      GAREW was a highly centralized agency and its suitability to implement the proposed RWSSP with
its decentralized, demand responsive design was cast in doubt. A Prime Ministerial decision subsequently
ruled in favor of a dedicated, independent PMU and governorate based PIU’s assigned to the MLA. GAREW
was dismantled by Presidential Decree No. 45 in April 2001. Its functions were temporarily assigned to the
Ministry of Agriculture and Irrigation (MAI) and subsequently reassigned to the MLA.

14.     Shortly thereafter the Ministry of Water and Environment (MWE) was established and the RWSSP
was aligned with this new ministry. In the same time frame the General Authority for Rural Water Supply
Projects (GARWSP) was established under the MWE. The Project retained its independent PMU under the
MWE; there was no immediate reconfiguration to merge the Project with GARWSP.

15.     Based on the Bank’s recommendations from the mid-term Project review in Sept./Oct. 2004 and
following a formal request from the Ministry of Planning and International Cooperation (MOPIC) the DCA
was formally amended. The significant formal amendments and their justifications included:
  a. responsibility for the RWSSP was transferred from MLA to MWE, along with the mandate for RWSS
     policy, strategy and long term investment planning,
  b. procurement thresholds modified: i) national shopping raised from $5,000 to $25,000; ii) civil works
     raised from $100,000 to $250,000 without prior approval, iii) goods procurement decreased from
     $400,000 to 200,000.
  c. Project geographic scope reduced from ten governorates to six governorates: due to late credit
     effectiveness (10 months following project approval), an extended time frame to establish new PIUs, low
     disbursement figures (albeit with significant commitments), and unresolved unsatisfactory procurement
     and financial management performance.
  d. beneficiary contributions to Project capital costs lowered from 15% to 5%; the initially proposed 15%
     contribution proved difficult to collect and as a consequence slowed down Project implementation; 15%
     also tended to exclude poorer communities. A 5% contribution was affordable but still elicited real
     demand and tested their ability to cover O& M costs
  e. Oversight Committee; decisions pertaining to the procurement of goods, works and services no longer
     would require Oversight Committee approval as it was noted such bureaucratic steps significantly
     slowed down Project implementation.

16.      Project extensions: Three Project extensions were approved. The credit funding phase of the Project
was initially appraised for a five year implementation period from early 2001 to 31 June 2006 (project closing
date). Due to delays in credit effectiveness, which was only achieved on 23 October 2001 and slow initial
implementation progress, the Project did not make major forward strides until late 2003, two years after
effectiveness and approximately 2½ years before the original Project end date. By the time of the mid-term
review in October 2004, the implementation progress had accelerated substantially and RWSSP received an

                                                         4
overall satisfactory rating, albeit with recommendations to improve and modify some components. A
recommendation was made and approved to extend the credit phase for 1½ years (first extension) to 31
December 2007.

17.     Given significant advances in Project outputs from the mid-point to the latter periods of the credit
phase and in order to address a backlog of pipeline sub-projects for which preparatory studies had been carried
out and were ready for implementation, a request from the GOY for an additional financing grant of US $ 20
million (SDR 12.6 million) grant was approved and the Project was extended for a second time in February
2008 and made effective in July 2008. The extension was to run through 31 December 2009. In mid-2009
GOY requested and was granted a third extension to the RWSSP to 31 December, 2010 with no further
additional financing to complete additional prepared sub-projects and utilize funds accrued from exchange rate
variations between the SDR and the US dollar.

18.     Partial cancellation of grant: At the end of the project in December 2010 GOY requested cancellation
of SDR 0.6 million that had accrued from a further weakening of the US dollar exchange rate against the SDR
and could not be disbursed prior to the project end date.

2.        Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1       Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

19.      Project Identification: A World Bank RWSS sector study was carried out in June – July 1996. Project
identification (Project Concept Document – PCD) was approved in November 1997 and a Project preparation
mission was carried out in the February-March 1998. Due to the institutional flux and sector reform dialogue
that prevailed during the time of project identification and preparation an extended period of time was needed
to agree on institutional arrangements and key strategy and policy issues. Also, the introduction of an approach
that was new to the water sector in Yemen, a community-based, Demand-responsive Approach required a
longer period for achieving understanding and consensus among all parties involved than is considered normal
for Bank infrastructure investments.

20.     Strategic Context: The Project supported GOY water sector development interests and priorities as
expressed in their various strategy and development documents, including the Poverty Reduction Strategy
Paper, 1st and 2nd Five Year Development Plans and others. Significantly, the RWSS Policy Statement
(Decree no. 21) ratified the GOY’s’ commitment to develop a RWSS sector strategy. A leading component of
the overall RWSSP was to oversee sector strategy development with bilateral parallel co-financing for RWSS
technical assistance. In parallel these commitments were in various definitions reflected in the World Bank
CASs covering the years 1996 through 2010. The project concept and design therefore was well integrated
with both GOY and donor strategies at the time.

21.      Background analysis: Project conceptualization and design was prepared during a period of reform
and institutional uncertainty in the water and sanitation sector. A nationally mandated decentralization policy
that few agencies bought into, despairingly poor RWSS service delivery performance, institutional
management problems, limited water supply technical options, indifference to sanitation and its relation to
improved health standards, and no coherent sub-sector strategy nor a sub-sector investment program were,
among other issues, taken into consideration in designing the RWSSP.

22. Project design drew comprehensively on global best practices and some nascent national1 experience with
participatory, community-based rural water supply and sanitation implementation approaches in the late 1990s.
The RWSSP was the first stand alone Bank financed rural water project in Yemen and it carried expectations
of being the standard bearer for Yemen RWSS development. While other Bank funded Projects, e.g. Southern
Regional Agricultural Development Project, the Social Fund for Development, and the Public Works Project


1
    GOY successfully piloted community-based RWSS approaches through the Dutch-financed SURWAS Project.


                                                        5
included add-on RWSS components, none incorporated a dedicated approach highlighting the means to
enhance beneficiary ownership and the potential for full community level managed sustainability.

23. No formal Quality-at-Entry assessment was carried out during preparation. However the level of detail
brought into the Project’s preparation and appraisal process indicates a satisfactory level of interaction and
analysis of RWSS sub-sector issues among a wide range of government agencies, bi-lateral donors, proposed
beneficiaries and related stakeholders.

24.      Government Commitment: Early government commitment and ownership of the Project was seen as
enthusiastic. RWSS was a noted priority in their various development plans and senior government and sector
agency representatives actively participated in Project identification and preparation. The Government viewed
the Project as a major opportunity to restructure the RWSS sub-sector in parallel with urban water and
sanitation reforms. The Government formed an initially active oversight committee (OC) that reviewed the
preparation process, made important contributions to the Project's conceptual design and was designated to
provide supervisory monitoring and various control measures over the RWSSP during its implementation
period. However, the OC became inactive as the Project progressed, offering limited stewardship during later
years.

25.      Assessment of Risks: Project institutional and implementation arrangements at the time of appraisal
were extensively debated against a background of GOY and donor concerns whether the mandated national
agency for RWSS, GAREW was committed and able to effectively manage the Project. The final
implementation arrangement based on an independent PMU and Governorate-level PIUs was intended to
mitigate this significant risk. However, GOY policies and other requirements for employing consultants and
staffing was a significant risk to the pace of project start-up that was not adequately assessed or for which
mitigating measures were not sufficiently developed.

26.      Up to late 2007 little attention was given to what institutional and implementation arrangements might
best serve to bridge the gap between Project completion, expectations of a next phase and harmonization with
the national RWSS program. At the time considerable attention was given to a sector-wide approach that
would align RWSSP activities within the framework of the GARWSP without undermining RWSSP service
delivery successes. A provisional program was outlined in 2009 under the overall guidance of GARWSP with
the PMU retaining fiduciary responsibility for all Project funds while attempting to merge DRA, reduce costs
and generally facilitate bringing GARWSP implementation mechanisms into alignment with the tested
approaches of the RWSSP. Intransigence on the part of both RWSSP and GARWSP management and
differences in implementation cycles, community mobilization approaches, training, hygiene components,
salary structures, project development and administration costs precluded any effective merger or transitional
arrangements until 2010.

2.2     Implementation

27.     The Project experienced extended delays at the outset in achieving the conditions for Effectiveness of
the Credit, which included establishing and staffing the PMU and governorate level PIUs. These decentralized
project implementation arrangements were new to the Government of Yemen, and the mechanisms for
government recruitment of project staff were cumbersome and bureaucratic, involving clearances from both
the Ministry of Planning and International Cooperation and the Ministry of Finance. The conditions were not
met until ten months following Board approval of the Credit. To a certain degree, this delay was anticipated by
the project team and 120 days rather than the standard 90 days were provided in the DCA to meet the
Conditions, but this proved to be insufficient.

28.    To improve Project performance and prospects of meeting expected objectives by the credit phase
completion date, the MTR gave rise to a number of DCA amendments (see details in Para. 15).

29.     Other obstacles and implementation delays that affected the Project were for the most part overcome
through dialogue between the Bank supervision teams and the RWSSP – GOY, though not without some
impact on outputs:

                                                      6
    a. Delays in meeting the conditions for credit effectiveness (10 months following project approval)
       caused slow start-up and reduced prospects for achieving expected accomplishments during the first
       phase;
    b. Slow recruitment and appointment of key technical personnel, including procurement specialists,
       sanitation specialist, and M & E officer;
    c. No effective M&E framework was developed at the outset of the project;
    d. The sanitation infrastructure and hygiene component did not begin until mid 2004, resulting in
       limited evidence that the sanitation infrastructure component met the proposed but ill-defined original
       targets;
    e. Procurement planning and transaction procedures acceptable to the Bank were not met until mid-2004
       causing slow disbursements during first phase implementation;
    f. Despite repeated efforts to improve the financial management systems, they were consistently under-
       performing unitl the final years of implementation;
    g. The Dutch co-financed RWSS TA component was delayed for two years following Project
       effectiveness;
    h. Proposed RWSSP collaboration with a Central Statistics Office GIS mapping exercise, while
       recommended as early as 2003 did not receive attention until 2008 and was not completed before the
       end of the project.

30.     The expectation that RWSSP would be the stand-bearer for RWSS sector reform, drive sector
coordination and collaboration, and stimulate GARWSP reorganization along community-based implement-
tation methodologies did not receive the attention anticipated until the latter years of the project.

31.      In favor of focusing on water supply improvements, limited attention to sanitation infrastructure and
hygiene promotion was given through the first 2½ years of implementation. Some cursory hygiene education
– awareness promotion was carried out, though rather unsystematically with limited results. Considerable
advancements were seen from the MTR period forward in building demonstration and individual household
latrines, sanitation facilities at schools, mosques, and health centers and some small scale centralized sewage
collection and communal septic tank sanitation facilities. Similarly, more active hygiene promotion
campaigning and related training activities were initiated and sustained throughout 2010. However the intent to
identify and pilot sanitation cost sharing arrangements that would be part of the rural water and sanitation
strategy was not carried out.

32.      Project management, training and technical assistance formed the third component of the RWSSP.
The PMU suffered from high staff turn-over in its early years including the Project Director, financial
management, and procurement personnel. The GOY was often slow in recruiting replacement staff and filling
other key positions - sanitation, hygiene and M & E specialists. The absence of these dedicated positions
adversely impacted Project performance and expected outputs evidenced by the slow start up of the sanitation
infrastructure activities, hygiene promotion/training, and the intention to develop a comprehensive M & E
system that never effectively got off the ground.

33.     RWSS Technical Assistance (RWSS –TA) for the National RWSS Strategy: The RWSSP was
designed to have a parallel component of external technical assistance for RWSS strategy formulation.
Financing was provided by a grant from the Dutch Government that was executed by the World Bank’s Water
and Sanitation Program (WSP).

34.      The RWSS-TA did not start until two years after RWSSP credit effectiveness. At the time of
commencement the interests of the stakeholders were diverging and this led to a rethinking of TA alignment
and objectives. The RWSS Project, GARWSP and the MWE were all considered as prospective counterparts
for the RWSS-TA. At the insistence of the donor, the TA program was focused on GARWSP as the
institutional base.

35.       Ultimately the technical assistance project adopted an overarching approach of general support to
RWSS sector reform with a concentrated focus on supporting GARWSP re-organization and in adopting
approaches piloted by the RWSSP. This program proved to be untenable given the divergent approaches
initially adopted by GARWSP and RWSSP. Nonetheless, a significant number of TA objectives in support of

                                                      7
sector reform and GARWSP restructuring were met: i) a RWSS Policy and Strategy Paper was prepared and
approved by the Ministry (though not ratified), ii) GARWSP institutional and capacity development improved;
a program for the decentralization and development of autonomous branch offices, project cycle
implementation, incorporating some aspects of community driven development components, were achieved;
iii) a GARWSP monitoring, evaluation and data management plan was developed; iv) a RWSS database
program administered by GARWSP was designed (but not fully operational by the end of the project) and;
v) the RWSS Sub-Sector Finance and Resource Flows Assessment –Study was carried out. Ultimately the
RWSS TA appears to have been less than a fully effective mechanism for supporting the RWSSP strategy
objectives or for bringing GARWSP into alignment with the DRA approaches of the Project. The RWSS TA
project ended in October 2005.

2.3       Monitoring and Evaluation Design, Implementation and Utilization

36.     The Project’s monitoring and evaluation (M&E) design was undertaken before the Bank initiated a
more robust approach to results monitoring. The lack of an effective monitoring and evaluation system during
most of the project implementation period is a significant shortcoming. Comprehensive and reliable data on
project performance measured against a baseline would have allowed for more precise assessment of project
outcomes and outputs. Inadequacies in the project’s original design included:

      a. Many of the results indicators were not well defined , with made it difficult to measure and track them;

      b. The Results Framework in the Project Appraisal Document did not consistently include baseline and
         target values;

      c. The Outcome Indicators in the original Results Framework included a set of impact indicators (school
         attendance of girls, diarrhea incidence in children) that are difficult to measure without specialized
         support or dedicated impact evaluations, and even harder to attribute to a specific intervention or
         project. This issue was resolved in the Consolidated Results Framework that was agreed at the time of
         the Additional Financing Grant, which excluded these indicators.

37.     Project monitoring and evaluation systems guidelines and key performance indicators were outlined
the Project Implementation Manual (PIM). The DCA requested that Project Monitoring Reports (PMR) be
prepared on a quarterly basis according to a recommended format. During project implementation, various
proposals were generated to upgrade and strengthen M & E systems to mixed and ultimately limited results.

38.      Supervision teams recommended hiring a dedicated M&E specialist to develop a participatory
monitoring methodology involving PIUs, WUAs, and SMTs. This was also seen as potential mechanism to
monitor implementation of the NWSSIP. Terms of reference were prepared, including provisions for a
comprehensive GIS, revised key project indicators, recommendations for a Monitoring Information System
that included mechanisms for a governorate-based data collection system that could be harmonized with the
emerging GARWSP M&E system. The GIS was suggested as a means to plot project outputs against MDG
indicators. In parallel the RWSSP GIS system was to have encouraged linkages with a nascent system under
development at Central Statistics Office. Discussions with both the CSO and GARWSP on modalities for
amalgamating relevant features were held though no concrete progress ever recorded. As late as April 2007 the
Project was still seeking, though ultimately abandoned, hiring a consultant to develop and guide the proposals
for a fully operational M&E system at the RWSSP. No comprehensive M&E system was put into place during
the course of the RWSSP.

39.     A consumer satisfaction survey was commissioned by the RWSSP in August 2008 in an effort to
comparatively evaluate the performance of the various implementation mechanisms employed by RWSSP,
GARWSP, the Public Works Project, UNICEF, and the Social Fund for Development. The survey assessed
176 functioning schemes in three governorates: Ibb, Hajja and Abyan. The final survey report was never
formally presented nor issued for public review due to concerns about the quality and clarity of the report,




                                                        8
although field research and data collected was considered to be of a good standard. The data was used for a
summary analysis by the Bank’s Development Research Group2.

40.     M&E Utilization. Despite many halting attempts at formulating and implementing a comprehensive
sector-wide M&E system that would measure all RWSS programs in Yemen, Project efforts never progressed
much beyond a limited output of basic monitoring information on physical progress, financial implementation,
procurement and environment compliance, consolidated into the quarterly reporting of Project inputs, activities
and outputs. While data was collected, there is no evidence it was ever systematically evaluated. The
Project’s monitoring data was used almost exclusively to respond to Bank and Borrower supervision demands
rather than for in-depth evaluation that could have provided lessons and guided refinements to Project
implementation.

2.4     Safeguards and Fiduciary Compliance
41.     Environmental: An Environmental Assessment (EA) focusing on the three Phase I governorates was
carried out as a feature of Project preparation. In accordance with the provisions of World Bank Operational
Directive 4.01 the Project was assigned a category B rating as there were no identified major adverse
environmental issues. The EA was annexed to the Project Implementation Manual (PIM) to facilitate
addressing various possible impacts and contingencies to be taken for each relevant Project component.

42.     Water source sustainability, assessed by pump testing in most cases, and water quality analyses
including physical, chemical and bacteriological analyses were obligatory baseline criteria for sub-projects.
For the most part these tests were systematically carried out. In the early stages of Project implementation
however, such testing was often not performed before start-up of the social and technical study components at
times resulting in some sub-projects being dropped from consideration due to inadequate ex-facto results. This
issue was quickly rectified. It was further agreed that a second water quality testing would be carried out six
months after works completion. Follow-up testing was not conducted by the Project in favor of the WUA’s
carrying out such testing on a periodic basis to ensure ongoing monitoring of water quality standards.

43.     Safeguards: According to WB safeguard policy guidelines the Project involved neither incursions nor
related concerns involving: natural habitats, forestry, cultural property, indigenous people, involuntary
resettlement, land acquisition or impact on international water ways. Ex post analysis suggests that social
impacts have been positive, with Project benefits directed disproportionately at poorer communities in the
project districts.

44.     Financial Management: A sound, transparent financial management system that conforms to IDA
standards, including a Financial Management Manual, an overall Financial Management Plan along with
qualified financial management personnel were conditions for credit effectiveness. During the course of the
Project numerous recommendations for improving the system were made and subsequent efforts undertaken to
meet compliance requirements.

45.     The Financial Management Manual was developed to the satisfaction of the Bank, but its guidelines
were not were not immediately put in practice. The Project experienced a high turn-over in financial
management personnel, and this was compounded by difficulties in recruiting capable replacement staff,
particularly at the PMU level. At the time of the MTR in October 2004, the Project’s financial management
system was evaluated as unsatisfactory.

46.     A financial manager and capable accountants, including a Yemen Ministry of Finance representative,
were brought into the Project in early 2006. Greater accuracy was noted in Project records keeping thereafter.
However new flaws in the system were noted and recommendations were made to reduce delays in
reconciliation of bank statements that resulted in unknown monthly balances, over-extended and unresolved

advances to PIU’s, poor management of contractor letters of guarantee, inconsistent back-up of accounting
data (at risk of complete loss). The Project’s financial management system remained unsatisfactory to
moderately unsatisfactory throughout much of the Project and was tagged as a moderate risk to Project
efficacy through early 2007.

47. In the Jun-Jul 2007 supervision mission the financial management system was upgraded to moderately
satisfactory based on compliance with: i) closing the US dollar account fed by the IDA special account in
conformity with WB Operational Policy 12.02, ii) putting in place improved assets control and registry, iii)
improved bank accounts control, including PMU monitoring of the PIUs activities, iv) improved disbursement
planning, iv) improved on-hand cash management, vi) upgraded auditing procedures including revised 2004-
2005 back audits, vii) improved management of beneficiary contribution accounts.

48. In the early years of the Project financial progress as measured by expenditures seriously lagged behind
physical progress, although for the most part commitments taken as whole equated to planned disbursement
rates. These circumstances were further exacerbated by the obligation for expenditure authorization from the
MOPIC and MOF to draw funds from their special account. This situation was rectified in favor of a
streamlined approval process.

49. The financial management systems of the RWSSP received only moderately satisfactory or lower ratings
through 2008, but were ultimately upgraded to satisfactory in June 2009 following improvement of
management systems.

50.      Procurement: The RWSSP Project Implementation Manual (PIM), prepared in mid 2001, outlined a
detailed approach to procurement procedures compliant with IDA credit guidelines. An annual calendar year
procurement plan (PP) including all proposed activities and further describing methods, estimated costs and
expected dates for each procedure was requested from the PMU (incorporating PIU Projections) for Bank
review and approval. Prior Bank review / approval of proposed PP’s were to be used to clear the eligibility of
activities, timing resource allocations and procurement methodology while periodically monitoring scheduled
plan dates with actual implementation dates.

51.      Through 2003 there was inadequate procurement planning and procedural activities despite Bank
established guidelines and admonishments to produce detailed annual plans covering all sectors of the Project.
Purchase of Project management information system software was approved, which was to have given rise to a
more systematic and detailed approach to procurement planning. Following the resignation of the procurement
officer designate in April 2004, a replacement was assigned to upgrade the procurement planning processes.
Subsequent to his hire procurement planning and process activities improved considerably, receiving a
satisfactory rating in the MTR.

52.     In an effort to speed up the rate of Project implementation, improve the efficiency of the Project cycle,
encourage competitive selection of quality service contractors, improve standards of performance and
generally reduce the supervision burden on the PMU, procurement plans were devised to package together
various related activities in lots covering whole governorates, e.g., pump and water quality testing, surveying
and design, construction contracting, training, etc. This approach while seen as a streamlining measure was
employed sparingly.

53.     To expedite Project implementation, recommendations to minimize procedural bottlenecks were
enacted. MOPIC relinquished its prior expenditures approval, while agreeing with revised procurement
thresholds for goods, works and national shopping.

54.    Both ex-post and prior procurement procedure reviews determined substantial improvements to
procurement planning; recommended procedures and processes were effectively carried out in general
agreement with DCA and Financing Agreement recommended guidelines. From the MTR to project closure
procurement processes were rated as satisfactory.




                                                       10
2.5     Post-completion Operation/Next Phase
55.     During the second half of the RWSSP period of implementation efforts toward greater donor
harmonization in the water sector led to the formulation of the Water Sector Support Project (WSSP). WSSP
was conceived broadly as a sector-wide approach initiative with pooled financing from the World Bank and
the Netherlands, and coordinated parallel programs financed by KfW and GTZ. WSSP essentially provides
budget support for implementing NWSSIP in the four inter-related components of water resources
management, irrigation, urban water supply and sanitation, and rural water supply and sanitation. This evolved
into the logical financing mechanism for scaling up the DRA strategy demonstrated by RWSSP within the
context of the national RWSS Program.

56.     The RWSSP approach (DRA with packaging of schemes into single works contracts) is now largely
endorsed and progressively being implemented by GARWSP and its branch offices (BOs). The BOs receive
support from former RWSSP-PIU staff. GARWSP has established a Special Unit to manage the transition.
The integration is supported by the Water Sector Support Program (WSSP) and four schemes in Hajjah and Ibb
governorates are under implementation by the Special Unit as part of the 2011 Annual Action Plan (AOP) of
WSSP-RWSS component implemented by GARWSP.

57.     RWSSP’s shorter implementation of civil works has not always resulted in a short overall project cycle
(from social mobilization to handing over to the WUA) where GARWSP boreholes were not already available.
In addition, the reliability of water from open wells and the sustainability of water from boreholes in deep
aquifers that are being overdrawn due to poor management of water resources are major issues for the quality
and long term sustainability of services. The WSSP decentralized and integrated programming system at
basin/governorate level offers an opportunity to address these major issues. Under the leadership of the
National Water Resource Authority (NWRA) and in the framework of the Water Law and the Decentralization
Law all water stakeholders will have an opportunity to identify and develop in a coordinated and
complementary way (PWP and SFD focusing on water harvesting method) the best sources of water. This
should ensure that groundwater abstraction will complement and not replace traditional water harvesting
systems where they exist.

58.      Although systematic establishment of WUAs is a major achievement of the Project, the extent of
training they received was in a few cases insufficient and the modalities for their support and supervision in the
operation phase were not carefully organized. Here also, WSSP offers an opportunity to support GARWSP
Branches in taking over this function to continue and strengthen support for WUAs in addressing technical,
financial, and water resource management issues to ensure quality and sustainability of services.

59.     RWSSP has directly supported the development of household sanitation through hygiene
promotion/education and incentives for water supply household connections. However, RWSSP interventions
in small-scale sewer systems for rural communities show that more research and development is needed to
develop technologies adapted to the diverse Yemen environment. A special sanitation unit could be established
in GARWSP with the support of RWSSP former staff. In addition, GARWSP will cooperate with the Social
Fund for Development and the Public Works Project to experiment with new sanitation systems.

60.     To facilitate the integration of the best RWSSP staff into GARWSP structure it is recommended that
the GARWSP budget structure be modified to transfer social mobilization, training and work supervision from
the recurrent to the investment budget. RWSSP qualified staff could then be hired as consultants by GARWSP
and financed from WSSP.

3.      Assessment of Outcomes

3.1     Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

61.     Throughout the period of appraisal/ design and implementation the objectives, outputs and expected
outcomes of the Project remained a leading development priority of the GOY; their relevance was consistently
high to very high. Proportionally, Bank country assistance strategies (CAS) during the pertinent years reflected


                                                       11
and adequately justified supporting the expressed interests of the GOY to improve rural infrastructure, with a
particular focus on RWSS.

62.     In 2004/2005 GOY, with the support of the donor community, completed the first long-term National
Water Supply and Sanitation Investment Program (NWSSIP) putting forward an ambitious agenda to improve
services and target relevant water and sanitation MDG’s. The GOY plan included specific requests for World
Bank assistance while drawing on lessons from the RWSSP. Although it was prepared in advance of the
declaration of the MDGs, the Project was well aligned with global priorities and the targets set forth therein,
most notably the targets for improving access to safe WSS services. During the Project’s ten year
implementation period, the development goals it prioritized remained highly relevant.

3.2      Achievement of Project Development Objectives

63.      The Consolidated Results Framework (CRF) adopted at the time additional financing was approved in
2008 was consistent with the objectives for the original credit. The project had two PDOs, one related to the
direct establishment of sustainable rural water and sanitation systems and the other to developing a national
strategy.

64.     Objective 1 - Sustainable improvement of rural water supply and sanitation services and hygiene
habits in the project area. The end-of-project targets were three-fold:

      a. 225 water sub-projects serving a population of 650,000. 90% of the water systems were to be
         “functioning well” and 75% of the sub-projects would have user charges that cover all operation and
         maintenance costs.
      b. 150 two-latrine blocks built at schools and mosques, 15,000 household latrines construction supported
         in about 40 communities, six small sewer systems completed, and 140 health promoters trained.
      c. About 350,000 people were to have been trained in improved hygiene, and hygiene behavior
         improvements were to have been evaluated.

65.     Water Supplies: Summary evidence indicates that 242 water supply schemes (against a target of 225
schemes) were constructed or rehabilitated by the Project that serve approximately 619,000 rural inhabitants,
representing 95 percent of the consolidated target population of 650,000. It should be noted that the first phase
of the project significantly surpassed the original target of 450,000 people served. During the additional
financing phase the cost of materials rose dramatically in both nominal and real terms as a result of fuel price
increases and the global financial crisis and this reduced the number of sub-projects that could be financed by
the Project. It should also be noted that the project generated a pipeline of more than 100 additional sub-
projects that were ready for implementation at the end of the Project. Implementation of these is being
financed through the WSSP.

66.      Although security conditions toward the end of the project and during the preparation of the ICR
prevented detailed or extensive field work, there is acceptable substantiation that the expected outcome of
systems sustainability is high. The WUAs are regularly collecting user fees, and O&M cost recovery targets
were being met in at least 10 of the 11 Water User Associations (91 percent compared to a target of 75 percent)
at the time they were interviewed (one WUA did not provide data). The indicator about “well functioning
water systems” is hard to measure as it is not clear what the criteria are (i.e. reliability of service, the quality of
the service, the financial sustainability of the service, etc.). More than 80% (gathered from satisfaction survey
findings in two governorates) of established WUA’s are operating effectively to finance and carry out at least
basic operation and maintenance, in many cases 5-6 years following the scheme’s construction. Customer
satisfaction surveys in 3 governorates indicate that 91.6 percent of RWSS project respondents rated overall
maintenance of the water network as satisfactory or better.

67.     Sanitation: The Project was successful in constructing 191 public latrines against a target of 150 at a
variety of institutions including schools, mosques, WUA offices and other locations selected by communities.
The project provided direct support in the form of latrine kits for constructing 2,385 household latrines. The
Project design concept called for the Project to promote household latrine construction primarily through

                                                          12
health education and requiring construction of household sanitation facilities as a prerequisite for obtaining a
house connection for water in all sub-projects and a target of 15,000 household latrines to be constructed was
established. The actual effectiveness of this approach was not monitored or evaluated, but national data suggest
that access to improved sanitation in rural Yemen overall has increased from 21 percent in 2000 to 33 percent
in 2009. RWSSP also financed the construction of thirteen small sewer systems that were functioning at the
time of project completion, exceeding the project target of six sewer systems.

68.      Hygiene: The weak project monitoring system prevented accurate assessment of the achievement of
the hygiene target. However, the project provided hygiene and sanitation training to 1209 health promoters
(compared to a target of 140 health promoters trained) who work at village and district levels, and the Project
has estimated that these promoters have in turn provided training to more than 400,000 (target 350,000) rural
dwellers in the project governorates. The impact of this training on actual behaviors was not monitored and no
Project-specific baseline data was developed against which to measure health or hygiene improvements or
impacts as a result of RWSSP interventions. However, national data show that infant and child mortality rates
have declined over the past decade, with infant mortality dropping from 72.5 per 1000 in 2000 to 50.8 per
1000 in 2009, and under five morality rates dropping slightly faster from 100.40 per 1000 in 2000 to 66.4 per
1000 in 2009. Cursory government health data suggest that the incidence water and sanitation-related diseases
is also declining in the Project areas.

69.     Objective 2 – New RWSS Strategy based on the project’s demand-driven and participatory
approach is adopted by Government and under implementation in the project area. The end of project
target was to have the RWSS strategy formulated and used to inform the design of the subsequent Water
Sector Support Program, and to have the strategy adopted for the national RWSS program.

70.     Through the RWSSP model, Yemen was successfully introduced to the processes and techniques of
DRA. Decentralization, through both the RWSSP PIUs and the progressive decentralization of the RWSS
national program has been shown to be relevant and improves prospects for community managed, sustainable
RWSS. A draft RWSS Strategy and Policy paper and reform agenda was formulated through a national
participatory process guided by the RWSS TA Project and submitted for cabinet discussion in 2004. The
document provided the basis for substantial portions of both the first and the updated NWSSIP, underscoring
the GOY’s acceptance of the principles presented therein.

71.     With the support of many collaborators, including the RWSSP, the expected outcome of a national
RWSS investment program ready for implementation was met. The NWSSIP, prepared and presented in late
2004, proposed an ambitious agenda of rapid expansion of RWSS services targeting "half the MDGs" (5
million inhabitants by 2015) along with estimated financing requirements. Though financing allocated by
government and donors averaged only 58% of the NWSSIP targets there is unfolding evidence that sub-sector
wide compliance with the precepts of NWSSIP and the NWSSIP update are underway. Key donors in the
water sector agreed to provide financial support to implementing the NWSSIP through a sector-wide approach
and pooled funding through the Water Sector Support Program.

72.     During the additional financing the RWSSP project team worked with GARWSP to identify a series of
training interventions for GARWSP headquarters and branch office staff to develop capacity for integrating
DRA in that national RWSS program. The training program was fully executed.

73.     However, the systematic transfer of successfully tested project approaches was not at Project end fully
and effectively institutionalized in the national RWSS program (GARWSP). Nonetheless, while not as yet
fully embraced in its recommended forms and methods by all sub-sector implementers, some important strides
are now being made with the noted inclusion of GARWSP.

74.      The RWSSP invested considerable resources in establishing and building up the technical and
financial management and planning capabilities of the WUAs. User satisfaction survey findings suggest that
the Project’s strategy for developing community capacity and meaningful involvement in planning and
managing their own water and sanitation systems is effective. The strategy has resulted in relatively high levels
of beneficiary satisfaction and has increased the likelihood that the communities will sustain the systems over
their design lives.

75.     Outcomes Summary (as expressed through key performance indicators and Project targets): Evidence
indicates the overall Project objective and the majority of performance indicators were generally met. There
were minor to moderate shortcomings in achieving the objectives of the Project.

76.     A significant indicator of the impact of Project outcomes is the level of support the approach has
received from the governorates in which the project was implemented. In 2009 Abyan Governorate allocated
approximately US$2.6 million from the governorate budget for the RWSSP PIU to implement an additional 12
RWSS Projects using the Project approach. Abyan Governorate continued to provide budget allocations
supplemental to the Project in 2010.

3.3      Efficiency

77.     Project Efficiency: An ex-ante cost benefit analysis was undertaken during project preparation. This
ex ante analysis estimated that the project would generate a Net Present Value of $13.5 million, and an Internal
Rate of Return of 17 percent.

78.      Using the same methodology, the ex-post analysis suggests a a Net Present Value of $10.7 million, and
an Internal Rate of Return of 23 percent. The largest benefits were linked to cost savings as households would
be less dependent on the use of traditional sources (i.e, vendor water, or costs associated with hauling water).

79.      These indicators are actually underestimating the efficiency of the project, as the project also generated
substantial employment benefits. These employment benefits were temporary and permanent. The contracting
of works generated up to the end of 2009, 301, 922 working days of which 83 percent pertained to unskilled
labor and the remainder to skilled labor. In addition, the project generated 108 staff in the Project
Implementation Unit. The establishment of the WUAs also generated employment as operators, meter readers
and bill collectors were required. The total employment which is permanent amounts to about 2,904
jobs – although it is not clear whether these are full-or part-time jobs.

80.     Unit cost efficiency: Project investment efficiency can be roughly assessed by comparing total
investment costs with the number of people served to arrive at a project per capita cost. As shown in Table 1
below, the Project invested a total of approximately US$40 million from IDA and GoY and an additional
US$3 million from community contributions. With this investment the project was able to serve nearly
619,000 people through completed sub- projects at an average per capita cost of roughly US$703. The large
majority of the water supply systems were piped networks with house connections, and the investment costs
include health education and sanitation interventions. There are significant differences between the sub-
projects that are linked to differences in hydrological conditions and timing (system costs rose significantly
due to fuel price increases in the final years of the project). The per capita cost compares favorably with global
average investment costs for similar service levels in developing countries.

  A small percentage of sub-projects involved only rehabilitation, the cost of which was significantly lower than
completely new schemes. Small-scale piped water supply systems were estimated to cost on average US$65 per capita
without boreholes, and US$75 with boreholes at the time of appraisal.

3.4     Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

81.     The Project remained highly consistent with GOY rural development interests and as reflected in core
RWSS development priorities expressed in the various WB- Yemen CAS. It generally met most of its
expected outputs and outcomes. In doing so it highlighted the effectiveness of community based DRA methods
and good prospects for service quality and sustainability. It developed a replicable model with comparatively
acceptable per capita investment costs and a relatively fast sub-project implementation cycle for water supply
improvements.

82.      However, the poorly developed and executed M&E component prevented full and accurate assessment
of some project outputs. In addition, the sanitation and hygiene component was given relatively light attention
until the latter years of project implementation, and the real impacts of the project on hygiene behaviors and
household level sanitation are not well understood

3.5     Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a)     Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
83.     The Project was defined as a poverty alleviation program. However, in the absence of a reference
baseline, the impact of the RWSSP on poverty is difficult to assess. Nonetheless, the eligibility of districts for
inclusion in the Project was based on poverty criteria and data derived from a social assessment carried out
under the World Bank-UNICEF Child Development Project. The criteria included infant and under-five
mortality, female school enrollment, poor access to health centers, and poverty, as well as poor access to
drinking water and sanitation. Comparative data from the GOY Central Statistics Office over the time period
2002 - 2009, while not Project specific, indicate girls basic school enrollment increases as high as 35%,
nationwide declines in the infant and under-five mortality rates at 75 and 50 per 1000 live births respectively in
2009 (as opposed to 120-150 as noted at Project appraisal) and declining rural morbidity rates, including
diarrheal diseases, malaria and bilharziasis.

84.     Provisions through the Project were made to encourage the active involvement and participation of
women in the selection, design, implementation and sustainability of their RWSS systems. Many women are
active members of the WUA, representing 10% and more in many cases. Women were substantive participants
in health and hygiene trainings programs and now lead the way in ongoing hygiene – health awareness
messaging. Approximately 1,200 health promoters were trained through the RWSSP, an estimated 45% of
which are women. The Project has made everyday life much easier for households, especially saving women
and children hours of labor fetching water each day.

(b)     Institutional Change/Strengthening
85.      Good capacity, skill sets and a replicable management model was adequately developed by the
RWSSP within the PMU and the decentralized PIUs during the course of its implementation. However, a
noted shortfall was that the RWSSP for the most part worked in isolation with limited capacity transfer to the
national RWSS program, although capacity building and skills transfer with GARWSP was given more
attention during the additional financing phase of the project.

86.    Steps were taken in mid-2010 to establish a dedicated RWSS unit in GARWSP to continue the
implementation methodology piloted by the RWSSP. Financing for this special unit is provided by the Water
Sector Support Project (WSSP) and is expected to eventually lead to full GARWSP assimilation of the
RWSSP model.

(c)     Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)
87.     Clear evidence is surfacing that water consumption has significantly increased in project communities
as a result of improved service. This was not unexpected. However, against a backdrop of diminishing water
resource availability service sustainability is at risk without either vigilant conservation measures or financial

                                                       15
resources being made available (from community savings and/or other sources) to deepen system boreholes or
shallow wells as the water table drops. This concern is exacerbated where water from project systems is used
for agricultural irrigation despite adamant project participation criteria prohibiting such practices.

88.     To ensure service sustainability a significant number of project communities have developed
contingency funds where users, according to their means, pay extra amounts on their monthly bills to address
unforeseen major repairs and/ expansion needs.

89.    Key aspects of the RWSSP approach, specifically the relatively short implementation cycle leading to
more immediate impacts, and clear evidence that the water systems are being well-managed and sustained by
WUAs are particularly attractive to governorate leaders. As an example, Abyan governorate allocated from its
independent budget supplementary funds to implement additional projects through the RWSSP PIU in that
governorate (see Para. 75).

3.6     Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops
90.     Annex 5 provides a more detailed synopsis of the findings from the Beneficiary Survey conducted
during March 2011 by the ICR consultants. For security reasons, the survey was conducted in Ibb and Hajjah
governorates only, and was limited to four days in each governorate. The survey does not pretend to be
representative of the entire project, but it does provide some insight into the results, outputs and outcomes of
the Project.

91.      WUAs, Local Council (LC) and representatives as well as beneficiaries praise the RWSSP approach
resulting in a shorter project implementation cycle. They fully support GARWSP’s decision to move to a
similar approach. Other main findings include: (i) beneficiary satisfaction and acknowledgement that the
quantity, reliability, and quality of their water supply is linked to the type of water source (borehole, shallow
well, or alternatives) and broader water resource management issues, (ii) cooperation with Local Councils and
other stakeholders is necessary to ensure sustainability; (iii) financial sustainability is improved by household
connections and metering, which facilitate transparent tariff charges; (iv) WUAs are generally confident they
can achieve financial sustainability, including O&M as well as major repairs and spare parts; (v) scheme
beneficiaries expressed their satisfaction with the hygiene promotion components of project and seem to be
applying recommendations; (vi) more intense and regular training as well as support and supervision of WUAs
is requested, in particular additional training for O&M; (vii) the quality of public sanitation systems is
questioned, and more support is requested for household sanitation; and (viii) the positive impact of the
Project’s community eligibility criteria, especially the establishment of WUAs, is recognized.

4.      Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: Moderate

92.     The findings of the beneficiary survey indicate that DRA enhances the prospects for service
sustainability. By and large, communities have demonstrated their willingness and capacity to pay, including
many of the poorer and vulnerable community groups. On average, scheme consumers have ready access to
their WUA’s to address service performance issues. More than 50 percent of users indicate that technical
system problems are expeditiously repaired. There is a sense of empowerment among the beneficiaries and
growing political support at the local level through the involvement of district councils to mitigate potentially
detrimental community/WUA conflicts. These are noteworthy indicators of the potential for systems being
sustainable.

93.     For the most part the water supply technologies of choice included i)) mechanized system: shallow
well or borehole, pumping, storage and distribution, and ii) spring sources with gravity distribution. These are
technologies that are fundamentally robust, easy to maintain, well understood by those who operate them; they
meet consumer satisfaction and appear to be technically sustainable.

94.   A fundamental risk to the development outcome of this project as well as most other water projects in
Yemen is the overall depletion of water resources, which is exacerbated by poor water resources management.

                                                       16
WSSP, which began implementation as RWSSP was closing, attempts to address the water resources
management issue and mitigate this risk through water basin-based planning.

95.     There is however, a risk that communities will not be able to sustain revenues from tariffs and build up
financial reserves to adequately operate and maintain their systems and meet unanticipated cost requirements
such as well deepening and major repairs over the long term. More time and monitoring is needed to assess
with certainty the long term capacity of communities to deal with these exigencies.

96.    In isolated cases, tribal leaders have been found to be usurping water systems for self-serving
purposes, but in most cases social pressure through the WUAs seems to be limiting this “elite capture”.

5.      Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1     Bank Performance
(a)     Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

97.     The Project design drew on global and national experiences for community-based, DRA rural water
supply and sanitation programs, while investing considerable time in characterizing relevant Yemen context
parameters that would prospectively enhance successful RWSSP intervention. The context and commensurate
needs of rural Yemen were adequately studied and analyzed. The project design and implementation approach
were new to Yemen and this lent a high degree of risk and uncertainty to the project, in particular to the early
implementation, that the preparation team might have more fully considered in the design and implementation
schedule for the first phase of the project.

98.      Though the process of preparation to Project implementation required approximately three years, this
is not interpreted as Bank performance weakness. Rather, a measure of reasonable patience and attentiveness,
against a backdrop of sub-sector uncertainty, in formulating adequate institutional, implementation
arrangements and regard for the unfolding decentralization process. Project risks were adequately identified
and measures to address them built into the design package.

99.     Bank efforts were particularly intensive and thoughtful during Project identification and preparation as
they addressed the challenges in defining appropriate institutional management and implementation
arrangements. Accordingly, project identification and preparation costs were high, amounting to $627,000
(including trust fund contributions of $110,000).

(b)     Quality of Supervision
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

100.     The Bank supervised the project intensively and was proactive in engaging the implementing agency
in dialogue and with recommendations for improving performance during the long and slow start-up of the
project, based on the information available in aide memoires and related documentation. However,
implementation progress and achievement of development objectives was not accurately reflected in ISR
ratings. The Project was consistently rated satisfactory on both of these measures up to the time of the Mid-
term Review despite the long delays in achieving Effectiveness and the slow pace of implementation during
the early years.

101.    Project supervision intensity lessened following the MTR through late 2007 leading up to formulation
and negotiation of the additional financing grant. During the latter period of the grant phase, 2009-2010, re-
invigorated efforts were made to plan and execute transitional arrangements with renewed efforts to integrate
the Project’s DRA approach and resources within the National RWSS Program in GARWSP.

102.   By and large Bank supervision teams were proactive in seeking ways to improve Project performance.
Aide memoires and ISRs indicate reasonable attention to tracking achievement of the PDOs and overall Project

                                                      17
implementation progress while adequately monitoring fiduciary, procurement and Project management issues.
The mid-term review recommended and was successful in generating various changes that served to
considerably speed-up Project productivity and outputs. However, earlier attention could have been given to
rectifying the shortcomings in the Results Framework and the associated Performance Indictors through a
restructuring that could have been done at the time of the Mid-term Review. In practice, the Results
Framework was not improved until the time of the Additional Financing Grant in 2008.

103.    Four task team leaders were involved in the ten year duration of the RWSSP. This was seen not to
adversely affect supervision quality of the Project as the transitions were effectively seamless with substantial
cooperative dialogue between the Bank, GOY, implementing partners and related stakeholders. Twenty six
supervision missions were carried out, on average more than two each year. Supervision costs were moderately
high, averaging more than $93,000 per year over the life of the project. The high costs can be justified by the
innovative nature of the project design within the Yemen context, and the security and other challenges
associated with managing projects in Yemen.

(c)     Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

104.    The Project was appropriately designed and received generally good quality supervision by the Bank.
Task teams were pragmatic in recognizing and recommending actions to improve performance and generate
Project momentum and subsequent outputs. Numerous proposals and guidelines were developed to upgrade
various management and technical Project components; e.g., financial systems, M&E; either they fell short in
expectations or never arrived, though not for lack of effort on the Bank side moreover a general reluctance by
the National RWSP Program to address them in favor of delivering infrastructure outputs.

105.    The Bank was consistent in its progressive development of CAS and a dedicated Country Water
Resource Assistance Strategy (CWRAS – 2004). At all times the Bank gave commensurate attention to GOY,
Project and stakeholder perspectives in the advancement of not only the Project but also RWSS sub-sector
issues of relevance.

5.2     Borrower Performance
(a)     Government Performance
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory
106.    Government ownership and commitment to the overall development objectives was good. However,
similar commitment to nationally integrating the community-based / DRA less so, evidenced by the
interminable reluctance of the national RWSS program to fully embrace, align and implement its portfolio
during the lifespan of the RWSSP within the demonstrated methodology of the Project model. This was
possibly due to extended debate over systems development costs seen by them as comparatively high and
management conflict issues.

(b)     Implementing Agency Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

107.    RWSSP management, including both the PMU and the governorate PIU’s, was generally dedicated to
and believed in the Project’s objectives and proposed methodologies. They generally responded well to Bank
recommendations to improve overall Project performance. Particular attention should be drawn to the Ibb
Governorate PIU as an exemplary model of systematic, resourceful, committed and ultimately very effective
application of the DRA mechanism.

108.    While all Bank recommendations were not fully and successfully incorporated, e.g. M & E systems
and financial management, these shortcomings were largely not for lack of effort on behalf of the Project
management. Moreover, it should be borne in mind that personnel turnover was high and local capacity often
limited requiring high learning curves, against a backdrop of donor expectations for rapid results achievement.

                                                       18
The PMU and PIUs made substantially successful strides forward in advancing their capacity, skill sets and
Project outputs. They are a valuable asset that GARWSP should capitalize on in the National RWSS
Program.

(c)     Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
109.   Borrower performance was generally good and very active during project design and preparation.
They were similarly positive in reacting to recommendations to streamline aspects of administration to
improve performance and outputs. Initially slow advances at the PMU level were seen as a largely
unavoidable period for understanding, absorbing and generating a working formula to operationalize proposed
methodologies and approaches that were new in Yemen while finding the right mix of sector professionals.
Considerable noteworthy improvements and progress in performance and results were made from year 2004
onward evidenced by approved Bank / IDA additional, second phase funding. The end result was a fairly high
performing Project and successful realization of most of its principle objectives and expected outputs.

6.      Lessons Learned

110.     Sustainability of outcomes is dependent on sustainable water resources management. The
sustainability of existing water sources was questioned at the time of appraisal and during early supervision of
the Project. Although boreholes, where feasible, provided adequate water during the first years, uncontrolled
drilling for irrigating qat is threatening the sustainability of deep groundwater aquifers. In mountainous areas
open wells in wadi beds are the major source of water; evidence shows they are not providing sufficient water
in winter months and households need to rely on other sources (roof water harvesting, delivery from water
tanks, small dams, springs, etc). Mechanized systems (power generator, electric pump) implemented by
RWSSP and GARWSP should not be considered as an exclusive alternative nor seen as a disincentive to
traditional water harvesting systems, but as a component of a comprehensive water resource management
system at village or sub-basin level. Cooperation with the Social Fund for Development on water harvesting
and other water supply alternatives should be more systematically applied in areas where the main sources of
water are open wells in wadi beds.

111.    Reaching the poor requires adaptation of demand-responsive approaches. Household connections and
metering is often not affordable in poor areas and by the poorest households. Because house connections and
water meters were not included in the civil works contracts and left as a beneficiary responsibility, the Project
did not keep track of house connections. Supervision missions found cases where service was not delivered
because beneficiaries did not have the financial resources to connect to the network. To address the issue, the
RWSSP included the cost of household connections and metering in the contracts after 2007. Continuing
national RWSS implementation under GARWSP should consider an approach that includes house connections
and metering in project investments.

112.     Sanitation components can be complex and require close supervision attention. The apparent shortfall
in sanitation infrastructure services and consistent hygiene practices education of the RWSSP is noted. While
the RWSSP portfolio did nominally address these issues they were done so in a less than proactively steady
manner. Bank supervision should have more closely monitored this vital component; in the absence of greater
project attention, a threat of financing suspension may not have been an unreasonable consideration.

113.    Harmonization between projects in a programmatic approach can provide more comprehensive and
sustainable outcomes. RWSS projects should either address all components of a RWSS scheme in a
comprehensive manner or closely coordinate with other stakeholders to ensure adequate delivery and
sustainability of services. RWSSP was expected to use existing sources of water and focus on the formation
and strengthening of Water User Associations as well as transportation, storage and main distribution of water
(financing and installation of house connections and metering was initially left to the households themselves).

114.     In areas where household latrines are a condition for house connections, the cost of household
sanitation could be financed by the project with cost recovery arrangements made through the WUA in order to
accelerate coverage. More work needs to be put into developing appropriate low cost solutions that can serve

                                                       19
environmental requirements and be affordable to households. Household connections are the solution preferred
by beneficiaries, therefore RWSS Projects should include the financing of household sanitation and a project
component should deal with the research and development of appropriate technologies in collaboration with
local stakeholders which have experience in rural sanitation (SFD, UNICEF and NGOs).

115.    Package contracts for sub-projects are relatively fast and efficient. The procurement arrangement
successfully used by RWSSP should be used by GARWSP to reduce the length of the civil work phase of the
project cycle (piped network, pumping units and tank). The packaging of most scheme components (supply
and installation of network, pipes, pumps and generator, and water tank) into one single turn-key civil work
contract, implemented over an average eight – twelve month period, has been appealing to communities and
Local Authorities. GARWSP should consider this type of packaging as an alternative to the bulk procurement
of pipes and pumps. The efficiency of RWSSP contracting system should be compared, in each governorate,
to the new GARWSP procurement system under which installation of pipes and pump will be contracted to
small contractors or communities at the level of each scheme. GARWSP could use the RWSSP operation
manual on project selection process, planning and implementation.

116.     Monitoring and evaluation should be embedded in community-based projects to provide communities
with feedback. Monitoring and evaluation and support to WUAs in the Operation and Maintenance phase
should be decentralized at Governorate and District level. Because of the shortcomings of RWSSP monitoring
and evaluation system and the long delays in carrying out the joint inventory of rural water schemes by RWSS
stakeholders, there is no reliable assessment of the current status of service delivery in RWSSP schemes. It is
therefore not possible to assess the equitability and the quality of water services in rural areas. RWSS
programs supported by GARWSP, SFD, PWP, UNICEF and others should assist local authorities at
governorate and district levels to establish District Water Services Assessments including databases of water
supply schemes of all types and with special emphasis on the type and localization of water sources in
collaboration with NWRA Branches. WSSP activities in the RWSS subsector would be justified by and would
refer to the Assessment

117.    Developing a value-laden (and enforceable) M & E strategy for monitoring and evaluating Project
performance and as means to feed the national “need to know” should have been more adequately predicted
and built in at Project preparation and steadily over-sighted during supervision. Against the setting of a
monumental lack of knowledge as to the status and inventory of nation-wide RWSS coverage, the opportunity
to reduce this void could have (in part) been averted with a more effectively operational RWSSP M & E
system.

118.     Decentralized service delivery works. Decentralized RWSS service development as shown through
the implementation approach of the RWSSP PIUs offers good prospects for scaling-up coverage. Adequately
meeting Project targets, particularly water supply systems development, demonstrated the potential to
effectively take the recommended approach nationwide. Employing a step by step approach with concise,
understandable and accountable rules can and was shown to effectively build sustainability capacity at both the
systems implementation and beneficiary/user management level.

119.    Water User Associations need ongoing support. Training and support to WUAs should not be limited
to the construction phase. To ensure sustainability of services, WUA performance should be monitored and
supported during the operation phase. GARWSP Branches have the appropriate mandate and should be
supported by WSSP to provide support to WUAs and Local Authorities. Although the Project has enabled the
communities to independently own and operate their infrastructure schemes without significant assistance, a
follow-on support mechanism, with greater focal capacity, than seen in the district local council apparatus,
might be considered. Such a mechanism, e.g. NGO’s, dedicated national RWSS program unit (at GARWSP),
could provide technical, management and administrative assistance to the WUAs to help sustain the good
practices initiated during Project implementation.

120.    Integrating PMUs within national institutions is challenging. Management of physical and human
resource assets after Project closing is a generic concern in Yemen. Until national institutions such as
GARWSP can provide competitive employment conditions for qualified staff, former Project staff will try to
move to other PMUs. GARWSP could retain RWSSP most qualified staff either as short term consultants to

                                                      20
GARWSP Branches, for social mobilization, technical design, procurement, work supervision, hygiene
education and training of WUAs. This will require that those “software” activities be transferred from
GARWSP operating budget to the investment budget as part of the investment cost. They would then be
eligible for financing from WSSP funding.

121.    Community-based, demand-responsive approaches work in Yemen. As an alternative to the supply-
driven service delivery mechanisms historically practiced in Yemen, systematic application of the community
demand driven approach has been demonstrated to work rather successfully. Enabling communities to fully
participate in the decision-making process of planning, design, implementation and management motivates
them to be responsible stewards for the sustainability of their systems. If demand for reliable and sustainable
water service remains high, as it has shown to be, communities are adequately braced to address the next level
of challenges, including resource conservation, schemes expansion, major repairs and breakdowns. Nowhere
else nor employing other approaches in this context have proven to be as successful as that shown through the
RWSSP.

The RWSSP comprised three main components: (i) water supply; ii) environmental sanitation; and
iii) institutional strengthening, project management, studies and training. Whereas components i and iii were
seen as generally satisfactory, there is limited evidence, due in large part to poor monitoring, that the sanitation
component fully delivered the expected outputs, in particular pertaining to hygiene behavior change.

Component 1: Water Supply

Key Outputs:

Population served: A nearly 619,000 beneficiaries in 248 implemented sub-projects were served with
improved access to water supply during the Project under two IDA financing phases: Credit Funding, October
2001 – June 2007 and Grant Funding, February 2008-December 2010. Project financing per phase was, in
equivalent SDR units, 15,700,000 and 12,600,000 respectively.

Water supply systems outputs per governorate, number of schemes and estimated population served and
according to the corresponding credit and grant phases are noted in the following table:

Note*- six schemes were developed and implemented by the RWSSP with independent Abyan Governorate funding; the number of
beneficiaries in these schemes has been included in the total population served.


Governorates Served: Ten governorates were originally targeted for RWSSP service development in two
phases. At the mid-term review the Bank and GoY agreed to downsize the Project’s geographic scope to six
governorates with the intent that the project approach would be progressively integrated in the national RWSS
Program within a reasonable time frame during or shortly after completion of the project. RWSSP population
targets remained unchanged and intensified project activities in the six governorates resulted in achievement of
the original population coverage targets.

Water Supply System Types: A wide range of water supply technology options, including boreholes with
storage, pumping and distribution networks, shallow wells with hand-pumps, spring protection and various
alternative technologies such as rain water collection and fog harvesting were offered by the Project.
Significantly the preferred beneficiary water supply technologies included: i) boreholes with pumping, storage
and distribution, iii) shallow wells with distribution and iii) spring sources with gravity distribution. These
technologies are fundamentally robust, easy to maintain, well understood by those who operate them; they
meet consumer satisfaction and appear to be technically sustainable. The following table illustrates the water
supply system choice per governorate:

Metered HH connections: The precise number of metered household connections installed through
independent intervention of the WUA, households themselves or directly by the Project proved difficult to
determine. House connections and water meters were not initially included in the civil works contracts for
sub-projects (from 2007 onward they were provisionally included in construction contracts). The connections
were a beneficiary responsibility and the Project did not record the installation of house connections. Rough
estimates, based loosely on WUA tariff collection records, indicate approximately 5,000 connections and
meters were installed during the project, with indications that more are being installed as the schemes
consolidate and expand under WUA management.

Water supply system major components: Financing and construction of water supply systems included
numerous major technical components: distribution – network piping, storage / water tanks, pump house,
pumps – extraction and booster (various types), electric and diesel generators, O&M small tools and equipment
and in several locations WUA administrative buildings.

Equipment for operation and maintenance and WUA furnishing: Water supply scheme small tool kits were
procured for the use of WUA operations and maintenance staff. 240 basic plumbing tool kits were distributed.
In addition, basic office furniture including 341desks, 1,246 chairs, and 240 book shelves were purchased by
the Project for WUA offices.

Water Quality Monitoring: Adequate source water quality was a baseline criterium for inclusion in the project.
Sampling and testing was carried out during the technical studies for each sub-project employing Yemen water
quality standards (rather than WHO). Follow-on testing after scheme completion was generally left to the
responsibility of the WUA using basic guidelines and rudimentary water quality sampling and testing
equipment packs provided by the RWSSP. The precise number of distributed packs was not recorded by the
Project.

Component 2: Environmental Sanitation

The environmental sanitation component encompassed sanitation promotion, sanitation infrastructure
construction, and health-hygiene awareness raising.

Key Outputs:

Sanitation Promotion: To facilitate sanitation infrastructure promotion, in particular household and cluster
latrines, typical construction design templates were generated by the RWSSP. Eighty seven local community
latrine builders were trained during the project. The latrine builders were subsequently entrusted with
constructing demonstration latrines highlighting basic construction techniques for un-served HH to construct
their own facilities. End of project outputs for both credit and grant phase periods included: 186 latrine units
in mosques, 170 individual school latrines, 12 school block latrines and 21 health center latrine units. This
quantity exceeded the consolidated framework targets.

Sanitation infrastructure – household and small scale excreta disposal facilities: In favor of concentrated
focus on water supply systems outputs, the Project gave limited attention to HH sanitation infrastructure
components through the first 2½ years of active implementation (June 2004). Advances were seen from the
MTR period forward in building demonstration and individual household latrines, school, mosque and health
centers and some small scale centralized sewage collection and septic tank sanitation facilities. However the
intention of the RWSSP to identify and pilot sanitation cost sharing arrangement that would be part of the rural
water and sanitation strategy did not effectively evolve.

HH sanitation facilities: This component included material incentives to households for the construction of
adequate sanitation facilities, i.e. simple dry pit latrines, pour-flush latrines, flush toilet and septic tanks.
Confirmed sanitation infrastructure outputs were difficult to quantify. In was estimated by the project in the
range 30%-40% of participating HH’s already had acceptable facilities. Whereas incentives in terms of cement
and basin pans were to be furnished by the project to address the un-served HH’s; only scant records were kept
by the RWSS P regarding their contribution to this component. Unconfirmed data estimates that 2,385 no. HH
latrine – sanitation facility kits/ incentive contributions were made during the course of the Project, however it
is unknown what additional number of latrines were constructed through independent direct household
investments. This cursory estimate (if accurate) represents considerably less than the consolidated framework
target of 10,000 HH latrines constructed.

Small scale excreta disposal systems: Centralized small scale sewage systems, whose basic design included
collection networks and septic tank disposal/anaerobic treatment were constructed in 13 communities,
including five in Ibb Governorate, nine in Hajja, one in Al Dhale’a and one in Amran. These pilot systems
were justified by the wastewater flow and population density and responded to community selection and
promise of adequate O&M.

Health, Hygiene Education and Awareness Raising: In the parallel with sanitation promotion, health-hygiene
awareness - education was a factored component of the Project. Through dedicated PIU based hygiene
interlocutors, the Project claims to have carried out hygiene awareness raising and training: promoting good
practice of collecting, storing and using water; improve hygienic practice for safe excreta disposal and promote
environmental improvements through solid waste collection and disposal to include greater than 1,200 village
based promoters while reaching out to more than 350,000 beneficiaries. No Project-specific baseline data was
developed against which to assess/ measure health or hygiene improvements or impacts as a result of RWSS P
interventions. However, cursory government health data suggest that the incidence water and sanitation-related
diseases is generally declining in the Project areas.

Other Key Outputs:

Demand Responsive Approaches (DRA): The Project was successful in developing, applying and the output
of prescribed DRA’s that facilitated petitioning communities self-selection, promoting beneficiaries decision-
making in-terms of systems technology choices, responsibilities and the ultimate sense of ownership. Both the

                                                       25
PMU and PIU’s generally believed in and were seen to be committed to the Project’s objectives and
methodologies.

Project qualifying studies carried out vs. actual schemes implemented: While 248 schemes were implemented
during the course of the RWSSP, it is interesting to note the project received a total of 1,021 applications for
assistance with 527 qualifying under the Project’s criteria. At least an additional 89 schemes were assessed,
carrying out either or both social and technical studies. Ultimately it was not implemented due to community
non-compliance issues, limited project funding or imminent project closure.

Women’s participation: Throughout the project women’s participation was encouraged and facilitated.
Approximately 10% of WUA members are women (2,012 no. total, average 9 no./WUA) while also being
substantially represented in health - hygiene awareness/promotion extension committees.

Component 3: Project Management, Institutional Strengthening – Training, Studies and Technical
Assistance

The significant components in this category included: (i) project management; (ii) institutional strengthening;
(iii) technical support and training at central/governorate/community levels, PMU, PIUs, SMTs and WUAs;
and (iv) technical assistance: sector review and studies to formulate a RWSS sector strategy, as well as support
to decentralized RWSS units at governorate levels.

Key Outputs:

Project Management: Two levels of project management were established: PMU (central – overall Project
Management Unit) and governorate based PIU’s (Project Implementation Units). The PMU and each PIU
were staffed with management, technical/procurement, financial and administrative personnel, albeit suffering
at times from high turn-over and slow replacement recruiting. Specialists, including social mobilization and
hygiene awareness – education officers were appointed in the PIU’s. A short-term sanitation infrastructure
engineer was appointed at the PMU to assist in developing the environmental component. Interrupted efforts
were made to assign a dedicated M & E officer at the PMU, however limited success was achieved in
developing a comprehensive M & E system.

Overall management at the PMU was seen to be adequate to acceptable. Generally the PMU was successful in
addressing requisite issues to keep the project moving forward while providing reasonably good support and
backstopping to the PIU’s. They responded adequately to recommended project changes made by the Bank
supervision teams, though often not as expeditiously as expected. A total of 21 staff were employed at the
PMU, including three Project Director appointments. At the PIU level various field director changes were
made during the project; including early replacements in both Hajja and Abyan along with numerous technical
and support personnel. An estimated 106 project management and support personnel were employed during the
10 year duration of the RWSSP. Generally, project management at both the PMU and PIU level was
satisfactory.

Monitoring and Evaluation: Despite many halting attempts at formulating and implementing a methodical
(and collaborative sub-sector wide) M & E system, Project efforts never progressed much beyond a limited
output of basic monitoring information: physical progress, financial implementation, procurement,
environment, key performance, etc., consolidated into their quarterly reporting format summary of Project
inputs, activities and outputs. While data was collected, there is no evidence it was ever systematically
evaluated. The Projects M&E was used almost exclusively to respond to Bank and Borrower supervision
demands and needs for Project monitoring data rather than for more in depth evaluation that could have guided
lessons learned and refinements to Project implementation.

Institutional Strengthening: The expected output of assisting government in building and strengthening RWSS
capacity was significantly achieved. The Project successfully developed adequate to good management and
implementation competence, and executed the project according to a systematic application of community self-
selection, participatory, technical and social compliance criteria and methods. Which, complemented by fair
evidence, is highlighted in a sense of beneficiaries ownership and unfolding systems sustainability.

                                                      26
The expected output of a systematic transfer of successfully tested Project approaches, integration of lessons,
capabilities and the impacts learned and achieved through RWSSP approach have not been fully assimilated
nor institutionalized by the national RWSS program under the guidance of GARWSP, though identifiable
progress in now being made.

Training: This sub-component included a lengthy list of training activities in support of PMU, PIU, GARWSP
personnel as well as beneficiary community capacity building and development. PMU capacity building
training courses were conducted locally as well as internationally, highlighting Bank/IDA Financial
Management and Procurement procedures. No less than eight additional external training programs benefiting
over 70 project personnel were carried out between Egypt, Italy and the Netherlands including: project
management techniques, communications, accounts and auditing, hygiene–environmental awareness and
formation/managing associations. These training courses incorporated both male and female project personnel.

Fifteen capacity building and technical assistance interventions, including both GARWSP headquarter and
governorate level personnel were sponsored by the RWSSP involving various levels of training in: investment
plans and monitoring, procurement procedures capacity building, SMT development, environmental impact
assessment and public relations. The total number of GARWSP participants in these training courses was not
recorded.

Particular training emphasis was given to building capacity at the PIU level for management, accounting,
social mobilization teams, health hygiene awareness trainers, sanitation promotion, and further PIU level
training in financial management and procurement systems standards. Some of these workshops included
GARWSP Branch Office personnel and Local or District Council members.

WUA Development: Throughout the six intervention governorates, 2,179 no. WUA members participated in
organizational training: management, accounting and operations and maintenance. 248 Water User
Associations (WUA) were established during the project comprising in total 21,000 members. As a registered
non-governmental organization (NGO), national law requires a minimum of 30 members in each WUA to be
legally recognized.

The RWSSP invested considerable resources in establishing and building up the technical and financial
management and planning capabilities of the WUA’s. Satisfaction survey findings suggest the Project’s
strategy for developing community capacity and meaningful involvement in planning and managing their own
water and sanitation systems is effective. The strategy has resulted in relatively high levels of beneficiary
satisfaction and has increased the likelihood that the communities will sustain the systems over their design
lives.

An interesting side note is the Project claim that 2,904 income generating jobs have been generated through the
WUAs in the areas of supervision, administration, accounting, O & M and meter reading.

WUA confidence: A three part agreement/contract, signed between the community / WUA, the Project and
the relevant District / Local Council for each approved and implemented scheme, underlined compliance with
Project participation criteria. Significantly, the formalized agreement process elevates the community’s sense
of ownership viewed as an encouraging signal of the prospect of schemes sustainability. Post Project survey
evidence indicates between 85% to 90% of the WUA were adequately functioning, regularly collecting user
fees, meeting O & M requirements and in some cases expanding service to new system users.

Health –Hygiene and Environmental Awareness: Hygiene promotion campaigning resulted in the formation of
169 no. local community based Awareness Committees, incorporating a total of 1,066 promotion interlocutors.
Forty three percent of the hygiene promoters are women.

Consultancy: An independent RWSS consumer satisfaction survey commissioned by the Project and carried
out by Darwish Water and Environment Consulting Services was completed in August 2008 as an effort to
comparatively evaluate the performance of various implementation mechanisms: RWSSP, GARWSP, Public
Works Project, UNICEF and the Social Fund. The survey assessed 176 functioning schemes in Ibb, Hajja and

                                                      27
Abyan Governorates. Final findings were never formally presented nor issued for public review as the survey
was ultimately seen as poorly prepared with obvious conflicting and erroneous analysis and information.

Technical Assistance: The RWSSP was initially designed and provisionally approved to have a parallel
component of external Technical Assistance (RWSS-TA) for a minimum period of two years. Financing was
provided by a grant from the Dutch Government and channeled through the WB –Water and Sanitation
Program (WSP) in support of an agenda to include: i) formulate the Yemen national RWSS Policy/ Strategy,
ii) provide RWSS input in the advancement of a long term water sector investment plan; iii) generally assist in
RWSS sector reform; and iv) provide launching and backstopping to the RWSSP. It was further inferred the
RWSS-TA should have a strong support presence with the newly (re) formed GARWSP.

During the two year course of the Dutch co-financed RWSS Technical Assistance program the following
outputs were recorded:
    i.  RWSS Policy/Strategy Paper; prepared/submitted, though not legislatively ratified;
   ii.  GARWSP institutional and resource capacity development, i.e. program for the decentralization and
        development of autonomous branch offices;
 iii.   Project cycle implementation, incorporating community driven development (CDD – DRA)
        components;
  iv.   Development of a GARWSP monitoring, evaluation and data management plan;
   v.   Formulation of an RWSS database program;
  vi.   RWSS Sub-Sector Finance and Resource Flows Assessment Study.
Ultimately the RWSS TA appears to have been less than a fully effective mechanism for either supporting the
RWSSP or bringing GARWSP into alignment with the Project approach. The RWSS TA ended in Oct. 2005.

Long-term (10-15 years) National RWSS Investment Program, to be supported Bank/IDA and Other Donors:
With the support of many collaborators including the RWSSP, albeit seemingly more by example than overtly
proactive participation, the expected output of a national RWSS investment program ready for implementation
was met. The NWSSIP I, prepared and presented in late yr. 2004, proposed an ambitious agenda of rapid
expansion of rural RWSS services targeting "half the MDGs" (5 million inhabitants by 2015) along with
considered financing requirements. The updated NWSSIP (II) 2008-2009, claimed during the investment
period that adequate water supply service increased from approximately 25% to 44% rural coverage, though
rural sanitation only a pitiable increase from 20% to 21%. Though financing allocated by government and
donors averaged only 58% of the NWSSIP targets there is unfolding evidence that sub-sector wide compliance
with the precepts of NWSSIP 1 and II are underway.

                       ANNEX 3: Financial and Economic Analysis
1. Financial Analysis

There is little information about the actual cost of operation and maintenance of the systems. Due to the
security situation in the country during the preparation of the ICR, additional information on cost recovery was
collected during short field visits in March 2011 in Hajjah and Ibb Governorates. In each of the governorates,
5 water supply schemes were visited, and meetings with beneficiaries and staff of the Water User Associations
were conducted.

The data show that all water user associations charged for water – mostly on a volumetric basis. Tariffs ranged
from YR70-400 (equivalent to about US $0.35 – 2) per cubic meter with a fixed monthly fee of YR50 to 100
in four WUAs; with tariffs higher in Hajjah Governorates. All the water supply schemes provided data on
monthly income and expenditure that show that the WUAs cover the basic operation and maintenance costs,
while generating a small surplus that in the future could cover for the partial replacement of assets (see Table
1). Yet, it is not clear in how far these levels of operation and maintenance cost recovery are present in the
other 240 plus schemes the project constructed.

Table 2 shows that the price of water per cubic meter varies from US$0.37 - $2 per cubic meter. These are
steep prices for rural water supply compared to global benchmarks but are likely to be a good reflection of the
water scarcity in the country and the high level of service provided (piped water schemes). The high prices are
confirmed by earlier household surveys undertaken in 2008, and below the opportunity cost of water
(especially vendor water). Consumers show to be rather responsive to price as those that are faced with the
highest prices tend to have the lowest per capita consumption levels.

The operation and maintenance costs are significant, and ranging from US$0.19 – 1.60 per cubic meter, which
is probably largely due to the lack of economies of scale as most systems provide only water up to 20 lcd.

2. Economic Analysis

Cost Effectiveness. The lower the cost of the schemes, the more people can gain access to improved rural
water supplies with a given investment The project gave priority to: (i) villages or village clusters that did not
exceed 10,000; (ii) with sufficient quantity and quality of water; and (iii) investment costs that were within per
capita ceilings ($85 for new systems or for systems with a previously accepted borehole or well; or $60 for
rehabilitation – all in 1999 prices). The average per capita investment cost under the Loan (2001-2007) was
$60, whereas it increased to $89 between 2008 and 2010 when the Additional Financing was implemented.
The increase in per capita costs is likely linked to the fact that more new (instead of rehabilitated schemes)
were included in the investment program during the additional financing phase, and due to rising fuel prices
the costs of many materials and equipment increased. The project team has used its resources effectively,
because:

       At appraisal it was assumed that the water source for most schemes would be boreholes (about 55 – 60
        percent), with open wells with hand pumps would making up 5 percent of schemes, and the remainder
        of sub-projects being rehabilitation of existing schemes. In actuality, 55 percent of schemes were
        using boreholes , 10 percent spring protection and 35 percent shallow wells;
       At appraisal in 2000, the average per capita cost was about $51. The increase in per capita investment
        costs to $70 in view of local inflation and currency depreciation suggests that in real prices the per
        capita investment costs were actually declining;
       Most of the investment cost increase occurred during the latter years of the Project (when additional
        financing was provided to the original credit). This may indicate that the project initially focused on
        relatively simple sub-projects before proceeding to villages where the cost of supply is higher.

Cost-Benefit Analysis

Benefits. The project aimed to improve water and sanitation services to rural communities in 3 governorates
in the first phase of the project and to another seven governorates thereafter, serving a total of 400,000 people.
The project’s geographic scope with revised at the Mid-term Review to six governorates. At the completion of
the project, it had served nearly 619,000 people in six governorates, of which 419,000 were served from the
credit financing (as described in the Project Appraisal Document) and 199,631 from the additional grant
financing.
The starting point for estimating the benefits is the survey 4 undertaken in 2008 to evaluate consumer
satisfaction with the services provided in the first phase governorates of Ibb, Hajjah and Abyan. The survey
interviewed 5,035 respondents in the three governorates using different donor schemes (including the one

  This survey provides some details for the performance of the different donor strategies, but unfortunately it does not
provide this analysis on a consistent basis. Hence we have used the average data although that may not necessarily reflect
all the details of the Bank-financed RWSSP.


                                                                             30
funded by the World Bank). The survey asked respondents about their prior water arrangements and the new
arrangements. The data from this survey and the one that was carried at appraisal in the project area differs
mainly with regard to the time spent on saving water, which is significantly higher at 4 hours per day during
appraisal in 2000 and 2.1 hours during follow-up survey in 2008.

Two types of benefits were estimated: (i) the cost savings associated with a decrease in the use of traditional
sources (i.e, the use of vended water, or the costs associated with hauling water from a source); and (ii) an
increase in the consumer surplus linked to the increase in consumption because of water being more readily
available.

Cost savings come from a reduced or eliminated need to buy water from vendors or to haul water from a
relatively distant source. The cost savings from those households that depended on vended water were
estimated as the difference in consumption in the “with” and “without” project situation. Households that
were served by the project used on average 11.68 cubic meters per month compared to 7.61 cubic meter per
month when they used their traditional source. Based on the survey results, the average monthly household
costs of vendor water was YR 3,031 and translates into a cubic meter price of $ 1.66 and a per capita
consumption 25 liters per capita per day. In the “with” project situation, per capita consumption increased to
38 liters per capita per day, and the monthly household cost of piped water is YR 1,393 (equivalent to $0.60
per cubic meter).

The monthly water savings from vendor water are equal to consumption “without project” times vendor water
price (cum) times 70 percent. It is assumed – similar to the Appraisal Report – that 30 percent of the price of
water paid to vendors is economic rent, and hence the correction factor. As such, the monthly cost savings
compared to the “with” project situation are $3.91 per household served by vendor water before switching to
the piped water provided by the Bank project (compared to $4.70 in the Staff Appraisal Report).

The monthly cost savings for not having to haul water were estimated as the opportunity cost of time spent on
water hauling which is equal to 30 percent of the average monthly household income of $214 (equivalent to a
monthly income of $21 per capita). This refers to an implicit monthly payment in the without project situation
of $16.91 compared to $6.97 in the “with” project situation, resulting in a cost savings of $9.93 per household
per month.

About 30 percent of the respondents were using vendor water before switching to the project built systems, and
the remaining respondents used to haul water. The average monthly cost savings are about $8.12 per
household per month.

Added to the consumer savings was the consumer surplus. After calculating the consumer surplus it was
reduced by 30 percent to allow for the uncertainty given the form of the demand curve. As a result, the
consumer surplus used in the analysis amounted to $2.24 per household per month.

Costs. The cost data are from the Bank project database. We have no detailed information about the operation
and maintenance costs and have used the same data from the Project Appraisal Document with O&M costs
ranging from 3 percent for hand pumps to 8 percent for boreholes. We adjusted the O&M cost to reflect the
type of schemes that were implemented, and hence as boreholes made up a large part of the total investment
schemes, the average O&M cost was about 5.7 percent of investment costs.
Results. Financial flows were estimated for the “with” and “without” project scenarios. Due to the high levels
of inflation, and little information on benefits before 2008 (as the survey was implemented in that year), we did
not adjust the nominal prices into real prices. We used a 10 percent discount rate and assume the investments
have a 25 year lifespan.

We find that using these data, the project has generated a Net Present Value of $10 million, and has an internal
rate of return of 23 percent despite the delays in the startup of the project. It should also be noted that the
project’s connection rate in the villages turned out higher than expected – 84 percent at ICR versus 70 percent
at Appraisal. The increase in income in the past decade in rural Yemen, and the increasing scarcity of water is
likely an important part of the explanation for this higher than forecasted connection rate.

                                                    PART I
                                            HAJJAH GOVERNORATE

1. General Information

The survey was carried out during the period March 13-16, 2011. Meetings were held with the RWSSP-PIU
Social Coordinator, representatives of District Local Authorities in Al Shaghadera, Bani Qais, and Hayran and
beneficiaries from 6 Water User Associations (WUA). A Meeting could not be held with the head of
GARWSP Hajjah Branch.

Five water supply schemes and one sanitation scheme were visited. Meetings were held with 6 beneficiaries
from 5 villages of Qala’at Hamid Al Garbi Water Supply Scheme (WSS), 5 beneficiaries from 1 village of
Qala’at Hamid Al Sharki WSS , 5 beneficiaries from Al Daher village, 6 beneficiaries from Al Franeta WSS ,
5 beneficiaries from Bani Husain WSS, and 5 beneficiaries from Al Dhafeir Water Supply and sanitation
Scheme. In addition to those meetings with beneficiaries, meetings were held with heads/ members of
mentioned WUAs.

In total, 32 beneficiaries representing 32 households living with 68 families were interviewed for the survey.
The small size of the sample, (15 % of the schemes implemented by RWSSP in Hajjah Governorate, and 1.8%
of the households in the selected WUAs) makes the extrapolation of the findings questionable. However, the
findings illustrate some of the major achievements and issues faced by the Project in Hajjah Governorate.

2. Before-Project Situation in the WUAs visited by the Survey

(a) Source of water before Project

As shown in the table below, for poor people the main source of water supply was open wells in wadi beds
where water had to be fetched at high social cost by girls and boys. In one WUA, families who could afford
the price (YR4,000/m3) bought their water from vendors. During discussions with the PIU at the time of social
mobilization, the villages expected that the schemes would significantly reduce the financial and social costs of
obtaining water. With the exception of Qala’at Hamid Al Gharbi, no information is available on the cost of
water before the Project in the sub-projects surveyed.

(b) Sanitary situation

According to WUAs visited, the sanitary situation before the Project was mediocre. There were no public
sewage systems in the villages covered by the WUAs and they consider that only 5 to 25% of the households
had access to adequate sanitation. The situation for each WUA was as follows:

       Qala’at Hamid Al Gharbi:           5%
       Qala’at Hamid Al Sharqi:           5%
       Al Daher                           5%
       Al Franeta                         10%
       Bani Husain                        25%
       Al Dhafeir                         17%

3. RWSSP Intervention in the WUAs surveyed.
(a) Mobilization Phase

Sources of information about the Project. Although the sources of information about the Project were diverse
(PIU, Governorate, SFD, other districts, Local Councils), they all provided clear information about the
eligibility criteria for project intervention (availability of safe water free of conflict, poverty area, formation of
a WUA, 5% financial contribution, and household sanitation as a condition for house connection). Details are
available in Appendix 1.

Eligibility requirements. The requirement of 5% contribution to investment costs was met with difficulty in
most schemes and the Project had to accept in-kind contributions (pumping house, plastic pipes and
excavation) and contributions from Local Councils to meet the requirement in some cases. Cash contributions
were deposited in the Project account.

The requirement on house sanitation as a condition for house connection was not always enforced and was
waived in Qala’at Hamid Al Gharbi and Qala’at Hamid Al sharqi (West and East Qala’at Hamid) because of
very poor condition of the area.

The requirement about the availability of adequate water source was easily met in the two WUAs where
boreholes drilled by GARWSP were already available and works could start as soon as other requirements
were met. In two WUAs, the deepening or implementation of new open wells financed by the community with
or without private support, resulted in delays in complying with RWSSP requirements (2 and 4 years).
Therefore, RWSSP short project cycle rightly celebrated by Local Councils and beneficiaries can be more
easily achieved where GARWSP (blamed for its long project cycle) has already taken care of the most difficult
component of a water supply scheme, the source of water.

(b) RWSSP scheme components

The table below shows the components financed by RWSSP in the WUAs visited. Water supply scheme
contracts included all required components (pumps, electric generator, tanks, networks, pump house) with the
exception of the water source and, until 2006, house connections. Although house connections and water
meters were included in principle after 2006, they were not implemented in schemes where their inclusion
would have pushed the average per capita cost above the maximum agreed unit cost.

The sample includes one sewage system for Al Dhafeir, a community already served by a GARWSP water
supply scheme. This is the only standalone sewage system financed by RWSSP in Hajjah governorate. All
other sanitation activities (mainly mosque latrines) were packaged with water supply schemes.

 (a Connections to the sanitation system
 (b HH connected to the water supply system (GARWSP)

The table above shows the status of household connections in the WUAs visited. The population mentioned in
RWSSP reports is the population at time of implementation. The WUAs often mentioned different figures that
may be closer to the current population. In addition the RWSSP did not keep track of the number of
households and families expected to be served by the schemes. Although WUA were initially given a choice
over the type of water delivery (public standpoint or house connection), beneficiaries quickly opted for house
metered connection (with the exception of Al Franeta). While the implementation and financing of house
connection were initially left to the beneficiaries they were included after 2006, at the request of the WUAs, to
ensure full service delivery. Therefore the percentage of household actually connected to the network appears
as a prerequisite for service delivery.

For the WUA visited the coverage rate is between 50 and 100 % with an average of 85%. All beneficiaries
met are connected to the networks.

(b) Sanitation situation

Although the Project did not in most cases directly finance household sanitation and focused mainly on public
infrastructure, the WUA representatives noted a moderate positive impact of RWSSP on the sanitary situation
in most WUA as shown in the table below. This may be the result of hygiene promotion education efforts and
the household sanitation requirements for water supply house connections.

c) WUA Cost recovery

All WUAs visited charge for water on the basis of volume metered. Water Tariffs for RWSSP schemes range
from YR150 to YR400 per cubic meter, with a fixed monthly fee of YR50 to YR100 added by two WUAs.
However, in Al Dhafeir the Local Council manages a water and sanitation sub-project that was implemented
by RWSSP. There is a fixed fee for the first 5 m3 of water of YR2,688 calculated on the basis of YR 300/m3 of
water plus YR 210 for sanitation. This is a block fee, charged whether all the water is used or not. Above
5m3/month the tariff is YR 400/ m3 plus 70 % of this amount for sanitation (400 x 70 % = 280).

The beneficiaries visited estimate their monthly water budget between 1% and 34% of their monthly income.
Except for Al Dhafeir (LCWSS) scheme where they complain about sanitation tariffs, there is no complaint
about water tariffs which are favorable compared to the price charged by the water vendors and the social cost
of water fetching by girls and boys.

d) Pro-poor policy

In most WUAs poor households are exempted from water charges (up to 5 m3 per month for one WUA and no
information on quantity for others). One WUA has decided that there are too many poor beneficiaries to have
a pro-poor policy. In another WUA, poor people are receiving financial support from the Social Welfare Fund.
Most WUAs tolerate a grace period of 1 to 6 months before service is cut off.


                                                                39
5. Beneficiary Satisfaction

(a) Profile of the Beneficiaries met
Ninety seven percent of the beneficiaries met in the survey own their house and 72 percent live in a
cement/block or stone house. They are all connected to the scheme network. Therefore they do not seem to
represent the poorest segment of the population.

The 32 beneficiaries met represent 32 households including one or several families sharing a single house
connection and meter (68 families in total).

The range of the beneficiary family size varies between 2 and 22 persons. Details for each scheme are
Appendix 2. The average family size is 6.5 people.

(b) Satisfaction with water supply service
In two schemes supplied by open wells, water is distributed on a weekly basis for 1 to 6 hours/day. In schemes
supplied by boreholes and one scheme supplied from an open well, water is available on a daily basis for 1 to
24h a day.

There seems to be a link between the satisfaction of the beneficiaries met and the type of source of water. In
the two WUAs using borehole (implemented by GARWSP) 100% of the beneficiary met are very satisfied
with the quantity of water although they complain about the quality (bad taste and salty water). In the WUAs
using open wells the situation seems to be reversed, with high satisfaction with the quality of water and
complain about shortage of water in winter, when beneficiary have to complement their water supply from
other sources such as water vendors (44% of beneficiaries), springs and wadis (33%) farm wells (31%) and
mosques (3%) (See Appendix 4).

(c) Satisfaction with sanitation interventions

With the exception of one WUA where all beneficiaries met are very satisfied with their sanitation system,
there are mixed feelings about the satisfaction with sanitation situation. The main complain is the lack of
connection to a public system. The Project had specific sanitation component in two WUAs with two different
systems, cesspits in Bani Husain and septic tank in Al Dhafeir. In both cases 40% to 60% of the beneficiaries
complain about the quality of service. They consider the system not convenient and to be a source of diseases.
Concerning hygiene promotion/education, many beneficiaries are not aware of the activity. With the exception
of Qala’at Hamid Al Gharbi where only 17% of the beneficiaries are satisfied, the percentage of beneficiaries
who acknowledged receiving and making use of hygiene is between 40 and 80%. Beneficiaries satisfied with
the hygiene promotion/education say they are applying the recommendations. Details are provided in the table
below.

(d) Beneficiary satisfaction with WUAs

With the exception of Qala’at Hamid Al Gharbi, beneficiaries are satisfied with the services of their WUA. In
four schemes, all beneficiaries agreed that WUA metering is accurate, they receive the bill on time, the
network is properly maintained and WUA provides enough information on its services. The majority of them
consider that complaints are handled in time. Details are available in the table below.

(e) Beneficiaries’ assessment of project impact

All beneficiaries were expecting the following benefits from the improvement of water supply conditions, and
they confirmed that the benefits have been achieved by the Project:

•       Making water service more regular
•       Providing safe and clean water
•       Reducing water-borne diseases
•       Saving time for girls/boys so that they can go to school
•       Saving money
•       Facilitating women's' household chores

            o   Protection of the environment

Although they consider that water schemes have a positive impact on the health situation in the communities,
the beneficiaries confirmed the presence of several diseases in their households. The presence of diarrhea was
confirmed by 50 to 100 % of the beneficiaries in 5 WUAs, the presence of malaria was confirmed by 60 to
100 % of beneficiaries in 5 UWAs, of typhoid by 20 to 100% of beneficiaries in 5 villages, of eye infection by
40 to 50% of beneficiaries in 2 villages. Less than 20 % of the beneficiaries in five WUA declared that there
were no diseases in their households. One WUA declares the presence of 5 diseases, 2 WUAs the presence of
4 diseases, 2 villages the presence of 3 diseases and one village the presence of one (typhoid).

(f) WUAs satisfaction with RWSSP

The WUAs visited in Hajjah governorate have a very positive appreciation of the methodology used by
RWSSP.

They credit the short project cycle to the packaging of the scheme components into a single contract. They
support the Demand Responsive Approach systematically used by the Project and they are happy to see this
approach endorsed by the GARWSP Branch. Although some communities had problems with the creation of
the WUA and poor communities faced difficulties in complying with the eligibility criteria, especially the 5 %
contribution in investment cost and house sanitation, they consider that the Project contributed to the
improvement of the sanitation situation.

The establishment of registered WUAs and the training of their staff is seen as prerequisite for the
sustainability of the scheme. All WUAs visited received technical, financial management and general
management training. However, 5 of the six WUAs met are not satisfied with the training received. They all
require additional training on all aspects with emphasis on O&M.

All WUAs rated the overall support of RWSSP-Hajjah PIU as very good.

WUAs praise the Project for actually completing water schemes in a shorter period than GARWSP. However,
a shorter implementation of civil works has not always resulted in a short overall project cycle (from social
mobilization to handing over the WUA). WUAs which did not benefit from the existence of GARWSP
boreholes, securing the land and the financing for the open wells took from 2 to 4 years for 3 WUA. The

                                                       43
completion of one scheme took 1.5 year because of problems with the contractor. One water supply scheme
was completed in one year and the sanitation scheme in 1.5 year which was considered very fast compared to
other projects. (Details in Appendix 3).

(g) Local Council assessments of RWSSP

Meetings were held with representatives of three District Local Councils: Al Shaghadera (District director and
Secretary General), Bani Qais District (Secretary General) and Hayran District director.

The three Local Council praise and support RWSSP’s approach. They see the establishment and training of
WUAs as a major step for sustainability. They assist the WUAs in the following ways:
    -   collecting water fees (metered and not metered)
    -   solving problems with beneficiaries
    -   supervising the role of the WUAs,
    -   helping Qala’t Hamid Al Sharqi in collection beneficiary’s contribution to house connections
    -   Following up with the Public Works Project to implement water barrier in wadi Kaeif to protect open
        wells for Qala’at Hamid Al Gharbi and Qala’at Hamid Al Sharqi,
    -   Advising beneficiaries on water management issues (reduction of groundwater abstraction (Hayran)
    -   Quarterly and annual financial audits of the WUAs (Hayran).
    -   Getting involved in the handing over of schemes to the WUAs (proposal from Al Shaghadera District)

Regarding the relations between RWSSP and GARWSP, there is a consensus that RWSSP approach (DRA and
packaging of schemes component into a single contract) is faster and more efficient than GARWSP’s. The
director of Hayran district considers that the requirement for adequate household sanitation before household
are connected to the network is a good incentive for improving sanitary conditions. He thinks that GARWSP
could have the same impact if they were connecting households to the scheme network. The Secretary General
of Bani Qais considers that although GARWSP is adopting RWSSP’s approach in the establishment of WUAs,
the WUAs will be able to function only if GARWSP can complete the schemes. He also wishes RWSSP could
help GARWSP in completing three schemes in the district.

                                                 IBB GOVERNORATE

1. General Information

The survey was carried out during the period March 5-8, 2011. Meetings were held with the head of
GARWSP Ibb Branch, the director of Al Sayany District Local Authority, the heads or representatives of 5
Water User Associations (WUAs) and 25 beneficiaries from 25 households5 in the 5 WUAs.

Five water supply schemes and one sanitation scheme were visited. Meetings were held, in each WUA, with 5
beneficiaries from Rayman, Al Qeta’a, Qehza, Saeir and Markiz Al Sayani WUAs.

In total, 25 beneficiaries representing 25 households and 44 families were interviewed for the survey. The
small size of the sample, (7% of the schemes implemented by RWSSP in Ibb Governorate, and 0.7% of the
households in the selected WUAs) makes the extrapolation of the findings questionable. However, the
findings illustrate some of the major achievements and issues faced by the Project in Ibb Governorate.

2. Before-Project Situation in the WUAs visited by the Survey

(a)      Source of Water before Project

As shown by the table below, for most WUAs the main sources of water supply were springs, wadis and water
harvesting and the water had to be fetched at high social cost by girls and boys. In Markiz Al Sayani the saline
water from an old GARWSP scheme was hardly usable. During the discussions with PIU at the time of social
mobilization, the villages considered that the schemes would reduce significantly water financial and social
costs. No information is available on the cost of water before the Project.

                                                                    Sources of water                Comments

(b)       Sanitary situation

The WUAs visited, consider that 5 to 100% of the households had access to adequate sanitation
before the Project. The situation for each WUA was as follows:

          Rayman                       100 %
          Al Qeta’a                    30%
          Qehza                        5%
          Saier                        70%
          Markiz Al Sayani             100 (without connection to a treatment system)

3. RWSSP Interventions in the WUAs surveyed
(a) Mobilization Phase

Sources of Information about the Project. The RWSSP PIU and Local Authorities were the main sources of
information about Project interventions and eligibility requirements. One WUA learned about the Project from
the Governorate and another from a local contractor.

WUAs were registered with the Ministry of Social affairs for all schemes; however, one of the five is not
functioning and was replaced by a Project Management Committee. Beneficiaries were well informed about
all eligibility requirements (availability of safe water free of conflict, poverty area, formation of a WUA, 5%
financial contribution, house sanitation as a condition for house connection).

Eligibility requirements. The requirement of 5% contribution to investment cost was met with difficulty in
most schemes. However the contribution was in cash only and was deposited in the Project account. In Qezah,
part of the contribution was covered by the local Sheik who is also the head of the WUA.

The requirement on house sanitation as a condition for house connection is seen as the number two difficulty
for complying with eligibility criteria. However the enforcement of this requirement is seen to have
contributed indirectly to improving sanitary conditions in the WUAs.

The requirement about the availability of adequate water source was easily met in the four WUAs where
boreholes (3 of them drilled by GARWSP) were already available and works could start as soon as other
requirements were met. In the fifth WUA, the community was able to implement a new open well. Therefore,
RWSSP short project cycle rightly celebrated by Local Councils and beneficiaries could be easily achieved in
part because of GARWSP had already taken care of the most difficult component of a water supply scheme,
the source of water.

Water supply schemes contracts included all required components (pumps, electric generator, tanks, networks 6,
pump house) with the exception of the water source and, until 2006, house connections. Although house
connections and metering were included in principle after 2006, they were not implemented in schemes where
the inclusion would have pushed the average per capita cost above the maximum agreed unit cost.
One of the WUA includes a public sewage system. In other WUAs the project financed mostly school latrines
and hygiene promotion/education.

The table above shows the status of household connections in the WUAs visited. The average connection rate
in the WUAs visited is high and varies between 89 to 100% with an average of 95%. The population
mentioned in RWSSP reports is the population at time of implementation. The WUAs often mentioned
different figures that may be closer to the current population. In addition the RWSSP did not keep track of the
number of households and families expected to be served by the schemes. Although WUAs were initially
given a choice over the type of water delivery (public standpoint or house connection), beneficiaries quickly
opted for house metered connection. While the implementation and financing of house connections was
initially left to the beneficiaries they were included after 2006, at the request of the WUAs, to ensure full
service delivery. Therefore the percentage of household actually connected to the network appears as a
prerequisite for service delivery. All beneficiaries met are connected to the networks.

Although the Project did not directly financed household sanitation and focused mainly on public
infrastructure, the WUA representatives noted a positive impact of RWSSP on the sanitary situation in most
WUA as shown in the table above. This may be the result of hygiene promotion education efforts and the
household sanitation requirements for water supply house connections.

(c) Cost recovery by WUAs

All WUAs visited charge water on the basis of volume metered. Most WUAs have a progressive tariff with a
0 to 5m3/month first tranche for which the tariff is between YR70 to 250. In addition, a fixed monthly fee of
YR 50 to 100 is added by two WUAs. Water fees are collected on a monthly basis. There is usually a 2 month

                                                                     50
grace period before service is cut off. WUAs’ average monthly income from water fees is between 10% and
87 % higher than average monthly expenditure. WUAs are confident about their financial sustainability and
their capacity to cover not only O&M but also heavy repairs and spare parts.

The beneficiaries visited estimate their monthly water budget between 1% and 7% of their monthly income.
There are no complaints about water tariffs which are favorable compared to the price charged by the water
vendors and the social cost of water fetching by girls and boys.

(d) Pro-poor policy.

In 2 WUAs, between 8 to 15 poor households are exempted from water charges without specification on the
quantity concerned. In two other WUAs poor people are exempted from the cost of house connections and
meters. Details are available in Appendix 2.

5. Beneficiary Satisfaction

(a) Profile of the beneficiaries met

Eighty four percent of the beneficiaries met in the survey own their house, 92% percent live in a stone house
and 8% in a cement block house. They are all connected to the scheme network. Therefore they do not seem
to represent the poorest segment of the population.
The 25 beneficiaries met represent 25 households including one or several families sharing a single house
connection and meter (44 families in total).

Family size varies between 5 and 15 persons. Although they are all connected to the network and 80%
consume between 1 and 10 m3 /month, beneficiaries depend on water vendors and springs as a secondary
source of water. (Appendix 2).

(b) Satisfaction with water supply services

In 4 WUAs, 100% of the beneficiaries met are very satisfied with the quantity of water from the scheme.
However 100 % of beneficiaries met in 4 WUAs and 20 % in the fifth declare to have springs, wadi and water
harvesting as a second source of water supply, in two WUAs beneficiaries use water vendors in addition
(Appendix 4). For 3 WUAs the high level of satisfaction could be explained by the source of water: boreholes
implemented by GARWSP. Although borehole are less subject to seasonal fluctuation on the short term,
WUAs are planning for the long term in planning for additional boreholes in Rayman, and building a kariff in
Al Qeta’a to recharge the aquifer of their open well.

The satisfaction with water quality is high. In four WUAs 80% of the beneficiaries met are satisfied with the
quantity of the water. In 3 WUA 100% of beneficiaries are very satisfied with the quality of water supplied by
the scheme. In 2 WUAs 40 % to 60% of the beneficiaries complain about salty water and or deposits. For
Markiz Al Sayani there seems to be an issue with the quality of the aquifer. Another old GARWSP borehole is
now used only for irrigation because of the salinity of the water.

(d) Beneficiary satisfaction with WUA

As shown in the table below, in most WUAS, the beneficiaries met are very satisfied with the services of the
WUAs. However, 100% of the beneficiaries met in Markiz Al Sayani are very dissatisfied with their WUA
which has been replaced for the management of the scheme by a Project Management Committee. However all
beneficiaries agree that water bills are sent on time, water meters reading are accurate , and with the exception
of beneficiaries from Markia Al Sayani, that the water network is properly maintained and the WUA provides
sufficient information on its services.

(e) Beneficiaries’ assessment of Project impact

All beneficiaries were expecting the following benefits from the improvement of water supply conditions, and
they confirmed that the benefits have been achieved by the Project.

•          Making water service more regular
•          Providing safe and clean water
•          Reducing water-borne diseases
•          Saving time for girls/boys so that they can go to school
•          Saving money
•          Facilitating women's' household chores

They declare that the water from the scheme is used solely for domestic purpose and there is no diversion 7 of
water for construction or irrigation

All beneficiaries met would prefer flash toilets if the sewerage system could improve, and they confirmed that
women, men, old people, and children would benefit from the improvement of the sewerage system. All of
them expect the following benefits for their households, if the sewerage system could improve.

                o   Improved hygienic conditions
                o   Reducing water-borne diseases
                o   Protection of building
                o   Protection of the environment

The beneficiaries consider that water schemes have a positive impact on the health situation in the
communities. Although in two WUAs 100% of beneficiaries are not declaring any diseases, in 3 other WUAs
beneficiaries confirmed the presence of several diseases in their households. The presence of diarrhea was
confirmed by 20 to 80 % of the beneficiaries in 3 WUAs, the presence of skin diseases by 20 of beneficiaries
in 1 WUAs, of typhoid by 20% of beneficiaries in 1 WUA, of eye infection by 20% of beneficiaries in 1 WUA.
Two WUAs declare the presence of 3 diseases, 1 WUA the presence of 2 diseases, and 2 WUAs are not
declaring any diseases.

6.         Satisfaction of WUAs with RWSSP

The WUAs visited in Ibb governorate rate their working experience with RWSSP has very good and they have
a very positive appreciation of the methodology used by RWSSP.



7
    One WUA has a penalty of YR3,000 to YR10,000 for non-domestic use of water


                                                               53
They credit the short project cycle to the packaging of the scheme components into a single contract. They
support the Demand Responsive Approach systematically used by the Project and they are happy to see this
approach endorsed by the GARWSP Branch. Although some communities had problems with the creation of
the WUA and poor communities faced difficulties in complying with the eligibility criteria, especially the 5 %
contribution in investment cost and house sanitation, they consider that the Project contributed to the
improvement of the sanitation situation.

The establishment of registered WUAs and the training of their staff are seen as prerequisite for the
sustainability of the scheme. All WUAs visited received technical, financial management and general
management training. However, 4 of the 5 WUAs declared that the training received was not adequate. They
all require additional training on all aspects with emphasis on O&M.

WUAs praise the Project for actually completing water schemes in a short period. Because of the availability
of the water resource in 4 schemes (GARWSP boreholes) and the previous implementation of the open well by
the fifth, unlike in Hajjh governorate, the shorter implementation of civil works actually resulted in a short
overall project cycle (from social mobilization to handing over the WUA). The completion of one scheme
took 1.5 year because of problems with the public sanitation component.

The main issues encountered in the operation of the schemes are linked to geography: isolation of the schemes
and bad roads leading to high transportation costs, pipe rupture when tanks are located on the top of mountains
and adequate pressure control systems are not installed. Other problems are specific to the schemes: poor
quality of water meters, additional investment not initially included in the cost of the scheme (house for the
guard, box protection for the meters, old network8)

7. Al Sayani District Local Council’s assessment of RWSSP

A meeting was held with the Director of Al Sayani District Local Council. The Director praises and supports
RWSSP’s approach. The Local Council had to intervene in Markiz Al Sayani to respond to the problems faced
by the WUA. The Local Council took over the management of the scheme for 4 months and established a
Project Management Committee to replace WUA management. They also financed a kareif to protect from
flood water and recharge the aquifer; in addition, they are now building a water reservoir.

Regarding the relations between RWSSP and GARWSP, The Director mentioned that the RWSSP approach
(DRA and packaging of schemes component into a single contract) is faster and more efficient than
GARWSP’s. However he would have preferred that RWSSP handed over the scheme to either the GARWSP
branch or central office, which are able to carry out big repairs while the WUA could be responsible for the
management of the scheme. In any case, RWSSP should have coordinated with the Local Council when they
handed over the schemes to the WUAs.

8. GARWSP Branch’s Assessment of the Project.

A meeting was held with the Director of GARWSP-Ibb Branch.

RWSSP Demand Responsive Approach (DRA) is now adopted by GARWSP-Ibb Branch. At the time of
receiving the demand from the community, they start preparing the social and technical studies, forming
WUAs, train WUA members. WUAs are now generating cost recovery and carrying out adequate O&M to
ensure sustainability.

GARWSP implemented boreholes for most water supply schemes implemented by RWSSP - Ibb PIU. One
water supply scheme has been implemented jointly in which GARWSP implemented borehole and water tank,
while other components were implemented by RWSSP. Regarding the sustainability of water supply
infrastructure implemented by GARWSP, the Director mentioned that they are now forming WUAs and train


8
    In one scheme where the Project used an existing network.


                                                                54
their members. Previously, GARWSP – Ibb branch was not promoting or supporting beneficiaries
communities by sanitary latrines, sewage systems development, hygiene education/training components.
GARWSP has now included the new activities in its 2010 program with the support of the Water Sector
Support Program (WSSP)

As part of institutional strengthening, RWSSP has provided GARWSP – Ibb Branch one computer and a broad
training course for the Director of GARWSP – IBB Branch. Training was provided on improving managerial
and planning skills, using computer’s software, and office administrative process. The lessons learnt from
those trainings are now incorporated in the methodology of the Branch. As part of mechanisms learned from
RWSSP approach, the branch adopted the implementation of technical and social studies, formation of WUAs,
handing over schemes to WUA to be operated and maintained by WUAs.

GARWSP Ibb-Branch is now following the same mechanisms of RWSSP related to community participation
techniques, such as self-selection, DRA, social mobilization, but the two days allocated to are not enough. The
working relationship between the branch and the PIU of RWSSP was excellent. From the perspective of the
Director, the performance of RWSSP was good, and GARWSP Ibb Branch is now aligned with RWSSP
approach.

GARWSP Ibb-Branch Director concluded as follows: (a) Water sector should be supported, (b) GARWSP
should take in consideration the positive aspects of RWSSP (all aspects either technical or financial aspects),
(c) Donors should support GARWSP as the permanent entity responsible for implementing water schemes.

Executive Summary

Shortage of safe drinking water and sanitation in rural areas is one of the most important problems in Yemen.
The Government continues to address this problem in cooperation with interested donors countries and
international organizations. In the late 1990s this cooperation resulted in creation of RWSSP based on law
number (9) for 2001, to supply water and safe sanitation for the rural areas that have been selected based on
specific criteria and indicators according to a strategy based on the principle demand – response,
decentralization and community participation.

This report aims to summarize the most prominent features of RWSSP. In order to achieve this goal, the report
has been divided into three main sections that, taken together, provide a full picture of the project and its
achievements. Project documents, including periodic progress reports, and related documentation were the
references used in preparing this report.

The first section of this report aims to define the project, and it consists of three parts; 1) The emergence of
the project and its objectives (in this part, we presented the project emergence and its main and objectives and
sub-objectives, fields and areas of works, and project manpower), 2) Project Institutional Framework, (project
institutional arrangements have been reviewed as stipulated in the loan document, administrative levels that
make up the project at this time, the components of each administrative level, main tasks, explain the
relationship of the project to local councils at governorate and district levels, and the lines of authority between
those levels in the form of demonstration illustrates the organizational structure of the project, 3) The third and
final part of this section dealt with clarifying the project working methodology that distinguishes the project
from other institutions working in the field of water supply and sanitation in rural and urban areas. In summary,
this mechanism is the demand responsive approach, decentralization and, community participation.
Responding to the request is taking place according to two main conditions; the first one is the compliance
with the eligibility criteria which are; availability of water source of clean water free of conflicts, and the
averages of poverty and education in the region. The second condition is related to the beneficiaries’
obligations to implement a numbers of conditions such as 5 % of the scheme cost as a contribution,
establishment of WUA to manage, operate and maintain the scheme, women participation in all stages of the
scheme. Regarding the decentralization, a PIU in each governorate is expected to supervise the works of SMT,
to ensure that the demand comes from the community, and the schemes type and its technology is selected by
beneficiaries themselves, also, the decision making cycle, specifying region priorities in a specific governorate
are taken place in the PIU of the same governorate with the participation of districts local councils and the
governorate authority.

Participatory rural appraisal is used in the working mechanism in assistance and supervision of team of
specialists in sociology, community health, and water technology, this team called SMT. By this the
community participation achieved (planning and execution).

The second section of the report entitled “Interim Results” is presenting the project progress since its
establishment up to the end of 2010. This section consists of 8 parts, each part presents what was achieved in
each stage of the project implementation stages. The first part – Awareness/Information Activities and demand
stimulate, specialized for talking about awareness/advertisings aimed to stimulate demand as a necessary step
before responding to the request. It explains the importance of stimulating demand, methods and means, and
the responsibility of SMT, and what have been achieved both in awareness or advertisings activities such as
posters, pamphlets, periodicals, documentary films, and short films in order to publicized the project and its
working mechanism and to stimulate communities demands.

Part two of section two of this report entitled “ Demand”, contains the definition of demand and its
mechanism, the total number of demands (applications) in each PIU, and the number of eligible applications,
and their percentage to the total number of applications, and the number of implemented applications and their

percentage to the eligible applications. In general, this part shows that 1,021 applications were submitted to all
PIUs out of which 527 were eligible applications, out of which 242 applications were implemented, which
reflect that the beneficiaries needs for water supply and sanitation schemes were beyond the available financial
means – due to the lack of pure water and the success of schemes implemented by project’s PIUs- and that the
proper conclusion from this result is to support the project to continue providing its services.

Part three of section two entitled “ Social Studies” explain that the project is distinguished from other
authorities involved in providing drinking water in terms of his interest in the implementation of social, health,
economic, and environmental studies before embarking on the implementation of the scheme using the
methodology of rural participatory appraisal, and women participation to ensure the success of implemented
scheme and scheme sustainability on one hand and to enable communities to participate in local development
on the other hand. Also, this part indicates the total number of social studies implemented in each PIU and its
percentage to the total implemented schemes in each scheme, and the number of social studies implemented in
each PIU according to years during the period from 2001 to 2010. This part shows 331 social studies were
implemented, which is exceeding the number of implemented schemes (242 schemes) by 89 studies, which
were not implemented because of lack of funding. Also, this part shows that the SMTs have carried out
number of social studies for the benefit of GARWSP as part of cooperation to achieve the common goal. This
part shows that Ibb PIU ranked first in term of the number of social studies carried out (89 studies) because of
the high number of submitted applications and the high population density. Also, this part shows that the
highest number of social studies carried out in the year 2005 at the whole project level with (90) studies.

 The forth part of section two entitled “Water Users Associations” contains a definition of WUA in terms of
it’s the body of beneficiaries themselves elected by the members of the general assembly whom are the whole
beneficiaries from the scheme, the election takes place under the supervision of SMT to ensure the
implementation of beneficiaries obligations and women participation in the management of the scheme. Also,
to ensure that the election process is going in accordance with approved regulations, election carried out under
the supervision of a representative from the branch office of Ministry of Social Affairs in the governorate, who
granting the association the working license with complete independence from the PIU. This part shows the
tasks/functions of WUA which are summarized in the operation & maintenance, identifying water tariff,
maintain the value of consumed water in a bank account to ensure the provision of maintenance requirements,
replacement, and to achieve sustainability. In addition to that, WUA tasks includes the supervision and follow-
up the efforts of improving sanitation, hygiene awareness among beneficiaries. This part shows that the 242
active Associations have been established with 20,630 Association members, out of which 2,012 are women
members with an average of 9 women for every WUA.

Part five of section two entitled “Training” shows that training is one of the project activities stated in the
project establishment documents to improve capacities of SMTs, project workers and, WUAs and persons
linked to the project. This part shows that part of training carried out in abroad for the staff of PMU, PIUs,
some employees from MOF whom have connection to the project activities, and some employees of GARWSP
and MOWE. Regarding the local training, the project has implemented number of training courses for the
project staff, some of local councils’ members, social personals interested in local development, and some of
SMT belonging to GARWSP. Training topics include; mobilize and stimulate resources to develop local
communities. Also, this part shows the project interests in training the members of WUA to enable them to
acquire basic capabilities in management, accounting, and operating and maintenance. 2,167 members from
267 WUAs (from the 6 targeted governorates) have benefited from these training courses. Also, the project
was involved in training committees of health awareness, health extension, in which 1,066 trainees have
benefited in this field. In addition to training courses, the project issued two manuals; Health
Education/Awareness, and Training Manual for WUAs. Also, the project prepared standard basic regulation
for WUAs.

Part six of section two entitled “Capacity Building Provided to WUAs” shows that the project has built 111
building as headquarters for Associations, provided WUAs with furniture totaling 341 desks, 1,246 chairs, 341
cupboards, 240 pluming equipment bags, and 3 computers with their accessories. In addition to that, 2,431
financing and accounting records and books representing 11 types of financial books, records, and financial
typical documents (221 of each type).


                                                       58
Part seven of section two entitled “Heath and Environmental Awareness” explains the justifications of
health and environmental awareness and its objectives, mechanism of forming awareness committees and their
responsibilities, number of awareness committees according to PIUs, reaching 169 key committees.

The final part of section two entitled “Women Participation” shows the numbers of female and male
members in WUAs in each PIU and percentage of female to male in each PIU too. Female members reached
2,012 female members which represents 9.75 % out of the total members of WUAs.

Section three of this report - entitled “Project Outputs” – aimed to illustrating numbers of implemented
water supply and sanitation schemes, which have been handed over to WUAs and operated by them. This
section has been divided into three parts;

The first part of section three – entitled “Implemented Water Supply Schemes” explained the numbers of
implemented water supply schemes from the proceeds of project loan according to PIUs, number of
beneficiaries from those schemes, schemes costs and per capita cost, same data are explained in regards to
implemented schemes from the proceed of project grant. From these data, it’s clear that the project has
implemented 242 water supply and sanitation schemes, out of which 67 % from the proceed of project loan,
while the rest (23 %) from the proceeds of the project grant (this percentage should be 33 %). Number of
beneficiaries reached 618,715, and the total costs of all implemented schemes reached US$ 42,061,015, and
the average per capita cost reached US$ 70.

The second part of section three – entitled “Sanitation” – illustrates the size of sanitation crisis globally and
locally, what returns sanitation improvement as referred to in the literatures and reports of human development.
This part explaining the sanitation strategy in the project work, this strategy based on the linkage between
providing both pure drinking water and the proper sanitation services through demand and conditional
response on the beneficiaries commitment to improve sanitation, and through the implementation of number of
interventions in the project working areas such as; establishment of a number of typical bathrooms in villages,
establishment of sanitary facilities in schools and mosques, establishment of sanitation networks in villages of
high population density and at district centers. In this part, type and number of interventions have been listed in
each PIU along with the cost for each type and the total costs for all interventions.

Part three of section three – entitled “Project Impact” – mentioned that the project has implemented a study
on Actual Impact for the Implemented Schemes by RWSSP in comparison with schemes implemented by other
authorities. That study has been executed by an independent research body, the study concluded that schemes
implemented by RWSSP are better. In this part, there is an evaluation of the project impacts - economic, social,
health, environmental, and educational - based on what is known of facts, with reference to that, although these
conclusions do not depend on an assessment of the impact of the project, the responsibility to do this
evaluation is not the responsibility of PMU.

The final part of this report is the “Appendices”: Data provided in all parts of this report were drawn from
the data included in these appendices.

The current Hajja Governor (former Abyan Governor) expressed his high regard for the RWSSP. He
described the general appeal of the project methodology in regards to the transparency of the project, the
relatively short implementation cycle, 8-12 months (as opposed to the normal 2-3 year cycle under the national
RWSS program), employing civil works contracting, fully immersing beneficiaries in the system selection
process and the training afforded to the WUA’s indicating a sense of community ownership and hence
improved prospects for self-managed service sustainability.
