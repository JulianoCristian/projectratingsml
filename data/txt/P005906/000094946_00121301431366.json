There are three\n            project components. The first, the water supply component,\n            provides a minimum service level including the construction\n            and rehabilitation of RWSS systems consisting of a range of\n            technologies, i.e., hand dug wells and hand pumps, spring\n            protection and gravity supply, rain water catchments, piped\n            schemes from boreholes equipped with either diesel or\n            electrical pumps, and supplying communal stand posts. The\n            second component, environmental sanitation, provides\n            incentives to household to construct household systems,\n            i.e., simple dry pit latrines, pour-flush latrines, flush\n            toilets, and septic tanks. The third component includes\n            equipment and running costs, as well as technical support,\n            training, technical assistance, and sector studies."}, "docdt": "2000-11-28T00:00:00Z"}
