"The Rural Water Supply and Sanitation\n            Project in Yemen, presents no major environmental concerns;\n            nonetheless, this Summary of the Environmental Review,\n            presented as an annex to the Appraisal Report, focuses on\n            wastewater, and excreta disposal, sludge, and effluents\n            reuse, and disposal, sanitary protection of wells and\n            bore-holes, water testing and surveillance, solid wastes\n            disposal, and storm water drainage. The mitigation plan\n            include: 1) soil inspection, and assessment of groundwater\n            depths to prevent contamination. Additionally, installation\n            of latrines, or septic tanks, should only be located at a\n            distance of at least fifty meters from the well, or\n            bore-hole, and, equipment, and training for water testing\n            should be provided; 2) the use of waste water will only be\n            used for crops irrigation, following a careful testing to\n            ensure compliance with the World Bank, and the World Health\n            Organization (WHO) standards; 3) similarly, dried sludge -\n            as soil fertilizer - will only be sold to farmers, following\n            compliance with WHO standards, and, a formal policy will be\n            developed for sludge reuse, and disposal. Communities will\n            be informed, and trained for an active participation in the\n            environmental aspects of the project."}, "docdt": "2000-05-16T00:00:00Z"}
