satisfactory; the risk to\n            development outcome was moderate; the Bank's\n            performance was moderately satisfactory; and the\n            Borrower's performance was also moderately\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: sustainability\n            of outcomes is dependent on sustainable water resources\n            management. The sustainability of existing water sources was\n            questioned at the time of appraisal and during early\n            supervision of the project. Reaching the poor requires\n            adaptation of demand-responsive approaches. Household\n            connections and metering is often not affordable in poor\n            areas and by the poorest households. Sanitation components\n            can be complex and require close supervision attention.\n            Harmonization between projects in a programmatic approach\n            can provide more comprehensive and sustainable outcomes.\n            Package contracts for sub-projects are relatively fast and\n            efficient. Monitoring and evaluation should be embedded in\n            community-based projects to provide communities with\n            feedback. Water user associations need ongoing support.\n            Community-based, demand-responsive approaches work in Yemen."}, "docdt": "2011-06-24T00:00:00Z"}
