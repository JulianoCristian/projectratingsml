development objectives of the Legal\n            and Judicial Capacity Building Project for Bangladesh are to\n            improve the environment for doing business by increasing the\n            efficiency, effectiveness, and accountability of the civil\n            justice system, and increase access to justice, particularly\n            for women and the poor. The overall results of the project\n            should provide a solid foundation for protecting against\n            corruption and improving governance in the country. There\n            are five project components. The first component strengthens\n            court administration and reduces delays, improves case\n            management, installs a court management information system\n            and automation, provides training and upgrading of training\n            facilities, provides other human resource needs that raise\n            the stature of the judiciary and regulate the court\n            performance of all levels of the judiciary, and upgrades\n            court infrastructure. The second component improves access\n            to justice by raising the level of gender sensitivity;\n            developing an alternative dispute resolution mechanism,\n            strengthening small cause courts, and improving access to\n            legal aid; and promoting legal literacy and public awareness\n            at the grassroots level, on a national level, and through\n            the bar associations. The third, fourth, and fifth\n            components strengthen the law commission and the ministry of\n            law, finance studies that prepare for future reforms, and\n            support project implementation."}, "docdt": "2001-03-01T00:00:00Z"}
