Description of the Project
The objective of the Project is to support measures: (a) to enhance the 
efficiency, effectiveness and accountability of the civil justice system, with a view 
particularly to reducing/eliminating the case backlog and expediting the clearance 
rate; and (b) to improve access to justice, particularly for women and the poor.
The Project consists of the following parts, subject to such modifications 
thereof as the Borrower and the Association may agree upon from time to time to 
achieve such objectives:

and, for this purpose and as necessary, strengthening/updating the procedural codes, 
rules, orders and forms (through the exercise of the Supreme Court’s rule-making 
powers or through legislation), in such areas as mandatory time-limits for processing 
cases, punitive costs and other sanctions, summary judgement procedures, enforcement 
of domestic and foreign judgements, and appeals, revisions and injunctions/stay 
orders; 
(c)
 inducting modern case management techniques into the courts’ working, 
aimed at: (i) the resolution of the case through a consensual process (such as ADR); 
or (ii) should a trial be necessary, the early identification of disputed issues of 
law and fact and the establishment and enforcement of a procedural calendar and rules 
for the life of the case; and 
(d)

clerical procedural manuals for court room staff, and trial practice manuals for 
litigating counsel; (ii) standardized legal/judicial and administrative forms; and

as general administration, human resources, research and case management support, in 
respect of the judiciary as a whole; (ii) establishing a modern planning, budgeting 
and financial management function in the Registrar’s office, including a system of 
preparing and updating multi-year projections of the judiciary’s needs and plans to 
address those needs, and of preparing separate annual capital and general budgets for 
the judiciary based on such plans;  and (iii) delegating to the Registrar’s office 
spending authority within the approved budget;
(b)
at the district level by: (i) upgrading the office of the administrative 
officer, shrestadar (office superintendent) and nazir (chief process server) in the 
District Judge’s court; and (ii) introducing suitable office structure/s for pooling 
and reorganizing administrative and clerical staff in the District Courts, so as to 
promote economy and efficiency; and  
(c) 
by providing the necessary staff, training, office manuals (documenting 
the new procedures and standard forms), office space and technology (the last linked 
to the CMIS developed under Part A.3 of the Project).
3.
Phased Installation of an Automated Court Management Information System (CMIS):

consisting of inter-related modules as follows: (i) a case management or 
case classification and status module, to facilitate case filing and monitoring, 
scheduling and tracking, and caveat matching; (ii) a legal framework module, to

areas as general administration, computer use and performance standards, all in 
accordance with an agreed training plan, updated from time to time with the agreement 
of the Association; and

to that end: (i) the upgrading of  JATI’s training facilities, including 
the development of modern teaching methods; the provision of teaching/office equipment

conferences and seminars in subjects of relevance to their work, including economic 
law, case management and gender-related issues.

the Supreme Court of an annual report, and the carrying out of user surveys, on the 
state of the courts.
6.

Improvement of access to justice by such means as: (a) raising the level of 
awareness of gender-related issues in the judiciary, particularly through training of
