Capacity Building Project for Bangladesh were as follows:\n            outcomes were unsatisfactory, the risk to development\n            outcome was high, the Bank performance was  unsatisfactory,\n            and the Borrower performance was also unsatisfactory. Some\n            lessons learned included: the project was approved at the\n            brink of the election which led to the change of the\n            Government. Two more governments came to power during the\n            life of the project. While each of these changes had major\n            impact on the project, the change in 2001 was the most\n            critical. The reforms that the project represented lost some\n            of its protagonists and leaders and the ownership of and\n            commitment to the reforms was diluted. The implementation of\n            the project key reforms (court administration and case\n            management reforms) revealed that the success of the reforms\n            requires the strong commitment and ownership of the capable\n            leaders on both levels; the central level as well as the\n            medium and lower level. It also proves that the leadership,\n            commitment and ownership are essential for the project from\n            its beginning to the end. The project originated in the\n            private sector department portfolio and stayed part of the\n            Private Sector Development (PSD) portfolio for the life of\n            the project. In hindsight, the project should have been\n            formally transferred to the Poverty Reduction and Economic\n            Management (PREM) portfolio, as therein lay its focus. By\n            doing so, it might have been able to benefit from improved\n            team supervision, with justice sector reform and broader\n            governance and institutional expertise, and increased\n            management attention and supervision."}, "docdt": "2010-05-14T00:00:00Z"}
