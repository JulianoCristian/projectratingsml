Transport\n            Improvement Project for Bangladesh were as follows: outcomes\n            were moderately satisfactory, risk to development outcome\n            was moderate, Bank performance was moderately satisfactory,\n            and Borrower performance was moderately satisfactory. Some\n            lessons learned include: the implementation of road works\n            was often delayed due to the resolution of the land\n            acquisition and resettlement (LA and R) actions but the road\n            sections which did not involve any LA and R actions, were\n            implemented as planned. The land acquisition should\n            therefore be minimized to the extent possible; all actions\n            including compensation to the affected persons should be\n            completed prior to awarding civil work contracts (with\n            relevant legal covenants). Many contractors were forced to\n            abandon the works and about 70 contracts were cancelled and\n            then re-awarded. To ensure contractors do not renege on\n            their contractual obligations, the executing agency should\n            put reasonable fixed amount against this bill of quantities\n            (BOQ) item. On many occasions local government engineering\n            department (LGED) awarded civil works contracts at the\n            beginning of rainy season or late in the dry season,\n            resulting in non-activity of contractors for half of the\n            year and delays in contract implementation. All contracts\n            which were awarded in this pattern took one year extra for\n            completion. This did not impact maintenance contracts but\n            only improvement works. On the other hand contracts awarded\n            by the end of rainy season had two full dry seasons to be\n            completed. The procurement of key technical assistance (TA)\n            and consultancy services should be completed by project\n            launch to avoid lengthy deferrals in implementation with\n            gradually reduced counterparts concern and drive. Where\n            piloting of important new concepts, processes and approaches\n            is planned, there should be a provision for rapid transition\n            from pilot to mainstreaming within the term of the same\n            project rather than plan an up-take of the post-pilot\n            activity in the new project with risk of loss of momentum."}, "docdt": "2013-02-27T00:00:00Z"}
