                         Implementation Status Overview
                         -The project is scheduled to close on 30 June, 2012 and over 99% of funds have been disbursed till now. The project has improved about 1630 km of Upazila and Union Roads,
                         rehabilitated over 2100 km of rural roads, improved over 120 rural markets and more than 30 river jetties in the 21 project districts across the country. More than 16000 meters of
                         bridges/culverts on union roads have been constructed to expand the continuously passable networks of union roads.
                         -The Local Government Improvement Program (LGIP) under RTIP is substantially and satisfactorily completed and the Institutional Development Component, as the project
                         approaches closure, is rated satisfactory taking into account the fact that LGED has identified concrete steps on the Unified Financial Management System (UFMS) rehabilitation, on
                         resolution with the Government of the Operational Risk Assessment (ORA)-supported organizational and staffing enhancements and on the strategic planning and action plan for IT-
                         ICT-MIS capacity enhancement.
