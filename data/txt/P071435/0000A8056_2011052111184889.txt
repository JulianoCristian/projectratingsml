                         Implementation Status Overview
                         This is an update of the project status. A supervision mission will be carried out before the end of FY11.
                         Since the September mission, LGED has processed all remaining contracts (re-bid of canceled ICB contracts, additional maintenance contracts). Most of the contracts awarded
                         before the mission are expected to be completed by June 30, 2011. The contracts awarded since the mission will require additional period of time for completion.
                         Further progress in the implementation of the Institutional Strengthening Action Plan and decisions on the implementation of the recommendations in the Operational Risk
                         Assessment (ORA) of LGED carried out in 2009 will be updated during the next supervision mission.
