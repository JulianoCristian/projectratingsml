Some of the key lessons learned\n            from the project include: (1) Human capacity development is\n            as important as technical training in projects promoting\n            rural decentralized infrastructure service delivery. In the\n            RTIP, while physical targets were met or exceeded, more\n            effective and in-depth training may have helped to smooth\n            project implementation and to build longer term capacity\n            within the Government, including for environmental\n            management. A decision to rely on a parallel Bank financed\n            project for planned training did not generate the results\n            anticipated, as confirmed by IEG\u2019s review of both this and\n            the parallel project. Training in the parallel project was\n            found to have been inadequate. (2) Civil works contracts\n            should include a transparently negotiated, price escalation\n            provision, even during short implementation periods, but\n            ensuring a more realistic estimate would be important, too.\n            In the case of RTIP, the price of construction materials\n            rose sharply during the short implementation period\n            (eighteen months) which resulted in many contractors\n            abandoning the works. (3) Timing and sequencing are critical\n            considerations when awarding civil works contracts. In the\n            case of RTIP, the implementing agency awarded civil works\n            contracts at the beginning of the rainy season or late in\n            the dry season, resulting in non-activity of contractors for\n            half of the year and delays in contract implementation. All\n            contracts which were awarded in this way took an extra year\n            for completion. On the other hand, contracts awarded at the\n            end of rainy season had two full dry seasons to be completed."}, "docdt": "2016-06-30T14:06:00Z"}
