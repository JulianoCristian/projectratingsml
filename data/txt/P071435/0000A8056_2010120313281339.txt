                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Out of a total of 715 contracts (excluding structures on union roads), 572 contracts have been completed and the remaining contracts are at different stages of implementation.
                         Implementation of the Local Government Improvement Program (LGIP) is on target, with the overall LGIP implemented at about 94 percent. The Local Government Engineering
                         Department (LGED) Institutional Strengthening Action Plan (ISAP) is now mostly fully implemented but progress is slower than expected on final-stage actions in Financial
                         Management, IT-ICT-MIS capacity and Quality Control/Quality Assurance. A high-level LGED Steering Committee, supported by six internal working groups, has begun to design a
                         plan to implement the 2009 Operational Risk Assessment (ORA) recommendations.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         1. As the project will close in end June 2011, LGED will ensure that contracts still underway will be completed by that date. If any contract needs to extend beyond June 2011, the
                         Government has to confirm the source of funds to finance contract execution untilcompletion.

                         2. LGED will start preparing the Government `implementation completion report' for the project in order to have a draft available when the project closes and then integrate it in the
                         World Bank's own assessment of the project.

                         3. LGED will firm up the implementation plan which will identify major Operational Risk Assessment (ORA)-based actions, the support required from the various development partners
                         and the specific activities to be included in the proposed follow on project RTIP 2.
