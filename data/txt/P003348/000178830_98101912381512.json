series to\n            protect existing cultivated areas from floods and saline\n            water inundation and reclaim abandoned paddyland in Lower\n            Burma. It would replicate the Paddyland I Project. The\n            project would develop and protect 125,000 acres of existing\n            farmland and reclaim 50,000 acres of abandoned paddyland.\n            Other components of the project include: equipment, spare\n            parts and workshops, 1,000 small pumps and 1,050 power\n            tillers, six fertilizer godowns, six training centers,\n            extension services, 39 man-months of consulting services,\n            and overseas training. The project would benefit 19,500 farm\n            families, of which 5,000 are presently landless resident\n            families. Annual incremental production, at full\n            development, is estimated at 90,000 tons of rice, 2,000 tons\n            of jute and 19,000 tons of pulses, groundnuts and other\n            crops. Realization of project benefits would depend largely\n            on the Government's setting prices at levels which\n            provide farmers with sufficient incentives to use modern technology."}, "docdt": "1978-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
