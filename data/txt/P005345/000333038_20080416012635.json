The Emergency\n            Project focused on essential repairs of physical and social\n            infrastructure in various sectors (power, water and\n            sanitation, solid waste, education, housing, etc.) while\n            paving the way for future sector reforms. The project\n            achieved most of its physical objectives, particularly in\n            the power and water and sanitation sectors, but was less\n            successful in the implementation of basic sector reforms.\n            Overall the project outcome is rated as satisfactory. The\n            Solid Waste Project\u0092s objective to provide solid waste\n            collection and treatment facilities for the whole country\n            was overly ambitious. At completion, only one of the 15\n            sanitary landfills planned was completed. The project almost\n            totally failed to achieve its objectives, and its outcome is\n            rated as unsatisfactory. Lessons learned from this\n            assessment included: government efforts remain concentrated\n            on slowly expanding infrastructure for water supply, solid\n            waste management and electricity and less on sector reform,\n            although there were notable achievements in the Ministry of\n            Finance and Telecommunications. Institutional issues\n            requiring cross-sectoral coordination have made little\n            progress. Attention to improving cost recovery, demand\n            management and environmental conservation has languished as\n            government continues to subsidize the delivery of basic\n            services on response to political pressure. What little\n            attention there was to long-range planning, conservation,\n            trade-offs, and efficiency improvements has become hostage\n            to the uncertain political climate and inability to bridge\n            sectarian differences for the common good. The most recent\n            34-day war between Hezbollah and Israeli starting July 2006\n            underscores the tremendous governance challenges in Lebanon\n            in which political authority is diffused, by design, among\n            various sects and branches of government. The continued\n            importance of sustainable natural resource and environmental\n            management is recognized by the Bank and forms the third\n            pillar of the 2006 country assistance strategy (CAS). And it\n            is likely, as before, that essential institutional\n            strengthening and reform in the primary water supply,\n            sanitation, solid waste and electricity service sectors will\n            be sidelined in the new national reconstruction program\n            following the July 2006 war. As a national consensus on\n            solid waste management seems unlikely in the short to medium\n            term, the Bank may consider supporting additional pilot\n            projects and private sector participation (PPP) in the\n            sector to overcome the information asymmetry that thwarts a\n            consensus on how to proceed."}, "docdt": "2007-01-25T00:00:00Z"}
