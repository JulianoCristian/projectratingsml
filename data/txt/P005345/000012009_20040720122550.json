an unsatisfactory project\n            outcome, unlikely sustainability, and modest institutional\n            development impacts. Despite a satisfactory Bank\n            performance, the Borrower performance is rated\n            unsatisfactory, thus lessons are addressed in the context of\n            interest to the Bank, and to the Borrower. Ensuring\n            institutional viability in terms of commitment, and support\n            from the government, the council of ministers, and the\n            parliament, and, clear agreement on important policy\n            dimensions, such as land site acquisition, environmental\n            regulations, participation of municipalities, and cost\n            recovery, should be agreed, supported by public consensus,\n            prior to launching new operations in Lebanon. Unless these\n            factors are ensured, this kind of project will not be\n            sustainable, even though the technical design is the correct\n            one. In particular, social analysis and assessment should be\n            undertaken during project preparation, including as\n            necessary, conflict-resolution mechanisms, to avoid social\n            resistance, while concentrating on fully integrated systems.\n            Furthermore, The Bank should proactively take remedial\n            measures such as canceling the project when the new\n            political leadership does not support it, or if the project\n            is encountering serious obstacles in its implementation,\n            setting a time limit to either restructure, or cancel a\n            project. Lessons for the Borrower, suggest the need for\n            strong, proactive local champions, who can facilitate site\n            selection, and maintain commitment of all stakeholders,\n            including central government, municipalities,\n            nongovernmental Organizations, and local community\n            residents. This is because given Lebanon's ethnic\n            tapestry, a participatory approach to build a consensus in\n            the communities, municipalities, and the central government\n            is necessary to address key strategic issues within a new\n            national solid waste management strategy, that includes land\n            site acquisition, environmental regulations, participation\n            of municipalities and cost recovery."}, "docdt": "2004-06-21T00:00:00Z"}
