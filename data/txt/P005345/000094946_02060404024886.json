Following a review on the\n            country's legal, and administrative framework, on the\n            technical and economic benefits of the project, on the\n            Bank's environmental operational guidelines, and on an\n            analysis of alternatives, the EA establishes the management\n            discharge control, proposing mitigation measures (Vol. 1)\n            based on geo-technical site investigations (Vol. 2). Public\n            awareness, and education campaigns were conducted regarding\n            adequate solid waste disposal, while a management plan\n            focused on an environmentally, integrated discharge system,\n            to protect flora and fauna, avoid disruption to green\n            spaces, and re-integrate treated discharges into the natural\n            landscape. To this end, soil erosion will be contained by\n            installing stabilized, underground cement pipes; drainage,\n            sludge, and water residues will be collected at specific\n            storage basins, septic tanks, and/or treatment facilities.\n            During construction, daytime working schedules will be\n            observed, vehicle speed limits enforced, and, machinery and\n            equipment inspected to abate noise disturbances. Regular\n            waste collections will minimize odors, either through\n            compacted waste collection, or discharges' incineration\n            to prevent biogas fumes. Asphalt roads will be constructed\n            to prevent dust and air pollution resulting from heavy\n            traffic transporting construction debris (which should be\n            carried in covered trucks), while on-site surfaces will be\n            water-sprinkled regularly. Cultural sites will be avoided,\n            in addition, the Archaeological Department will be informed,\n            and inspect the site, should archaeological finds occur.\n            Following construction, reforestation and vegetative\n            propagation practices will be conducted."}, "docdt": "2002-08-31T00:00:00Z"}
