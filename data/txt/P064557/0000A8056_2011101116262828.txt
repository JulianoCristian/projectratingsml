                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The development objectives of the project are to improve the capacity of schools to educate a rapidly increasing number of primary-level students; and of the
                         government of Burundi to carry out policy analysis, strategic planning and program implementation.
                         The first objective responds to the well-justified and urgent priority that the Government gives to providing immediate and direct support to schools in order to
                         cope with the rapid expansion of participation in primary school. This rapid expansion has been caused by pent-up demand in the immediate post-conflict
                         period and the abolition of school fees. Failure to provide timely assistance to schools as the system expands could result in the slowing or even reversal of
                         this trend toward full primary enrollment. In this context, the overwhelming majority of project funding is focused on these urgent goals, which are normal in a
                         post-conflict reconstruction environment. The second objective responds to the equally well-justified priority that the government gives to rapidly building its
                         capacity to plan and manage the education sector, which will help the completion of an in-depth action plan that will increase the likelihood of attracting more
                         external funding for its programs, including Fast-Track-Initiative's membership.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Education is seen as an important contributing factor to peace and security in Burundi. The Burundi Education Sector Reconstruction Project (ESRP) continues to make progress
                         towards achieving the Project Development Objectives, albeit more slowly than originally envisaged. The main goal of the government is to ensure that access to schooling is
                         improved. The Primary Completion Rate increased from 38% in 2005/06 to 47.7% in 2009/10 against the estimated target of 65% which is assessed to be very ambitious. Access to

                         schooling has received significant attention. The first component on school construction and rehabilitation has been completed. A Memorandum of Understanding was signed
                         between the Government of Burundi and Education International, Canada in June 2010. The Memorandum relates to a twinning arrangement (Accord de Jumelage) to facilitate
                         technical assistance for key studies in the areas of human resources development, program budgeting, education management information system, textbook policy, education
                         management, curriculum development, school inspection, assessments of student learning achievement, in-service teacher training, and student repetition and dropout issues.
                         Significant progress has been made in getting the key studies underway. In the coming months progress towards project targets is envisaged to accelerate as a result of the
                         improvement in implementation.

                         There has been progress since November 2010 towards achieving key pending activities under components 2 and 3 of the project: (i) the administration of the reading assessment is
                         now underway; (ii) activities towards revising the Education Sector Plan (PSDEF) have picked up momentum especially since the Education Sector Review of February 2011. At the
                         joint review of the education sector the two Ministries of Education and development partners committed to accelerating the pace of work towards preparing the application for
                         Burundi to be EFA FTI endorsed. The GoB endorsed the overall framework for the PSDEF in October 2009. However, the Plan needs to be updated following the newly elected
                         government's introduction in October 2010 of a new policy of 9-years basic education. The timetable for this is envisaged to be around November/December 2011, following which
                         the Plan will be reviewed and endorsed by donors. Efforts are underway to coordinate technical and financial support to revise the education simulation model and the Education
                         Sector Plan; and (iii) there has been some progress in the procurement of secondary school textbooks.

                         An unresolved aspect is the copyright issue for 3rd year French textbooks. A resolution is likely before end-December 2011 with the French Publisher Hachette.
