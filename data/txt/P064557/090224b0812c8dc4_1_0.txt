Project Development Objectives
Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)
The development objectives of the project are to improve the capacity of schools to educate a rapidly increasing number of primary-level students; and of the
government of Burundi to carry out policy analysis, strategic planning and program implementation.
The first objective responds to the well-justified and urgent priority that the Government gives to providing immediate and direct support to schools in order to cope with
the rapid expansion of participation in primary school. This rapid expansion has been caused by pent-up demand in the immediate post-conflict period and the abolition
of school fees. Failure to provide timely assistance to schools as the system expands could result in the slowing or even reversal of this trend toward full primary
enrollment. In this context, the overwhelming majority of project funding is focused on these urgent goals, which are normal in a post-conflict reconstruction
environment. The second objective responds to the equally well-justified priority that the government gives to rapidly building its capacity to plan and manage the
education sector, which will help the completion of an in-depth action plan that will increase the likelihood of attracting more external funding for its programs, including
Fast-Track-Initiative's membership.

Implementation Status Overview
The Burundi Education Sector Reconstruction Project (ESRP) has made considerable progress in project implementation. The project funds will be fully disbursed prior to project
closing in June 2012. Despite the progress, the Project Development Objectives are not likely to be achieved prior to project closing. The Primary Completion Rate increased from
38% in 2005/06 to 51% 2010/11 against the revised, estimated target of 55%. The target was formerly set at 65% which was estimated to be very ambitious. During project
o   restructuring in July 2011, the target was revised downwards to bring it more in line to a realistic estimate. Despite the downward revision of the target, it is unlikely to be met within
0   the next six-months. The Government's primary concern is to ensure that access to quality schooling is improved. This is a priority objective for the new 9-years basic education
a)
:   policy. Access to schooling has received significant attention through the project. The first component on school construction and rehabilitation had been completed in June 2011.
o   The twinning arrangement (Accord de Jumelage) between the Ministry of Education and Education International has now culminated in the completion of key studies in the areas of
0   human resources development, program budgeting, education management information system, textbook policy, education management, curriculum development, school inspection,
r   assessments of student learning achievement, in-service teacher training, and student repetition and dropout issues. The analytical report on the Early Grade Reading Assessment
o (EGRA) has also been completed. The findings and recommendations of the studies are timely, and as intended, would provide the analytical basis for the revision of the Education
Sector Plan. The considerable improvement in project implementation has helped to make some progress towards the project targets.
There has been progress since June 2011 towards the completion of key pending activities under components 2 and 3 of the project: (i) the administration of the reading assessment
was successfully completed and the analytical report is now available. The results show that relative to countries like Mali and Kenya, Burundi's outcomes are comparable although
low considering that 90% of students speak one language i.e., there is a relatively homogeneous language base; (ii) there has been progress in the procurement of secondary school
textbooks and the primary education 3rd year French textbooks. A resolution has been reached regarding the copyright for the primary education 3rd year French textbooks; and (iii)
the revision of the Education Sector Plan is scheduled to be launched in January 2012. The financial simulation model is now complete, and this will serve as the tool for prioritizing
the parameters to accomplish the policy targets of the new policy of 9-years basic education. The revised Education Plan for Burundi will eventually be presented to the Global
Partnership for Education (GPE, formerly EFA-FTI) for endorsement. There are ongoing challenges with the coordination of technical and financial support to revise the Education
Sector Plan.
