                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The development objectives of the project are to improve the capacity of schools to educate a rapidly increasing number of primary-level students; and of the
                         government of Burundi to carry out policy analysis, strategic planning and program implementation.

                          The first objective responds to the well-justified and urgent priority that the Government gives to providing immediate and direct support to schools in order to
                         cope with the rapid expansion of participation in primary school. This rapid expansion has been caused by pent-up demand in the immediate post-conflict
                         period and the abolition of school fees. Failure to provide timely assistance to schools as the system expands could result in the slowing or even reversal of
                         this trend toward full primary enrollment. In this context, the overwhelming majority of project funding is focused on these urgent goals, which are normal in a
                         post-conflict reconstruction environment. The second objective responds to the equally well-justified priority that the government gives to rapidly building its
                         capacity to plan and manage the education sector, which will help the completion of an in-depth action plan that will increase the likelihood of attracting more
                         external funding for its programs, including Fast-Track-Initiative?s membership.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?

                            Yes           No

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The Burundi Education Sector Reconstruction Project continues to make progress towards achieving the Project Development Objectives, albeit more slowly than originally
                         envisaged. The main goal of the government is to ensure that access to schooling is improved. Education is seen as an important contributing factor to peace and security. The
                         Primary Completion Rate increased from 38% in 2005/06 to 44% in 2007/08, 46% in 2008/09, and 47.7% in 2009/10 against the estimated target of 65% which is assessed to be very
                         ambitious. Access to schooling has received significant attention. The first component on school construction and rehabilitation has been nearly fully implemented. A Memorandum
                         of Understanding was signed between the Government of Burundi and Education International, Canada in June 2010. The Memorandum relates to a twinning arrangement (Accord
                         de Jumelage) to facilitate technical assistance for key studies in the areas of human resources development, program budgeting, education management information system,
                         textbook policy, education management, curriculum development, school inspection, assessments of student learning achievement, in-service teacher training, and student repetition
                         and dropout issues. Significant progress has been made in getting the key studies underway. In the coming months progress towards project targets is envisaged to accelerate as a
                         result of the improvement in implementation.

                         Three key activities, however, are pending: (i) the administration of the reading assessment which has been delayed due to one contractor declining to undertake the work as a result
                         of lack of time to complete the work by June 30, 2011 (original project closing date). However, this is envisaged to be undertaken by June 2011; (ii) the endorsement of the Education
                         for All - Fast Track Initiative application. Some progress was made in 2009 towards preparing the Education Sector Plan. The GoB endorsed the overall framework for the Sector Plan
                         in October 2009. However, Development Partners did not endorse the Plan due to its complexity. Development Partners have voiced commitment to bringing technical assistance to
                         the Ministries of Education for updating the Education Sector Plan. The Education Sector Plan needs to be updated following the new government policy announcement of 9-years
                         basic education. The timetable for this is envisaged to be around November/December 2011, following which the ESP will be reviewed and endorsed by donors; and (iii) the
                         copyright issues for 3rd year French textbooks continue to remain unresolved. Although Development Partners have reached an agreement, there has been no response from
                         Hachette, the French publisher.

                         Donor coordination is posing significant challenge in-country. Development Partners do not have a fully coordinated approach to supporting the education sector. There are multiple
                         pressures from different partners due to differing agency objectives and goals. The risks are the failure of partners to effectively coordinate technical and financial support to revise
                         the education simulation model and the Education Sector Plan, thereby leading to further delays in finalizing, reviewing and endorsing the Education Sector Plan.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         Key outcomes at the end of the supervision mission:
                         (1) The Government of Burundi has requested a six-months extension of the closing date of the Burundi Education Sector Reconstruction Project, from June 30, 2011 to December
                         31, 2011. The objective is to complete the project activities for which the procurement processes are underway, and are expected to be completed prior to June 2011.
                         (2) The Ministry of Education and Development Partners have requested technical assistance from the World Bank for two areas: (i) updating the Education Sector Plan in
                         collaboration with the Ministry of Education, Development Partners and other stakeholders. The studies completed through the twinning arrangement (Accord de Jumelage) are
                         intended to serve as background documents for the revision of the Education Sector Plan; and (ii) undertaking an analysis of sector financing needs of the new Plan, which would
                         include the new 9-years basic education policy.
