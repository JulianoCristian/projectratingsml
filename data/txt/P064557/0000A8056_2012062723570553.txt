                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The development objectives of the project are to improve the capacity of schools to educate a rapidly increasing number of primary-level students; and of the
                         government of Burundi to carry out policy analysis, strategic planning and program implementation.
                         The first objective responds to the well-justified and urgent priority that the Government gives to providing immediate and direct support to schools in order to cope with
                         the rapid expansion of participation in primary school. This rapid expansion has been caused by pent-up demand in the immediate post-conflict period and the abolition
                         of school fees. Failure to provide timely assistance to schools as the system expands could result in the slowing or even reversal of this trend toward full primary
                         enrollment. In this context, the overwhelming majority of project funding is focused on these urgent goals, which are normal in a post-conflict reconstruction
                         environment. The second objective responds to the equally well-justified priority that the government gives to rapidly building its capacity to plan and manage the
                         education sector, which will help the completion of an in-depth action plan that will increase the likelihood of attracting more external funding for its programs, including
                         Fast-Track-Initiative's membership.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         This is the final ISR for the Burundi Education Sector Reconstruction Project (ESRP). The Project will close on June 30, 2012.

                         During the course of the last six-months progress has been made towards completing the remaining project activities. Per financial management projections in early-June,

                         disbursements would be approximately 94.32% by project closing in June 2012. An estimated amount of only US$1.15 million will remain un-disbursed. This primarily reflects the
                         exchange rate gains which would not be fully utilized by project closing date. Project implementation has continued to be Moderately Satisfactory. In finalizing the penultimate ISR for
                         the project, the unavailability of school year 2011/12 data made it difficult to gauge with certainty if the PDO would be achieved. However, prior to project closing, available data for
                         school year 2011/12 show that the PDO has been reached. The improvement in project implementation over the past two and a half years has helped to make progress towards
                         achieving the project targets. Further, the systemic processes and the institutional capacity developed through the project have contributed to achieving the targets before project
                         closure in end-June 2012.

                         Project Development Objective indicators:
                         (i) The Primary Completion Rate (PCR) increased from 38% in 2005/06 to 56% in 2011/12 against the revised, estimated target of 55%. The original target for this indicator had been
                         set at 65%. This was estimated to be very ambitious. During project restructuring in July 2011, the target was revised downwards to bring it more in line with a realistic estimate. The
                         assessment of target achievement in the penultimate ISR seemed to indicate that despite the downward revision of the target, it might not be reached by June 20, 2012. This is
                         because 2011/2012 data had not been available at that time. Six months on, the availability of data for school year 2011/12 indicates that the target has indeed be reached.

                         (ii) The Gross Enrollment Rate (GER) increased from 80% in 2005/06 to 137.7% in 2011/12 against the original target of 100%. The first component on school construction and
                         rehabilitation had been completed by June 2011. The component targets have been fully achieved. This contributed to achieving the GER target. The Government's primary concern
                         has been that access to quality schooling is improved. This is a priority objective for the new 9-years basic education policy. Access to schooling has received significant attention
                         through the project.

                         (iii) Burundi is on track to be endorsed for the EFA-FTI (GPE) program: (a) the financial simulation model has been completed; (b) the country status report 2011 has also been
                         completed; (c) the Education Sector Plan (revision of the 2009 document to factor in the new policy of 9-years basic education) is well underway to be finalized by end-June 2012;
                         and (d) the application for EFA-FTI (GPE) endorsement is being prepared by the Supervising Entity (Belgian Technical Cooperation).

                         There has been progress since June 2011 towards the completion of key pending activities under components 2 and 3 of the project:

                         (i) The administration of the first Early Grade Reading Assessment (EGRA) was successfully completed in May 2011, and the analytical report became available shortly thereafter.
                         The repeat of the EGRA was completed in May 2012. The final report will be received by end-June 2012. The results show that Burundi's outcomes are comparable to countries like
                         Kenya. The results of the second follow-on reading assessment indicate that there has been an improvement in student reading. Compared to the 2011 results which showed that
                         20.4% of students in grade 2 were unable to read, the 2012 percentage has dropped to 19.0%. This could be attributed to the increased availability of textbooks, improved teaching
                         due to more qualified teachers, and the recommendations of the 2011 reading assessment having been taken on board in implementing improvements at the school level.

                         (ii) There has been progress in the procurement of primary education 3rd year French textbooks and secondary school textbooks. The books have been distributed to schools. The
                         Bank adopted a Rapid Results Initiative (RRI) which ensured that books were distributed to the most remote parts of the country within a 100 days timeframe.

                          (iii) The twinning arrangement (Accord de Jumelage) between the Ministry of Education and Education International has culminated in the completion of key studies in the areas of
                         human resources development, program budgeting, education management information system, textbook policy, education management, curriculum development, school inspection,
                         assessments of student learning achievement, in-service teacher training, and student repetition and dropout issues in October 2011. It is now confirmed that the analytical outputs
                         have served as the basis for the revising the Education Sector Plan which is currently in the process of being finalized.

                         (iv) Finally, the revision of the 2009 Education Sector Plan is on schedule to be completed by end-June 2012. The financial simulation model is now complete, and this has served as
                         an important tool for prioritizing the parameters to accomplish the policy targets of the new policy of 9-years basic education. Development partners have actively addressed the
                         challenges with respect to the coordination of technical and financial support to revise the Education Sector Plan.

                         Relevance: The Project Development Objectives (PDOs) to improve the capacity of schools to educate a rapidly increasing number of primary-level students; and of the government
                         of Burundi to carry out policy analysis, strategic planning and program implementation were relevant and timely. The first objective responded to the well-justified and urgent priority
                         that the Government had placed to providing immediate and direct support to schools in order to cope with rapid expansion of participation in primary school. This rapid expansion
                         had been due to the pent-up demand in the immediate aftermath of the post-conflict period, followed by the abolition of school fees in 2006. Failure to provide timely assistance to

                         schools as the system was poised to expand would have resulted in the slowing or even reversal of the trend towards full primary enrollment. In this context, the majority of project
                         funding was focused on the urgent goals, which was normal in a post-conflict reconstruction environment. The second objective responded to the equally well-justified priority that the
                         government placed to cope with demand for institutional capacity to address the challenges. The second objective focused on rapidly building institutional capacity to plan and
                         manage the education sector. The objective was to assist with the completion of an in-depth action plan that would increase the likelihood of attracting more external funding for the
                         government's policies and programs, including Fast-Track-Initiative's membership. The design was appropriate and directly responded to the development goals of the government.

                         Project implementation was completed in line with the PDOs albeit a little more slowly than originally anticipated due to both institutional constraints on the part of the Bank and the
                         government. However, the outcomes were moderately satisfactory. The project resulted in substantial institutional capacity being developed for the government's technical team to
                         undertake the preparation of a simulation model, complete the analysis to update the education sector status, analyze the issues in a cogent manner to develop a revised Education
                         Sector Plan, and to provide the necessary basis for the country to qualify for EFA-FTI (GPE) endorsement.

                         The stated objectives were achieved effectively. The construction of schools and the rehabilitation of classrooms exceeded the originally set targets. This helped to accommodate the
                         increasing enrollments. The textbooks procured and distributed through the project and the in-service teacher training helped to improve the learning experience of students, and to
                         some measurable extent these contributed to improving student learning. The related investments to develop the Ministry's capacity in support of the second objective was relatively
                         small (US$4.25 million) when compared to the rest of the project. And yet, the actual contribution of the project to institutional development was substantial, based on evidence that
                         extends beyond the original stated indicators. The institutional capacity developed through the project contributed directly to improved planning and management of the education
                         sector, including in the areas of financial management, procurement, and project implementation.

                         Efficiency: The unit cost of constructing a classroom through the project was higher at approximately US$20,000 than those constructed by other development partners, especially
                         UNICEF at about US$12,000. However, this had to do with the technical specifications adopted by the Bank financed Project. The Bank constructed schools appear to be well
                         constructed and school construction was based on careful assessment of the sites, soil, overall catchment area, and an environmental and social assessment. With respect to the
                         procurement and distribution of textbooks, despite some setbacks with the copyright issues for third year primary French textbooks, the books were received on time and distribution
                         was undertaken through a Rapid Results Initiative (RRI) which resulted in schools in remote areas receiving the books in time for the start of the school year 2010/11. Of note is the
                         successful negotiations undertaken by the project implementation team in ensuring equal profit sharing for the reprinting of the third year French textbooks with the international
                         publishing company. This resulted in the reprinting of the textbooks incountry at a lower price. Finally, the institutional capacity developed resulted in the preparation of the simulation
                         model, the update of the Country Status Report, and the preparation of the revised Education Sector Plan all in a record time of eight months. The studies (on the issue of student
                         repetition, early grade reading assessment, and other Accord de Jumelage outputs) undertaken through the Project directly contributed to policy development.

                         Beneficiary assessments were undertaken through successive supervision field visits. The results revealed that by and large school administrators, teachers, and students were
                         positively disposed towards the contributions by the Project. While there were some concerns about the delays in the receipt of the textbooks, there was recognition that the books
                         once made available did in fact contribute to improved student attendance and engagement in the classroom. School administrators and teachers confirmed that they had acquired

                         appropriate training through distance learning content. However, some had expressed concerns about the lack of full knowledge regarding the correct use of the radios that had been
                         distributed through the Project. Remedial action to improve the capacity for the use of the radios was undertaken prior to project completion. Finally, Ministry officials showed
                         improved analytical capabilities towards assessing policy decisions. They demonstrated their enhanced knowledge by making presentations and actively taking part in policy debates.
