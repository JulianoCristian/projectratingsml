and (b) for the\n            Government of Burundi to carry out policy analysis,\n            strategic planning and program implementation. There are\n            three components of this project. Component 1 deals with the\n            expansion of school facilities. The objective of this\n            component is to contribute to the expansion of primary\n            enrollment on an equitable basis in order to reach universal\n            completion by 2015. It will respond to the significant\n            increase in the rate of enrollment by expanding school\n            infrastructure through supporting the Ministry of National\n            Education and Culture (MINEDUC's) school infrastructure\n            triennial plan (2007-2009). Component 2 deals with the\n            support for teaching and learning. The objective of this\n            component is to contribute to maintain or improve student\n            acquisitions through supporting: (i) the introduction of new\n            in-service programs and devices to train teachers, schools\n            directors and inspectors; (ii) the provision of textbooks\n            and pedagogic materials for all students at the primary\n            level and three subject textbooks for lower secondary\n            students, and setting up a textbooks management mechanism;\n            and (iii) the measurement of learning outcomes undertaking a\n            rapid assessment of reading competency in a sample of\n            primary schools throughout Burundi for each year of the\n            Project. Component 3 focuses on building capacity in\n            MINEDUC. The objective of this component is to improve the\n            capacity of the Government of Burundi to carry out policy\n            analysis, strategic planning and program implementation.\n            Building Government's capacity to plan and manage the\n            education sector will, in turn, increase the likelihood of\n            attracting more external funding for its programs, including\n            membership in the Education For All - Fast Track Initiative."}, "docdt": "2007-01-24T00:00:00Z"}
