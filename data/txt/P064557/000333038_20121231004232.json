EFA-FTI ENDORSEMENT SUP", "versiontyp": "Final", "abstracts": {"cdata!": "Ratings for the Education Sector\n            Reconstruction Project for Burundi were as follows: outcomes\n            were moderately satisfactory, the risk to development\n            outcome was moderate, the Bank performance was moderately\n            satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was also\n            moderately satisfactory. Some lessons learned included:\n            multiple levels of organizational management with vertical\n            and horizontal lines of authority can become unwieldy when\n            even a single element undergoes modification. Fundamental\n            changes at the ministerial level (twice) led to confusion in\n            the lines of authority and ultimately led to delays in\n            implementation. Simpler structures can mitigate such issues,\n            even if they can't prevent them entirely. Indicators\n            that measure outcomes at a level different than that of an\n            intervention can mask shortcomings or miss the opportunity\n            to highlight progress. By setting the primary completion\n            rate indicator at the national level, rather than at the\n            level of the nine targeted regions, the project missed an\n            opportunity to record the more impressive rate of\n            achievement in these areas. Data from the nine regions\n            indicate the primary completion rate more than doubled from\n            23 percent to 46.6 percent, compared to the country as a\n            whole where the rate increased from 38 percent to 51.4\n            percent. This is particularly impressive given the fact\n            these were disadvantaged regions in a post-conflict\n            environment. Thus, linking indicators directly with\n            activities produces a better measure of impact. Both\n            government officials and SEO (Executive Operations\n            Secretariat - Secretariat Executif Operationnel) staff\n            remarked on the multiple changes in Task Team Leader (TTL),\n            and the lack of a more permanent presence in the field by\n            the Bank. Particularly in the middle period of project\n            implementation there was a perception of disengagement,\n            which weakened the Bank's position with the government\n            and other development partners. Staff movement in the Bank\n            is unavoidable, but changes in TTL should be kept to a\n            minimum, and joint handover missions (including the sector\n            manager, if possible) should be the norm."}, "docdt": "2012-12-20T00:00:00Z"}
