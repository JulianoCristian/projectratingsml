The Government of China gives high priority to\n            electric power development and has developed a comprehensive\n            strategy for power development. The Yanshi Thermal Power\n            Project is located about 90 km west of Zhengzhou in Henan\n            province and comprises the following components: (i)\n            extension of the existing Yanshi thermal power plant by\n            adding two generating units of 300 MW each at a site being\n            developed; (ii) construction of five 220 kV transmission\n            lines with associated substations; (iii) provision of\n            technical assistance for a tariff study for the Henan power\n            grid; and (iv) a training program for upgrading the\n            technical, financial, and management skills of the Henan\n            Provincial Electric Power Bureau (HPEPB) staff."}, "docdt": "1991-12-17T00:00:00Z"}
