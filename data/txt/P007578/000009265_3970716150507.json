increasing\n            exports, self-sufficiency in food and real farm income. It\n            will continue to develop FIRA's institutional framework\n            for efficient allocation of financial resources and assist\n            to improve agricultural policies through the reduction of\n            interest rate subsidies. The low-income producers'\n            component will comprise about one-half of the total\n            investment program. A program of training and demonstration\n            will provide support to credit operations. About 105,000\n            families or 580,000 beneficiaries will benefit from the project."}, "docdt": "1984-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
