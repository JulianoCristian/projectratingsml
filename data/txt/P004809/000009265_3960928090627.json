production capacity,\n            primarily in the agricultural, industrial, service and\n            tourism sectors, by providing long-term resources to the\n            Tonga Development Bank (TDB) for making term loans primarily\n            to the private sector; and (c) to continue to support\n            TDB's (TDB) institutional development. The project\n            would be cofinanced by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and\n            would comprise a credit line to the TDB to meet the\n            term-financing needs of its clients over a three-year\n            commitment period, 1990-92. Financing under the line of\n            credit would be provided to all viable subprojects in a\n            broad range of subsectors."}, "docdt": "1989-10-31T00:00:00Z"}
