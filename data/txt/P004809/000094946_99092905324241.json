unsatisfactory with project sustainability unlikely. World\n            Bank performance in appraisal was partially satisfactory\n            while its performance in supervision was adjudged as\n            deficient. As a typical financial intermediation lending\n            (FIL) operation, the project offered the following lessons:\n            A FIL operation may achieve limited sectoral policy\n            objectives if the borrower is committed to the specific\n            objectives and does not have many options for mobilizing\n            long-term funding sources. FILs are ineffective in\n            introducing commercial banking practices to financial\n            intermediaries which in reality are government policy banks.\n            Sound market analysis of potential long-term funding demand\n            in an economy is essential in designing an effective FIL\n            operation. While technical assistance in the areas of\n            developing a credit manual, accounting procedures, and\n            information technology systems are needed, the bottom line\n            for a sound sub-loan is market-based, realistic\n            sales/revenue projections. Even as a non-lending co-lender,\n            The International Development Association should be more\n            proactive in project preparation and supervision to ensure\n            the cost-effectiveness of the project's economic\n            outcomes and of staff inputs."}, "docdt": "1999-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
