which\n            the loan will be made comprises the construction of three\n            dams, a tunnel connecting two of the reservoirs, ancillary\n            structures and a system of irrigation canals in the States\n            of Kedah and Perlis to provide water for two crops of paddy\n            a year on an area of 261,500 acres. About half of this area\n            is at present served by an irrigation system, which,\n            however, supplies water for a single crop of paddy; the rest\n            of the acreage is entirely dependent on the monsoon. The\n            project is designed, on full development, to produce an\n            increase in net farm benefits amounting to US$30 million per\n            year. The rate of return to the economy is estimated to be\n            10 percent per annum. The increased output will also reduce\n            the amount of paddy that will otherwise have to be imported\n            to meet the needs of a growing population and a rising\n            standard of living; the gross annual import savings may be\n            of the order of US$35 million."}, "docdt": "1965-10-31T00:00:00Z"}
