About half of this area\n            is at present served by an irrigation system, which,\n            however, supplies water for a single crop of paddy; the rest\n            of the acreage is entirely dependent on the monsoon. The\n            project is designed, on full development, to produce an\n            increase in net farm benefits amounting to US$30 million per\n            year. The rate of return to the economy is estimated to be\n            10 percent per annum. The increased output will also reduce\n            the amount of paddy that will otherwise have to be imported\n            to meet the needs of a growing population and a rising\n            standard of living; the gross annual import savings may be\n            of the order of US$35 million."}, "docdt": "1965-11-30T00:00:00Z"}
