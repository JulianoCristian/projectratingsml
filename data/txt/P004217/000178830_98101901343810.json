The project\n            is located in the States of Kedah and Perlis in the\n            northwest of Peninsular Malaysia. The area is the\n            traditional rice bowl of Malaysia. Farms average 1.6 ha in\n            size and there is a high degree of tenancy. The primary\n            objective of the project was to achieve double cropping of\n            paddy in the area. There was little attention, at appraisal\n            or subsequently, to yields or alternative crops. Physical\n            construction of the project was completed six months behind\n            schedule and the first irrigation water was delivered in the\n            off-season of 1970. Three extensions of the closing date\n            were necessary to allow certain repair and improvement works\n            to be completed and for the loan to be fully disbursed. The\n            improvement works included pilot projects for water\n            distribution at the farm level. Even though the Muda Project\n            has fulfilled its original goals, there is still\n            considerable scope for further development. Proposals for\n            on-farm development, that is, the provision of ditches,\n            drain, and roads to serve individual farms have been under\n            investigation for some years. The project management has\n            recently embarked on a new systematic program of pilot\n            projects which, if properly directed and monitored, will\n            determine design standards, test the acceptability of the\n            works to the farmers and establish the feasibility of\n            project-scale development. If large-scale investment is\n            recommended, it could also include any necessary repairs to\n            the Muda and Pedu dams and possibly an expansion of the\n            irrigated area. This project appears to have high priority."}, "docdt": "1975-06-15T00:00:00Z"}
