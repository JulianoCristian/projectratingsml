MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF TEE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOWS >'Ž  A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE REPUBLIC OF KENYA
FOR THE INSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT
AND CIVIL SERVICE REFORM PROJECT
1.    I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation on a
proposed development credit to the Republic of Kenya for SDR 17.2 million, the equivalent
of US$25.35 million, on standard IDA terms with a maturity of 40 years to help finance a
Project for Institutiorld Development and Civil Service Reform. The British ODA has
agreed to provide par1lel financing of the equivalent of about US$10.7 million on a grant
basis.
2.     Sector Background: At independence in 1963, the civil service had an
establishment of 60,300, while Kenya's population was 8 million. In 1965, the Sessional
Paper No. 10 on African Socialism and its AMplication to Development in Kenya was
issued setting the agenda for greatly expanded government intervtion Kenya's population
has steadily increased at an average anmnal growth rate of almost 4% and had reached about
24 million in 1993. The rapid population growth, along with the expectations raised by
African Socialism, created an even greater demand for public services. Consequently, the
civil service establishment has grown over the years by about 6.5 percent per anm. Total
civil service employment as of August 1993, stood at 272,000 (excluding teachers)
representing over 13 percent of employment in the modern and informal sectors (i.e.,
excluding small holder agriculture). Civil service growth in part has reflected the political
philosophy of successive Govermnents and their attempts to guide the development
process. Another miportant factor affecting growth has been the Governmenes commitment
to be the employer of the last resort.
3.    Kenya is now facing new challenges in econonmc mnagement and public policy.
Quality public services remain a priority, but cost considerations have become significantly
more important. Not only must Kenyans' needs be met, they must be met efficiently.
Pervasive reform of the civil service is therefore required. In response to this imperative, a
wide ranging review of the structure and functions of the civil sevice was conducted in
1992. Extensive recommendations and an action plan for reform have been developed, and
implementation has started.
4.    An overriding goal of government economic policy is to return to renewed growth
as soon as possible. On the basis of policies outlined in the Policy Framework Paper (PFP)
for 1994-96, it is expected that GDP growth will recover to 5-6 percent per annum in 1995
and 1996. The increased economic activity is expected to derive from higher private sector
investment in response to more stable macro-economic conditions. Significant progress is
called for over the PFP period, beginning with the 1994/95 budget, in shiftimg the allocation



-2-
of budget resources towards the core finctions of Govemment: the maintenance of law and
order and the administion of justice; the provision of broad-based basic education and
health sevices; the provision of economnic infrastructure; and the protection of the
environment.
5.    There are three priority areas for Kenya: (a) public sector adjustment involving the
divestiture and rationaization of pare.tatals, the down-sizing and reorgnzation of the civil
service, and the rationalization of the remainin public expenditures; (b) developing the
g3ate mcgtou through reform of the legal and reglatory environment and financial sector,
and the elimination of the remaing foreign exchange, pice, marketing and production
controls; and (c) targieted intervention to aReviate poverty, including improvement in the
delivery of social services to low-income groups, with specal attention to the development
needs of women and residents in arid and semi-arid areas.
6.    After several years of internl study and debate, the Government of Kenya, through
the Directorate of Personnel Management, prepared a Civil Service Reform Program and
Action Plan in March 1992. This document outlined the problems of the proliferation of
govenment ministries, agencies, departments, and services; overstaffing in the civil service;
inadequate control over staffing and remuneration; a major imbalance between a bloated
payroll and scarce resources for operation and maintenance; and low levels of morale and
discipline within the civi service.
7.    Since the release of the Action Plan, a number of measures have been implemented,
including (i) rapid establishment and operaticnazation of a central reform agency (the Civil
Service Reform Secretariat - CSRSj to manage the reform program, along with the set-up
and induction of related organizations at the Msterial, Provincial and District levels; (ii)
rationalization of staffing and improved establishent control through tightening of
recumnt controls, payroll controls, and rapid introduction of Voluntary Early Retirement
Scheme (VERS) under which almost 6000 civil servants were retired by the end of FY94;
(iii) reduction of the civil service staff complement from 272,000 in August 1993 to
252,440 by end June 1994; (iv) initial movement on compensation refom including
establishment of a new inter-misral Task Force on Motivation; (v) movement on
rationalization of ministries including a reduction in their number from 30 to 22 in January
1993, and identification of the five ministries to be restructured during the first year of the
program, and commencement of preparatory work, and finally (vi) regarding staff
development, preparation of plans to restructure Kenya's premier civil service training
insfitution into an autonomous and financially independent body.
Project Objectives and Outcomes
S.    The projeces key objectives are as follows: (a) to achieve an overall rationalHation
of staffing and improved establishment control leading to better resource allocation,
forward planning, productivity improvements and cost-effective delivery of services; (b) to
introduce wide-ranging compensation reforms resulting in a simplified and more



-3 -
transparent grading structure, better aligned to the external markets, and with better pay
relativities; (c) to introduce better personnel management practices to obtain better
performance from existing staff and attract high quality recruits into the service; (d) to
improve opportunities for staff development through better planning and delivery of
training by the Kenya Institute of Administration (KIA) and other similar bodies; and (e) to
commence rationalization of five target Ministries to achieve quantifiable improvements
in service delivery to Kenya's citizens. Detailed policy measures to support the program are
described in the Government's Letter of Sectoral Policy, presented in Annex MI of the SAR.
9.    Expected key outcomes by the project completion include (i) reduction in staff
numbers by up to 48,000 over three years, pernitting increased spending on O&M; (ii)
introduction * f a new computerized payroll and personnel database system in the Ministry
of Finance covering the whole civil service; (iii) improvements in compensation
arrangements (including divestiture of a significant portion of the government housing
stock), personnel management practices, and tramining (including commercialization of
Kenya's premier government training institution); (iv) rationalization of five Ministries; (v)
introduction of modern performance management techniques in these five Ministries leading
directly to increased decentralization and better delivery of services tc the public; and (vi)
build-up of central and local capacity to manage Phases II and m of the Reform Program.
Project Description
10.   The project will support Phase I of the Government's Civil Service Reform Program,
which focuses on cost containment 1. The project consists of five components, each
relating directly to the objectives above. Work on the first three components (rationalization
of staffing and improved establishment control; compensation reforms, and personnel
management reform) will be led by CSRS. Work on staff development will be led by the
Manpower Development Division of the DPM, supported by Government Training
Intitutes such as the Kenya Institute of Administration (largely supported by the British
Overseas Development Administration). Work on rationalization of the five target
Miistries (which also involves elements of staffing and improved establshment control, and
personnel management reform) will be led by the Ministerial Reform Committees in each
Ministry, supported by CSRS. The major components are described below:
11.   Rationalization of Staffing and Improved Establishment Control (US$122.12
miuion, including retrenchmniet payments of $113 million from GOK and ODA) including
short-term assistance in improving the design of the Voluntary Early Retirement Scheme
(VERS), following a review of costs and benefits; short-term assistance in developing an
overall structure for establishment and payroll control to ensure staff reductions achieved
through VERS can be sustained; definition, development and introduction of a major new
Integrated Personnel & Payroll Database (IPPD) system for the entire civil service;
Phases II and III of the program deal with performance improvement and consolidation of
gains respectively, and are shown in more detail in Annex I of the SAR.



-4-
provision of a long-tern resident advisor to work at CSRS to help coordinate these
initiatives, and give additional assistance on all other project components below.
12.   Compensation Reforms (US$2.11 million) including a comprehensive review of
pay and benefits, grading, policies and procedures, and job evaluation techniques, leading to
fill implementation of an unproved structure; a detailed study on how the Government
should move away from the current practice of housing civil servants, and assistance in
achieving this; implementation of performance related pay or alternative system to improve
motivation, on a pilot basis; development and roll-out of an experimental "High Flyers
Scheme" to attract and retain high caliber staff.
13.   Personnel Management (US$0.84 million) including development of an overall
human resource strategy and training in change mamgement techniques for key groups;
review of central personnel management orgamzation and procedures, including options for
decentalization; development and introduction of a modern performance appraisal system
for both senior and junior grades.
14. Staff Development (US$4.36 million) including support to the Kenya Institute of
Aministration to help it become an efficient, autonomous provider of high quat,
demand-driven training courses. Work will include appointment of consultants to develop
the institute's new contractual relationship with Government; review its structure, course
portfolio, and range of services; assist in costing courses and improving financial
management, and attachlnents of staff to other international training institutes. There will
be limited support to the Government Training Institute at Mombasa to support training of
early retirees under the VERS. This support will be provided pending GOK's submission of
a needs assessment and a financial plan satisfiactory to IDA. In addition, the project will
support intensive specialist training programs, involving courses in Kenya and abroad, for
key staff in CSRS, DPM, the PSC and the Mnisterial Reform Committees.
15.   Rationaliation of Target Ministries (US$7.76 million) including support to
rationalization programs in the five target key ministries (Ministry of Health; Ministry of
Finance; Ministry of Lands and Settlements Ministy of Public Works and Housing; and the
Mnistry of Land Reclamation, Regional and Water Development). These Ministerial
programs will typically start with an organizational review, either startng from scratch, or
(in the case of Health) building on what has recny been done, and assisting in design and
execution of detailed implementation programs. This work wil be combined with a review
of personnel management structures and practices, including an upgrading of the personnel
management function. This will later lnk with central initiatives run by CSRS to update job
descriptions, regrade posts and introduce a new performance appraisa system  In parallel,
work will commence on improving establishment control, through building interim MIS
systems to improve monitoring of staff mnmbers, and tighting recrutment procedures to
preserve gains from the VERS. 2 This will lead into wider studies and implementation

of Financ; investnt in them will therefore be lited at this stage.

assistance on staffing norms, based on the new organizational structures. Work on
development of performance targets will follow this, amng to build an integrated system
with top-level policy objectives leading down to creation of detaied service delivery plans
Each Ministiy will also undertake between two and three Mangement Reviews of
sig!"Westut functions or units, comprising analysis of the units' performance, and
implementation of recommended changes.
Project Fiaucing
16.   Total project cost is US$156.98 milion, which includes $105.0 million from
Govemment for payments under the VERS scheme. About US$134.67 are local costs and
US$22.31 are foreign costs. The IDA credit of $25.35 million represents approxmately
16% of total project costs net of duties and taxes. The Goverment's total contritaion will
be $120.93 million. The British Government (OD)A) will provide support totaling the
equivalent of $10.7 million for a long-term advisor to CSRS, reform of KIA, and to
contribute to some of the VERS costs. A breakdown of costs and the fincing plan are
shown at Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement and disbursements, and the
disbursements schekie, are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing
events and the stats of Bank Group operations in Kenya are given in Schedules C and D,
respectively. More detailed information is provided in Staff Appraisal Report No. 13609-
KE.
Project Implementation
17. The overall management structure for implementation and supervision of the project
is shown in Table I below. The primary focus will be on existing Government staff and
structures - DPMK CSRS, the Reform Committees, and the Kenya Institute of
Admistraton. These units have already demonstrated implementation capacity in staring
to push through an aggressive timetable for the complex VERS exercise.

18.   The Executing Agency for the project will be CSRS under the Office of the
President. The CSRS is headed by a Program Director who reports to the Permanent
Secretary/Director, DPM. A National Steering Committee (composed of representatives at
the PS level from key ministries in addition to the Head of the Public Service, the PS/DPM
and the Director of CSRS) provides overall guidance to the civil service reform effort,
including activities outside the scope of the project, such as reform of the teachers' service
and local government.
19.   The British Government (ODA) has already taken actions to ensure that CSRS has
in place certain limited infasructure requirements (e.g. hardware and software). CSRS is
already hiring local and expatriate expertise with PPF financing to augment its capacity.
20.    Govenmment structures will be supplemented by use of consultants to provide
specialist skills, and additional analytical and implementation capacity. The local consulting
market is relatively well developed, and it is anticipated that local firms, to the extent
possible, commensurate with available skills will be able to bid for a significant number of
assignments. For areas where very special skills or complex project management experience



-7-
is required, international firms may be contracted, but these firms will be encouraged to
subcontract work or form partnerships with local firms 7'.;rever possible.
Project Sustainability
21.   Long-term  sustainability, and a firm foundation for Phases 2 and 3 of the
Government's reform progran, should be assisted by a number of capacity building
initiatives contained in the project. These include (i) strengthening CSRS and other Reform
Committees at Ministerial, Provincial and District levels; (ii) building improved budgeting
and establishment control systems to safeguard current gains from the VERS exercise (as
described in the Letter of Sectoral Policy and the DCA); (iii) investment in a major new
payroll system which can be further developed over the next 5 - 10 years, (iv) structural
changes in remuneration and personnel management, including divestiture of government
housing which will be difficult to reverse; (v) expediting structural changes in training
provision, creating a more commercial framework for this; and (v) detailed work at
Ministerial level to improve structures and introduce target setting, the fill value of which
will only be realized in the medium term
Lessons from Previous BanklIDA Involvement
22.   Government ownership and sponsorship of reforms is critical. Over the last three
years GOK, IDA and donors have maintained a dialogue on Civil Service Reform that has
led to the current program, supported by this proposed project. While there are no relevant
PCRs for the sector, nor operations involving the central implementing organizaion, it is
accepted that this reform program will require continued vigilance and effort. Hence, as
program design has evolved, Govemment has been required to demonstrate its commitment
through adherence to time-bound actions. As Government efforts build momentum, with
increased financial inflows from the credit, fiuther time-bound actions will act as nilestones
to measure progress. AdditionaBy, as part of the design, this credit is anticipated to support
only the first stage of the program, with further support dependent on the success of the
next three years.
Rationale for IDA Involvement
23.   This project is a central plank of IDA's country dialogue.and is consistent with the
Country Assistance Strategy statement. The Country Assistance Strategy, presented to
the Board in April 1994, set out as an objective the need to accelerate economic growth as
a precondition to reducing poverty and absorbing the roughly 500,000 new entrants in the
job market each year. The private sector is expected to be the main source of growth, with
the Government's role limited to that of providing an appropriate enabling environment,
through ensring provision of basic social services and maintenance of essental
infrastructure. To this end, the CAS identified public sector adjustment as one of the key
priority areas. This involves, inter alia, comprehensive civil service reform through
decreases in the cost of the civil service and an improvement in its efficiency. The key



-8-
aspects of this approach are set out in the Government's policy statement and would be
supported by the proposed project. The need to support the Civil Service Reform effort is
also reflected in the Policy Framework Paper for 1994-97 which will be discussed by donors
at the forthcomnng Consultative Group meeting on Kenya. IDA and other agencies
providing external support for Kenya's develor'ent have identified a set of weaknesses and
imbalances which have impeded effecti.e government services in general, and
implementation of IDA-funded and other govermnent projects in particular. Sector-specific
project measures to cope with these problems have not succeeded, as evidenced by
notoriously poor O&M of public assets, virtual grounding of field staff in line ministries,
and Kenya's laclduster disbursement rate for nearly all donor-funded projects. IDA's
lending for civil service reform will help to catalyze support from other donors for this
program, and would constitute a timely intervention in support of the current reform
momentum.
24.   Agreed Actions:  Actions, which have been completed, include Government's
submission of a Project Implementation Plan, and its submission to the Association of a
Letter of Sectoral Policy. Assurances obtained from the GOK include commitments to: (a)
allocate K Sh 1.75 billion (in constant 1994 shillings) annually in its budget for VERS; (b)
prepare semi-annual progress reports for submission to the Association; (c) carfy out ar.zual
reviews and a mid-term review of the Project in cooperation with the Association; (d)
maintain at a}l times the CSRS, NSC and the Reform Committees; (e) maintain records and
accounts and caffy out annual reviews and audit; (f) implement the agreed policy reforms
according to the Letter of Sectoral Policy; and (g) implement measures satisfactory to IDA
to ensure that positions vacated by retirees through the VERS are eliminated and canceled
from the civil service establishment. Conditions for credit effectiveness include: (a)
establishment of an adequately staffed and finctioning accounts unit within CSRS with staff
in adequate numbers and with qualifications and experience satisfactory to IDA including a
principal accounting officer to lead the unit; and (b) elimination of all posts vacated through
the VERS up to the date of credit effectiveness.
25. Environmental Assessment. The project is classified as category C, with no
adverse impact on the environment.
26.   Program Objective Categories: The program objectives that will be impacted by
this project are:
Primary:    Institutional development in the civil service.
Secondary:  Improved long term management capacity in key ministries.
27.   Participatory Approach: This project was initiated by GOK under its 1992 Action
Plan for Civil Service Reform. The NSC and CSRS defined the project objective,
deternined the key components of the project, and developed many of detailed Terms of
Reference for specific project activities. They were deeply involved in the project appraisal
missions and in the preparation of the project documents (for which a team of four from the



-9-
GOK spent about a week at Bank headquarters working with the appraisal team). In
particular, on their own initiative, they built monitoring and evaluation mechanisms into the
VERS including formal feedback from VERS beneficiaries on the training they received and
the initiation of an early actuarial assessment of the VERS safety net packages, intended to
guide potential future modifications to the scheme.
Benefits
28. The proposed project is integral to the Government's civil service refonn strategy
and complements its wider macroeconomic reforms. Specific benefits from the project
include: (a) higher productivity and more cost-effective delivery of services arising from
rationalization of staffing and better use of O&M expenditures; (b) a better motivated and
higher caliber civil service paid at nearer to market rates; (c) better deployment and
movement of staff arising from an upgraded personnel management function and improved
systems for hiring, appraising, promoting, and disciplining civil servants; (d) upgraded skdlls
arsing from improved trainng capacity, more responsive to real operational needs; (e)
increased decentralization, better organization and greater focus on the needs of the
customer arising from introduction of devolved targets and performance indicators,
commencg in five target Ministries; and (f) buildup of significant reform management
capacity at the center of Government (CSRS) and in the target Ministries, with coordinated
implementation the reforms listed above in these Ministries.
Risks
29.    The major risk associated with the project would be an unexpected weakening of
political pressure to continue with (and adequately fund) the VERS scheme, and/or to
introduce the tough establishment control initiatives needed to ensure cost containment
benefits are maintained in the future. Other components such as pay reform and Ministerial
rationalization will have controversial aspects needing considerable political impetus from
the National Steering Committee to drive them through.
30,   The main technical risks with the VERS scheme include the possibility that current
arrangements are relatively generous to some individuals, ether resulting in overspending
by Govenment and consequent restrictions on the scheme, or very high payments arousing
public dissatisfaction. The National Steering Committee will use the recommendations of
the project's Actuarial Study (already underway, financed by the PPIF) to modify the VERS
formula to ensure that the VERS is as cost effective as possible. Similarly, as the VERS
exercise proceeds, there is a significant risk that Ministries will retire needed skilled staiff
and then seek to re-employ or retain other individuals in these posts later, making the
exercise largely futile. There is also the risk of "double-dipping" by staff who leave, then
rejoin another pubic institution to obtain another package. Government is aware of these
risks and is currently launching studies under the PPF to develop practical solutions.



- 10-
31.   There are also technical risks that the major MIS development scheduled to
improve payroll and personnel control is not completed on time, or does not operate
entirely to specification. Use of standard software packages (introduced successfuly in
other developing countries) should mi'nimie these possibilities. Finally, there is the
institutonal risk that personnel or other changes weaken the ability of CSRS and other
bodies leading reform to push through initiatives. There is an associated danger that lower
level bureaucrats delberately or unconsciously frustrate implementation, particulary in the
personnel management, compensation reform, and Ministerial rationalization components.
The project contains substantial elements for traing, equipment and related items to ensure
that as far as possible support is provided to help both senior and middle level officers
perform.
32.   1 am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the Articles of Agreement
of the Association and recommend that the Executive Directors approve it.
