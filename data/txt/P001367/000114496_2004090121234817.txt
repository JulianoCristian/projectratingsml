Re:
Dutch Grant Agreement - TF 020871 (Institutional Development and 
Civil Service 
Reform Project) Amendment
Dear Sir,
We would like to refer to the Dutch Grant Agreement dated March 18, 1996 between 
Republic of Kenya and the International Development Association (the Association) as 
Administrator of Dutch funds provided by the Minister for Development Cooperation of 
the Netherlands.  The Association has received an amount of $4,440,000, which did not 
exceed the equivalent of NLG 7,327,000, from the Dutch Government for this Project.  
The Grant Agreement, however, provides the Grant in Dutch Guilders.  Since the 
Association can only disburse the Grant in the currency it was received, we propose to 
amend the Grant Agreement to substitute Guilders for US Dollars, as follows:
1.  Section 2.01 shall be amended to read as follows:  
“Section 2.01  The Administrator agrees to extend to the Grantee, on the 
terms and 
conditions set forth or referred to, a grant in an amount of four 
million four 
hundred and forty thousand United States 
Dollars ($4,440,000).” 
2.  The table in Schedule 1 to the Grant Agreement shall be amended as provided in the 
Attachment to this letter.
If you agree with the proposed amendment, please sign and date the attached 
letter and return it to us for our records.  All provisions of the Grant Agreement, as 
amended herein, shall remain in force.  The Amendment shall become effective on the 
date of your confirmation as indicated herein.
Sincerely,
Stephen Weissman
