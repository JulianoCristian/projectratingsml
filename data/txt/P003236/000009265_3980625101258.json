bringing a core network\n            of 33,500 kilometers in maintainable condition; (b) bringing\n            the condition of the road network to at least 50 percent\n            good and about 10 percent poor for all types of road; (c)\n            strengthening the technical and managerial capacity of road\n            authorities; (d) creating employment opportunities in the\n            road sector and alleviating poverty through the creation of\n            30,000 new jobs in road maintenance; (e) improving road\n            safety and reducing road accidents by at least 20 percent;\n            (f) improving environmental management in the road sector\n            through establishing procedures and guidelines; (g)\n            providing an enabling environment for improved road\n            transport services and increasing the truck and bus fleet by\n            at least 20 percent in rural areas; and (h) developing a\n            framework for the management of community roads and\n            promoting community participation in road management. The\n            project components include: civil works; community\n            accessibility program; construction industry development\n            program; institutional capacity building; and engineering services."}, "docdt": "1997-09-04T00:00:00Z"}
