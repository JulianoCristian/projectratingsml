consists of: (a) in the\n            Doukkala: enlargement of the main supply canal (29 km),\n            construction of about 6 km of feeder canal and installation\n            of automatic flow regulators; construction of 4 electric\n            pumping stations, each with an elevated equalizing\n            reservoir; construction of 50 km of 60 kv and 50 km of 22 kv\n            power transmission lines and a substation for pumping\n            stations; land preparation and consolidation; installation\n            of 416 km of a buried pipe distribution system and\n            associated mobile sprinkler equipment; excavation for main\n            drainage channels; 108 km of classified road rehabilitation\n            and 85 km construction of new classified roads; construction\n            of farm access roads and windbreaks; construction of\n            buildings and provision of equipment; construction of six\n            new milk collecting centers; (b) a bilharzia control\n            programme for the Province of El Jadida; (c) a feasibility\n            study for irrigation, water supply and power development\n            based on a dam at Dechrael-Oued; (d) a feasibility study for\n            the production, processing, and marketing of fruits and\n            vegetables in the Massa region in southern Morocco. This\n            report comprises two impact evaluation reports for Mexico an\n            Morocco, and an overview which synthesizes the findings of\n            both impact evaluations regarding the extent of, and reasons\n            for, sustainability a compares the impact of irrigation\n            systems design on project performanc striking feature of all\n            four projects is the lower agricultural and ec performance\n            than that estimated at the time of audit. Weaker commodity\n            an inadequate development approach in one project, lower\n            than expected efficiencies, insufficient attention to\n            operation and maintenance in a projects, and damage to the\n            environment and natural resources have bee main factors\n            affecting performance. However, with one exception, which\n            performed poorly, the degree of success in the transfer of\n            technology respect of both irrigation practice and\n            agricultural productivity has continued to be sustained in\n            the other three projects."}, "docdt": "1976-01-31T00:00:00Z"}
