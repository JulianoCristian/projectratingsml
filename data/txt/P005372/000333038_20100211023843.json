construction of 50 km of 60\n            kv and 50 km of 22 kv power transmission lines and a\n            substation for pumping stations; land preparation and\n            consolidation; installation of 416 km of a buried pipe\n            distribution system and associated mobile sprinkler\n            equipment; excavation for main drainage channels; 108 km of\n            classified road rehabilitation and 85 km construction of new\n            classified roads; construction of farm access roads and\n            windbreaks; construction of buildings and provision of\n            equipment; construction of six new milk collecting centers;\n            (b) a bilharzia control programme for the Province of El\n            Jadida; (c) a feasibility study for irrigation, water supply\n            and power development based on a dam at Dechrael-Oued; and\n            (d) a feasibility study for the production, processing, and\n            marketing of fruits and vegetables in the Massa region in\n            southern Morocco.

Weaker commodity an inadequate\n            development approach in one project, lower than expected\n            efficiencies, insufficient attention to operation and\n            maintenance in a projects, and damage to the environment and\n            natural resources have been main factors affecting\n            performance. However, with one exception, which performed\n            poorly, the degree of success in the transfer of technology\n            respect of both irrigation practice and agricultural\n            productivity has continued to be sustained in the other\n            three projects."}, "docdt": "1976-01-09T00:00:00Z"}
