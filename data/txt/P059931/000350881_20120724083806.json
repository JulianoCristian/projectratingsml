Management Project\n            for Indonesia were as follows: outcomes were moderately\n            satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was moderate,\n            the Bank performance was moderately satisfactory, and the\n            Borrower performance was also moderately satisfactory. Some\n            lessons learned included: institutional development and\n            reform-oriented investments in the water sector should take\n            a long-term program approach synchronized with government\n            policy reform implementation, and with flexible design which\n            can adapt to evolution of the policy environment.\n            Accordingly the project design should be kept simple and\n            realistic in terms of project targets. A participatory\n            approach in basin water resources and irrigation management\n            improves decision-making effectiveness, and enhances\n            ownership of the solutions by different stakeholders. The\n            alignment between irrigation sector reform interventions and\n            agricultural production activities of interest to\n            communities creates incentives for active involvement of\n            beneficiaries and enhances program sustainability.\n            Inter-agency collaboration and coordination proved essential\n            not only for project implementation but also for ensuring\n            project impact and sustainability, as demonstrated in the\n            integration of irrigation sector reform interventions and\n            agricultural productivity improvement, which has created\n            incentives for farmer participation and has enhanced project\n            sustainability. It's critical to retain a stable team\n            of government staff during the implementation period as a\n            high rate of staff rotation in government services resulted\n            in a continuous need to train new people and transfer\n            knowledge, thereby limiting the effectiveness of the\n            capacity-building program under the projects."}, "docdt": "2012-03-30T00:00:00Z"}
