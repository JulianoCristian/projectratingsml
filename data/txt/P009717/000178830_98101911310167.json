The\n            project components will include: (i) the provision of\n            housing for about 40 percent of agricultural extension staff\n            as well as offices and transportation to improve mobility of\n            the reorganized extension service. (ii) improvement of seven\n            existing staff training centers by the construction of\n            hostels, classrooms, additional teaching staff, equipment\n            and vehicles. (iii) the provision of staff, equipment and\n            funds for studies to evaluate and monitor project progress\n            and impact. (iv) the provision of 300 training fellowships\n            in extension work and 130 research training fellowships. (v)\n            the provision of about 15 man-months of short-term\n            consultancy visits."}, "docdt": "1977-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
