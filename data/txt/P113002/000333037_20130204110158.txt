Remarks:
1
  The procurement method is changed to Single Source Selection from Selection of Individual Consultant. The reason for selecting International Network for Participatory
Irrigation Management (INPIN) are follow:
     a) We envisioned this study being undertaken by a firm which has advantages in terms of coordination, responsibility/accountability etc compared to recruiting individual
     consultants.
    b) INPIM successfully completed a study this year for ADB under CMIASP on Multi-function WUAs entitled "Building Social Capital and Livelihood through Multifunctional
    Water Users’ Association in Nepalese Irrigation Systems". This study closely links with the proposed FMIS study. It was prepared on time and to a high (international
    publication) standard and will lead on to a successor study in 2012.
    c) INPIM-Nepal is based in DOI’s head office at Jawalakhel, Kathmandu (next door to the ADS office). INPIMN currently has around 150 members comprising a broad
    spectrum of people interested in irrigation, including professional people, students, people working in the irrigation sector and farmer representatives. It has an 11-person
    executive committee elected every 3 years and 7-member advisory board. They also have contacts in the wider irrigation and are expected to be able to recruit or appoint
    three competent specialists.

The estimated cost for all the national consultant (highlighted in yellow color) are denominated in Nepalese Currency.
