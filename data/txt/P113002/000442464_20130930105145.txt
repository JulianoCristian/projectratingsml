A. Summary of Proposed Changes
The proposed restructuring entails an extension of the Closing Date and cancellation which are critical to
enable the full implementation of pilot activities on social safety nets in Nepal. Evaluation results of the
activities will form the basis of government decision-making on key areas of improving nutritional
outcomes and safety nets for the most vulnerable. Due to the small size of the remaining allocation, it is
unlikely to affect the disbursement profile.

The following changes are proposed to reflect agreements reached during the implementation support
review in May 2013:

(i) An extension of the Closing Date from September 30, 2013 to September 30, 2014, and the related
adjustments in the implementation schedule reflecting the proposed extension;

(ii) Cancellation of SDR 3,444,000.00 (US$ 5.34 million equivalent) with cancellations detailed as
follows:

     a. SDR 550,000.00 from IDA Credit 4510
     b. SDR 1,086,000.00 from IDA Grant H424


                                                                                                Page 5 of 25
     c. SDR 1,015,000.00 from IDA Credit 4750
     d. SDR 793,000.00 from IDA Grant H579


While all the four IDA financed sources will remain open, this cancellation would leave the project with
IDA Credit 4510 and IDA Credit 4750 as financing sources for the implementation of activities during this
extension period because Grant funds would have been used. These cancellations will also be reflected in
changes to the Financing Plan and changes in Disbursement Estimates.

(iii)The addition of two new intermediate indicators in the Results Framework to measure the outcomes
under sub-component 1b - “Completion of CCF implementation as designed”, and under sub-component
1c - “Number of districts in which cash transfer beneficiaries receive at least one payment via branchless
banking”.

B. Project Status
SSNP was approved on September 30, 2008 and an Additional Financing (AF) was approved on May 26,
2010. Total International Development Association (IDA) financing is US$69.5 million, including
US$16.7 million under the original project and US$47.8 million under the AF, and an additional grant of
US$5 million provided from the Food Price Crisis Response (FPCR) Trust Fund (TF). The project was
designed to enable the Government of Nepal to improve access to nutritious food for highly food insecure
households in the short term and to create opportunities for improved agriculture production in food
insecure districts in the long run. As such, the project components focus on supporting immediate
responses through public works, medium term responses through seed and fertilizer support, longer term
responses through safety net systems and nutrition related behavior change through a Community
Challenge Fund.

The project has made good progress to date and is on track to achieve its objective. All Project
Development Objective (PDO) level indicators have been met. Progress towards the achievement of the
PDO is Satisfactory, and has been throughout the project. Other ratings have been MS or higher for the
last year, including an upgrade from Moderately Satisfactory to Satisfactory on Financial Management. In
fact, the project has improved both the quality and the timeliness of financial management reporting. The
project has no outstanding audit reports. However, currently, the third trimester Implementation Progress
Report (IPR) of FY2012/13 is overdue. Disbursement is over 80 percent of the total allocation. Since its
initiation in 2008, the project has supported over three million people across the country.

Component 1a : The Public Works sub-component is focused on the provision of the short term response
to the food insecurity in Nepal, through the provision of food/cash for work programs. It was implemented
by the Ministry of Federal Affairs and Local Development (MoFALD) with World Food Programme
(WFP). Under the Public Works Program, as of May 2012, over 34,000 metric tons (MT) of food had
been distributed and US$3.15 million has been disbursed as cash. Over 98 percent of the supported
households have reported an increased ability to meet their food needs. The sub-component has surpassed
its target of 140,000 households benefiting from assets created for agriculture production activities, as well
as its target for physical infrastructure development achieving 405 improved community water points
constructed or rehabilitated under the project against a target of 200, and 851 km of rural roads
rehabilitated against a target of 600 km. During implementation of this sub-component, the household
food consumption score was at 48, above the target of 42 for poor and food insecure households in food
insecure districts. The food consumption score is a composite score based on dietary diversity, food
frequency, and relative nutritional importance of different food groups. This sub-component is completed
and no additional funds are required, aside from those expenditures which have been made but not yet
claimed.

Component 1b: The Community Challenge Fund (CCF) sub-component is a pilot through which
performance grants are provided to community organizations for the purpose of improving maternal and
young child nutrition. While progress has been slower than expected under this sub-component, this was
largely due to delays in the release of the Government budget in the last fiscal year. The budget release has
now taken place. Further, all necessary preparation work for the CCF is being carried out in partnership
with the Poverty Alleviation Fund (PAF). Implementation is expected to be completed by September 30,
2014 which is why the extension is required. The Memorandum of Agreement between PAF and

MoFALD has been signed, the evaluation has been designed and baseline information collection is
underway.

Component 1c: The Strengthening Safety Net Systems sub-component focuses on strengthening the
MoFALD’s safety net systems, particularly in establishing a Management Information System (MIS), a
grievance redress mechanism and branchless banking payment system for the cash transfers. Progress has
also been made on the activities that support systems strengthening for cash transfers. The MoFALD has
approved an implementation design of the key activities under this sub-component which will be
implemented over the course of one year in 12 districts and will include: (i) piloting of electronic payments
(in six districts), (ii) the development and implementation of a Management Information System, and (iii)
institutional strengthening which includes training and capacity development of the staff responsible for
implementation of the cash transfers at the national and district levels, as well as the computers, hardware,
and back-up systems needed for the improved implementation. This support is expected to improve the
efficiency and targeting of Government cash transfers. The MIS firm has completed the development of
the MIS system and the MoFALD has already agreed with the Asian Development Bank to roll out the
MIS in 15 districts; discussions are underway with Department for International Development (UK) to do
the same in an additional two districts. The MIS is also being rolled out in two other districts using
funding from another Bank-financed source - Rapid Social Response funding.

Component 2: Support to Seeds and Fertilizer is aimed at improving provision of seeds, farmer’s use of
fertilizers and technical assistance to the Ministry of Agriculture. Since 2010, under support for this
component, the Nepal Agricultural Research Council (NARC) has produced over 129.38 MTs of breeder
seeds and 1,654 MTs of foundation seeds, including crop varieties that are better suited to food insecure
areas. A total of 11,213.9 MTs of fertilizer and 782.7 MTs of seeds of improved varieties of paddy, wheat,
and maize have been made available in remote districts. The Component has met its planned objectives
and targets and therefore no further activities or additional funds are required, aside from those
expenditures which have been made but not yet claimed.

Component 3: Project Coordination and Monitoring and Evaluation component is aimed at improving the
project’s coordination as well as monitoring and evaluation. Activities completed include capacity building
of MoFALD staff in a Monitoring and Evaluation Training and preparation of monitoring reports for the
ministry and the World Bank. During the extension period, several activities are planned, as detailed below
in the “cancellation section”.

Change in Project's Development Objectives
Change in Results Framework

Explanation:
Revision to the Results Framework is limited to the addition of two intermediate indicators. These
indicators are being added in order to reflect the results of the Community Challenge Fund (sub-
component 1b) and the Strengthening Safety Net Systems subcomponent (sub-component 1c) as these are
the main pieces being implemented during the proposed extension period. The intermediate results for the
project components are proposed to be revised as follows:

For the Community Challenge Fund (sub-component 1b), the indicator being added is “Completion of
CCF implementation as designed”. This will allow the project to gauge the implementation under this sub-
component. The baseline at this stage is 0, as the implementation has just begun this fiscal year, and no
households have benefited yet from the Community Challenge Fund. Due to the rigorous monitoring by
the project and the additional monitoring for the impact evaluation, the Poverty Alleviation Fund (PAF),
which is implementing this sub-component, collects the information on households benefiting from the
pilot every three months.

For the Strengthening Safety Nets Systems (sub-component 1c) the indicator being added is “Number of
districts in which cash transfer beneficiaries receive at least one payment via branchless banking”. This
indicator would help monitor payments via branchless banking and effective establishment and use of the
MIS for the cash transfers, which are the two key activities being implemented under this sub-component.
The data for this indicator will come from the implementing agency, the MoFALD, to whom the banks
implementing the branchless banking will provide this information three times a year, as per the payment
cycle of the cash transfers. The MIS will also track this information. To date, no cash transfers
beneficiaries in Nepal receive payments through branchless banking, establishing a baseline of 0. The
project intends to establish this system in six districts across the country.


                                                Financing
Change in Loan Closing Date(s)
Explanation:

The Closing Date would be extended by one year until September 30, 2014 per the Government request
dated September 25, 2012. This will enable the MoFALD to complete the establishment and
implementation of the MIS for the cash transfer programs and to pilot the payments through branchless
banking for a full cycle (i.e. one fiscal year). The MoFALD had prioritized the emergency activities (food
related) in the first few years of the project and started the implementation of the cash transfers component
more recently. Without the extension, the MIS would only be established in the Ministry and not in the 12
districts as intended by the project. Additionally, the use of the MIS for the full intent of planning and
monitoring can only be properly done if the MIS is used at the different implementing levels and different
phases, i.e. planning, implementing and monitoring of the program. The lack of a MIS was highlighted by



                                                                                                Page 9 of 25
the National Planning Commission in their 2012 review of the cash transfers system. The creation of a
MIS is a key method to improve efficiency and remove potential ghost beneficiaries. The MoFALD has
already agreed with the Asian Development Bank that in an additional 15 districts, the same MIS will be
rolled out, and discussion is underway with DFID to ensure the same in an additional two districts. The
MoFALD has begun planning how to roll out the use of the MIS nationwide.

The proposed extension of the Closing Date would allow the branchless banking pilot to make more than
just one payment through the branchless banking mechanism. One payment through a new modality is
insufficient to learn from or gather robust information on the results and impact of systematizing this
modality. The MoFALD cash transfer is made three times a year. In addition, the constant change of
modality of payments can be confusing to the beneficiaries. Lessons and documentation of this experience
are critical for the MoFALD’s national plans to improve the efficiency of cash transfer programs in Nepal.
Expansion across the country to areas where infrastructure allows branchless banking is under discussion
within MoFALD, as this is the logical next step to their move to a system of bank based payments in
municipalities, which they have been implementing for the last two years.

The extension of the Closing Date will also allow completion of the implementation of the Community
Challenge Fund (sub-component 1b) which was delayed by the late release of the Government budget last
fiscal year. Since then, the budget has been released and the Government now has a revised
implementation plan to ensure implementation acceleration. Although Nepal has made significant
progress towards attaining the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) in child nutrition, stunting and
wasting still affect large numbers of the under-five population. Chronic under nutrition, which manifests as
stunting, affects 42 percent of children under- five years of age according to the Nepal Living Standards
Survey 2011. The under-five rate of wasting, which reflects acute under nutrition, has changed little over
the last decade and currently stands at about 14 percent. The completion of this innovative pilot will
support the learning in Nepal as well as the broader regional and global learning in how to improve the
nutritional status of children in their first 1000 days.

Cancellations
Explanation:



                                                                                             Page 10 of 25
The proposed cancellation totals SDR 3,444,000.00 (estimated to be equivalent to US$ 5.34 million)
detailed as follows:
      a. SDR 550,000.00 from IDA Credit 4510
      b. SDR 1,086,000.00 from IDA Grant H424
      c. SDR 1,015,000.00 from IDA Credit 4750
      d. SDR 793,000.00 from IDA Grant H579

The cancellation reflects the Government request, dated July 21, 2013, to cancel US$5.3 million and to
retain funds necessary in those activities which still need to be completed during the proposed extension
period, as discussed above for the proposed adjustments include:

The proposed allocations for Components 1a and Component 2 reflect funds needed to cover expenditures
already made but yet unclaimed.

Credit allocation for Community Challenge Fund (component 1b) is being reduced by SDR 0.5 million,
from the original allocation of SDR1.65 million, which reflects the total amounts that are required for the
completion of this activity. As such, although it was envisaged that the costs of the evaluation of the CCF
would be funded by the project, these project funds are no longer required. The difference in the total
allocation from the original reflects Additional grant funds which became available from the South Asia
Food And Security Nutrition Initiative (SAFANSI) to support the design of the evaluation, and from the
Strategic Implementation Evaluation Fund (SIEF) to support the evaluation.

The allocation for the Strengthening Safety Net Systems (sub-component 1c) and for the Project
Coordination, Monitoring and Evaluation (Component 3) is SDR 3.85 million. This is being reduced by
SDR 0.55 million bringing it SDR 3.33 million.

With the project activities now focused only on two sub-components during the extension period
(Community Challenge Fund and Strengthening Safety Nets Systems), there is less to coordinate and
therefore costs under this component are reduced. Under Component 3, during the extension period,
specific activities include the review of changes made in the Public Works Program to make it gender
friendly and a beneficiary assessment of the Strengthening Safety Nets Systems activities as well as some
activities to support implementation and monitoring capacity.

This has gained importance with the release of National
Planning Commission's report citing leakages and
inefficiencies as well as media reports of anecdotal cases
of leakage. As such public perception of the project is
also positive.
Donors active in social protection, through the Social
Protection task team are also supportive of the objectives
of the project.
The DDC and VDC staff, particularly VDC secretaries,
may have an interest in ensuring the project is stalled as
they could perceive the development of MIS to manage
and monitor beneficiaries and payment of cash through
banks as a threat to their opportunities to gain from the
cash transfers.

The implementation of component 1a continues under
government's own funding as well as WFP support.
Implementation of most activities under component 2 are
continuing through government and other WB supported
projects. The component 1c helps start up systems and
piloting delivery via branch less banking. The government
has already planned to scale up these activities across the
country, including a request for possible support from
WB. The component 1b is a pilot with an impact
evaluation which will determine whether there is a need to
sustain activities or learnings.

While the country and fraud and corruption ratings are high and substantial, all other risk ratings are low to moderate. The design of one of the
components of the project seeks to address the fraud and corruption inherent in the cash transfer system, and helps to mitigate it. In addition, the
commitment and ownership of the implementing agency is high. As such the overall implementation risk is rated moderate.
