Nepal were as follows: outcomes were moderately\n            satisfactory, risk to development outcome was substantial,\n            Bank performance was satisfactory, and Borrower performance\n            was moderately satisfactory. Some of the lessons learned\n            included: budgetary top-up to existing government programs\n            can be an expedient way to scale up emergency support. An\n            emergency operation can create opportunities for medium- to\n            longer-term policy dialogue and more sustained engagement on\n            institutional development, especially if the project\n            performs well and justifies continued support either through\n            additional financing or follow-on operations. Opportunistic\n            inclusion of related activities can be beneficial for the\n            purpose of experimentation and for opening new areas of\n            policy dialogue and operational engagements. If combined\n            with significant investments in dialogue by the Bank,\n            successful demonstrations through such opportunistic\n            activities can contribute to building government ownership\n            as has been the case with the sub-component 1c."}, "docdt": "2015-03-27T00:30:02Z"}
