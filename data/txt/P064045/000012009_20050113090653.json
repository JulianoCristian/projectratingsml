Despite a satisfactory performance\n            by the Bank, the Borrower performance is rated\n            unsatisfactory. Lessons reinforce the critical aspect of\n            ownership and government commitment, particularly in a\n            difficult political environment, where the Bank should have\n            as of the early stages, realistically underlined the risks,\n            and potential mitigation of this technical assistance loan\n            (TAL) operation. Given the political factors, a TAL on its\n            own does not offer enough monetary leverage, or political\n            cover to encourage tough legal reforms, or institutional\n            changes. Thus the parallel Structural Adjustment Loan (SAL)\n            could have been used more effectively to mitigate risks for\n            this project, particularly in relation to the governance of\n            the deposit guarantee agency -AGD. And yet, reliance on\n            parallel budgetary support loans in crisis periods, can lead\n            to unexpected risks, namely that conditions (including those\n            agreed with partner international financial institutions)\n            may be waived, with an impact on the TAL. Nonetheless, while\n            not a guarantee of total success, it helped that\n            multilateral donors maintained on-going coordination and\n            consulted each other in developing a unified framework for\n            financial crisis resolution with the Government, within\n            which the project contributed positively."}, "docdt": "2004-12-29T00:00:00Z"}
