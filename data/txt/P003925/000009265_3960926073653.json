resources specifically for improving operations\n            within the Bank Rakyat Indonesia (BRI) and Kredit Umum\n            Pedesan (KUPEDES).  To this end, the project comprises two\n            components consisting of credit and technical assistance.\n            The credit aspect of the project provides for general\n            purpose financing in all sectors while the technical\n            assistance element seeks to enable BRI to (i) develop its\n            capacity to design, implement and analyze studies for\n            monitoring and evaluation and (ii) improve the capability of\n            BRI's field auditors and supervisory staff.  This\n            project allows the Bank to express its support for a small\n            credit scheme oriented towards the lower economic level of\n            society, within the context of a financially viable operation."}, "docdt": "1987-04-07T00:00:00Z"}
