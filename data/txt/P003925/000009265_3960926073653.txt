INDONESIA
BRI/KUPEDES SMALL CREDIT PROJECT
Loan and Project Suwary
Borrower:          Republic of Indonesia
Beneficiary:       Bank Rakyat Indoneria (BRI)
Amount:            US$101.5 million equivalent
Terms:             Twenty years, including five years of grace, at the standard
variable interest rate
Relending
Terms:          The proceeds of the loan would be onlenL to BRI for a 20-
year term, including five years of grace, at a variable
interest rate equal to the average cost of BRI's customer
deposits (excluding noninterest-bearing deposits from G0I or
OI-owned entities). BRI would also pay commitment fees
equal to those under the loan. The Government would assume
the foreign exchange risk and onlend the rupiah equivalent
of the loan to BRI.  Subborrowers would pay a fixed interest
rate of 1.0% per month for loans for investment purposes and
1.5% per month for loans for working capital purposes,
calculated orn the original subloan amount.
Project
Description:    The project has the specific objectives oft  (a) supporting
BRI's efforts to esvelop the Unit Desa (sub-branch) system
into a financially viable network that is able to provide
credit on a nonsubsidized basis to all creditworthy small
borrowers, to molilize savings and to provide other banking
services; (b, facouraging BRI to improve its resource
mobilization efforts so that it could eventually fund
KUPEDES loans out of deposits it raises (KUPEDES is a small
credit program operated by BRI through the Unit Desa
system); (c) reducing BRI's reliance on SI liquidity credits
for the KUPEDES program; and (d) improving the overall
institutional :apability of BRI as well as for the KUPEDES
program.
The project consists of two components: (a) a credit
component for general purpose financing in all sectors. A
total of US$100.0 million of the proposed Bank loan would be
for KUPEDES lending so as to eliminate BRI's reliance on
Bank Indonesia (BI) liquidity credits and to enable such
scarce resources to be used for other priority development
projects given Indonesia's severe financial constraints; and



- iv -
(b) a technical assistance component to assist B31 in
improving its institutional capability as it relates to the
KEPEDES program. A total of US$1.5 million of the proposed
Bank loan would complement an ongoing USAID technical
assistance package (US$10.0 million).
The project provides support to a market rate-based credit
scheme designed to meet the needs of small borrowers. The
major project risks are a deterioration in the KUPEDES loan
portfolio and bureaucratization of the credit procets (e.g.,
introduction of lending targets). Being conscious of these
risks, BRI is taking concrete steps towards developing a
comprehensive training prograw for staff and is instituting
improvements in internal controls and monitoring of Unit
Desa performance.

INDONESIA
BRI/KUPEDES SMALL CREDIT PROJECT
I. SECTORAL ASPECTS
1.1       Background.  Indonesia's economic performance has been seriously
affected by the weakness in the oil market since 1982 and particularly by the
precipitous decline in oil prices in 1986. Net oil/LNG export earnings fell
from an estimated $6 billion in 1985/86 to about $2 billion in 1986/87. The
overall terms of trade declined by about 35% durin; the year. These develop-
mnts led the Government of Indonesia (GOI) to implement a comprehensive set
of measures to stabilize the economy. It adopted an austere budget for
1986/87, reduced the development expenditure budget by 24Z, and introduced a
number of steps to liberalize the trade regime and to spur nonoil export
growth. On September 12, 1986, GOI also devalued the rupiah bv 31% (IMF
method) and has since initiated steps to contain the concomita.it impact which
such a devaluation would otherwise have on inflation. Further, the recently
announced budget for 1987/88 is also very austere.
1.2       Indonesia's medium-term prospects are likely to continue to be con-
strained by balance of payments difficulties. The need to raise more
resources domestically, and to enhance the efficiency of the utilization of
scarce resources, therefore becomes more acute. Improvement in the financial
intermeliation process is an essential element in the effort to increase the
mobilization of domestic savings and to enhance the effic.ency of resource
use, This is a challenging task, yarticularly in a large. country like
Indonesia where the rural sector - represents some 80% of the total
population, 50% of the gross domestic product (GDP) and nearly 60% of total
employment. The proposed project provides support to GOI in meeting this
challenge.
A. The Financial Sector
Level of Development and Scope for Financial Deepening
1.3       The Indonesian financial system is still at an early stage of devel-
opment. The ratio of broad money to GNP is about 19.5%, low compared to those
in Malaysia (58.51), Thailand (50.6%) and Korea (35.2%). The share of time
and savings deposits to total deposits is about 66%, significantly less than
in Malaysia (80.91), Thailand (93.8%) and Korea (81.3%). Long-term financial
assets in Indonesia are less than 10% of total assets. Access to banking
institutions is limited, particularly in rural areas. There is, therefore,
1/   For the sake of convenience the definition of "rural" throughout this
report includes provincial towns and cities. Although they might other-
wise be considered "urban" they are included because of the underdevel-
oped nature of financial institutions at this level.



-2-
considerable scope for increasing financial savings and improving financial
intermediation.
1.4       Expenditure surveys and related data show a high savings propensity
(about 20% of household income) in rural areas, with savings concentrated in
the top income quartile. Despite this, financial savings are low. As a
result of the low level of financial development, rural households often hold
their savings in nonfinancial assets, ranging from paddy stocks to jewelry to
land. Limited access to banking institutions has been one main reason limit-
ing the amount of finance that enters the formal financial system.
Institutional Framework
1.5       The Indonesian financial sector comprises a banking system with the
Central Bank, Bank Indonesia (BI), at the apex, five state-owned commercial
banks, 79 private national commercial banks, 10 foreign banks, a state devel-
opuent bank (Bank Pembangunan Indonesia--BAPINDO), 26 regional development
banks (RDBs) and three nonbank financial institutions principally engaged in
medium- and long-term lending and equity participation. A capital market has
also begun to develop. It remains very small and only a few companies have
gone public. There is little activity in bonds.
1.6       BI has played a particularly important role in Indonesia's financial
system, far exceeding that of most other central banks. In addition to normal
central banking functions, BI has traditionally lent directly to public
enterprises for certain large-scale investments and indirectly to priority
economic sectors through special rediscount facilities ("liquidity credits"),
which are funded out of nLew money and government deposits. BI has been the
primary source of funds for the private sector (particularly for small-scale
borrowers), providing 30% of 'he total private sector credit and nearly 60% of
long-term private sector credit. As a result of the ongoing financial sector
reforms (paras. 1.11-1.15), in the long run BI is expected to concentrate on
its central banking functions, particularly in the areas of financial and
monetary policy formulation and bank supervision, with a smaller role relative
to what it has done so far in direct banking activities.
1.7       The five state commercial banks,2/ one of which is Bank Rakyat
Indonesia (BRI), the beneficiary of the proposed Bank loan, dominate the com-
mercial banking system. They control almost 40% of total bank assets (BI
accounts for 42%) and for about 70% of the total assets of the deposit money
banks. The original mandate of these banks called for sectoral specializa-
tion. In practice, the diversification of GOI-sponsored official development
and credit programs, funded out of BI liquidity credits and for which these
banks have been the major channels, have blurred sectoral distinctions. It is
2/   These are Bank Dagang Negara (BDN), Bank Negara Indonesia 1946 (BNI
1946), Bank Rakyat Indonesia (BRI), Bank Ekspor Impor International
(BEII) and Bank Bumi Daya (BBD). BDN, BNI 1946 and BRI are participating
in the Bank's Export Development Project--Ln. 2'02-IND (President's
Report No. P-4308-IND).



-3-
expected that, in future, the subsidy-based, official development credit
programs funded out of liquidity credits will constitute a smaller proportion
of these banks' activity. Thia trend was hastened by the 1983 financial sec-
tor reforms (para. 1.11). Since then, the state banks have become much more
active in resource mobilization, with time deposits increasing from Rp 2.1
trillion in 1983 to Rp 5.2 trillion at the end of 1985. One of the state
banks' greatest challenges is to reduce thuir costs of financial
intermediation which average around 7% of total assets. These relatively high
costs are due to overstaffing, large loan losses, the large number of small
loans and a low degree of automation. Most of the banks are now implementing
action plans to modernize their organization, information and accounting
systems, and to increase efficiency.
1.8       Private banks represent the fastest growing segment of deposit money
banks, having aggressively expanded their share of total bank credits from
about 10X at the end of 1983 to approximately 20% by June 1986. They also
account for almost 30% of all time and savings deposits. Despit. their rapid
growth and profitability, the private banks tend to concentrate on short-term
working capital loans to major clients, and still operate almost exclusively
in urban areas.
1.9       In addition to BAPINDO and the three national nonbank term lending
institutions, there are the RDBs which, alLhough designated as development
banks, have concentrated on providing commercial banking services and
treasury-type functions to regional governments. The quality of these banks
varies widely. In general, they require considerable strengtheuing to enable
them to play a greater role in meeting the demand for financial services in
their respective regions.
1.10      There are also a multitude of secondary banks (including four
private and one state-owned savings banks), 156 market banks, over 3,500
village banks, over 2,000 paddy banks and many other semifQrmal financial
institutions. Although their role at the national level is almost negligible
in terms of resources mobilized, their impact on the specific communities in
which they operate is very significant.
Financial Sector Reforms and Subsequent Developments
1.11      Until June 1983, the financial system was tightly controlled by the
authorities with GOI channelling its financial savings into the banking system
through low-interest, BI liquidity credits in pursuit of a variety of develop-
ment objectives. BI set the deposit and lending rates of state banks, estab-
lished credit ceilings for all banks, and guided the allocation of credit
through the liquidity credit mechanism. In June 1983, GOI introduced a major
reform of the financial sector aimed at opening up the economy through stimu-
lating private financial savings, improving resource allocation and red-icing
the dependence of the banking system on BI liquidity credits. The state banks
were thus free to set their deposit rates; credit ceilings were eliminated for
all banks. In addition, the number of special priority programs qualifying
for (and the state banks' access to) new BI liquidity credits was substanti-
ally reduced. Subsequently, direct BI intervention in the day-to-day
operation of the state banks 'las reduced significantly and its direct lending



-4-
to q4asi-governmental bodies and state-owned enterprises was replaced by
lending through the state banks. As a result Qf the dcregulation, BI was
required to replace quantitative gui4elines with market tools for exerting
monetary control.
1.12      These reforms had dramatic impact on the banking system.  Nominal
interest rates on deposits paid by the state banks increased from a range of
6-122 to a range of 16-18%. There was a rapid rise in state banks' deposits,
particularly time deposits. Rupiah time deposits, which had grown at about
40% annually between June 1981 and June 1983, leaped by 80% in the year
following liberalization. There was also a shortening of the maturity
structure of rupiah time deposits, reflecting the narrowing of interest rate
differentials among various deposit categories and heightened expectations of
devaluation risk. The proportion of deposits with maturities of less than 24
months increased sharply, from 59% of total time deposits at the end of 1982,
to 93% at the end of 1984, to 93.4% in February 1986. Given these changes in
the cost and structure of funding, the lending rates of state banks also
increased and the availability of nonpriority (i.e., non-BI liquidity credit
funded) term loans was drastically curtailed. The nominal lending rates of
state banks on nonpriority loans rose from about 13% to around 18% for term
l-ns and 21% to 24% fo.- workiif capital, representing real interest rates
ranging from around 9% to 15Z.3   To some extent, these rates also reflected
the relatively high intermediation costs of state banks. With the removal of
credit ceilings, private banks have increased their share of bank credit
(para. 1.8) and an active money market has emerged.
1.13      Since June 1983, GOI has also undertaken a number of other measures
to promote further the development of an efficient financial system. Thus, in
1984, as part of the thrust to reduce credit subsidies, it encouraged BRI to
develop the Kredit Umum Pedesan (KUPEDES--Village Credit) program, on a market
rate-basis, to replace the subsidized BIMAS credit program and extend the
availability of credit to all small borrowers in rural areas. GOI also
encouraged BRI to place more emphasis on savings mobilization in these areas.
1.14      More recently, GOI has taken a number of steps to improve corporate
access to the capital market, particularly by enlarging the list of firms
eligible to float securities in the market. In addition, COI is now preparing
legislation to update the legal framework covering the operation of pension
funds, insurance and banking.
1.15      These changes have been beneficial to the development of the
financial system, although a number of concerns have emerged. These issues,
and possible strategies to deg} with them, form the main focus of the Bank's
1985 Financial Sector Report._   The most important issue is the adverse
3/   Inflation in Indonesia averaged about 9% for the period 1983-1986.

impact of the increased cost and limited availability of term funds on invest-
ment activity. To address this concern, GOI's strategy is to encourage compe-
tition in the financial system in order to lower intermediation costs, and to
strengthen the balance of payments position by liberalizing the trade
regime. Because of the open capital account, domestic interest rates are not
only determined by international interect rates and domestic inflation but
also by exchange rate expectations.   A stronger balance of payments position
would reduce the speculative premium needed to hold rupiah assets and thus
should lead to lower interest rates. Other issues dealt with in the Financial
Sector Report include the need to improve the efficiency of the state banks
and to lower their administrative costs, particularly by making them more
market oriented, and the need to increase domestic resource mobilization.
B. Small-Scale Enterprises and Rural Activities
1.16      Host small-scale economic activities in Indonesia, particularly in
rural areas, are undertaken as individual or family enterprises without the
use of hired labor, with the family shifting its labour and working capital
among various activities to take advantage of opportunities available. Apart
from agricultural production, these activities include the processing and
marketing of agricultural produce, trade, cottage level industries, and work
in private or public construction.
1.17      The most recent data indicate that the total number of small anter-
prises, including those engaged in farming, fisheries, forestry and livestock,
exceeds 27 million. Most are small, are located in rural areas and employ an
average of fewer than two persons, often family members. Over a quarter of
the labor force is self-employed. Small enterprises probably accouint for
about 75Z of total employment in Indonesia, with the majority being engaged in
agricultural and trading activities. Small farms produce the bulk of staple
food output and a significant proportion of export crops such as rubber,
coffee and pepper. In manufacturing, the contribution of small entrepreneurs
is greatest in domestic resource-based industries, such as rice milling,
bakery products and furniture. Much of the road transport is carried out by
individual private operators. In construction, most projects are also under-
taken by small enterpreneurs. Small wholesale and retail traders are essen-
tial intermediaries between producers and consumers, financing and holding
stocks of raw materials and finished products. A number of surveys also
4.ndicate that small traders have beer. an important source of informal credit
in rural areas to farmers who have limited access to formal credit.
1.18      Credit for Small Borrowers.  Financial services outside the large
cities, especially those for small credit and small savings, are provided by a
variety of formal, semiformal and informal financial intermediaries. In
general, the formal intermediaries can be classified as follows:

1.19      At the lowest level (by loan amount) are the Badan Kredit Kecamatan
(BKK). Each BKK is an independent village credit institution that is locally
administered and financially autonomous, operating under the iuspices of the
provincial government. The BKKs were started in 1972 in Central Java and have
since been replicated in some other areas. The main characteristics of BKK
credit operations are: little paperwork, no collateral, and reliance on local
social pressure for repayment; a post system operating at village markets, which
compensates for the limited mobility of most villagers; and the willingness of
borrowers to pay the high interest rates necessary to cover the costs of such a
program. BKK loans are very small and finance mostly market traders. Savings
facilities are usually available only to borrowers. The results of the BKK
program to date indicate a productive use of assets, a relatively low level of
loan delinquency, and an overall level of profit sufficient to enable the pro-
gram to be financially viable.
1.20      At the higher level are two BI programs:  the Kredit Investasi Kecil
(KIK--small invebtment credit) and the Kredit Modal Kerja Permanen (KMKP--small
working capital credit).  P e Bank has provided a total of $350.65 million in
support of these programs.-   The KIK/KMKP programs are subsidized by GOI

through low interest rate funding and liberal insurance provision to the
handling banks.  The interest rate to final borrowers on KIK/KHRP loans is 12%
p.a. Both programs have as objectives the promotion of small-scale enterprises
(SSEs) and more equitable income distribution. KIK/KHKP loans are available
through the full service branches of state and of some private banks which are
usually located at the district level. As such, KIK/KHKP loans are not readily
available to many rural borrowers given the long average distance to the nearest
full-service branch. Also, there is an effective mir.imum loan size of Rp 2 mil-
lion. The upper 'Limit is Rp 30 million.
1.21      Although the KIK/KMKP programs have had a positive iyyact in terms of
value added and employment creation, the costs have been ;iigh.-   Because of the
emphadis by the authorities on achieving a high level of disbursement, and the
extent of insurance coverage provided by GOI through PT Asuransi Kredit
Indonesia (ASKRINDO--the state-owned credit insurance company), the handling
banks (HBs) did not, in general, apply rigorous creditworthiness criteria for
their selection of clients and, once the loans ran into difficulties, did not
have sufficient inc etives to institute systematic and aggressive loan
collection efforts.- The low spread accruing to the HBs also meant that HBs
had little intrinsic financial interest in the KIK/KMKP programs. For the same
reasons, following the 1983 reforms when BI slackened its pressure for a sus-
tained high level of lending, both new approvals (net of refinancings) and loans
outstanding stagnated. The Bank, as part of its supervision effort on SEDP III
and its ongoing dialogue with GOt on financial sector issues, has been urging a
revision of the major parameters of the KIK/KMKP programs, in particular,
increasing or.'ending interest rates and modifying credit insurance provisions,
on which GOI has not acted. In the interim, the Bank should support other more
economically viable programs for small borrowers, such as the KUPEDES program
(para. 1.22).
1.22      The KUPEDES credit program initiated by BRI in 1984 is the most
important nationwide scheme for small credit below the KIK/KMKP programs. It is
operated through some 2,500 Unit Desas (subdistrict based sub-branches) of BRI
and bridges the gap between the services provided by the BKK and the KIK/KMKP
programs. The parameters of the Unit Desa system are established at the lower
end by KUPEDES' minimum loan size, collateral and paperwork requirements, which
exceed those of the BKK, and the distance from many villages to the subdistrict-
based Unit Desa. At the upper end, KUPEDES is separated from the KIK/KMKP level
by the long distances to the district level based bank branches which make
7/   The subsidy cost of the KIK/KMKP program for 1985 has been estimated by
the Bank at US$231.4 million. The largest element of this cost was
$150.0 million to cover ASKRIND) insurance claims relating to nonpayment
of loans.
8/ Survey evidence suggests that the program was seen by the HBs as a "BI"
program with participation being mandatory and justified on the basis of
its "developmental mission" rather than as a program that would be
inherently attractive to them. On the borrowers' side, there is evidence
that the program was perceived as one with an associated "grant" element.

KIK/KMKP loans, the good service records of the Unit Desas and the effective
minimum loan size for the KIK/KMRP loans. The market for KUPEDES loans is
clearly defined and does not overlap with that of the subsidy-based KIK/KMKP
programs (para. 1.20). In addition, the countrywide coverage of the Unit Desa
system and the large asset base 'of BRI mean that there is a tremendous untapped
potential for savings mobilization offered by this network at the small saver
level. The system also has potential for developing other banking services,
e.g., cash transfers and other savings instruments. Moreover, KUPEDES loan
interest rates are not subsidized, and are set at a level to cover intermedia-
tion costs and to yield a profit. Experience to date shows that loan collec-
tions under KUPEDES are good and that the savings mobilization efforts have been
successful. As of June 30, 1986, there were slightly more than 1.1 million
borrowers in the KUPEDES program. About 25% were engaged in agriculture, 2X in
small industry, 72% in trade and processing, with 1% in other activities. These
categories, however, are not necessarily representative of loan utilization
since KUPEDES is a general purpose lending activity. Section IIB of this report
describes in detail the development and characteristics of BRI's Unit Desa
system.
C. Bank Objectives, Strategy and Role in the Financial Sector
1.23      The Bank has been assisting GOI in its effort to modernize the economy
and position it for long-term growth. The Bank is also supportive of government
policies and programs aimed at promoting improvements in income distribution and
poverty alleviation. Within this broader framework, the Bank objectives in the
financial sector are to support reforms aimed at increasing resource
mobilization and improving resource allocation. These objectives have been
pursued through a continuing dialogue on macroeconomic and sectoral issues, as
well as through support to specific projects and concomitant policy measures.
The proposed project supports a market-based credit program, which also actively
promotes savings mobilization, and provides institution-building assistance to
BRI.
1.24      A major thrust of the Bank's recent involvement in the financial
sector has been through economic and sector work. The 1985 Financial Sector
Report outlines the follow-up needed to complement the 1983 financial sector
reforms, particularly, a further reduction in the scope and extent of the
subsidized BI liquidity credits and an increase in the efficiency of the state
banks to reduce intermediation costs. The design of the proposed project is
consistent with these recommendations in that it envisages the phasing out of BI
liquidity credits for the KUPEDES program and complements efforts already under-
way, within the context of the SEDP III Project and an ongoing USAID TA project,
for improving the efficiency of BRI. Complementary to the proposed project, the
Bank has initiated a stuly of the numerous rural and agricultural credit schemes
(most of which are subsidized by GOI) and related institutions to see how they
could be rationalized, and what measures are necessary to improve resource
mobilization and allocation in the rural sector.
1.25      To date, the Bank Group has provided a total of $837.6 million in 13
operations far fi;aancing investment through financial intermediaries. These
comprise seven DFI loans/credits, six to BAPINDO ($367.4 million) and two 'o the



- 9 -
Private Development Finance Company of Indonesia (PDFCI - $25.0 million), three
loans/credits for small enterprise development ($350.7 million), one credit for
rural credit ($30.0 million) and one loan for the development of the export
sector ($64.5 million).
1.26      The success in meeting the objectives of the Bank's lending operations
in the sector has been mixed. The most recent Project Performance Audit Report
(PPAR) No. 6403, covering the Bank Group's relationship with BAPINDO over the
period 1979-83, noted that while BAPINDO has made some progress in terms of
institutional development, this fell short of mutual expectations and BAPINDO
continues to face substantial problems. The PPAR made a number of recommenda-
tions for improvements. BAPINDO is now undertaking a comprehensive portfolio
review, undertaking a comprehensive reorganization, and strengthening its
capital base through an infusion of equity from GOI. PPAR No. 3862, on the
PDFCI project (Ln. 1363-IND), found that while the loan proceeds were
transferred to sound industrial projects, performance on the broader
institutional and policy goals was disappointing, largely because of the
restrictive overall policy environment in the financial sector prior to the 1983
reforms.
1.27      The three Small Enterprise Development Projects (SEDP--Cr. 785-IND,
Ln. 2011-IND and Ln. 2430-IND) have substantially been completed. These
projects appear to have had a positive impact on employment (at $2,750 of
capital investment per fulltime job) and income distribution. Their costs,
however, have been very high, largely due to a substantial subsidy element
(para. 1.21). While GOI has not yet responded to the Bank's advice on changing
the parameters of the KIK/KMKP programs in order to lower the subsidy cost
involved, it has supportea the KUPEDES program which is free from the
distortions affecting KIK/KMKP.
1.28      The lessons learned from these operations will be helpful to the
Bank's further involvement in the sector. Thus, under the proposed project,
funds will be onlent at market rates that will allow the intermediary to earn a
profit if it can maintain sound portfolio quality. Also, there is no targetting
of borrowers which could distort the basis for credit decisions by the
operational staff of BRI involved in the lending process.

II. PRESENT STATUS OF THE BENEFICIARY AND THE KUPEDES PROGRAM
A. Bank Rakyat Indonesia - Institutional Aspects
2.1       Background.  BRI has been the main institutional source of rural
credit in Indonesia. Founded in 1896, it was established in its present form
as a fully state-owned bank under Law No. 21 of December 18, 1968. Today, BRI
is Indonesia's second largest of the five state-owned banks. As of December 31,
1985, it had total assets of Rp 5.68 trillion (US$3.4 billion equivalent). In
terms of branch offices and personnel, BRI is the largest with an organizational
network of 15 regional offices, 296 branch offices and 2,510 village units and
employing almost 32,000 people.
2.2       BRI's original statutory mandate calls for it to (i) assist Govern-
ment in implementing national agricultural policies and rural development
programs; (ii) undertake commercial banking activities, primarily short- and
medium-term lending to farmers, fishermen, small-scale industries and traders;
and (iii) supervise secondary rural banks ir accordance with BI directives.
In the regulated banking environment that existed up to June 1983, BRI was
thus called upon to act as the ma;n channel for most of the Government-
sponsored credit programs for the rural and small-scale sectors. Most of
these programs were based on BI's subsidized liquidity credits (para. 2.9),
and the narrow spreads allowed BRI did not cover its costs relating to these
programs. Under several of these programs (such as BIMAS), BRI had little or
no say in client selection. As a result, BP slowly developed into a
relatively bureaucratic and slow-moving institution reliant upon BI for most
of its funding, operating at high costs with little profit (para. 2.10).
These policies also led to high loan arrears. Since most program loans were
guaranteed by Government, BRI had little incentive to push loan collection
efforts, particularly since the costs associated with such efforts were
relatively high given the small size of most loans (para. 2.8).
2.3       Strategy Following the June 1983 Reforms.  These reforms had pro-
found implications for BRI. It was suddenly called upon to mob.lize substan-
tial resources directly from the public for lending purposes and to operate
profitably in an increasingly competitive market. BRI's management, under its
new President-Director, started putting together a strategy which would enable
it to effect a turnaround and become a broad-based, sound and comercially
viable bank. This strategy called for: (a) diversification of income-
generating activities to ensure BKT's short-term financial viability; (b) a
comprehensive review of its organiz&tion and procedures to improve internal
efficiency and productivity; and (c) a product profitability analysis to
determine which activities to pursue, modify or drop so as to maximize
profitability.
2.4       BRI is well into the process of implementing this strategy.  Build-
ing on its strong resource base and large branch network, it has diversified
its clientele to include a number of strong and profitable corporate as well
as Government accounts, such as BULOG (Board of Logistic Affairs) (para. 2.7).
It has dropped unprofitable activities (such as BIMAS) and started other
programs which can be operated profitably on a market basis. Part of this



- 11 -
effort has been to make its existing Unit Desa system financially viable
through the introduction of the KUPEDES loan program and the SIMPEDES savings
scheoe.
2.5       Today, BRI can best be described as an organization in the process
of fundamental change. While the initiatives of the past three years consti-
tute progress in the right direction, the scope for further improvements is
substantial and presents a zormidable challenge to BRI management. The pro-
posed project is designed to support and assist BRI in this process.
2.6       Management, Organization and Staffing.  With its head office in
Jakarta, BRI operates an extensive branch and office network reaching down to
the village level. BRI a organizational structure is shown in Chart 1. BRI's
Board of Managing Directors comprises the President-Director and four Managing
Directors, all appointed by the Government for five-year renewable terms.
BRI's President-Director is a former senior official of BI. The Board is
responsible for implementing the policies set by the Ministry of Finance (MOF)
and BI, and is in charge of all aspects of the management of the bank. A
government-appointed Board of Supervisors (made up of three members) oversees
BRI's Board of Managing Directors. While BRI has a well-structured regional
and branch network, its overall organization procedures and methods need to be
modernized. Hence, under Loan 2430-IND (SEDP III), BRI engaged an experienced
banking team to: (i) carry out an in-depth evaluation of BRI's organization,
operations and product profitability/strategy; and (ii) recommend institu-
tional, operational and marketing/strategy changes (including an action plan
for implementing these recommendations). This $3.0 million effort started in
July 1986. Phase 1, an in-depth diagnosis for identifying the main aspects to
be studied, was completed to the satisfaction of BI in December 1986. Phase
2. an in-depth review of those specific areas, is expected to be finished by
late 1987. This will be followed by implementation of changes decided upon.
2.7       Financial Condition.  BRI's financial position in recent years is
given in Annex 2, Table 1. During 1981-85, BRI's assets grew at an average
annual rate of almost 312, reaching Rp 5.68 trillion as of December 3
1985. Much of this growth occurred in 1984 as a result of the BULOC -
account being transferred from BI to BRI as the implementing bank: Rp 1.6
trillion, or 702 of the Rp 2.3 trillion increase in assets during the year,
represented BULOG loans. Adjusting for the extent of BI liquidity funding,
BRI's loan-to-deposit ratio in 1985 was about 75X, which is sound. Overall,
BRI's asset and liability/equity structures seem reasonably matched. As of
December 31, 1985, 80.92 of BRI's assets and 77.92 of its liabilities were
short-term.
2.8       As shown in Table 2.1 below, loans account for approximately 752 of
BRI's total assets.
I/   Under this program, loans are made to finance working capital needed by
BULOG for the buying/stocking/selling of paddy/rice, second crops and
hybrid seedlings.

/a Net of provision for bad debts.
As of December 31, 1984, working capital loans accounted for 80% of BRI's
portfolio, with investment loans 16.4% and other loans (primarily to BRI
employees) 3.6%. BRI carries the direct credit risk on only about 40% of its
loan portfolio. The rest (mainly financed out of BI liquidity credits) is
guaranteed or insured by GOI (or GOI-owned agencies). Such loans (e.g.,
KIK/RKKP) account for most of the nonperforming assets which in 1984 amounted
to about 38X of total loans. While this level of nonperforming loans is high,
it does not threaten BRI's financial viability given the underlying GOI
guarantees. Nevertheless, the effect of this poor portfolio is institution-
ally debilitating, particularly on staff morale. BRI is therefore reducing
this type of lending and improving collection efforts. It is also providing
adequate provisions and write-offs of delinquent loans for which it bears the
direct credit risk. Thus, in 1985, it made Rp 43.1 billion in provisions and
wrote off Rp 32.2 billion. Like the other state banks, BRI's capitalization
level is very low with paid-in capital of only Rp 300 million (authorized in
the Law of Establishment of BRI); as of December 31, 1985, retained earnings
amounted to Rp 27.3 billion and reserves totaled Rp 72.1 billion (excluding
loan loss provisions of Rp 122.2 billion). Since Government appropriates 45%



- 13 -
of annual net after tax profits, BRI has not been able to build up its capital
base through profit accumulation. Given its status as a fully government-
owned bank, this low level of capitalization has not been a cause for great
concern. However, since Government intends for the five state-owned comer-
cial banks to operate on an increasingly independent and profit-oriented basis
(para. 2.3), it is considering, as part of banking reforms currently being
prepared, strengthening the capital base of these banks, including BRI.
2.9       BI liquidity credits have funded an increasingly larger portion of
BRI's total loan portfolio since 1981, although this trend was reversed in
1985. BRI has made considerable progress in its efforts to increase customer
deposits, which increased by 50X in 1983 (from Rp 682.5 billion as of December
31, 1982, to Rp 1,027.6 billion as of December 31, 1983) and by another 86Z
over the next two years (reaching Rp 1,915.1 billion as of December 31, 1985).

1980-85 are summnaLized in Annex 2, Table 2. An overview of BRI's financial

Net profits as a percentage of average total assets in 1984 and 1985 (0.8X and
0.51, respectively) improved significantly over the 0.21 and 0.1X registered
for 1981 and 1982, respectively. However, this improved profitability was
mainly due to non-interest income, su:h as foreign exchange transactions and
the government subsidy for BIMAS losses, and rot to adequate margins on its
loan portfolio which declined from 6.41 of average total assets in 1981 to
4.41 in 1985, reflecting the large amount of priority loans on which BRI could
not adjust its interest rates despite the increase in overall deposit costs.
Despite significant success by BRI in reducing high personnel and administra-
tive costs (from 6.0X of average total assets in 1981 to 4.01 in 1985), these
costs need to be further reduced. To increase future profitability, BRI will
have to improve operating efficiencies, expand general lending and move into
other high income areas of banking activity. This is recognized by BRI's
management. The KUPEDES lending program, discussed in Section B below, is one
example of this new direction.
2.11      Project Aid Credits/Loans.  Since 1972, BRI has participated in
numerous projectr funded by bilateral and international financial institu-
tions, especially those related to the agricultural and rural sectors. As of
December 31, 1985, the outstanding amount of these loans/credits was
Rp 286.9 billion (US$253.9 million equivalent). As shown in Annex 2, Table 3,
the Bank Group has provided funds to BRI in the amount of $82.0 million
through five credits and two loans; ADB has made eight i?ans in the amount of
$106.2 million. Two loans approve4 by the Bank in 1986- will provide another
'41.5 million to BRI. In addition, BRI has been a participating bank in the
KIK/KMKP programs which have beezt partially financed with World Bank Group
funds (para. 1.20); over 50% of these funds were channeled through BRI.
B. The BRI Unit Desa System and KUPEDES Program
Background
2.12      In 1970, upon the establishment of BIMAS 3/ as a national program,
BR! was asked by Government to establish a Unit Desa (village sub-branch) sys-
tem to administer BIMAS credit.  The Government provided an administrative
subsidy and later covered the operational losses of the Unit Degas. (A
detailed description of the origin and development of Unit Desas, and their
relationship to the BIMAS program, is available in the Project File.)
2/   Ln. 2702-IND, Export Development Project, and Ln. 2773-IND, Fisheries
Support Services Project.
3/   The BIMAS program was aimed at improving agricultural production and
practices through the provision of physical inputs, technical assistance
and short-term credit through BRI Unit Desas at an interest rate of 12%
p.a. This rate was substantially below market rates. BI/GOI bore up to
75Z of the credit risk atid provided an administrative subsidy to BRI to
cover the operating costs of the Unit Desas.



- 15 -
2.13      By 1983, GOI recognized that the BIKAS credit program had outlived
its usefulnss.  Costs far exceeded possible benefits (in 1983, losses
amounted to Rp 12.6 billion). With the discontinuation of BIKAS, BRI faced
the choice of either abandoning the Unit Desas (since their operations would
no longer be subsidized by GOI) or changing their role and function to make
them profitable. BRI chose the latter,course for various reasons. First, the
Kredit Mini and Kredit Midi programs 4/ had shown that there was a large loan
daimand for 8.1 kinds of village entrepreneurial activities. Second, Unit Des&
staff had !iready learned how to administer small credit programs; disbanding
the system completely would therefore be wasteful and result in substantial
staff layoffs,
2.14      Thus, with the close assistance of the MOF's Center for PvAicy and
Implementation Studies (CPIS), BRI initiated the Kredit Utum Pedasan
(KUPEDES), a new general-purpose credit program, as the main credit function
of Unit Desas. The terms and conditions of KUPEDES loans are described in
paras. 2.20-2.24. BRI's long-term goal was to develop the Unit Desa system
into a nationwide Iub-branc% system, integrated within the overall BRI struc-
ture, which would be profitable. Each Unit Desa would operate as a profit
center, making loans and raising deposits, with staff being paid a bonus,
based on annual financial results, to encourage good merformance. It was also
decided that, henceforth, Unit Desas would no longer participate in adminis-
tered credit programs. Kredit Mini and Kredit Midi were terminated at the end
of 1983, and KUPEDES operations began in February 1984. To help BRI initiate
KUPEDES, the Covernment provided a grant of Rp 66.7 billion and MOF directed
BI to provide initial liquidity credit of Rp 143 billion (para. 2.28).
Organization
2.15      The Head Office.  BRI's Board of Managing Directors is the main
authority for establishing policy regarding Unit Desa activities. Policy
directives are then communicated from the Board through the regional offices
and branches to their respective Unit Desas. In the context of preparation
for the proposed project, BRI prepared a draft Unit Desa Policy Statement and
a draft Unit Desa Strategy Statement formally outlining the overall goals and
operational objectives of the Unit Desa system as evolved over the past two
years. These statements were discussed with the Bank during appraisal and were
finalized at negotiations (Annexes 3 and 4, respectively). The adoption of
these statements by BRI's Board of Managing Directors is a condition of loan
effectiveness. It was further agreed that neither the Policy Statement nor
the Strategy Statement would be amended in a material way without prior
agreement of the Bank (para. 4.3).
2.16      Since February 1986, overall responsibility for Unit Desa operations
rests with the Village Unit Development Division (PUD) that was created within
4/   Established in 1973 and 1979, respectively, these programs made credit
available to small borrowers outside of the BIMAS program, primarily for
off-farm economic activities. Under Kredit Mini, the loan ceiling was
Rp 200,000; under Kredit Midi, the maximum loan limit was Rp S00,000.



- 16 -
the Cooperatives, Farmers and Fishermen Credit Department (KTN). Also, to
ensure coordination of policy matters affecting the Unit Degas, a working
committee has been established. It is chaired by the President-Director of
BRI with the Chief of KTN as its secretary and includes the heads of eight
departments. This arrangement for coordinating Unit Desa operations is
satisfactory.
2.17      Management information is primarily relayed through standardized
reports. In addition, the MOF's CPIS consolidates and analyzes information on
outstanding loans, disbursements, delinquencies and write-offs. Rural credit
experts within the CPIS have also helped to design a system for preparing
monthly financial statements that consolidate information received from the
Unit Desas. These functions were assumed by PUD at the end of 1986. In
addition, the PUD will also be responsible for instituting a more efficient
monitoring system. Financing has been approved out of the aforesaid USAID TA
project to strengthen the capacity of the PUD to undertake these tasks.
2.18      Regional. and Branch Offices.  The regional and branch offices play a
major role in supervising and monitoring Unit Desa operations. The regional
offices oversee the operations of the branches. Typically, a regional office
is responsible for about 10-15 brAnches. Branch offices have the primary
responsibility for monitoring and supervision of day-to-day Unit Desa activi-
ties. Branch offices consolidate financial information on their respective
Unit Desas. Each branch has supervisory staff whose exclusive job is to visit
and monitor Unit Desa operations, cash balances and financial controls. Most
analyses of Unit Desa performance are undertaken at the branch level, although
the Unit Desa itself collects data and summarizes it in monthly reports. The
recent introduction of computers in PUD is expected to help staff analyze data
on a national, regional, and branch level more efficiently. BRI also plans to
study the possible computerization of field offices. Overall, the present
information system for Unit Desa operations is adequate and should be
considerably improved once new systems, nnw being prepared, come on stream.
2.19      The Unit Desa.  Each BRI Unit Dcsa is staffed by four persons,
including a Manager, a Loan Officer, a Bookkeeper and a Cashier. There are
now some 2,510 Unit Desas with total employees numbering 12,735. The typical
Unit Desa employee is a high school graduate with three to five years'
experience with BRI. While Unit Desa staff are generally quite competent, BRI
considers that additional training is necessary to enable the system to meet
the expanding demands for credit, savings and other banking services.
Scope and Terms of KUPEDES Lending
2.20      Eligibility.  KUPEDES loans are made directly to individuals, not
through groups as was the case in the BIMAS programs. The main criterion for
lending decisions is the creditworthiness of the borrower. Initially, KUPEDES
loans were exclusively for directly productive activities. Fixed income
earners, without s'ch activities, were not eligible for such loans. In
November 1986, BRI widened the scope of the KUPEDES program to include loans
for purposes other than directly productive activities in order to meet the
demand for such credit, a demand which is being largely met by the informal
credit market. However, to ensure that the preponderant emphasis remains on



- 17 -
financing entrepreneurial activities, BRI agreed, at negotiations, to include
in its Unit Desa Policy Statement a declaration that new loans for purposes
other than directly productive activities would not exceed 5X of new loan
approvals.
2.21      BRI requires borrowers to provide proof of income sources and/or a
certification of their business activities. Most rural families engage in a
number of different activities, including agriculture, trading, cottage
industry, etc., depending on the time of year. The borrower will list one
activity as the purpose for the loan. The purpose of most loans (around 70X)
is stated as trading, often related to basic consumer goods. The Unit Desa
staff review the cash flow from that activity and select an appropriate
repayment schedule. Where the borrower is engaged in several activities, the
loan application is evaluated on the basis of that which has a regular cash
flow. All applications for loans require a cosigner who is normally the
applicant's spouse.
2.22      Loan Size.  The minimum size KUPEDES loan is Rp 25,000.  In
practice, few loans of less than Rp 100,000 have been made. The maximum
KUPEDES loan amouni, which was raised in April 1986 from Rp 1 million to Rp 2
million, is generally available only to repeat customers who have promptly and
fully repaid previous loans.
2.23      Collateral.  All borrowers must provide collateral sufficient to
cover the value of their loans. While land, buildings or any other property
may be accepted, most borrowers use land. A borrower is classified on the
basis of his repayment record, and this establishes the person's limit for
subsequent loans. Since the legal system for realizing collateral in case of
loan default is long and complicated, the documentation of collateral for each
loan is more for the purpose of establishing the borrower's ability and
serious intent to repay than it is to provide a basis for legal action.
2.24      Repayment Schedules.  Repayment schedules for working capital loans
range from three to 24 months, with or without grace periods of three to nine
months. Single balloon payments for three- to 12-month maturities are also
available. Repayment schedules for loans for investment purposes range up to
a maximum term of 36 months, including grace periods.
2.25      Interest Rates.  The approach to setting interest rates for KUPEOES
loans is different from that in previous official credit programs for small
borrowers where the focus was to provide credit to the subborrowers at a
nominally cheap rate. With KUPEDES, the emphasis is on (a) prompt delivery of
credit, and (b) ensuring the soundness of the financial intermediary. The
underlying assumption is that for small borrowers, access to credit is more
important than the interest rates involved. This basic rationale and the
decision to move gradually away from subsidized GOI funded credit programs,
meant that BRI had to: (a) set deposit rates sufficiently high to ettract
savings; and (b) set lending rates sufficiently high to cover its funding anJ
operating costs, and yet earn a reasonable profit. In establishing onlending
interest rates, BRI and the CPIS based their calculations on the need to
ensure that the Unit Desa system would break even with about Rp 200 billion in
loans outstanding. On this basis, BRI set an onlending rate of 1.5% per month



- 18 -
for working capital loans, calculated on the original loan amounts, and 11 per
month for investment loans, similarly calculated. Thip,differential was
considered necessary to encourage investment activity. /  Thees rates still
apply. During negotiations, it was agreed that modification of this interest
rate structure would be made only after consultation with the Bank
(para. 4.1). Since onlending rates are stated in terms of interest on the
original amount borrowed rather thtn on the declining talance, the effective
annual interest roes are 31.7Z for working capital loans and 21.5Z for
investment loans._   While these rates are admittedly higher than current
market (effective) rates for larger loans (which range from 17X to 221), they
compare favorably to rates charged by other lenders to smaller borrowers
(including BKK, private banks and local money lenders). In addition to these
interest rates, there is a penalty charge of 0.51 per month (also calculated
on original loan amounts) collected monthly for failure to pay loan install-
ments on time. This is returned to borrowers who have paid all installments
on time.
KUPEDES Lending Operations
2.26      Volume of Lending.  During the period February 1984 to June 1986,
total KUPEDES disbursements 7/ amounted to Rp 719.9 billion; loans outstanding
as of June 30, 19b6, were Rp 285.1 billion. The total number of loans made
during this same period was 2.2 million (Annex 5, Table 1). KUPEDES lending,
on an average quarterly bais, is summarized in Table 2.3 below.
Table 2.3: AVERAGE QUARTERLY KUPEDES DISBURSEMENTS
January-June
1984           1985                1986
Loan disbursements                  41.1           83.8                 110.2
(in Rp billion)
Number of loans ('000)             159.8          248.0                 286.0
5/   To ensure that Unit Desa staff are neutral in deciding between working
capital and investment loans, BRI introduced an internal transfer price
system for funds used for investment purposes (para. 2.30) so that the
spread to the Unit Desas on both types of loans is similar.
6/   For loans with grace periods, the effective interest rate is kept
basically the same: as for the standard one-year loan with no grace
period.
7/   In KUPEDES, approvals and disbursements are treated synonymously.



- 19 -
On an average quarterly basis, disbursewnt incresed by 104S during 193b
(over 1984), while growth for 1986 (based on disbursement for the first siz
months) wya a more modest 322. In terms of number of loans, the increase in
growth in 1985 registered 551, declining to 151 (based on the first six
months) for 1986.
Characteristics of KUPEDES Lending
2.27      Since the introduction of the KUPEDES scheme, data generated by the
SRI and statistics from a number of surveys undertaken by CPIS provide the
following characteristics of KUPIDES loans.
(a) Type of Loans. As of June 30, 1986, 93Z of loans outstanding repre-
sented working capital loans. It is not clear why investment loans
do not comprise a larger portion of the KUPEDES portfolio. Consid-
ering the desirability of encouraging investment for productive
purposes, BRI agreed during appraisal that one study which would be
undertaken by the Research and Planning Division is the identifica-
tion of measures (other than arbitrary targets or quotas, which
would adversely affect the neutrality of Unit Desa staff in making
credit decisions) which may be needed to induce greater demand for
KUPEDES loans for investment purposes. At negotiations, BRI agreed
to furnish the results of this study to the Bank by March 31, 1988,
and to prepare a plan of action by June 30, 1988, acceptable to the
Bank, for implementing the recommendations of this report.
(b) Average Size and Maturity. As indicated in Table 2.3 above, the
average size of KUPEDES loans remains relatively small, having
increased from Rp 257,000 in 1984 to Rp 338,000 in 1985 to
Rp 385,000 during the first six months of 1986. Survey data shows
that less than 15X of KUPEDES loans are larger than Rp 500,000,
while only about 5X are less than Rp 100,000. During the period
January-June 1986, survey findirgs show that, in terms of maturity,
12-month working capital loans accounted for 571 of loans made by
nnmber, and 45Z by amcunt extended. Eighteen- and 24-month working
capital loans accounted for another 161 and 141, respectivelyt by
number, and 182 and 211, respectively, by amount.
(c) Geographic Distribution. As of June 30, 1986, 752 of KUPEDES out-
standing loan portfolio was concentrated in Java. This reflects the
fact that approximately 622 of Indonesia's population lives on Java
and that the level of economic activity that is relatively higher
than in other islands. While 641 of total BRI Unit Desas are
located in Java, BRI has Unit Desas operating in 14 of the 15
provinces in which it has branches.
(d) Access of Woman to KUPEDES loans. From sample surveys, BRI has
found that approximately one-fourth of all borrowers and three-
fourths of all cosigners are women. This evidence supports the
thesis that most KUPEDES loans a,near to benefit family unit, (para.
2.20). Under the proposed project, monitoring and evaluati n data
would be disaggregated as to gender in order to measure atr evaluate
the particpation of women in the KUPEDES program.



- 20 -
Funding of Unit Desas and Resource Mobilization
2.28      KUPEDES loans are funded out of three sources:  BRI equity allocated
to Unit Desa activities, BI liquidity credits, and savings mobilization:
(a)  Equity.  This consists of the proceeds of a Government grant to BRI
for the Kredit Mini program for Rp 66.7 billion which in 1984 was
reallocated to funding KUPEDES loans. BRI distributed this grant
equally among the Unit Desas as "an equity contribution" of
Rp 19.0 million each.
(b) Liquidity Credit from BI. This consists of: (i) the conversion of
Rp 43.0 billion originally made for the purpose of funding the
Kredit Midi program; (ii) the initial Rp 100 billion of liquidity
credit available to BRI for KUPEDES; and (iii) additional liquidity
made available by BI once KUPEDES loan outstanding reached
Rp 250 billion, on the basis of Rp 50 billion in liquidity credit
for each Rp 75 billion increase in KUPEDES lending outstanding.
Under this formula, BRI was comitted to providing at least one-
third of the incremental resource requirements for KUPEDES out of
its own funds. The interest rate on BI liquidity funds was 15%
i.e., the average rate payable by state banks on deposits),
excepting amounts utilized for investment purposes where the rate
would be 3%. Since a working capital/investment blend of 75/25 was
assumed, BI charged BRI 12% (the average rate) for the sake of
convenience with an understanding that there would be an adjustment
at a later stage. However, both BRI and BI have now agreed on a
single consolidated rate of 12% on the full amount of the liquidity
credits (para. 3.5).
(c)  Savings Mobilization by the Unit Desas.  The Unit Desas provide two
major savings instruments: TABANAS and SIMPEDES. Tabungan Nasional
(Small Savings--TABANAS) is a national savings scheme sponsored by
BI and available to depositors in all banks, both state and private.
The interest rate is 15% on the minimum monthly balance up to
Rp 1 million and 12Z for higher amounts. Under TABANAS, withdrawals
are restricted to two per month. Simpanan Pedesan (Village Savings
Program--SIMPEDES) is a new savings instrument introduced by BRI
through the Unit Desas. During an 18-month trial period, SIMPEDES
was tested in a two-phase pilot project and expanded nationwide in
August 1986. SIMPEDES interest rates, calculated on the basis of
minimum monthly balances, are 0% on balances of less than Rp 25,000,
9% on balances from Rp 25,000 to Rp 200,000, and 12% on talances
above Rp 200,000. The saver is permitted unlimited withdrawals.
This is considered the key factor behind the success of the program,
although experience to date shows very few people actually making



- 21 -
two or more withdrawals in a single month. Associated with the
SIMPEDES program is a lottery system for prizes. In addition to
TABANAS and SIMPEDES accounts, Unit Dess offer time deposits with
maturities ranging from three months to one year and checking (Giro)
accounts, which are held primarily by local government agencies.
As of June 30, 1986, these resources in the Unit Desa system amounted to
Rp 343.0 billion as follows:
Resource                         Rp (billion)
[redit Mini (Equity) Grant          66.7
Converted Kredit Midi               32.7
BI Liquidity Credit                150.0
TABANAS (Unit Desas only)           63.3
SIMPEDES                            15.5
Deposits and Giro                   14.8
Total                         343.0
Unit Desa Administration and Financial Operations
2.29      Until 1984, the Unit Degas operated as windows of BRI branch
offices.  For BRI to turn the Unit Desas into separate financial entities that
would operate as profit centers, it needed to set up s-stems to enable them to
fund their operations and to identify their respective costs and profits.
This entailed: (a) reconstruction of each Unit Desas's financial statements;
(b) setting up a mechanism to enable each Unit Desa to fund its loan
operations, irrespective of the amount of deposits it could raise; (c) a
mechanism to allow the Unit Desa to invest excess funds; and (d) allocating as
part of the Unit Desa's overhead costs the branch's cost of supervising it.
2.30      In reconstructing the financial positions of each Unit Des&, all
BIMAS assets and liabilities were transferred from the Unit Desa books to the
respective branches, white Kredif Mini and Kredit Midi assets were left with
the Unit Desas and Rp 19.0 million in equity was allocated to each Unit Desa
(para. 2.28). Also, Unit Desas were required in future to set up reserve for
bad debt equal to the total amount of loans more than three months overdue
from the final loan payment date. Recently, this rule has been modified.
While it will apply for setting aside provisions for Kredits Mini and Midi,
the reserve for bad debt for KUPEDES loans must be kept equal to either loans
more than three mopths overdue or 2.5% of loans outstanding, whichever is
greater. In addition, loans one year overdue are to be written off, although
loan collection efforts relating to such loans would continue.
2.31      Additional funds required by a Unit Desa for lending purposes beyond
its equity (Rp 19 million) and the deposits it was able to raise, could be
borrowed from the branch at an interest rate of 15% for working capital and at
3% for investment loans. Recently, these rates were increased to 17% and 5%,
respectively, with the objective of encouraging the Unit Desas to mobilize
savings. (The 2% spread to the branches resulting from this modification in



- 22 -
the onlending rates to Unit Desas is placed in a Unit Desa Development Fund.
The fund is used to finance expenses related to overall Unit Desa programs
such as training.) If a Unit Desa raises more deposits thin it can lend out,
the excess funds can be depo ited in the branch at an interest rate of 17X
(the extra 22 above the 15% 'ABANAS rate is drawn by the branch from the Unit
Desa Development Fund). This provision gives Unit Desas an extra incentive to
raise savings, and protects "net savings" Unit Desas from automatically
incurring losses. Thus, the system has a built-in mechanism to encourage sav-
ings mobilization (deposits are cheaper than borrowed funds); at the same
time, those units whose savings exceed loan demand are not penalized for suc-
cessfully mobilizing resources.
2.32      BRI Auditing and Internal Control.  BRI staff involved in internal
auditing total approximately 68C persons with 110 persons at the head office
and 570 in the regional offices. At the regional office, auditing is per-
formed by teams normally consisting of five persons each. Team assignments
are rotated at least twice a year. Priority is normally given to audit of
branch operations, but audit teams try to visit each Unit Desa at least twice
a year. This is not always possible, however, and audit team visits to
individual Unit Desas are generally infrequent. Therefore, the financial
review and supervision of Unit Desas is mainly performed by the branch manage-
ment. In some isolated Unit Desas, cash reconciliation and other routine
financial control checks are accomplished only on a weekly basis. BRI's
management is most concerned to improve the capability of its staff
responsible for supervising Unit Desa activity. The proposed project includes
assistance to BRI for this purpose. In addition, financial control
shortcomings are being addressed through the USAID TA project (para. 3.7).
The plan of action in this regard was reviewed by the Bank and is considered
appropriate. External auditing at BRI is performed by the Government's Agency
for Financial and Development Supervision (BPKP). BPKP's audit teams visit
all BRI regional and branch offices but only audit Unit Deias on a sample
basis.
Financial Position and Performance of Unit Desas
2.33      Financial Position.  The Unit Deuas' financial position over the
past two and one-half years is presented in Annex 5, Table 2. Between
March 31, 1984, and June 30, 1986, total assets increased from Rp 178.8 bil-
lion to Rp 358.7 billion, growing at an annual rate of 68.1X in 1985 and 38.8%
(on an annualized basis) in 1986. KUPEDES loans, which represented 622 of
total assets as of year-end 1984, accounted for 76% and 79% of total assets as
of December 31, 1985, and June 30, 1986, respectively. Cash in the branches,
Unit Desas' surplus loanable funds, has steadily declined (as a percentage of
total assets) during the same period: from 272 to 211 to 17%. On the lia-
bilities side, TABANAS and SIMPEDES savings have increased twofold between
December 31, 1984, and June 30, 1986, from Rp 38.6 billion to Rp 78.9 bil-
lion. Despite this success, however, the increase in the KUPEDES portfolio
has outpaced the increase in savings, and BRI needs to rely on external (i.e.,
outside of BRI) resources to meet KUPEDES loan demand, at least for the period
covered by this project (para. 3.4).



- 23 -
2.34      Financial Performance.  There has been steady improvement in the
Unit Desas  profitability (Annex 5, Table 3).  After losses of Rp 25.0 billion
for 1984 and lp 0.9 billion for 1985, the Unit Desas registered a profit of
Rp 4.8 billion for the first half of 1986, a return on average total assets
(annualized) of 2.91. Other financial indicators for the Unit Desa system
during the first 30 months of KUPEDES operations are sumarized in Table 2.4
below.

An adequate lending spread and control of personnel expenses were the key
factors enabling the Unit Desas to reach a position of profitability. In
1984, personnel accounted for 59% of total expenses (including financial). In
1985, the increase in personnel expenses was kept below 10, while personnel
expenses as a percentage of total expenses fell to 45X. For the first half of
1986, personnel expenses increased by approximately 12! (on an annualized
basis), while as a percentage of totel expenses, they fell to 38Z.
2.35      Quality of Portfolio.  The success of the KUPEDES program to date is
further evidenced by a very satisfactory collection performance and low
arrears. As of June 30, 1986, only Rp 10.3 billion, or 3.6X of the KUPEDES
outstanding portfolio, was in arrears (Annex 5, Table 4), with arrears defined
as any payment of principal overdue by one day or more. As of June 30, 1986,
only Rp 2.7 billion, or less than 1X of the outstanding portfolio, was in
arrears of more than one day beyond final installment due dates. For the
remaining Rp 7.6 billion classified as arrears, however, there is no detailed
aging classification.
2.36      Measures to Prevent Deterioration in Portfolio Performance.  Much of
the Unit Desas' success in keeping KUPEDES loan arrears low is the result of
financially prudent lending procedures, close follow-up of borrowers, and
close monitoring by the branches and senior BRI management. However, arrears
have been creeping upwards, from 0.5! of the outstanding portfolio as of
December 31, 1984, to 3.6! as of June 30, 1986. While still low, BRI
management is most concerned to ensure that this trend is halted and that
apart from stressing increased supervision by the branches, it is also taking
a number of initiatives to ensure a sustained high level of loan collec-
tions. These are:
(a)  Since BRI Unit Desa staff are paid bonuses of up to one month which
are directly related to the financial performance of the Unit, an
increase in arrears, which would result in an increase in
provisions, would negatively impact on profitability and, hence, the
amount of the bonus for which they would qualify. Thus, as of the
end of 1986, each Unit Desa is required to maintain as provision of
bad debts the larger of (i) 2.5% of the outstanding KUPEDES
portfolio, or (ii) the amount of principal three or more months
overdue after the final installment due date. Principal more than
one year overdue after the final installment due dates must be
written off;
(b)  Introduction of new portfolio performance measures which would
better identify trends in arrears. For logistical reasons, it may
take some time to introduce these measures to the 2,500 Unit Desas
since it is first necessary to ensure the present systems and
information requirements are fully understood by all Unit Desa staff
before changes are made. Adequate training must be arranged for all
staff prior to the introduction of new procedures and information.
Training for Unit Desa staff is being addressed under the USAID
supported technical assistance program;



- 25 -
(c) BRI head office is also reviewing the results of a number of proce-
dures currently being used by different branches in dealing with
problem arrears (e.g., mandatory cessation of lending to new
clients, but not to those who have promptly paid back previous
loans, for all Unit Desas with arrears in excess of a specific
level, e.g., 5Z). It is expected that the most successful of these
would be adopted as standard operating guidelines for the entire
Unit Desas system; and
(d) BRI's head office is also actively studying other aspects related to
the arrears problem. A recent survey was conducted to identify the
profile of clients who are most likely to default. Also, a recent
survey indicated that 50% of all arrears are concentrated in 22 of
the 296 branches. BRI has formed special teams from the head office
and the regional offices to identify lessons learned.
2.37      This shows BRI to be very active and motivated in ensuring that the
experience of high arrearages under previous credit programs is not
repeated. To enable the Bank to provide timely guidance, however, in case of
an unforeseen rapid portfolio deterioration, BRI agreed, at negotiations, to
consult with the Bank and to draw up within three months time a time-bound
action program, acceptable to the Bank, for dealing with arrears once they
reach a level of 8% over a six-month period (para. 4.1). BRI also agreed at
negotiations to add to its Unit Desa Strategy Statement a clause stating that
maintaining sound portfolio quality would receive management's highest
priority and that arrears (of three months or more past final installment due
date) of 6% or more would be considered unsatisfactory performance. Should
this level of arrears be reached, BRI management would evaluate the overall
program and organization of the Unit Desas with a view to redesigning ongoing
programs, organization and prccedures to ensure the continued financial
viability of the Unit Desa System on an autonomous basis (para. 4.1).

I;I. THE PROJECT
A. Project Rationale, Objectives and Content
3.1       Project Rationale and Objectives.  In accordance with GOI policy
reforms to deregulaie the financial system, spur resource mobilization,
restrict the scope of BI liquidity credit programs and enhance the access of
creditworthy small borrowers to credit, the proposed project aims at assisting
BRI to strengthen its Unit Desa system through which the KUPEDES program is
operated. As discussed in Section IIB, KUPEDES represents a dramatic depar-
ture from the heavily subsidized credit programs that have characterized much
of the lending directed to many sectors in Indonesia, especially to small-
scale borrowers. The proposed project has the specific objectives of:
(a) promoting BRI's efforts to develop the Unit Desa system into a financial.y
viable sub-branch network that is able to provide credit on a nonsubsidized
basis to all creditworthy small borrowers, to mobilize savings, and to provide
other banking services; (b) encouraging BRI to improve its resource mobiliza-
tion efforts so that it could eventually fund KUPEDES loans out of the depo-
sits it raises; (c) reducing BRI's reliance on BI liquidity credits for the
KUPEDES program and thus contributing to a release of such resources for
financing other high-priority development projects during a time of severe
financial constraints; and (d) improving the overall institutional capability
of BRI overall as well as for the KUPEDES program.
3.2       Project Content.  The project would comprise two components:  (a) a
US$100.0 million credit component for general purpose financing in all
sectors. This is expected to meet BRI's requirements for funds for KUPEDES
loans, other than those which it expects to raise through savings mobiliza-
tion, and is equal to the amount of BI liquidity credit that BRI would other-
wise require for the period. The component would finance small-scale enter-
prises in all sectors including manufacturing, agriculture, trade and
services, and would be committed by the Bank on the basis of the formula
described in para. 3.11; and (b) a technical assistance component (including
training) aimed at strengthening BRI's institutional capability to implement
the KUPEDES program. Bank funds (US$1.5 million) would complement USAID
financing for an on-going technical assistance program (para. 3.7) and would
assist BRI in (i) developing the capacity to design, implement and analyze
studies for monitoring and evaluating systematically the lending and deposit
mobilization activities of Unit Desas, and (ii) strengthening the capacity of
BRI in supervision, accounting and auditing for activities related to the Unit
Desas.
B. Projected Resource Requirements and the Credit Component
3.3       Operational Projections and Resource Requirements.  Projected
KUPEDES lending operations for 1986-90 (Annex 5, Table 5) are based on past
experience, with future disbursements reflecting the composition of previous
KUPEDES loans (by amount and maturity). The projected average annual increase
in KUPEDES loans outstanding of Rp 116.0 billion over this five-year period



- 27 -
appears sustainable. Annual disbursements during 1986-90 are projected to
increase at an average annual rate of slightly less than 272, with the yearly
increase declining from about 421 in 1986 to 17% in 1990. The portfolio
outstanding would grow at corresponding rates, from Rp 229.0 billion as of
December 31, 1985, to Rp 808.1 billion as of December 31, 1990. (As of
June 30, 1986, the portfolio outstanding was Rp 285.1 billion.)
3.4       As shown in Annex 5, Table 6, BRI will place substantial emphasis on
expanding its resource mobilization efforts through TABANAS and SIMPEDES which
are expected to increase 4.5 times--from Rp 68.7 billion as of December 31,
1985, to Rp 310.0 billion by December 31, 1990. As a percentage of the out-
standing RUPEDES portfolio, TABANAS and SIMPEDES savings will increase
steadily from 30.0% to 38.41 during this same period. However, despite the
steadily growing impo-tance of this savings mobilization effort. the Unit
Desas will continue to need additional resources to meet pr^iected KUPEDES
demand through 1990.
3.5       Under the proposed project, Bank fundb would replace BI liquidity
credit. In order to match Unit Desa system funding requirements more closely
with available funds and to reduce demand on scarce GOI resources, BRI agreed
that: (i) any liquidity credits it drew down afte; March 1, 1987, would be
repaid to BI within one year of the date of effectiveness of the proposed
loan; and (ii) it would not avail itself of any new liquidity credits as long
as there remain undisbursed funds under the credit component of the proposed
Bank loan. BI and BRI also reached the following agreements regarding the
terms on the outstanding liquidity credits (Rp 193 billion): (i) an interest
rate of 12%; and (ii) a fixed amortization schedule of 28 equal quarterly
payments (of Rp 6,893 billion) beginning in the first quarter of 1989. At
negotiations, BRI agreed that these terms would not be amended without the
Bank's consent.
3.6       Projected Financial Positions and Financial Results.  Projected Unit
Dess income statements and balance sheets for 1986-90 are given in Annex 5,
Tables 7 and 8, respectively, while selected ratios of financial performance
are summarized in Table 3.1 below.

/c   Income adjusted to exclude IPTW reserve expense.



- 29 -
Total assets are expected to increase at an annual rate of about 21Z, from
Rp 300.5 billion as of December 31, 1985, to Rp 787.7 billion as of
December 31, 1990, with the KUPEDES loan portfolio (net of provision for bad
debts) accounting for over 952 of total assets. TABANAS and SIMPEDES savings
will account for an increasing proportion of the Unit Desas' total borrowed
funds: from 28.12, as of June 30, 1986, to 49.8X, as of December 31, 1990.
While a net loss of Rp 3.3 billion is projected for 1986, this is due
primarily to BRI's recently introduced policy of requiring a provision for bad
debt equivalent to at least 2.5% of KUPEDES loans outstanding at the end of
1986, increasing to 5.5% by the end of 1988 (para. 2.30), thus ensuring
adequate reserves in case of future deterioration in portfolio quality. Net
income for 1987 is projected at Rp 8.9 billion, increasing to Rp 14.3 billion,
Rp 26.5 billion and Rp 36.2 billion in 1988, 1989 and 1990, respectively. As a
return on average assets, the corresponding percentages are 2.22, 2.82, 4.32
and 5.02. These projections assumed that, in addition to the 5.52 provision
for bad loans, 22 of all KUPEDES loans are eventually written off and that a
40% increase in staffing will be required. These assumptions appear prudent.
C. Technical Assistance and Training Needs of the
Unit Desa System - The TA Component
3.7       While the Unit Desa system has made rapid progress since 1987, there
is still scope for improvements in the overall control and direction of Unit
Desa policies and operational guidelines as well as for training of the large
number of staff involved in Unit Desa activities. BRI has secured assistance
from USAID in the form of a technical assistance project for this purpose.
This project, which was reviewed by the Bank during appraisal and found to be
comprehensive and well-conceived, is in its early stages of implementation.
This is complemented by the technical assistance component included under the
proposed project. The scope of the USAID project and the Bank TA component
are described below.
(a) The USAID Technical Assistance Project. This amounts to US$10.0 and
complemented by US$8.0 million equivalent in counterpart funds. The
project focuses on:
(i) Training. BRI's training facilities currently consist of a
central training center with 11 professional staff in Jakarta
and 15 regional (provincial) training centers staffed with 60
professionals. The Jakarta training center handles training
for senior and central BRI staff. The provincial training
centers, which have a combined annual capacity of 3,000
students, are not adequate to cope with training of over 13,000
Unit Desa staff in the various aspects of the KUPEDES credit
scheme, the SIMPEDES savings programs, or on operational and
accounting details, as well as in possible new Iroducts,
particularly since BRI and USAID estimate that an average of
three weeks of formal training for all staff over the next
three years would be needed.



- 30 -
To support this trainirg, the U3AID assistance includes the
financing of two long-term policy and training advisors for
three years ($1.6 million) who would develop training materials
and train trainers. The advisors will work with thE BRI train-
ing division on all aspects of curriculum development, program
administration and support, and personnel policy. To provide
adequate training staff, BRI will recruit 21 new regional
trainers within BRI.
(ii)  The establishment of five regional centers for Unit Desa
training. USAID would finance up to 50S, or $1.7 million, of
the cost of constructing training centers in Padang,
Yogyakarta, Surabaya, Bandung and Ujung Pandang. When
completed, these will have the capacity to train effectively
all 13,000 Unit Desa staff in three years. Until the new
buildings are ready, outside space will be rented. USAID will
also fund 501 of the first year's operating costs for the
initial three-year period, up to $1.5 million.
(iii)  Accounting, Automation and Audit.  Additional advisory support
on these aspects consisting of 7.5 man-years of technical
assistance ($1.5 million) is also included, as well as up to
$2.5 million for financing the purchase of communication and
automation equipment for Unit Desa activities and $1.2 million
for research on the rural finance sector.
Thus, overall, the USAID projects meets the training requirements of
BRI for Unit Desa staff in respect of training, accounting and MIS
systems. Bank supervision missions will periodically obtain
information on the USAID TA project.
(b)  The TA Component Under the Proposed Project.  This component (US$1 5
million) has two major objectives:
(i) strengthening the capacity of BRI's Research and Planning
Division to corduct its own evaluation of and special studies
on most aspects of Unit Desa activity. The principal functions
of the division, which consists of 47 staff members including
12 professionals, are to undertake special studies as requested
by BRI management and to monitor and evaluate operations.
Because of the large number of Unit Desas and the high volume
of small operations (both on the credit and on the savings
side), the best way to determine how existing programs are
being implemented and how to introduce new products or changes
in existing ones is through sample surveys. It is, therefore,
necessary for BRI to build such a capability in-house. Funds
out of this component would enable BRI to hire a full-time
Research and Planning Advisor (36 man-months) plus 28 man-
months of short-term specialists. The advisor's task would be
to transfer to BRI staff the capacity to design, execute and
analyze studies useful to BRI management. At negotiations, BRI
provided to the Bank a shortlist of five candidates for this



- 31 -
position and agreed to employ the selected candidate by
October 31, 1987 (para. 4.1). The terms of reference for this
position are presented in Annex 7. The short-term specialists
would be engaged, as needed, to undertake such studies as: (a)
identifying and marketing new banking instruments; (b) design-
ing and implementing borrower-level economic impact studies in
rural areas; (c) compiling profiles of rural savers and
borrowers for marketing purposes; and (d) designing new loan
supervision and collection control systems. BRI staff in the
Research and Planning Division would also receive on-the-job
training by the full-time advisor and by the specialists in
survey design and methodology, statistics and data analysis
techniques. Approximately $100,000 of Bank financing is
allocated for the overseas training of SRI staff involved in
monitoring and evaluation operations; and
(ii)  improving the capability of BRI's field auditors and
supervisory staff for Unit Desa operations.  US$500,000 is
allocated for this purpose, representing 701 of the total cost
of training field Ltaff (located at BRI branches and regional
offices) in the areas of supervision and audit of Unit Desas.
This training is considered essential to ensuring continued
satisfactory portfolio quality and overall performance of Unit
Desas, and complements the USAID-financed training (which
focuses on Unit Desa staff).

D. Project Cost Estimates and Financing Plan
3.8       The nature of this project precludes a statement of costs in terms
of the total investment financed by the subprojects and a firm plan for
funding these costs. The size of the proposed credit component is based on
BRI's projections of disbursement for KUPEDES loans, assuming no rerource
constraints, through September 1989. The component will finance a proportion
of the increase in KUPEDES loans outstanding, which is expected to represent
about 10% of the total amount of new KUPEDES loans disbursed during the period
(para. 3.11). BRI would finance the remaining need out of its own resources
and existing "rolled over" BI liquidity credits. Table 3.3 below outlines
BRI's KUPEDES loan financing and technical assistance needs, and the
associated financing plan.

E. Features of the Loan
Lending Arrangements
3.9       The proposed Bank loan of US$101.5 million would be lent at standard
country terms to the Republic of Indonesia. The Government would assume the



- 33 -
foreign exchange risk and onlend the rupiah equivalent of the loan to BRI for
a period of 20 years, including a five-year grace period since there is a need
to augment the pool of resources available for loans for small enterprises.
BRI would pay an interest rate equal to the average cost of BRI's customer
deposits (excluding noninterest-bearing deposits from GOI or COI-owned enti-
ties). Based on August 1986 data, this arrangement would result in a minimum
relending rate to BRI of about 11% p.a., which is highly positive in real
terms. The rate would be adjusted every six months, subject to a floor equal
to the rate on the Bank loan plus a fixed spread of 1.75%. (See Annex 8 for
details of the formula.) Since deposit rates in Indonesia are market deter-
mined and capital flows are generally unrestricted, the formula for calculat-
ing the cost of funds to BRI would indirectly include an element to cover the
perceived foreign exchange risk; the difference between the Bank's lending
rate and the relending rate charged by GOI can be considered a premium for
bearing the foreign exchange risk. BI would be responsible for calculating
this rate on the basis of the most recent quarterly data available to it. At
negotiations, GOI confirmed its agreement to these interest rete provisions as
well as to the method of interest rate calculations. The Government will also
charge BRI a commitment fee on the undisbursed balance of the loan equal to
the commitment fee payable by GOI to the Bank. The signing of a subsidiary
loan agreement, satisfactory to the Bank, between BRI and GOI is a condition
of effectiveness of the proposed loan.
3.10      Onlending Terms.  The interest rates to subborrowers of KUPEDES
loans would be equal to 1.0% per month for loans for investment purposes and
1.5% per month for loans for working capital purposes, calculated on the
original subloan amount.  The effective annualized interest rates would there-
fore be about 21.5% p.a. for investment subloans and about 31.7% p.a. for
working capital loans. These rates, which are highly positive in real terms,
are needed to enable BRI Unit Desas to cover their costs of operation, includ-
ing a provision for loan losses of about 5.5% of outstanding loans, and
provide a reasonable return to BRI. Modifications to the onlending interest
rate structure would be done only after consultation with the Bank
(para. 4.1). In passing on the funds from the proposed loan to the Unit
Desas, BRI would continue to apply the present internal transfer pricing
system and ensure that the cost of these funds to the Unit Desas is at least
equal to the highest interest rate payable on customer deposits at the Unit
Desa level. This feature is designed to ensure that the proposed project does
not undermine incentives of the Unit Desas to increase resource mobilization
efforts. At negotiations, BRI also confirmed that at least 501 of the spread
between the onlendiing rate from GOI and the internal transfer cost to the Unit
Desas would be credited to the Unit Desas Development Fund (para. 4.1).
Loan Administration
3.11      Disbursement.  Loans made under KUPEDES are very small.  There is no
direct foreign exchange component (regarding the credit component). There-
fore, the proposed disbursement formula is based on an imputed foreign
exchange content ar.d takes into consideration the need to maintain the incen-
tives for BRI to sustain its efforts to mobilize savings. For the credit
component, the Bank loan disbursements would be based on the higher of
either: (a) 10% of disbursements on new KUPEDES loans approvals during a



- 34 -
quarter, with a ceiling of 65X of the total increment in the KUPEDES loan
portfolio outstanding during the first year of the project and 60% thereafter;
or (b) 501 of the increment in the total KUPEDES loan portfolio outs:anding.
This arrangement is designed to encourage BRI's resource mobilization
efforts. (Annex 9 gives the rationale for and further explanation of the
proposed disbursement formula.) BRI would submit quarterly requests for
reimbursement with Statements of Expenditure (SOE) consisting of supporting
documentation on ICUPEDES loan disbursements and repayments during the quarter
plus the beginning and ending outstanding balances of the KUPEDES loan
portfolio. All KUPEDES operations from the first day of the quarter in which
the proposed loan is signed would be eligible for reimbursement. DisburseLent
under the technical assistance component would be for 1001 of consultant costs
against standard documentation, except for contracts valued at less than
$100,000 which would be claimed under SOE. Disbursement for the local
training of Unit Desa supervising staff in auditing/supervision would be based
on 701 of eligible expenditures and would be claimed under SOEs. Based on
projected KUPEDES lending operations (paras. 3.3-3.4), the credit component
could be disbursed in as little as three years. However, to allow for (i) the
lag between disbursement at the Unit Desa and receipt of the SOEs by the Bank,
and (ii) a less-Ehan-projected KUPEDES loan approval rate, a disbursement
period of five years has been assumed for the project, based on the standard
disbursement profile for IDF projects in the East Asia and Pacific Region
(Annex 10). The technical assistance component would be disbursed over a
three-year period.
3.12      Procurement.  Under the KUPEDES program, subloans are very small,
averaging less than US$250 equivalent, and have no direct foreign exchange
component; competitive bidding procedures would be impractical. Goods and
services pro:-dred with subloan proceeds would be acquired through normal
commercial channels available to the borrowers.  Consultant services financed
with the Bank's loan proceeds would be provided in accordance with the Bank's
"Guidelines for the Use of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers and by the
World Bank as Executing Agency." Terms of reference and the appointment of
all consultants financed by the Bank under the project would be subject to
prior Bank approval.
3.13      Auditing and Reporting.  BRI's accounts and SOE documentation would
be audited by BPKP, which is acceptable to the Bank. The report of the
external auditor, in English, would be submitted to the Bank annually and no
later than nine months after the end of BRI's fiscal year. These auditing
requirements would encompass three areas: BRI's annual accounts; the SOEs
periodically prepared by BRI for reimbursement under the proposed loant
detailing the quarter-by-quarter disbursements, repayments, and beginning and
ending balances of the outstanding KUPEDES loan portfolio during the period of
loan effectiveness; and confirmation that reimbursements claimed by BRI are in
respect of the KUPEDES program only and are consistent with the terms of
agreement with the Bank. These audit arrangements were confirmed at
negotiations. BRI will £lso be required to submit quarterly progress reports,
acceptable to the Bank, covering Unit Desa operations, as well as a Project
Completion Report within six months following the project.

F. Project Benefit. and Risks
Benefits
3.14      BRI's efforts to convert the Unit Desas into a profitable banking
operation are consistent with the Bank's goals in the financial sector. The
project would provide, during its implementation period, about 62.0X of the
funds needed to ensure that the growth of KUPEDES is not constrained by lack
of resources. KUPEDES represents a dramatic departure from the heavily
subsidized credit programs that have characterized much of directed lending in
Indonesia. Its success could have a strong demonstration effect vis-a-vis
existing priority credit schemes and could lead to changes, long advocated by
the Bank, aimed at reducing the subsidy cost of these schemes. Also, for the
first time, resource mobilization is a specific and important objective; the
proposed loan would help reinforce BRI actions in this regard. The project
would also assist BRI in improving its systems and operational capabilities.
In addition, the project provides strong support for a scheme providing small
credit to the lower socio-economic levels of society, within the context of a
financially viable operation. The project can also provide a learning
experience for the Bank in structuring this type of very small credit program.
Risks
3.15      The project faces two risks.  The first is that of a deterioration
in the KUPEDES loan portfolio, particularly as the program expands. The
second is that of the KUPEDES credit process becoming bureaucratized as it
moves from relatively simple procedures, which do not target specific borrow-
ers, to more intricate application procedures, including specific lending
targets. Such a development could stifle the program and distort the basis
for making KUPEDES loans, as well as give scope for i..creased irregularities
by Unit Desa staff. BRI is most conscious of these risks and is developing
(with the assistance of the USAID and the Bank) a comprehensive training pro-
gram for staff and improvements in internal controls and monitoring of the
Unit Desa performance. The project provides support to BRI's policy to oper-
ate the Unit Desas as autonomous profit-oriented sub-branches which will no
longer participate in administered credit schemes. Given these efforts, the
energy and dedication of BRI management to making the Unit Desas a viable cor-
mercial operation, and COI's continuing commitment to developing a more open
financial system, the potential benefits of this project outweigh the risks.

IV. AGREMKENTS AND RECOMMENDATION
4.1       During negotiations, the following agreements and understandings
were confirmed v'ith BRI:
(a)  mod4fication of the interest rate structure for KUPEDES loans to
final borrowers woult be done only after consultation with the Bank
(para. 2.25);
(b)  a study would be undertaken by the Research and Planning Division
(with the assistance of the advisor in survey techniques and method-
ology, who will be recruited under the technical assistance cor-
ponent of the proposed Bank loan) to identify measures that may be
needed to induce greater demand for KUPEDES investment loans (para.
2.27). The study would be completed by March 31, 1988, and a time-
bound plan of action based on the study would be submitted to the
Bank by June 30, 1988 (para. 2.27);
(c)  BRI would incorporate into its Unit Desa Strategy Statement a clause
stating that maintaining a sound portfolio quality would receive
management's highest priority and that arrears of three months or
more past final installment due date of 62 or more would be
considered unsatisfactory performance. Should this level be
reached, BRI management would evaluate the overall programs and
organization of the Unit Desas with a view to redesigning ongoing
programs, organization and procedures to ensure the continued
financial viability of the Unit Desa system on an autonomous
basis. In the event that arrears of one day or more should exceed
82 over a six-month period, BRI would furnish the Bank within three
months, information relating to actions taken and its action plan to
reduce such arrears (para. 2.37);
(d)  no further BI liquidity credits for KUPEDES lending would be
obtained as long as there remained undisbursed funds under the
credit component of the proposed Bank loan (para. 3.5);
(e)  any drawdowns on additional BI liquidity credit between March 31,
1987, and loan effectiveness would be repaid over a period not to
exceed one year (para. 3.5);
(f)  the agreement between BI and BRI concerning the repayment by BRI of
liquidity credits outstanding as of March 1, 1987, would not be
changed without the Bank's agreement (para 3.5);
(g)  the position of Research and Planning Advisor would be filled by
October 31, 1987 (para. 3.7);
(h)  BRI would allocate to the Unit Desa Development Fund at least 502 of
the margin between the cost to itself of the Bank loan proceeds and
the onlending rate to the Unit Desas (para. 3.10);



- 37 -
(i) the formula for disbursement of Bank proceeds for KUPEDES loans
(para. 3.11); and
(j) the arrangement for asnual audit and quarterly reporting
(para. 3i3).
4.2       During negotiations, agreements and understandings were reached with
Government on the lending terms to BRI (para. 3.9).
4.3       Conditions of loan effectiveness are as follows:
(a) adoption of the Unit Desa Policy Statement and Unit Desa Strategy
Statement by BRI.'s Board of Managing Directors. The Statements
would not be amended without prior agreement of the Bank (para.
2.15); and
(b) the signing of a subsidiary loan agreement, satisfactory to the
Bank, between GOI and BRI (para. 3.9).
4.4       Recommendation.  Subject to the above conditions, the project is
suitable for a loan of $101.5 million to the Republic of Indonesia for 20
years, inc?ading a grace period of five years, at the standard variable
interest rate.

ANNEX 3
INDONESIA
BRI/KUPEDES SMALL CREDIT PROJECT
Bank Rakyat Indonesia Unit Desa Draft Policy Statement
BRI regards the provision of a broad range of banking services as
essential to promote rural economic development. BRI's basic objective for
the Unit Desas is that they become true financial intermediaries that are able
to moet the needs of the rural people for a wide variety of banking services--
not only credit, but also savings and other financial services--while
remining financially viable, able to operate without government or any other
subsidy. BRI's management of the Unit Desas will be guided by the following
principles:
(a) Rural credit should be available to any rural enterprise run by a
creditworthy person or to any creditworthy person. Credit should
not be targetted to particular activities chosen by someone other
than the loan applicants. The final decision on loan applicants
should be made by the bank based on sound banking considerations.
Loans made by Unit Desas for purposes other than directly productive
activities would not exceed 5% of all new loans.
(b) Interest rates on credit must be sufficient to cover all costs,
including the cost of unsubsidized funds, operating costs and loan
losses, and also provide a profit margin in order that the BRI Unit
Desas will remain financially sound and be able to develop their
activities.
(c) The BRI Unit Desas should offer a broad range of savings instruments
to encourage savings mobilization. These instruments should
normally offer positive real rates of interest structured according
to the ease of withdrawal under each instrument.
(d) The BRI Unit Desas should introduce other banking services as these
are needed by the rural people but should calculate carefully
whether their costs in providing these services can be covered.
(e) Convenient and ready access to banking services, which lowers
transaction costs to the borrower or saver, is important in
decisions by rural people to participate in the services offered by
formal financial intermediaries. The people look at total cost of
borrowing, not interest cost alone, when deciding whether to borrow
capital for their enterprises. They look at interest received minus
tr nsaction costs in deciding whether to save in a financial
institution. The BRI will attempt to provide Unit Desa services as
close to the villages as is economically possible.

INDOVESIA
BRI/KUPEDES SMALL CREDIT PROJECT
Bank Rakyat Indonesia Unit Desa Draft Strategy Statement
1. Funds Mobilization
In addition to providing credit to the rural communities, the BRI
Unit Desa also needs to mobilize financial resources from the rural
communities. The potential for funds mobilization from the rural areas is
large.
To mobilize these rural based funds, it is necessary to provide
instruments thatt meet several conditions including:
(a) instruments must be very liquid (unlimited withdrawals);
(b)  instruments must offer positive real interest rates.
In order to provide an instrument that satisfies these conditions, a
new savings program was developed by the BRI called "SIMPANAN PEDESAAN"
(SIMPEDES) or Village Savings Program. This instrument provides the two
conditions noted above, and in addition offers a lottery with prize drawings
held every six months. Separate lotteries are held in each Kabupaten
(District). This new scheme was tested successfully in 13 pilot branches
before going nationwide in June 1986.
In addition to the "SIMPEDES," the Unit Desas also offer other types
of savings instruments such as GIRO (demand deposits); DEPOSITO BERJANGKA
(Time Deposit); and TABANAS (passbook savings).
2. Reallocation of Resources
The initial locations of the BRI Unit Desas were based on the BIMAS
rice intensification program. Because of this, most locations were in agri-
cultural areas with irrigated rice production.
With the redefinition of the Unit Desas in order to make them
complete banking units offering lending, deposit, and other services to a
wide-based rural clientele, it has been necessary to reallocate the staff and
facilities according to redefined economic and geographic regions. A large
number of unit desas have been moved to locations that are more central to
rural economic activities, especially near market centers.
To continue to provide service to outlying areas and tap special
areas with high savings or lending potential, a new village post system has
been developed. Posts are located in the desas (villages), and operate as
windows of the BRI Unit Desas, which are in the Kecamatans. These posts are
open between one and 5-1/2 days per week, and are operated by a mobile team,

ANNEX 4
Page 2
consisting of one bookkeeper and one cashier from the BRI Unit Desa Induk
(Unit Desa main office).
3.   Incentives
BRI Unit Desa staff are now required to operate as professional
bankers. The quality of their judgment and the diligence with which they
perform their duties will determine the success of the Unit Desa. To
encourage good performance, a special incentive system has been adopted for
Unit Desa staff. This incentive is primarily based on profits. 102 of Unit
Desa profits are available to be paid as staff incentives (proportional to the
basic employee salary).
There is also an additional incentive on savings. One half of 12
(0.5Z) of savings mobilized in the rural areas is added to the above incentive
on profit. The total of the two types of incentives are given up to a maximum
of one month's salary.
4. BRI Unit Desa Development Fund
As an incentive to mobilize savings, the branches charge 22 more
than the TABANAS savings interest rate for liquidity credits given to Unit
Desas, and they pay 21 more than the TABANAS rate on Unit Degas' surplus
savings placed in the branches. Branches with a net balance of the amount
charged or liquidity credits provided to the Unit Desa over the amount paid on
savings placed with the Cabang will transfer this amount to the Unit Desa
Development fund at the BRI head office. Those branches with a deficit will
draw the amount from the Unit Desa Development Fund.
If there is a net balance in the centrally controlled fund, it will
be used for central expenditures in support of the Unit Desas such as:
advertising materials for SIMPEDES, KUPEDES, and other services; payments for
SIMPEDES prizes; the training of the Unit Dese staff and the branch super-
visory staff; printing of Unit Desa operational manuals; providing office
equipment to the Unit Desas, etc.
5. Monitoring of the Program
Monitoring and evaluating the program is extremely important in
order to ensure a smooth operation and to ensure objectives are met. This
monitoring and evaluating includes:
(a) A management information system designed to provide concise,
critical information on lending, savings, arrears, profitability,
numbers of borrowers and savers and other critical measures
affecting the operations of the BRI Unit Dseas;
(b)  The first line of monitoring authority is at the branch which is
specifically charged with the tasks of supervising the Unit Desas
and correcting any problems they find in the operation of the Unit
Desa. In addition, they have officers who analyze reports received
from the Unit Desas and check records at the Unit Desa as well as
spot checking records and procedures with clients.

ANIEX 4
Page 3
(c) The second line of monitoring authority is the regional office which
has the basic tasks of ensuring the Cabangs have understood and are
carrying out their monitoring and supervision responsibilities
correctly.
(d) The highest level of monitoring authority is at the head office.
There is a special section charged with the tasks of analyzing
reports on Unit Desa activities and keeping the Board of Directors
informed of the current situation. They also arrange special
surveys when the reports indicate problems may have arisen w.hich
require more field study to be understood and corrected.
6. Strategy for Further BRI Unit Dena Development in the Future
The first phase of BRI Unit Desa Development during the 1984-1986
period consisted of a large number of very fundamental changes in the nature
of the BRI Unit Dena System including:
(a) Reconstructing the system of accounts to separate the Unit Desas
from the Cabangs and make them accountable as individual profit
centers; (this change also involves charging the Unit Desas interest
for resources used and paying interest to the Unit Desas for
resources mobilized and deposited with the Cabangs.)
(b) Reallocating the staff resources of the unit desas in order to
create more strategic locations for the provision of banking
services;
Sc) Introducing a new major lending program not targetted to any
specific activity, but rather providing credit to any rural
enterprise run by a creditworthy person;
(d) Introducing new flexible savings services, especially through the
introduction of the new SIMPEDES program;
(e)  Redefining the role and functions of the Unit Desa staff to
encourage more professionalication and independent decision making;
and
(f) Rewarding Unit Desa staff on the basis of performance through the
creation of a profit-based, as well as a deposit mobilization-based,
incentive system.
This first phase has involved substantial change in the policies
affecting Unit Desa development. The next phase of Unit Desa development,
from 1987 to 1990, will be one of consolida.ing these fundamental changes.  In
this new phase, the emphasis will be on:
(a) Training: Well organized and comprehensive manuals will be
developed which cover Unit Desa administration, credit, savings
mobilization, and all other subjects necessary for the Unit Desa



- 47 -
AEX 4
Page 4
personnel to fully understand their responsibilities and to perform
theme in a relatively uniform way. Five regional training centers
vill be activated to provide training to all Unit Des& employees,
consisting of over 12,000 persons. During an initial three-year
phase, all employees will receive initial courses from 2 to 6 weeks
in length, and all employees will regularly receive training
upgrading of at least one week per year. Twenty-eight full time
trainers will be hired to staff these regional training centers.
(b)  Operational Systems Developent:  All administrative, reporting, a*r
accounting systems will be upgraded. An emphasis will be made to
create efficient systems with adequate controls. Special studies
will be undertaken to determine the feasibility of introducing
automated systems.
(c) Supervision: There will be a major effort to clarify and strengthen
the supervisory role of the Kantor Wilayah and Cabang. This will
include increasing their staff's ability to analyze data from the
Unit Desas and to understand and correct problems which arise in
particular Unit Desas. Supervision of the Unit Desas by staff from
the Wilayah and Cabang should in the future be based on a problem-
solving approach rather than rulesetting as in the past.
(d) Funds Mobilization: Efforts will be continued to increase savings
mobilization to enable a greater proportion of KUPEDES loans to be
financed out of these resources. Targets of at least 35X have been
set for 1987/1988 and 40Z for 1988/90.
BRI's management would implement such policies and procedures as are
conducive to the Unit Desas' maintaining a sound quality portfolio. However,
when arrears of three months or more past final installment due date reach 62
of the total loan portfolio, this would be considered unsatisfactory perfor-
mance and BRI's management would then evaluate the overall program and organi-
zation of the Unit Desas with a view to redesigning ongoing programs, organi-
sation, and procedures to ensure the continued financial viability of the Unit
Desa System on an autonomous basis.

Formula for Calculation of Relending Rate from GOI to BRI
1.        The interest rate payable by BRI to GOI on funds out of the Bank
loan will be a -ariable rate per annum equal to the average weighted interest
cost of BRI loanable funds arising out of its customer deposits (i.e.,
excluding free funds from government and parastatal agencies). This rate will
be determined accoarding to the following formula:
rT (T ) + rS (S ) + rD (MD )
x  =                              
t      (T  + S  +        D  (RT + R   D + RD
Definitions
t    =    the last day of the most recent month or quarter prior to an
Interest Period for which BI has consolidated data on the deposit
base of BRI
rD   =    interest payable on BRI demand deposits, at time t
T
rT    =    interest payable on BRI time deposits, at time t
S
rt   =    interest payable on BRI savings deposits, at time t
t
Dt        the amount of BRI demand deposits, at time t
Tt        the amount of BRI time deposits, at time t
St    =    the amount of BRI savings deposits, at time t
MDt  =    minimum average balance of demand deposits outstanding during
quarter immediately preceeding time t
RT        reserves on time deposits of BRI at t
t
Rs   =    reserves on savings deposits of BRI at t
t
RD         reserves on demand deposits of BRI at t
t
Xt    =    interest rate applicable on subsidiary loan (from GOI to BRI) for
each interest period
2.        Notwithstanding the above cost-of-funds formula, the relending rate
will not be less than the interest rate on the Bank loan plus a margin of
1.75%.

3.        The interest rate Xt shall be calculated for each interest period,
except that if, during an interest period, changes in the underlying para-

may, after consultation with the Bank, adopt for the rest of that interest
period the rate calculated on the basis of the most recently available data.

BRI/KUPEDES SMALL CREDIT PROJECT
Rationale for Disbursement Formula Adopted
for BRI/KUPEDES Small Credit Project
1.        Among the objectives of Bank support for the KUPEDES program are:
(a) To support a growing credit program;
(b) To encourage resource (savings) mobilization by the Unit Desas; and
(c) To replace additional BI liquidity credit.
Under the existing agreement with BI regarding the provision of liquidity
credit to BRI for the KUPEDES program, BRI is comitted to funding one third
of the increment in KUPEDES lending operations on the basis of the outstanding
KUPEDES loan portfolio. For every Rp 50.0 billion in liquidity credit
provided by BI, BRI must provide Rp 25.0 billion, either through additional
Unit Desas' TABENAS/SIMPEDES savings deposits and/or other BRI funds. In
other words, no growth in the KUPEDES program, no additional BI liquidity
credit; furthermore, no less than 33.3% of the incremental must be funded by
BRI (preferably, through savings mobilized by the Unit Desss).
2.        In arriving at a formula for disbursing the proposed Bank loan in
support of the KUPEDES loan program, the appraisal mission was concerned with
retaining the objectives/advantages inherent in the existing formula for
providing additional BI liquidity credits (which will no longer be available
once the Bank loan becomes effective). These objectives/advantages are:
(a)  funds can only be disbursed against an expanding KUPEDES loan
program - it does not maake any sense to provide additional funds to
BRI if total KUPEDES loan outstanding are stagnant or shrinking,
particularly since existing BI liquidity credits constitute a base
pool of stable long-term resources;
(b) BRI must provide a minimum and increasing percentage of the
incremental funds required for KUPEDES loans - this encourages BRI
to continue, and increase, resource mobilization efforts; and
(c) BRI would not be penalized if it raises more resources than needed
by a growing loan program - additional funds could be lent by Unit
Desas to the branches and successful savings mobilization efforts
are to be encouraged.
The mission was also concerned that the proposed formula should (i) not result
in the Bank financing more than 25% of KUPEDES loan disbursements during any
calendar year (in order to stay within indirect import/local cost guidelines
for Indonesia); yet (ii) still allow the Bank to finance a substantial portion



- 65 -
ANNEX 9
Page 2
(at least 50%) of the increase in total loan outstanding if that increase
resulted in substantial part from an increase in the average length of
maturity of new KUPEDES loans.
3.             The proposed formula meets all these concerns.  Thus, the Bank
would finance either
(a) 10% of new KUPEDES loan approvals for a given quarter with a ceiling
of 65% of the total increase in KUPEDES loan outstandings during the
first year of the project (BRI would finance the rest out of
mobilized savings). This ceiling would be reduced to 601 after the
first year of the project in order to encourage further the resource
mobilization efforts of the Unit Desas; or
(b) 50% of the total increase in KUPEDES loans outstandings (net of
provision for doubtful debt) if this is greater than the amount
calculated under (i) above.  This option is designed to enable the
Bank to prcvide a higher level of assistance (in terms of absolute
Rps.) to BRI in case of a rapid, large increase in total loans
outstanding resulting frt a substantial lengthening of average
KUPEDES loan maturities." Even in this case, however, it is
unlikely that Bank financing as a percentage of KUPEDES approvals
would exceed 20%.
Sensitivity tests indicate that option (i) will always be applicable during
the disbursement period of the proposed loan provided that the average
maturity of new KLPEDES loans does not increase substantially. Below are 3
examples to show hiw the formula works.
4.        Attachment I shows a simplified presentation of projected lending
operations with assumptions as outlined in the appraisal. The KUPEDES program
is growing with BRI committed to meeting a minimum level (i.e., 35% and 40%)
of annual KUPEDES funding requirements. Over a two-year period, total KUPEDES
disbursements would amount to Rp 1,564 billion with outstanding portfolio
increasing by R 195 billion (from Rp 400 billion to Rp 595 million). Of the
additional resources required to finance the growing portfolio, IBRD would
provide Rp 121.9 billion (or 62.5%) with BRI/Unit Desas providing the other
Rp 73.1 billion.
5.        Attachment 2 shows only a marginal increase in projected quarterly
disbursements over the two-year period (no change in assumed loan maturi-
ties). Total disbursements amount to Rp 1,287 billion; outstanding portfolio,
however, would increase by only Rp 65 billion (from Rp 400 billion to Rp 465
billion). Of the additional funding resources required (i.e., Rp 65 billion),
IBRD would finance Rp 40.8 billion (or 62.8%) with BRI/Unit Desas providing
the remaining Rp 24.2 billion.
1/   At the same time, this formula minimizes the amount of effective
refinancing undertaken by the Bank in the event that the KUPEDES
portfolio rapidly expands due to increasing arrears, since such arrears
would be provided for in the provision for doubtful debt.



- 66 -
ANNEX 9
Page 3
6.        Attachment 3 shows the same level of disbursements as assumed in the
appraisal, but assumes a doubling of average loan maturity.  Thus, while total
disbursements would still amount to Rp 1,564 billion (as in the case of
Annex 1), KUPEDES loans outstanding would increase by Rp 598 billion (from Rp
400 billion to Rp 978 billion) due to the lower level of repayments attributed
to the longer repayment periods. In this instance, IBRD would finance 50% of
the additional funding resources required, i.e., Rp 289 billion. Using the
10% of disbursements and minimum BRI contribution formula applied in the Annex
1 and 2 examples, IBRD would be able to provide only Rp 156.4 billion (or
27.1%) of the additional resources required to fund KUPEDES lending activities
over the two-year period. Under the alternative formula, IBRD is able to
provide a substantially greater amount of absolute Rp resource requirements
while BRI would also increase its level of participation (i.e., from 40% to
50%); at the same time, Bank disbursements as a percentage of total KUPEDES
loans would be slightly less than 19%.
