               (Third Technical Assistance Project) - Amendment
Dear Dr. Kiyonga:
     We refer to the Development Credit Agreement between the
Republic of Uganda (the Borrower) and the International Development
Association (the Association) dated November 14, 1988 and your
letter of May 22, whereby you requested the Association to waive the
provision under paragraph 3(d) of Schedule I to the Development
Credit Agreement concerning payments to the Economic Analysis Unit.
     Having reviewed your request, we propose that paragraph 3(d)
of Schedule I to the Development Credit Agreement be amended to read
as follows:
     "(d) expenditures under Category 6(a), made after June 30,
1992."
     Please confirm your agreement to the proposed amendment by
signing and returning to the Association a copy of this letter.
                         Sincerely,
                         Callisto E. Madavo
