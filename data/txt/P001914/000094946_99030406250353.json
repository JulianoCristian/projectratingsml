project is\n            satisfactory, as most project objectives were attained. Key\n            lessons learned from the projects are: 1) To facilitate\n            implementation, projects should not be too complex or\n            involve too many different agencies and activities. 2) A\n            full-time project coordinator is needed to implement complex\n            projects involving many agencies, donors, and activities. 3)\n            For complex projects involving many agencies, regular\n            meetings of a ministerial level body demonstrates Government\n            commitment to environmental protection and the project. 4)\n            Regular monthly meetings chaired by the agency responsible\n            for project coordination improves communications and helps\n            in quickly identifying problems and finding solutions. 5)\n            Project implementation benefits from the use of action\n            plans. 6) All preparatory activities should be completed\n            prior to signing the legal agreement. 7) Individual project\n            components should not be overly designed, but should match\n            the technical capabilities of countries. 8) Operations and\n            maintenance requirements should be estimated and sources of\n            financing identified prior to undertaking investments. 9)\n            The participatory and open process of decision-making\n            adopted in the project helps prevent corruption within\n            government, and strengthens democratic institutions overall."}, "docdt": "1998-12-14T00:00:00Z"}
