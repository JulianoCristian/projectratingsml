institutiional arrangements necessary to have physical\n            planning, land use control, infrastructure investments and\n            environmental protection managed in a coordinated and\n            rational way. The project would also enable the government\n            to take immediate remedial measures including selective\n            investments to reverse the trend of environmental\n            degradation and to develop a system of environmental\n            monitoring and analysis for setting environmental standards\n            and assessing the viability and cost-effectiveness of future\n            investments.  The components of the Environmental Investment\n            Proogram are 1) the National Physical Development Plan, 2)\n            environmental laboratories, 3) design and engineering\n            studies for an industrial park, 4) design and implementation\n            of a sanitary landfill site and rehabilitation of present\n            dumps, 5) integrated pest management and research, 6) marine\n            conservation, and 7) establishment of the Black River Gorges\n            National Park."}, "docdt": "1990-11-16T00:00:00Z"}
