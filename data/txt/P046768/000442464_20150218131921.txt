At the time of project preparation, forest-based traditional fuels (firewood and charcoal), mainly
used for household cooking purposes, represented 53 percent of Senegal's final energy
consumption. The bulk of the consumption of charcoal took place in the principal urban areas.
Over the years, the operation of the charcoal industry in Senegal had resulted in (i) the gradual
loss of forest cover (approximately 30,000 ha per year) degrading the ecosystem's carbon
sequestration capacity and biodiversity; (ii) the degradation of the rural environment (particularly
soils); (iii) the impoverishment of rural areas and an acceleration of rural exodus; and (iv) a
massive transfer of wealth from the rural communities to a few city-based woodfuel traders.
These negative impacts disproportionately affected rural women and children.




The project adopted a comprehensive approach, tackling both woodfuels' supply and demand, by
- Mapping forest resources, preparing participatory, sustainable forest management plans, and
training communities on how to implement them, over 300,000 hectares of forests in the
Tambacounda and Kolda regions, strengthening in the process the buffer zone around the
Niokolo-Koba National Park.
- Establishing GIS-based forestry monitoring and evaluation systems.
- Promoting private sector inter-fuel substitution and the use of improved stoves.
- Strengthening the institutions involved in the management of the sector, and promoting the
participation of civil society, with a special focus on women and mobilization opportunities at the
village and regional levels. Villages were made contractually responsible for the forests in the
project zone.




Demonstrated that the production and marketing of traditional biomass fuels can be
stabilized, while arresting deforestation, contributing to ecological conservation and
increasing village incomes. More than 20 percent of Senegal's woodfuel consumption in
2004 was derived from sustainably managed forests.


Highlights:
- Sustainable community-managed forests were established over an area of 378,161 ha
(exceeding project targets), supplying more than 370,000 tons per year of sustainable fuelwood.
- As an incentive for respecting sustainable forest plans, villagers benefited from rural
development and training schemes. Community-base micro enterprises were established
including beneficiary-operated improved carbonization units, apiculture cooperatives, collective
and individual agricultural diversification units/systems; livestock and poultry-raising, arts and
crafts units, etc. While woodfuel and large liverstock activities where mostly led by men, all other
activities where generally managed and operated directly by women.
- Established a sustainable incremental income generation base (wood and non-wood products)
of about US$12.5 million per year, equivalent to a $40,000 average per participating village. Of
that total, more than 30 percent resulted from women-led economic activities.
- More than 20 percent of Senegal's energy supplies were derived effectively from renewable
resources in the form of sustainable woodfuels in 2004. (That share has increased to 50 percent
today with the introduction of sustainable green wood cutting in an eight-year rotation program).
- Inter-fuel substitutions (switching from charcoal to kerosene and LPG) and improved stoves
directly benefited some 250,000 families in the principal urban and peri-urban areas of Senegal,
reducing negative health effects associated with in-door pollution.
- Training and micro-credit schemes helped create an economically viable market for improved
stoves.




- IDA contributed US$5.2 million of US$19.8 million project cost.
- Pioneered the use of GIS for the development of community-based participatory forest and
natural resource management schemes.
- Introduced community-based rural development approaches that will be replicated in non-
forested areas, where central economic activity will be agriculture, fisheries, or other.




From project preparation to supervision, the World Bank worked in close collaboration with the
Dutch Co-operation agency (DGIS) which contributed US$8.8 million. The Global Environment
Facility also co-financed the project (US$4.7 million).




- The establishment of a sustainable and diversified income base and the generation of a
productive demand for energy have made the 317 project zone villages prime candidates for
rural electrification and increased access to other modern energy services.
- A second transitional phase of this project is now under implementation, covering an additional
269,000 has. A second project is expected to expand the successful community-based and
participatory PROGEDE model to other parts of Senegal starting in 2008.
