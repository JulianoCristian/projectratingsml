(ii) the\n            degradation of the rural environment (particularly soils);\n            (iii) the impoverishment of rural areas and an acceleration\n            of rural exodus; and (iv) a massive transfer of wealth from\n            the rural communities to a few city-based wood fuel traders.\n            The project adopted a comprehensive approach, tackling both\n            wood fuels' supply and demand, by - mapping forest\n            resources, preparing participatory, sustainable forest\n            management plans, and training communities on how to\n            implement them, over 300,000 hectares of forests in the\n            Tambacounda and Kolda regions, strengthening in the process\n            the buffer zone around the Niokolo-Koba national park. It\n            was demonstrated that the production and marketing of\n            traditional biomass fuels can be stabilized, while arresting\n            deforestation, contributing to ecological conservation, and\n            increasing village incomes.
