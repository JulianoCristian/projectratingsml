A series of important\n            lessons are distilled that are of direct relevance to\n            African countries. They concern: 1) the sustainability of\n            traditional energy supply systems; 2) the dependence of the\n            traditional energy sector on the implementation of\n            comprehensive changes in the woodfuels supply systems and\n            chains; 3) the importance of community-based natural\n            resource management; 4) the necessity of a minimum policy\n            platform for underpinning a well-functioning traditional\n            energy supply system; 5) the risk that unmanaged zones and\n            unregulated producers might undermine the sustainability of\n            the country's resource base and interfere with the\n            competitiveness of the managed production zones; 6) the\n            success of the intervention model based on a multi-sectoral\n            community driven development and asset-based development\n            approach, promotion of economic diversification at the\n            village level, valorization of the natural resources base,\n            full mobilization of the gender potential, strong\n            beneficiary capacity and institution building, focus on\n            developing functional capacity, and sequencing of assistance\n            and investment support; 7) identification of specific gender\n            investments in the health, nutrition, and education sectors;\n            8) community-based biomass energy management is a gateway to\n            increasing rural access to modern energy services; and 9)\n            continuity in Bank teams could improve the quality and\n            impact of poverty alleviation."}, "docdt": "2005-06-20T00:00:00Z"}
