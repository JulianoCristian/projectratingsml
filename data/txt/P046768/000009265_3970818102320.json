Participatory Energy Management Project is to meet an\n            important part of the rapidly growing urban demand for\n            household fuels, without the loss of forest cover and the\n            ecosystem's carbon sequestration potential and\n            biodiversity. The project will: (1) implement and monitor\n            environmentally sustainable community-managed forest\n            resource systems, creating a protection zone around the\n            Niokolo-Koba National Park; (2) promote inter-fuel\n            substitution and improved stoves initiatives; (3) strengthen\n            the institutions involved in managing the sector, and\n            promote the participation of the civil society (private\n            sector, academic institutions, and nongovernmental\n            organizations (NGO)) in operating the sector. The project\n            will finance: (1) an assessment of vegetation cover, an\n            assessment of dead wood and other preparatory activities;\n            (2) community-based forest management activities; (3)\n            promotion of rural-based micro-enterprises and private\n            sector and NGO-based inter-fuel substitution activities; (4)\n            consultant services for supervision work, delivery of\n            services, and various technical studies; (5) technical\n            assistance; and (6) materials, equipment, and goods."}, "docdt": "1997-05-23T00:00:00Z"}
