The project was designed to improve the water\n            supply and sanitation conditions in some of the poorest\n            rural communities of Indonesia. It was expected that\n            improved access to safe and reliable water supply and\n            sanitation facilities, along with the provision of hygiene\n            and sanitation education would result in improved health and\n            increased productivity of the community members. Community\n            participation was encouraged in all phases of the project,\n            from project design to implementation and maintenance.\n            Mechanisms such as meetings, community surveys, focus group\n            discussion, training, and capacity-building exercises\n            facilitated active community involvement. Information\n            sharing and dissemination was ensured through community\n            notices and updates on project rules, roles, and\n            responsibilities. Such data sharing also induced\n            transparency in the project's activities. WSSLIC was\n            completed in September 1999 and contributed substantially to\n            improve the water supply and sanitation facilities in rural\n            communities, although sanitation and hygiene education did\n            not result in any major behavioral changes. Some of the\n            other issues that remained partially unresolved were\n            administrative and fund channeling arrangements, mechanisms\n            to encourage the active participation of women, and the\n            delegation of community control over the water supply and\n            sanitation systems. The Second Water Supply and Sanitation\n            Project (WSSLIC 2) began operation in 2000. The project\n            builds on the drawbacks and lessons learnt from WSSLIC and\n            other rural infrastructure development projects in Indonesia."}, "docdt": "2003-01-01T00:00:00Z"}
