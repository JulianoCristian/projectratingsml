The\n            project serves about 2 million people living in selected\n            rural and urban low-income communities in six provinces.\n            Provincial level poverty status is the main consideration\n            for selecting these provinces. The project comprises two\n            broad components. The first component, water supply,\n            provides safe water to about 2 million people in about 1,400\n            communities. This includes construction of piped systems\n            (spring capture, groundwater, and surface) and non-piped\n            systems (protected dug wells, protected springs, shallow and\n            deep wells with hand pumps, rainwater collectors, and\n            appropriate systems). About 10 percent of the water supply\n            component provides for rehabilitation of existing\n            facilities. The second component, sanitation, provides\n            appropriate sanitation facilities to approximately 1.7\n            million people through a process of demonstration, training,\n            and promotion to encourage beneficiary and private-sector\n            participation in constructing and financing sanitation facilities."}, "docdt": "1993-05-27T00:00:00Z"}
