Lessons are addressed under three\n            categories: underlying theory and assumptions; project\n            design; and, project implementation. First, the reasoning\n            behind most water supply, and sanitation projects is that\n            water is a public good with impact on health, whereas\n            sanitation is considered a private good. Though not\n            explicit, this implies that while water supply should be\n            subsidized (or publicly intervened), sanitation remain a\n            personal decision matter, thus the project actively\n            challenged sanitary integration through the inclusion of a\n            hygiene and sanitation education component, stimulating a\n            household package for latrine construction. Second,\n            operations like this one, should use simple project design\n            schemes, relying on community participation, through proper\n            training, and technical support; but, accountability for\n            funds allocation, should be centrally channeled,\n            particularly if inter-governmental coordination is\n            politically, or technically weak. It is emphasized that\n            reliable, and timely data collection is required for a\n            continuous hands-on operation, and corrective changes,\n            avoiding comparable data which may be hindered by variable\n            methods. Third, project implementation should consider both\n            political, and logistic criteria; ensure monitoring and\n            evaluation; and, balance institutional arrangements between\n            limited cost overruns, and procedures."}, "docdt": "2000-06-16T00:00:00Z"}
