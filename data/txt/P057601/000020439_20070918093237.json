follows: outcomes\n            were moderately satisfactory, the risk to development\n            outcome was high, the Bank performance was satisfactory, and\n            the Borrower performance was moderately satisfactory. Some\n            lessons learned included: the implementation of financial\n            administration reform projects benefit from the support from\n            high-level political actors within Ministries of Finance; in\n            spite of difficult political and economic circumstances,\n            these projects have high chances of survival because of the\n            strong interest of the government to obtain and utilize on\n            reliable information; flexibility during design and\n            implementation is essential to better reflect variance in\n            the government priorities and needs; bank management should\n            ensure the quality of documentation of Bank operations and\n            the effective transfer of knowledge and the records from one\n            task team to another; political changes have considerable\n            impact on project design and implementation; project\n            approval or signing around the time of a Presidential\n            election or inauguration may be counterproductive even for\n            technically sound operations; frequent or sudden changes in\n            Task Manager may also be counterproductive; and\n            participation and consultation devices are required at all\n            stages of the project cycle."}, "docdt": "2007-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
