        and changes in prices and purchase policy, and strengthen\n            agricultural policy-making mechanism. The project comprises:\n            (i) rehabilitation of godowns and silos; (ii) construction\n            of storage capacity; (iii) tarpaulins and polythene sheets;\n            (iv) pilot programs for controlled open storage and dryers;\n            (v) expansion of maize milling capacity; (vi) rehabilitation\n            of existing mills; (vii) laboratory facilities for grain and\n            flour analysis; (viii) lorries, radio communication network,\n            utility vehicles, passenger cars, and motorcycles; (ix)\n            staff training; (x) technical assistance to improve\n            management, information systems, and planning; and (xi)\n            financing for staff, vehicles, equipment, surveys and\n            analytic work for the Marketing Development Bureau and the\n            Project Preparation and Monitoring Bureau. The investment\n            would improve management practices and strengthen the\n            institutional capacity of NMC to procure, transport, store,\n            and mill foodcrops."}, "docdt": "1980-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
