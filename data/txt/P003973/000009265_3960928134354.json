1993. The\n            project objectives are fivefold : 1) provide interface\n            equipment to fully utilize network capacity and connect\n            approximately 125,000 main lines; 2) modernize and expand\n            the local telephone network to connect 475,000 main lines;\n            3) provide computer systems to modernize and improve network\n            management systems in Jakarta and six other major cities; 4)\n            support ( with UNDP ) a training improvement program to\n            upgrade training facilities at the center at Bandung and 12\n            other regional centers; and 5) provide technical assistance\n            to a) improve sector management capabilities; b) help\n            PERUMTEL build managerial, financial and technical\n            capabilities essential for efficient management and c)\n            finance consultancy services to help develop inhouse\n            capabilities in project management and construction\n            supervision.  There are three main components, which are :\n            1) local switching ( 630,000 units of telephone switching\n            equipment to be installed in 250 locations ); 2) outside\n            plant facilities ( local cable network, interexchange links\n            of multi - exchange areas in seven cities ); 3) computerized\n            network administration system; 4) outside plant maintenance\n            center ( OPMC ); and 5) capacity utilization of all existing\n            telecommunications facilities."}, "docdt": "1990-03-06T00:00:00Z"}
