The primary development objectives of the project\n            were defined as follows: (a) to assist the GOI in improving\n            overall management of the sector; (b) enhance Perusahaan\n            Umum Telekomuinikasi, PERUMTEL\u2019s (Telecommunications Public\n            Corporation) institutional capability; and (c) support\n            cost-effective and efficient implementation of a large\n            investment program. The performance of the Borrower, the\n            Beneficiary and of the Bank were all highly satisfactory.\n            Three important lessons were learned during the\n            implementation of the project : (i) first,is active\n            participation and commitment of all stakeholders not only\n            during implementation but also preparation are prerequisites\n            for success in reforming of public utilities operating in\n            monopoly environment; (ii) second lesson, continuity of\n            competent and committed personnel, with proper skill mix, at\n            the Borrower, Project Entity, and the Bank, and above all,\n            decisive leadership by the Borrower are critical to the\n            creation of mutual trust and understanding for resolving the\n            many sensitive issues involved in sector reform of large\n            public utilities; (iii) third, inclusion of policy\n            conditionality\u2019s in loan agreements is not a pre-requisite\n            to effective Bank intervention on major policy issues or\n            assurance that agreed policy reforms are undertaken."}, "docdt": "1997-06-23T00:00:00Z"}
