   installation of trunk water mains as well as additional\n            storage and pumping facilities; (iii) rehabilitation of\n            existing treatment plants at 9 locations and 106 boreholes\n            and wells including the installation of new chlorination\n            equipment; (iv) leak detection and repair of selected\n            sections of the existing distribution system with serial\n            extensions as required; (v) rehabilitation of about 4000\n            public standpipes with provision of proper drainage\n            facilities to reduce current pollution risks; (vi) provision\n            of headquarters and five district center buildings, staff\n            housing, vehicles and equipment; and (vii) procurement and\n            installation
