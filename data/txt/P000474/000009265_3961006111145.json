productivity, by expanding animal health\n            services; 2) to alleviate poverty among herders, by\n            rebuilding herds of viable size and broadening their\n            activities to include crop farming; 3) to strengthen the\n            livestock sector's professional organizations, through\n            the democratization of their operations and the\n            decentralization of the decision making process; and 4) to\n            ensure the sustainable management of natural resources. The\n            project is designed around two main lines of action: 1)\n            implementation of administrative and policy reforms and 2)\n            financial support for a package of development activities.\n            The project will finance the following six major components:\n            1) rationalizing rangeland management by setting up and\n            administering 21 Agro-Pastoral Action Areas ; 2)\n            strengthening the animal health services and setting up\n            veterinary checkpoints at the country's borders; 3)\n            implementing a grassroots capacity development program among\n            herders and their wives to help them organize themselves\n            into herding interest groups or mixed farming interest\n            groups ; 4) setting up and running a mutual savings and loan\n            scheme and a line of financial assistance for herd\n            rebuilding; 5) technical support to livestock activities;\n            and 6) ensuring the proper administration of the above\n            activities by providing training of supervisory staff and\n            directing project administration costs."}, "docdt": "1994-12-01T00:00:00Z"}
