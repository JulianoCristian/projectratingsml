                         To date, nine of the 11 schools (including three with emergency shelters) planned for construction have been rebuilt in accordance with the civil works contracts. Of the remaining two
                         schools, one (with an emergency shelter) is expected to be completed by the endof April 2012, and the other is showing critical delays and requires specific measures to ensure that
                         the works are completed by May 31, 2012. Additional construction works are underway on all 11 schools to ensure better functionality of the infrastructure. These additional works are
                         expected to be completed by Project closing on all schools.

                         It is expected that the Project Development Objective (PDO) indicator will be met for at least 10 of the 11 schools; two of the completed schools have reopened and are receiving

                         numbers of students attending these schools in 2010 and on the student capacity of the newly built structures, it is expected that all 11 schools (once rebuilt) will meet or surpass the
                         target occupation rate of 75% within six months of closing.

                         It was decided to organize the National NAPSS Workshop on May 10, 2012, with the primary objectives of collecting key stakeholder opinions and reaching an agreement on key
                         education policies for the NAPSS. It was also agreed in March 2012 that the Ministry of Education and Vocational training (MENFP) will lead the NAPSS process, with continued
                         technical support from FAES until Project closing, to ensure a broader inclusion of all stakeholders and to reinforce the process of establishing the NAPSS.
