                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The Project is currently on track for closing in December 2011. Construction is underway for all 11 schools, with the status of the works at over 50% completion on most schools, and
                         contracts have been negotiated with firms that will supervise construction for all schools. The Project has also made some good progress in the elaboration of the National Plan of
                         Action for Safe Schools, which will play a pivotal role in the reconstruction effort in the education sector in the post-earthquake context.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The Project restructuring, requested by the Government of Haiti, was finalized in May 2011. Key elements of the restructuring included a reduction in the number of schools built and
                         schools retrofitted as emergency shelters, due to increased unit costs for school construction following the 2010 earthquake; as well as a revision of many target dates, for instance
                         for completion of the National Action Plan for Safe Schools.
