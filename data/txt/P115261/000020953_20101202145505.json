PURES comprises two\n            components. The first one aimed to restore the offer of\n            primary schools and the second will allow to reduce and to\n            mitigate the vulnerability of scholastic facilities in\n            Haiti. The ESMF will permit to guide environmental and\n            social management activities and sub-activities likely to be\n            supported by the project, and help ensure as well the\n            conformity with the national environmental legislation as\n            the requirements of the World Bank Safeguard Policies.  The\n            ESMF includes an analysis of the national environmental\n            institutional and legal framework in which the PURES will be\n            carried out. In the project context, the impacts could\n            depend on the state, the status and the characteristics of\n            the chosen site, but also on the importance of the works.\n            The project\u0092s negative environmental impacts will mostly\n            result from the building and renovation of the\n            infrastructures (schools, toilets; water points). In\n            summary, the project negative impacts could be linked to the\n            poor choices of sites; to trees\u0092 cutting in order to clear\n            the new building sites; to the conflicts or potential\n            litigations during lands acquisition and occupation; to\n            pollutions and nuisances on bordering populations and\n            workers during jobs; to risks of accident; to unemployed of\n            potential local workers. Diverse kinds of pollution\n            (anarchic discharge of solid and liquid wastes from building\n            sites: rubbles and clearings from sites preparation,\n            excavation, foundations, oil change from engines; etc.)\n            caused by building activities can contribute to soil and\n            waters natural degradation. In the schools functioning\n            stage, the potential adverse impacts are as follow:\n            deterioration of equipment; precariousness of scholastic\n            hygiene; poor quality of accomplished works and especially\n            the insufficiency of motivation of the teachers.\n            Nevertheless, these adverse impacts should be moderate or minor."}, "docdt": "2010-09-01T00:00:00Z"}
