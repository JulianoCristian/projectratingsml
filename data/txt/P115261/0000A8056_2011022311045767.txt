                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The Project continues to suffer from the delays caused by the earthquake of January 2010. Nonetheless, the Project successfully completed the site identification and pre-
                         qualification procedures for 11 primary school. The architects were recruited and presented their final project designs for nine of the 11 schools. Civil works for the construction of six
                         schools is expected to begin in March. The Project has also made some good progress in the elaboration of the National Plan of Action for Safe Schools, which will play a pivotal role
                         in the reconstruction effort in the education sector in the post-earthquake context.
