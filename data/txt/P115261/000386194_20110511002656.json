The major change to the Project\n            and rationale is a revision of the results framework,\n            especially of most targets and target dates, largely due to\n            an increase in unit costs due to increased demand for\n            construction and construction materials and the addition of\n            more stringent building standards following the January 2010\n            earthquake. The project was approved on March 5, 2009 and\n            became effective on June 25, 2009. It was designed to\n            respond quickly and effectively to the damage caused to\n            education sector infrastructure by the hurricanes that\n            struck Haiti in August and September of 2008. The Project\n            consists of two components. Prior to the January 2010\n            earthquake, the project experienced delays with regard to\n            component  which aimed to 'build back better'\n            selected destroyed and heavily damaged public primary\n            schools, including upgrading and adapting select schools as\n            temporary emergency shelters on a pilot basis. With the\n            introduction of more stringent construction norms, the high\n            demand for construction firms and the high cost of\n            construction materials, unit cost for school construction is\n            expected to increase to a range of US$300,000-US$350,000\n            from a range of US$200,000-US$250,000 estimated during\n            project appraisal. These new costs have been found to\n            compare favorably with those of other current school\n            construction programs in Haiti and thus still provide\n            cost-effective solutions. There is no change in financing\n            that will be allocated to either of the two project\n            components. The increase in unit costs has been offset by a\n            corresponding reduction in the number of schools and\n            emergency shelters to be built. In addition, some of the\n            increase in costs will be offset by the increased value of\n            the grant in US$."}, "docdt": "2011-05-03T00:00:00Z"}
