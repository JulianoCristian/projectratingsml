            EMERGENCY SCHOOL RECONSTRUCTION PROJECT

                             RESTRUCTURING PAPER



  A. SUMMARY

1.     The major change to the Project and rationale is a revision of the results
framework, especially of most targets and target dates, largely due to an increase in unit
costs due to increased demand for construction and construction materials and the
addition of more stringent building standards following the January 2010 earthquake.

  B. PROJECT STATUS

2.     The Project was approved on March 5, 2009 and became effective on June 25,
2009. It was designed to respond quickly and effectively to the damage caused to
education sector infrastructure by the hurricanes that struck Haiti in August and
September of 2008. Using the strategic approach of “building back better”, the Project
aimed to: (i) rebuild and refurbish an estimated 15-20 public primary schools; (ii) reduce
and mitigate the vulnerability of educational infrastructure; (iii) elaborate a National
Action Plan for Safe Schools (NAPSS); and (iv) build the capacity of the MENFP Civil
Works Unit (DGS – Direction du Génie Scolaire). Through these activities the Project
was expected to contribute to developing, demonstrating and disseminating improved
standards and methods of safe school construction.

3.      The Project consists of two components. Prior to the January 2010 earthquake, the
Project experienced delays with regard to Component 1, which aimed to “build back
better” selected destroyed and/or heavily damaged public primary schools, including
upgrading and adapting select schools as temporary emergency shelters on a pilot basis.
In the beginning of the summer of 2009, the DGS began pre-selection of school sites,
which consisted of: (i) conducting a pre-feasibility study for the civil works; (ii)
community consultations; (iii) verifying school and land ownership; and (iv)
environmental and social assessments. The pre-qualification process was expected to be
completed by the end of the summer of 2009, but took an additional three months, ending
in November 2009. The list of selected schools was then approved by the Minister in
November 2009. It was agreed between the Minister of Education and the implementing
agency—the Fund for Social and Economic Assistance (FAES)—that a first group of 11
schools would be identified for construction, including four upgraded with temporary
emergency shelters. The remaining pre-qualifications were postponed given the length of
the process, and until more concrete construction cost figures could be obtained.

4.     In December 2009, FAES began selection of the architects responsible for
preparing technical feasibility studies to be used for the preparation of bidding
documents. However, the January 2010 earthquake interrupted all Project activities for a

                                            1
period of three months, until early April 2010. FAES subsequently re-launched the
selection process for architects, and the contracts were signed in June 2010. The
technical feasibility studies were completed in December 2010.

5.      In addition to anti-hurricane norms, which were already in the purview of the
Project, following the earthquake the MENFP requested the incorporation of anti-seismic
norms into the architectural plans of the selected schools and shelters. It, thus, became
necessary to undertake geotechnical soil studies on each site before any construction
could begin, as soil quality is an important aspect of the ability of a structure to resist
seismic forces. For this activity FAES recruited the National Laboratory of Construction
and Public Works, (LNBTP – Laboratoire National du Bâtiment et des Travaux Publics)
which is the only entity in Haiti mandated to undertake soil analyses, and has been highly
solicited following the earthquake. Due to its heavy work load, the LNBTP only began
its missions in the summer of 2010, and submitted the results of its analyses at the end of
November 2010. The results of these analyses were taken into account by the architects
in the technical feasibility studies. The bidding process for the civil works for nine
schools is complete, with contracts signed and construction activities underway. Bidding
is nearly complete for the two other schools approved in November 2009.

6.      With respect to Component 2 of the Project, which aims to reduce and mitigate
the vulnerability of educational infrastructure including by supporting the development
and adoption of a National Action Plan for Safe Schools (NAPSS) as well as to
strengthen the capacity of the DGS, FAES has remained relatively on track with the
established implementation calendar and the component is advancing satisfactorily. To
promote community participation and the proper use and maintenance of the new
educational infrastructure, the Project hired and is training nine community development
specialists to develop and deliver appropriate training at the community level. Radio
spots have been broadcast to promote community knowledge of and participation in the
Project.    A vulnerability assessment and risk analysis of existing educational
infrastructure has been completed and the related report published. A multi-stakeholder
Task Force has been constituted to guide the creation and application of the NAPSS, and
planning is underway for the national workshop that will collect feedback from
stakeholders that will feed into the NAPSS.

7.        Finally, although there were some earthquake-related delays, Component 2
activities aimed at strengthening the physical and human resources capacities of the DGS
are currently advancing satisfactorily: office materials and vehicles have been acquired,
and the rehabilitation of the DGS office building, which was structurally damaged by the
earthquake, was completed in November 2010. With respect to the human resource
capacities of the DGS, several training sessions have been organized for DGS staff,
including training on assessing the vulnerability of school infrastructure and a session on
leadership and team spirit; several additional training sessions are planned at the request
of the DGS and as designed by the Project. The DGS is undertaking missions to assess
the vulnerabilities of school construction in two regions using newly acquired skills and
evaluation tools created by the Project.

    C. PROPOSED CHANGES

Project Cost

8.      With the introduction of more stringent construction norms, the high demand for
construction firms and the high cost of construction materials, unit cost for school
construction is expected to increase to a range of US$300,000-US$350,000 from a range
of US$200,000-US$250,000 estimated during Project appraisal. These new costs have
been found to compare favorably with those of other current school construction
programs in Haiti and thus still provide cost-effective solutions. There is no change in
financing that will be allocated to either of the two Project components. The increase in
unit costs has been offset by a corresponding reduction in the number of schools and
emergency shelters to be built. In addition, some of the increase in costs will be offset by
the increased value of the grant in US$. The total value of the grant as of March 31, 2011
is US$5.38 million compared to US$5.0 million when the Project was approved due to a
favorable difference in the exchange rate between the SDR, the currency in which the
grant is denominated, and the US$1. Finally, there will be no increase in Project
management costs because the implementing agency FAES is paid a flat fee of 10 percent
based on the value of the grant, regardless of the implementation period of the grant.

Results/Indicators

9.      The Project includes one Project outcome indicator and nine intermediate
outcome indicators. The Project outcome indicator and its target date have been revised.
There have also been changes in all nine intermediate outcome indicators (see Annex 1
for the revised Results Framework):

(a)     Outcome indicator: The wording of the indicator has been changed to reflect the
fact that, although it is difficult to determine the precise date of delivery of completed
schools, it is expected that schools will begin operating as soon as construction is
completed. Since the Project is expected to close before the completion of one whole
school year, and in order to ensure this indicator is measurable, the indicator should be
measured within six months of Project closing rather than at the end of the school year
following completion of the civil works.

        •    Original indicator: Occupation rate of rebuilt schools will be maintained at
             75% or above during the next school year following completion of civil
             works.

        •    Revised indicator: Occupation rate of rebuilt schools will be maintained at
             75% or above following completion of civil works, as measured within six
             months of Project closing.

 The SDR/US$ exchange rate was US$1.47 for 1 SDR on February 17, 2009 and it was US$1.59 for 1
SDR on April 19, 2011.


                                                3
                                 (b) Intermediate outcome indicators:
                                     There have been changes in all nine
                                     Intermediate      Outcome      Indicators.
                                     Targets and/or target dates have been
                                     revised for 7 of these indicators because
                                     the substantial cost increase means that
                                     the Project funding will only be
                                     sufficient for the construction of 11
                                     schools and four shelters against the
                                     original target of 15 schools and five
                                     shelters. It is expected that civil works
                                     will take between six and nine months.
                                     Because of the delays and reductions in
                                     the civil works, other Project activities
                                     will also be delayed and/or reduced in
                                     scope. For example, with the reduction
                                     in the number of schools to be
                                     constructed, additional schools will not
                                     be pre-qualified, so the original target
                                     for prequalification in 2010 has become
                                     irrelevant. In addition, one of the
                                     original targets outside of the Project
                                     scope has now been revised to reflect
                                     what the Project could monitor
                                     realistically. It is not in the Project
                                     scope to monitor that other donors use
                                     the NAPSS. Rather, the Project seeks to
                                     prepare the NAPSS for its adoption by
                                     the MENFP and presentation to the
                                     donor community.

           • Revised target and target dates: 0 DGS staff
             trained to become Master Trainers in 2009; 0 DGS
             staff trained to become Master Trainers in 2010;
             10 DGS staff trained to become Master Trainers in
             2011.
10.     In addition, the wording of two of the Intermediate Outcome Indicators has
changed, as well as their targets and target dates. One indicator has been changed to
clarify what the Project can realistically accomplish. It is not possible to ensure that other

11.     The other indicator has changed to remove redundant language. The words
“training materials, guides and other materials” have been deleted since these materials
are sub-categories of training modules. The words “at the national and the local level”
have been deleted since the indicator already refers to “all” schools.

               materials, guides and other materials on measures to increase safety in all
               schools at the national and local level. Set of training materials developed
               in 2009; Training materials disseminated in 2010 and 2011.
