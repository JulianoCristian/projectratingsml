1.    The closing date for the Emergency School Reconstruction Project, International
Development Association (IDA) Grant No. H460-0-HT, P115261, will be extended from
December 30, 2011 until May 31, 2012.
2.       Project implementation is advanced despite some delays, and Project objectives
continue to be achievable within the revised timeframe. Under Component 1,
construction is underway on all 11 schools (including four with emergency shelters)
selected for reconstruction. Nine of the 11 schools are 50 percent or more physically
complete, with some schools scheduled to be ready by the end of December 2011. The
start of construction was delayed at the remaining two sites; at these sites construction is
now at 25 and 45 percent physical completion, respectively. With respect to Component
2, most planned activities have been completed, including those related to the capacity
strengthening of the Direction du Génie Scolaire (Directorate of School Infrastructure).
The first draft of the National Action Plan for Safe Schools was presented on December
6, and is on track for eventual adoption.
3.     The proposed extension is necessary primarily to allow completion of the school
construction activities which were delayed, first due to the 2010 earthquake, and
subsequently due to additional complications on construction sites and a disruptive rainy
season in 2011. The Borrower has established an updated and realistic action plan for
completion of these activities. It is expected that works will be completed on all schools
by end of March 2012.
4.      This     will     be      the      first    extension       of     the      Project.
