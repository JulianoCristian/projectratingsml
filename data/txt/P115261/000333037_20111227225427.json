The proposed extension is\n            necessary primarily to allow completion of the school\n            construction activities which were delayed, first due to the\n            2010 earthquake, and subsequently due to additional\n            complications on construction sites and a disruptive rainy\n            season in 2011. The borrower has established an updated and\n            realistic action plan for completion of these activities. It\n            is expected that works will be completed on all schools by\n            end of March 2012. This will be the first extension of the project."}, "docdt": "2011-12-27T00:00:00Z"}
