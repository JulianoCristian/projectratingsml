Some lessons learned included: in\n            natural disaster-afflicted areas, it is important to build\n            for quality even if it requires that fewer schools be built.\n            Although Haiti suffered from devastating natural disasters\n            and fundamentally agreed on the need for greater safety in\n            schools, it has still proven difficult to develop a\n            comprehensive National Action Plan for Safer Schools. This\n            difficulty can be traced to the fact that ownership and\n            commitment from MENFP (Ministere de L'Education\n            Nationale et de la Formation Professionelle - Ministry of\n            Education) was lacking from the beginning. Although\n            implementing agencies had the capacity to build and\n            supervise the building of schools, there needed to be a\n            closer review of designs for schools. The Bank could make\n            greater use of its skills and resources in reviewing and\n            improving local designs. The MENFP did not maximize the\n            opportunity for the demonstration effect of the construction\n            of new schools. In particular, it was not clear to other\n            stakeholders whether the Project was presenting a new model\n            for construction of schools that would be financed by other\n            donors, or whether the new schools were simply a\n            demonstration of what could be built with local capacity."}, "docdt": "2012-11-30T00:00:00Z"}
