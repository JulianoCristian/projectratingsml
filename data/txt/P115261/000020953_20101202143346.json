The project objective is\n            to support the Government of Haiti to (i) restore the access\n            to fundamental education in chosen public primary schools\n            harmed by the hurricanes of August and September, 2008 and\n            (ii) develop, show and disseminate norms and improved\n            methods for building of safe schools. PURES comprises two\n            components. The first one aimed to restore the offer of\n            primary schools and the second will allow to reduce and to\n            mitigate the vulnerability of scholastic facilities in\n            Haiti. However, the PURES activities could have social\n            negative impacts and require the application of\n            environmental and social protection operational\n            instructions. That is why the wording of this project\n            provided for the development of a Resettlement Policy\n            Framework (RPF) which is the purpose of this study. The\n            Resettlement Policy Framework describes the objectives,\n            principles and procedures which frame the means of obtaining\n            the lands for infrastructures utilities setting up. The RPF\n            clarifies the rules that are applicable to the\n            identification of the people who are likely to be involved\n            in the PURES activities implementation. There are no long\n            term impacts anticipated with the construction or\n            rehabilitation of schools. As the sites are already\n            identified, the risks to destroy buildings and houses are\n            practically nonexistent. Nevertheless, on the bare fields,\n            certain activities could have moderate or social negative\n            minor impacts, notably on the agrarian lands (destruction of\n            culture fields)."}, "docdt": "2010-08-01T00:00:00Z"}
