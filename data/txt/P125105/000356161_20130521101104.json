        Pakistan (GoP) in strengthening the implementation of its\n            Citizen's Damage Compensation Program (CDCP). The\n            extension is necessary to support the effective closure of\n            the grievance redressal system in accordance with the\n            program's operational manual. In addition, the\n            extension will also assist the implementing agencies to\n            undertake the preparatory activities for institutionalizing\n            the Future Disaster Response Action Plan (FDRAP) for early\n            recovery cash transfers developed under the project and\n            approved by the government. To that end the Government of\n            Pakistan's request for extension of the closing date,\n            dated March 14th, 2013, also indicates the possibility of\n            additional financing for institutionalization of FDRAP, the\n            request for which they would process separately."}, "docdt": "2013-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
