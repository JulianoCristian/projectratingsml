                         The development objective of the project is to support the recovery of flood affected households by assisting the Government of Pakistan (GoP) in strengthening the
                         implementation of its Citizen's Damage Compensation Program (CDCP).

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The Citizen's Damage Compensation Program (CDCP), implemented by the Cabinet Division and the National Database and Registration Authority (NADRA) with support of all
                         provincial/regional governments has made good progress in implementing the project in accordance with the approved Operations Manual. Overall, the project is moving towards
                         achieving its objectives:
                         More than a million eligible households have been enrolled in the program, and the majority of them have received both tranches of their benefit payments. The operational audits are
                         providing timely information on the due diligence, which need to continue until completion of project implementation.

                         Due to the larger than anticipated number of appeals received through the grievance process, the completion of project activities is taking longer than anticipated. In addition, the
                         Government has sent a request to the World Bank for further support to finance the institutionalization of the systems created under CDCP. As a result the project was restructured to
                         extend the closing date to March 31, 2014.
