{"cdata!": "Ratings for the Flood Emergency Cash\n            Transfer Project for Pakistan were as follows: outcomes were\n            satisfactory, risk to development outcome was moderate, Bank\n            performance was satisfactory, and Borrower performance was\n            moderately satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: in\n            an emergency program, targeting methods should be as simple\n            and well understood and based on disaster impact rather than\n            wealth. This places heavier reliance on grievance redress\n            mechanisms, which become an important feature; this is not\n            necessarily so in a normal project where more time can be\n            spent on design than is appropriate in an emergency\n            operation. While a post-disaster cash transfer program needs\n            to be prepared more quickly after a disaster, applying a\n            two-phase response may be effective - a first phase that is\n            purely disaster targeted and provides immediate relief,\n            focusing on keeping people alive and safe, and ensuring that\n            immediate needs are met; and a second phase focused on\n            recovery, not only protecting basic consumption but also\n            recapitalizing assets and restoring livelihoods. If national\n            identification cards are to be used as an element to verify\n            beneficiaries, they need to have broad coverage and be\n            up-to-date. Public awareness and well-prepared\n            communications are essential to ensure smooth processes. The\n            use of debit cards and automated teller machine (ATM)\n            machines is likely to reduce the risk of storing large\n            amounts at home. The impact evaluation was accurate in\n            capturing the impact of the two transfers under second phase\n            of citizen's damage compensation program (CDCP II) on\n            beneficiary households."}, "docdt": "2014-10-17T00:00:00Z"}
