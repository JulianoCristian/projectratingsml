           PAKISTAN – FLOOD EMERGENCY CASH TRANSFER PROJECT
                                 P125105
                      IDA CREDIT 4910-PK AND 4911-PK

                                  Restructuring Paper


1.      The Closing Date for the Pakistan, Flood Emergency Cash Transfer Project, IDA
credits 4910-PK &4911-PK, P125105, is proposed to be extended from June 30, 2013
until March 31, 2014. This will be the first extension of the project, which was approved
by the Board on March 29, 2011 and declared effective on June 27, 2011.

2.      Project implementation is proceeding on track as evidenced by the achievement of
the Project Development Objective results indicator: At least 1 million flood affected,
eligible households as per the re-targeting criteria benefit from cash grants. To date, the
project has disbursed more than 98% of the committed funds. The external audit and all
Interim Unaudited Financial Statements have been received and found to be satisfactory.
The latest supervision mission for the project has rated Financial Management as
Satisfactory for one implementing agency and Moderately Satisfactory for the other

3.     The proposed extension is necessary to support the effective closure of the
grievance redressal system in accordance with the program’s operational manual. In
addition, the extension will also assist the implementing agencies to undertake the
preparatory activities for institutionalizing the Future Disaster Response Action Plan
(FDRAP) for early recovery cash transfers developed under the project and approved by
the government. To that end the Government of Pakistan’s request for extension of the
Closing Date, dated March 14th, 2013, also indicates the possibility of Additional
Financing for institutionalization of FDRAP, the request for which they would process
separately.
