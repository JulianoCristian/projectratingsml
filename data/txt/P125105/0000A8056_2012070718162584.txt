                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Since the start of the project/program, the implementation agencies of the Citizen's Damage Compensation Program (CDCP), namely the Cabinet Division and the National Database
                         and Registration Authority (NADRA), have made good progress implementing the second phase of the CDCP in accordance with the agreed Operations Manual. This was confirmed
                         by the third Joint Supervision and Evaluation Mission (JSEM) carried out by the participating donors (USAID, DFID, Italy, and World Bank) from March 5-8, 2012. Overall, the project
                         is moving satisfactorily towards achieving its objectives: The payments for the first phase of the CDCP have been completed. Under the second phase, more than 700,000
                         households had been paid the first installment of PRs 20,000 and the payments of the second installment (PRs 20,000) have begun in many districts. Going forward, special attention
                         needs to be given to strengthening the grievance redressal system, and to the future action plan for disaster recovery which Cabinet Division is working on.
