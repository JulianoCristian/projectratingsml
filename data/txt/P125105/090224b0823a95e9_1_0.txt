                         provincial/regional governments has been implemented in accordance with the approved Operations Manual, achieving the projectâ€™s objectives fully. More than a million eligible
                         households have been enrolled in the program, and the majority of them have received both tranches of their benefit payments. However, there are a few beneficiaries who are
