0    Implementation Status Overview
."   The project became effective on June 28, 2011. Since then, the implementation agencies of the Citizen's Damage Compensation Program (CDCP), namely the Cabinet Division and
0   the National Database and Registration Authority (NADRA), have made good progress in setting up the institutional capacity to implement the second phase of the CDCP. This was
confirmed by the second Joint Supervision and Evaluation Mission (JSEM) carried out by the participating donors (USAID, DFID, Italy, and World Bank) at the end of November 2011.
Overall, the project is moving satisfactorily towards achieving its objectives. Due to the efforts of both implementing agencies, provincial governments and participating donors, on
December 31, 2011, more than 250,000 households had been paid the first installment of PRs 20,000, adding to PRs 4,704,296,380. The payments of the second installment (PRs
20,000) will soon be started. The mission was pleased with the progress made with regard to verifying and finalizing the beneficiary lists and institutional strengthening within Cabinet

Division and NADRA. The mission noted, however, some bottlenecks related to the availability of hardware and other logistics for setting up registration centers which somewhat
hampered implementation progress. During the next months, special attention needs to be given to the finalization of the beneficiary lists in all provinces, to the establishment of the
grievance redressal system, to training for and capacity building of provincial authorities, and to the future action plan for disaster recovery which Cabinet Division is working on.
