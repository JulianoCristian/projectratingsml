Pursuant to a request from the authorized\n            representative of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan\n            ('Recipient') dated December 24, 2012, this\n            Restructuring Paper seeks a request for a reallocation of\n            funds in the amount of 3,610,000 SDR from Category (2) to\n            Category (3) for the subject IDA Credit, the Pakistan Flood\n            Emergency Cash Transfer Project. The proposed reallocation\n            is necessary to allow NADRA to support continued field\n            operations required for the resolution of grievances and\n            completion of project activities. The team supports this\n            reallocation. As per paragraph 8 of the Minutes of\n            Negotiations, \"in case of a shortfall in the funds\n            required by NADRA to carryout component 2 of the Project,\n            the Recipient will exchange communication with the World\n            Bank to either re-allocate funds from Categories 1 or 2 to\n            Category 3, or secure the requisite funds from its own\n            resources.\" In a letter dated December 24th, 2012, the\n            Government of Pakistan requested such a reallocation. As per\n            the MOU with Development Partners, the financing gap for\n            cash grants to flood affected households is to be covered by\n            the Government of Pakistan."}, "docdt": "2013-01-17T00:00:00Z"}
