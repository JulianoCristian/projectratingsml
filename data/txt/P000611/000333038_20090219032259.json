In order\n            to respond to demand for schooling and pave the way for\n            development of the education sector by improving its\n            effectiveness, the Government requested that IDA finance a\n            project through which access to education in disadvantaged\n            urban areas and in rural communities could be expanded,\n            management of the education system as a whole reevaluated\n            and reviewed, and development of the system organized on a\n            sound basis of financial planning and cost control. More\n            specifically, in addition to it's for the building or\n            extension of two urban schools and eight rural schools, the\n            Government requested technical assistance and specialization\n            training for Djibouti nationals so as to be able to set up\n            an Education Planning Service within the Ministry of\n            Education. The initial quantitative goals of the project\n            were far exceeded, since 84 new classrooms were built\n            instead of the 43 proposed at the appraisal stage.\n            Buildings, whether classrooms or ancillary facilities (staff\n            housing, boarder accommodation, canteens, sanitary\n            facilities), are soundly constructed on the whole, while the\n            materials and fittings used guarantee working conditions and\n            standards of comfort clearly superior to those found\n            elsewhere in the region."}, "docdt": "1992-10-16T00:00:00Z"}
