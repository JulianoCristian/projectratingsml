1. Country and Sector Background
To reduce the poverty level by focusing on the participation and social
integration of all members of the Second Morocco, by supporting
implementation of the literacy component of the Charte nationale.
2. Objectives
To offer the poorest adults an opportunity to obtain basic education
through
high-quality, well managed literacy programs.
3. Rationale for Bank's Involvement
The main purpose of this pilot project, which is supported by a Learning
and Innovation Loan (LIL), is to test new approaches to teaching quality
and adult literacy program management, which, if proven effective, will
enable the Government of Morocco (GOM) to implement nation-wide programs
that result in lasting literacy outcomes and are fiscally sustainable. A
project of this kind provides an opportunity to assess which approaches
are best taken to scale.The Literacy Department (DLCA) of the Ministry of
Labor, Vocational Training, Social Development, and Solidarity (MEFP)
currently operates four literacy programs, which have had a throughput of
more than one million adults aged 16 and above since 1995 (see table
below): the Campagne generale, run out of Education Ministry schools; a
public providers program, run in partnership with several government
departments and aimed at groups often facing economic hardships (e.g.
fishermen, farmers, the prison population); a job-based program, run in
partnership with private industries such as dairy cooperatives and the



textile and clothing trade; and the Cent mains program created in
partnership with nongovernmental organizations (NGOs).Table 1: Enrollment

200233,650301,5001,149,559This project focuses on the NGO program because
it will accommodate the majority of learners in the medium-term (see table
below), and because the NGOs tend to target the poorest population,
particularly rural women and girls. Therefore, the project's goal is to
improve teaching supervision and to increase the institutional capacity of
the literacy system, which will impact all literacy providers.Table 2:

DLCA provides funding in the form of a general allocation to meet the
costs of teachers' salaries, as well as in-kind resources in the form of
literacy manuals and training for trainers. The NGOs are responsible for
identifying and enrolling learners, recruiting and training teachers, as
well as for providing classrooms and managing the courses (including the
assessment of learner achievement).The Bank's on-going BAJ Education
Project has contributed to the NGO program. With Loan No. 4024-MOR, the
DLCA has signed "partnership agreements" with about thirty national and
local NGOs catering for some 85,000 learners, mainly rural women. The
African Development Bank has also financed contracts in this program.
Experience with the BAJ Education Project has given the DLCA the chance to
show its capacity to enlist NGOs as service providers and to reach target
groups that had hitherto not had access to literacy education. The
current NGO program has limited coverage however and, in its present
configuration, cannot hope to meet the country's massive literacy needs.
The GOM recently set itself the target proposed in the Charte nationale
d'education et de formation [National Education and Training Charter],
namely to reduce adult illiteracy by one half from the current official
estimate of 50w, by 2010.   In light of the method used to calculate the
illiteracy rate (a simple statement by respondents in censuses or surveys
of household living conditions), the proportion of the adult population
with a low literacy level (i.e. neither reading nor writing well enough to
improve their living conditions or well-being) is certainly higher than
50%.Expansion of the literacy programs faces a double challenge.
Improving program quality requires a complex approach at the teaching and
administrative levels. First, to extend the programs, particularly the
NGO program, to a level consistent with the government's objectives in a
fiscally sustainable way requires a reduction in unit costs; for this, the
GOM is relying on deconcentrating DLCA functions to regional and
provincial levels and on strengthening the program management capacity at
these lower levels. Second, for this expanding literacy program to have a
lasting economic and social impact, teaching quality must be improved at
the level of the NGOs and other providers; for this, the GOM aims to
renovate curricula and books, and to train teachers and teacher trainers.
The GOM would like Bank support in bringing international experience to
bear in the areas of strengthening the teaching system and improving
cost-effectiveness.
4. Description
-2-



Component 1. Improving program qualityThis component aims to reform the
educational dimension of programs in the campagne generale run by NGOs,
government departments, private industries, and local groups, if any.
Curriculum content and teaching methods will be renovated to improve
learner participation and performance. Component 2. Strengthening
management of the systemThis component aims to strengthen the
institutional capacity of the DLCA, the local offices of the MEFP
(essentially the provincial literacy coordinators) and service providers,
using a partnership-based approach. Measures to be implemented include
training of government and service provider personnel, and development of
post-literacy strategies.Regular evaluation and analysis of literacy
programsIn addition to the components per se, the project will also
undertake regular evaluation of project outcomes (see section B.6.) and
analysis of different aspects of the literacy programs so as to prepare to
take successful innovations to scale.Table 3: Project components

6. Implementation
7. Sustainability
This project aims to improve the adult literacy system, so that it is
sustainable both in its learning outcomes and in its fiscal impact. As a
Learning & Innovation Loan, the project may lead onto a broader, follow-up
operation.
8. Lessons learned from past operations in the country/sector
Partnerships with local NGOs enable the Government to reach sectors of
society (women, rural, poor) inaccessible through traditional programs.

10. Environment Aspects (including any public consultation)
Issues     :  This project poses no risk to the environment or to
the poorest populations. Environmental protection. There is no
environmental risk as the project does not finance any construction work.
In addition, environmental issues will be taken into consideration during
renovation of literacy curricula and the design of new curricula, so that
important information may be communicated to the learners (for example,
the literacy curriculum specifically designed for farmers includes more
efficient and more environmentally friendly agricultural techniques).
Social impact. The project poses no social risk; specifically, the
project does not entail any population displacement. The recommended
approach calls for the strong involvement of civil society.
Nongovernmental organizations will be called upon as literacy service

providers and will be responsible, among other things, for identifying
demand, recruiting teachers, evaluating outcomes, and devising a
post-training integration plan for learners. Deconcentration of DLCA
functions to local offices of the MEFP also helps build up local
programs. Women, particularly in rural areas, are at a significant
disadvantage with respect to men in terms of literacy.
