At project\n            closing, the M&E system is still not operational.\n            M&E tools have been produced but their use at the local\n            level is not complete. As a result, basic data are not\n            systemically collected, let alone analyzed. When project\n            outcomes largely depend on consulting services, it is\n            necessary to analyze both the international and the national\n            market for these services during preparation. Based on the\n            findings, the Bank should agree with the Borrower on the\n            share between national and international consultants. Also,\n            consultant selection methods should be in line with the size\n            and complexity of a project. Better use of the quality cost\n            based selection method should be made to allow for a\n            stronger focus on quality. Candor should be used to assess\n            project development objective (PDO) and implementation\n            progress (IP) during project supervision. Assessing the PDO\n            and IP with candor early on will have helped recognize the\n            project as a problem project, thereby motivating the team to\n            provide a stronger and more effective response to the lack\n            of progress on project implementation during the first two years."}, "docdt": "2008-08-05T00:00:00Z"}
