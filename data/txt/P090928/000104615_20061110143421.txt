1. 
Country and Sector Background 
 
The GoA has been remarkably successful in establishing a stable macro-economic environment.  
Currency reform was completed in early 2003 and since then inflation has been around 10 per cent and 
the currency stable.  The government has shown strong fiscal discipline and has implemented a no 
overdraft policy where they refrain from printing money to finance a deficit. However, Afghanistan 
remains one of the world’s poorest countries with an estimated per capita GDP of only US$315, including 
the drug economy, which represent almost one-third of the economy. Low GDP and continuing insecurity 
threatens to derail state building efforts and undo the recent economic progress. To address its 
development concerns, the GoA will have to rapidly improve security, develop state capacity, control the 
illegal narcotics trade and sustain economic growth.  This can only be accomplished if the international 
community maintains its high level of support and Afghanistan develops a dynamic private sector to 
provide jobs and drive growth.  
 
Private sector development is at the heart of Afghanistan’s long term economic development and poverty 
reduction strategy. There is full government recognition that foreign and domestic investment in new 
ideas, facilities and sectors will provide the foundation for economic growth, long term prosperity and 
economic sustainability. The private sector will provide the employment opportunities for the Afghan 
people that the state can no longer provide. Private commerce will also provide the tax revenues that will 
provide public funding for health, education and other services that the state needs to provide for its 
people when external aid is no longer available.    
 
Private sector development is one of the priority areas for the Afghanistan Interim National Development 
Strategy (AINDS), which is the GOA’s overarching strategy for promoting growth, generating wealth and 
reducing poverty and vulnerability.  The World Bank’s Interim Support Strategy strongly supports 
GOA’s strategy. However, to meet this strategy and implement private sector dominance in the economy, 
there is need for stronger GOA commitment to address private sector constrains pertaining to economic 
and physical infrastructure, regulatory regime and corruption.   
 
The proposed Private Sector Development Project (PSDP) is closely aligned with the objectives of both 
strategies and directly addresses some of the above issues. While there is considerable private 
Page  2
entrepreneurial activity in Afghanistan, much of it is informal. The challenge of private sector 
development is to expand legal entrepreneurial activity and induce a shift from an informal and often 
illicit business environment to a formal contract-based private sector.  
 
2. Objectives 
 
The objective of the project is to improve the investment climate in Afghanistan for foreign and domestic 
firms.  The specific goals that will contribute to this are:  
 
·
Enhance the provision of land and infrastructural services for enterprise development 
·
Enhance the capacity of government agencies to analyze PSD issues, and develop and implement 
PSD-related strategies, policies and programs  
·
Enhance the capacity of government agencies to promote Afghanistan as an investment 
destination and provide investment facilitation services 
 
3. 
Rationale for Bank Involvement 
 
Despite the involvement of many donors in facilitating private sector development activities, large gaps 
remain. The proposed PSDP is designed to fill some important gaps left by other donors and help 
Afghanistan address the most important constraints to private investment. The interventions proposed are 
based on the World Bank Group’s on-going analytic and advisory program on private sector development 
(PSD) issues, national priorities articulated in the AINDS and Government’s National Priority Program 
on PSD, and specific requests from the Government for assistance. It takes into account what other donors 
are doing and complements their activities.  
 
A
lending program in support of PSD in Afghanistan needs to strike a balance between the enormity of 
needs and the poor capacity in Government to implement complex projects. The Government’s capacity 
to analyze PSD issues, and formulate and implement PSD policies and programs is limited. Despite the 
fact that other donors are active in Afghanistan; the Government is increasingly looking at the World 
Bank Group to take the lead in many areas of PSD. This demands a wide ranging program of PSD 
support from the World Bank Group. At the same time, capacity constraints in government, suggest that 
complex projects should be avoided. Thus, the World Bank will adopt a long-term development approach 
to supporting PSD in Afghanistan with the proposed PSDP being the first in a possible series of projects 
dedicated to PSD issues.   
 
4. Description 
 
The project will finance the following activities:
1
·
Industrial park development (US$22.30 million).
 The proposed PSD Support project will support 
the Government’s industrial park development program by: a) funding the construction of two 
parks at Kamari and Jalalabad 
(US$20.72m)
;
and b) providing technical assistance to help 
develop project implementation capacity (in construction supervision, procurement, financial 
management, and environmental and social management) and a policy, regulatory and 
institutional framework for an overall industrial park development program for the country 
(US$1.58m).

This excludes the PPF amount of $1 million.

·
Institutional development and capacity building for PSD (US$1.25 million).
 This component will 
support institutional development and capacity building in the public sector and through public-
private partnerships to strengthen the legal, policy, regulatory and institutional framework for 
private sector development. This will be in addition to the ca
pacity building in AISA’s Industrial 
Parks Department described above. This component will support institutional development and 
capacity building in government through two windows: a) AISA - investment promotion, 
facilitation and policy research ($0.75 million); and b) Ministry of Commerce and Industry – 
MoCI ($0.50 million).

6. Implementation 
 
The project will be under the oversight of the High Commission for Investment, which will receive 
periodic reports on implementation progress. AISA, the Secretariat of the High Commission for 
Investment, an inter-ministerial committee chaired by the Minister for Commerce and Industry, will be 
responsible for implementation of main components of the project. MoCI will directly implement a small 
technical assistance component.  
 
7. Sustainability 
 
The World Bank is committed to the project sustainability. Together with the Afghanistan Investment 
Support Agency, it has undertaken an economic, environmental and social impact assessment of the parks 
to ensure that all sustainability drivers - good governance, social inclusion and environmental 
considerations – are carefully taken into account before the project is presented to the Bank’s board for 
their approval. 
 
8.  Lessons Learned from Past Operations in the Country/Sector 
 
The key lessons learnt in implementing other projects in Afghanistan, particularly the Afghanistan 
Investment Guarantee Facility (a recent World Bank private sector development project in Afghanistan) 
that are relevant for this project are the following: 
 
·
Selectivity
.
Projects that try to serve a broad range of clients in a post conflict environment often 
result in diluted second-best solutions. With a wide range of pressing capacity building needs 
selectivity is essential for success. In this regard, the project deliberately decided to focus on 
industrial park development and capacity building in the AISA and MoCI that complements the 
industrial park component. Broader reforms which included addressing access to finance constraints, 
and direct support to private firms such as business development services, were excluded after careful 
consideration.
 
·
Simplicity
.
Implementing complex projects in capacity constrained environments is risky. The team 
has deliberately sought to clarify potential project complexities early in the project design process.

·
Local Capacity Building: Private sector reforms are not sustainable unless they are comprehensive 
and penetrate institutional structures
.
Relying on donor expertise to implement projects is not a 
sustainable model. Although the MoCI has advisors from various donor agencies, local experts will 
be relied upon as far as possible for both project implementation and capacity building activities to 
ensure that the Ministry’s ability to promote sound private sector development policy is sustained 
over the long run.
