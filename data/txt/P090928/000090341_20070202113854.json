Enhance the capacity of\n            government agencies to promote Afghanistan as an investment\n            destination and provide investment facilitation services. By\n            helping to address the land constraint, this project will\n            attract private investment in a variety of sectors,\n            including but not limited to manufacturing, agribusiness,\n            and smaller scale infrastructure projects.
