Some lessons learned included:\n            recent reviews and studies on international experience\n            relating to industrial parks (and special economic zones)\n            also suggest that a more efficient approach to the\n            development of IPs is to rely on public private\n            partnerships, where the private sector is responsible for\n            the construction and management of parks. 'Flexibility\n            in design' can seem an evasive concept in an\n            infrastructure project. However, the deterioration of\n            security (or the lack of long term visibility and possible\n            change of environment) should probably always, at least, be\n            considered a risk in a conflict context. In this respect,\n            options to quickly reorient the use of Project funds might\n            have been identified at preparation, for example, to support\n            other IPs already under construction with the support of\n            other donors. The decision to use Afghanistan Investment\n            Support Authority (AISA), supported by individual\n            consultants, to undertake the construction of the industrial\n            park appears, in retrospect, to have been ill-informed.\n            Building an industrial park requires a variety of highly\n            specialized expertise that only an engineering firm can\n            mobilize. While the focus on building AISA's capacity\n            was well founded, the approach to build its capacity through\n            individual consultants was not appropriate, when it came to\n            building a large industrial park."}, "docdt": "2012-03-21T00:00:00Z"}
