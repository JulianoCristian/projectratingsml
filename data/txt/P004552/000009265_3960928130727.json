term development\n            program for the coconut sector has been recognized for many\n            years.  This project will constitute the first phase of a\n            long term small coconut farms development program, which,\n            over the next twenty years, will result in the replanting of\n            some 743,000 ha of senile coconuts and the rehabilitation of\n            418,000 ha of low bearing palms.  Project objectives are to\n            : a) launch a long term program of coconut replanting and\n            productivity improvement; b) increase the incomes of coconut\n            smallholders by improving coconut yields and copra quality;\n            and c) boost foreign exchange earnings by ensuring an\n            increasing and reliable supply of higher quality copra for\n            processing and export.  Project components include : 1)\n            establishment of seedgardens, nurseries and other\n            infrastructure sufficient to sustain a long term program of\n            replanting 50,000 ha of senile palms per annum; 2) replant\n            25,000 ha and support intercropping during the first 3 years\n            of replanting; 3) rehabilitate 348,000 ha of middle aged\n            palms and support the development of 50,000 ha of immature\n            palms; 4) support a pilot copra quality improvement program;\n            and 5) provide for the institutional strengthening of the\n            Philippines Coconut Authority (PCA)."}, "docdt": "1990-05-01T00:00:00Z"}
