Nonetheless, the\n            lessons suggest that: 1) although a long-term coconut\n            development program has been prepared, there is still lack\n            of consensus on the precise elements for the strategy of\n            this program. Issues include the competition faced by\n            coconut oil from substitutes in export markets, the\n            agronomic constraint of shading, and a \"holistic\"\n            approach in the preference to keep coconut as a secondary\n            crop, or to diversify out of it to other profitable crops,\n            or uses; 2) the private sector needs to be actively pursued,\n            for experience shows that the private sector's contract\n            services are more reliable, than attempting to establish\n            separate public sector facilities; 3) innovative financing\n            mechanisms need to be addressed, particularly, alternative\n            cost-sharing arrangements should evolve to finance a\n            long-term replanting program; 4) likewise, mechanisms to\n            reduce planting costs should be explored, to help develop a\n            market for coconut hybrid seedlings for replanting purposes.\n            Experience suggests that hybrids may outperform tall\n            coconuts, making those worth producing; and, 5) project\n            delays undermined its benefits, thus project readiness at\n            entry is critical for a timely implementation, which should\n            include clear monitoring and evaluation practices."}, "docdt": "2000-06-06T00:00:00Z"}
