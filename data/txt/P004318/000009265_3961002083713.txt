MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE IBRD
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO MALAYSIA
FOR A THIRD FELCRA LAND DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.        I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation
on a proposd loan to Malaysia for the equivalent of US$94.0 million to help
finance a Third FELCRA Land Development project. The loan would be at the Bank's
standard variable interest rate, with a maturity of 17 years, including 5 years
of grace.
2.        CountrvySector Background.  Over the past several decades, Malaysia
has achieved an impressive record of rural poverty alleviation. The principal
thrusts of its efforts have involved the opening of new lands and the
rehabilitation of previously low productivity agricultural areas, through the
growing of tree crops, especially rubber and oil palm for which Malaysia enjoys
strong natural agroclimatic advantages. The strategy has been to extend the
advantages and benefits of the country's acknowledged highly successful estate
production systems to smallholders, by organizing them into group farming
systems. Several official development programs have been involved in carrying
out the strategy, with Bank assistance over the years; one of the most important
of these has been the Federal Land Consolidation and Rehabilitation Authority
(FELCRA). Established in 1966, FELCRA has to date developed some 247,000 ha with
tree crops, for the benefit of about 46,800 rural families. Its group farming
schemes have encouraged smallholders to come together to enjoy the benefits of
scale of production, with FELCRA providing improved technology and skilled
management services.
3.        Although FELCRA has made considerable progress and today can be
counted among the more successful rural development agencies worldwide, it
nonetheless faces significant challenges over the coming decade. First, while
average rural income levels have improved in Malaysia, poverty pockets do remain
in some areas which are suitable for FELCRA-style development, so there is a need
for selective expansion of the system. Seco-nd, there are still important gaps
to be narrowed between the production efficiencies of the large estate sector and
FELCRA's group schemes. With Malaysia facing continually rising labor costs, it
is essential that it pursue all possible avenues to improve its technical
performance and efficiency, and thereby consolidate and ensure the long-term
sustainability of the income gains achieved thus far by its rural smallholder
beneficiaries. In particular, agricultural performance in rubber needs to be
further strengthened through technological changes to reduce tapping costs and
improve rubber yields.   With Bank assistance, and drawing on cross-country
experience from West Africa, FELCRA has been piloting some promising
technological improvements under an ongoing project, which it will extend
throughout its system under the proposed operation. To do this effectively,
FELCRA's organizational structure needs to be strengthened to enhance the
attention to technical and financial management matters.



- 2 -
3.        A final major challenge concerns the future management of fully
developed schemes and agro-processing facilities. It has long been FELCRA's
policy to withdraw from management of group farms once land development
obligations were repaid by the members, but it was not until the last few years
that any schemes had actually reached this stage. In the course of preparing the
proposed project, FELCRA has developed specific arrangements to devolve the
management of schemes and palm oil mills to private institutions, and the project
would support FELCRA in implementing this effort. This involves, inter alia, the
training of cooperatives to participate more actively in the management of
schemes during the development phase, so as to prepare them to assume full
decision-making responsibilities on reaching maturity; progressive introduction
of management fees so that schemes/cooperatives become accustoim_  to financing
such services directly; and elose monitoring of the schemes for which FELCRA has
privatized management responsibility to ensure that their technical and financial
performance is maintained.  FELCRA has developed a satisfactory action plan
encompassing these and other activities, which will be implemented under the
project.
5.        Lessons Learned trom Previous Bank Ogerations.  The Bank has thus far
supported expansion of the FELCRA system through three loans (for the FELCRA I,
Trans Perak Area Development and Second FELCRA Land Development projects). The
first two were completed, with OED generally commending FELCRA's very successful
rural development efforts. They were judged to be sustainable, and FELCRA' s high
staff morale and ability to respond flexibly to changing circumstances over the
years were noted. Performance under the recently completed Second FELCRA project
has also been good, with all targets met except for delayed completion of two
processing facilities and training centers, all of which will be finished during
1992. The fact that responsibility for these various projects was largely under
one agency greatly facilitated their execution.
6.        Rationale for-Bank Involvement. The Bank's continued involvement with
FELCRA through the proposed project would assist it in dealing with key
transitional issues which it must face in order to remain a highly effective
development agency over the coming years.   These include: (a) the need to
strengthen its agricultural and financial management systems, so as to achieve
greater internal efficiency; (b) the need for significant improvements in crop
production technology to ensure the continued competitiveness and income gains
made thus far by FELCRA smallholders; and (c) gradual disengagement from the
management of group farms that have repaid their development loans, and
processing facilities, in favor of private institutions, without weakening the
quality of agricultural performance. The project would be consistent with the
Bank's long-standing poverty alleviation objectives in Malaysia, and its dialogue
with the Government on privatization and public sector reform issues.
7.        Project Objectives. The project's main objectives are to build FELCRA
into a stronger and more efficient development agency to increase the incomes of
its smallholder beneficiaries, improve the quality of its technical and financial
performance, and support the agency in the transitional period as it begins to
withdraw from the management of mature schemes and processing facilities.
8.        Project Description. The project would provide, over four years, for:
(a) rehabilitation of 48,000 ha of idle agricultural land with tree crops,



- 3 -
predominantly oil palm and rubber, the maintenance during immaturity of about
120,000 ha of tree crops planted prior to and during the project, and the
introduction of a reduced frequency rubber tapping technology over about 50,000
ha of rubber; (b) the provision of agriculture scheme infrastructure; (c)
institutional reorganization, with the formation of new Plantation, Finance and
Human Resource Divisions, and expansion of the scheme agricultural inspectorate;
(d) staff management and accounting systems; and (e) equipment, including
enhanced computerization facilities and vehicles.
9.        Project Implementation. The proposed project would be carried out by
FELCRA. The project cost is estimated at US$361.6 million equivalent, with a
foreign exchange component of US$98.8 million equivalent (27%) and taxes and
duties estimated at about US$2.7 million equivalent. The Bank loan of US$94.0
million equivalent would finance 95% of the foreign exchange and 26% of the total
costs. Retroactive financing not exceeding US$9.4 million equivalent would cover
eligible development expenditures incurred from the start of appraisal on
December 1, 1991 through the date of loan signing, to provide continuity of Bank
support for FELCRA's acitivities. A breakdown of costs and the financing plan
are  shown  in  Schedule A.   Amounts and methods of procurement and  of
disbursements, and the disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B.  A
timetable of key project processing events and the status of Bank Group
operations in Malaysia are given in Schedules C and D, resuectively. A map is
also attached. The Staff Appraisal Report, No. 10372-MA dated May 15, 1992 is
being distributed separately.
10.       Prolect Sustainability.  The project would be fully sustainable and
self-financing after reaching full development in the year 2010 (for both oil
palm and rubber). The whole thrust of the project is to encourage smallholder
participants to assume full management responsibility for their group farms,
either directly or through their representative institutions.
11.       Agreed Action.    During negotiations, agreements were reached with
the Government and FELCRA on: (a) the appointment of an independent accounting
consultant to review FELCRA's accounting policies and practices; (b) the
establishment and maintenance of new Divisions for Plantations and Finance, each
headed by qualified and experienced officers; (c) the incorporation into FELCRA's
planting directives of adequate environmental directives and guidelines; and (d)
the periodic exchange of views between FELCRA and the Bank on the pilot program
to devolve to beneficiary institutions the management of palm oil processing
mills and agricultural schemes which have repaid their land development loans.
12.       Environmental Asgects.  Project activities are concerned primarily
with the rehabilitation of existing agricu'ltural lands and are therefore unlikely
to induce significant environmental impacts. Planting directives will be updated
to reflect environmentally sound field practices and a list of environmentally
acceptable agricultural chemicals, used in compliance with necessary safety
procedures, has been agreed with the Bank. Environmental standards and controls
observed in road construction are satisfactory.
13.       Project Benefits.  The main benefits of the project would be: (a)
improvement of the incomes of some 24,000 smallholder beneficiaries with average
annual incomes currently below the rural poverty level in Malaysia; (b) the



- 4 -
strengthening of FELCRA's agricultur1l performance through the introduction of
new crop production technologies, to enhiance the productivity and maintain the
competitiveness of Malaysian smallholder tree crop producers; (c) support for
FELCRA's efforts to disengage from the management of mature schemes and agro-
processing facilities; and (d) the incremental production of 105,000 tons of palm
oil and 34,000 tons of rubber per year. Using projected world market prices and
constant 1992 dollars, the net foreign exchange earnings by full development in
2010 would be about US$100 million per year. The project would also directly
benefit women agricuitural workers, particularly rubber tappers, through
upgrading of their technical skills and, hence, their income levels.   The
economic rate of return of the project has been estimated at 13%.
14.       Risks.  The only major project risk would be a steeper deterioration
in the cost-price relationships for rubber production than could be offset by
productivity gaLns. The new reduced frequency rubber tapping technology, which
will be the major source of productivity gains, has already been proven in other
parts of the world and pilot tested by FELCRA under the previous Bank project,
with good results. To ensure its successful introduction throughout the FELCRA
system, the proposed project will support substantial training of workers and
FELCRA staff, and improvements in FELCRA's agricultural services. FELCRA will
also introduce a system of incentives adequate to motivate tappers in a fast
growing economy to make the necessary changes in their production practices. The
risks with oil palm are minimal, as the main labor requirement is for unskilled
workers, for whom wages are competitive with non-agricultural wages. The project
is fully sustainable and self-financing after the development investment period.
15.       Recoenda&ion.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of Bank and recommend that the Executive Directors
approve it.
