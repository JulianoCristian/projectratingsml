The FSAL sought a comprehensive financial reform\n            by: (a) reducing state participation in banking (by\n            eliminating the development banks, curtailing activities of\n            Banco de la Nacion, and privatizing state-owned commercial\n            banks); (b) improving the regulation of banks (by re-casting\n            banking regulations and strengthening the banking\n            superintendency); and (c) reinforcing capital markets (by\n            strengthening regulations and introducing a private pensions\n            systems). Bank's performance was satisfactory.\n            Borrower's performance was satisfactory. The key\n            lessons learned were as follows: (i) Borrower commitment is\n            critical to the success of a program; (ii) design and\n            implementation of a reform program is more effective when\n            the relevant legislation supporting the reforms has been\n            enacted; and (iii) a stable macroeconomic environment is a\n            necessary condition for sustainable reforms of the financial sector."}, "docdt": "1997-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
