           Metro Manila Area and in the three secondary cities of\n            Davao, Cebu, and Cagayan de Oro. The project will also\n            provide funds for: (a) employment promotion through the\n            development of commercial and industrial sites, business\n            loans, and (b) assistance to the National Housing Authority\n            (NHA), the Ministry of Human Settlements (MHS) and the Metro\n            Manila Commission (MMC) in institutional development and\n            training. The project is expected to benefit directly\n            approximately 110,000 people in the urban poverty group in\n            Metro Manila, and 78,000 in the three secondary cities. The\n            primary risks are related to the fact that the\n            Government's program has only recently been\n            established. The project units in the regional cities were\n            created only recently, and have not yet been tested. In\n            addition, existing programs of NHA have strained NHA's\n            financial and staff resources, and the local governments\n            responsible for implementation are only now beginning to\n            develop on effective working relationship with NHA on\n            financial and technical matters."}, "docdt": "1978-12-31T00:00:00Z"}
