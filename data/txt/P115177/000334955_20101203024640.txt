1. Program Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

    a. Macro-economic context at appraisal

Economic Context

Gross Domestic Product (GDP) during the four years previous to appraisal had accelerated
peaking at a record rate of 11.5 percent in 2007, and remaining robust at 9.2 percent in
2008. This economic boom was triggered by rapid improvements in the external environment,
coupled with an improved fiscal stance and banking system, both of which raised investor
confidence and facilitated the transmission of positive global developments to the domestic
economy. An internationally oriented service sector (Panama Canal, financial sector, air
transport), accounting for some 80 percent of GDP growth since 2002, and, to some extent, a
booming construction industry drove economic growth; in contrast, the highly protected
agriculture and manufacturing sectors did not exhibit anywhere near the same dynamism.

During the same period the fiscal position of government posted a major improvement. The
nonfinancial public sector balance, excluding the Panama Canal Authority (PCA), had turned
from a deficit of about 5 percent of GDP in 2004 into a surplus of 0.4 percent of GDP in 2008.
The positive fiscal results along with the strong economy had been reflected in a marked
reduction in public debt (excl. PCA) from a peak of 62.2 percent of GDP in 2004 to 37.6 percent
of GDP in 2008. Improvements in the fiscal stance did not preclude major increases in public
investments, which rose from 3 percent of GDP in 2005 to nearly 5 percent in 2007 and to over
7 percent of GDP in 2008. In 2008, the improved fiscal and debt position contributed to a
Standard & Poor's upgrade of Panama's long-term foreign and local currency ratings from BB to
BB+, while Fitch affirmed Panama's rating at BB+ and revised the rating outlook to positive.

A special currency regime, where the US dollar is legal tender, avoided the costs of foreign
exchange volatility, but transmitted the increasing international prices of food and energy
leading to an increase in inflation that reached over ten percent at the end of 2008. Higher oil
prices and the imports needed in the expansion of the canal moved the current account balance
from a deficit of 4.9 in 2005 to 12.1 of GDP in 2008. But, the deficit was adequately financed by
foreign direct investment (FDI)--mainly in the financial, commerce and housing sectors--
averaging over 9 percent of GDP annually since 2004.

High growth had made some inroads in decreasing poverty rates, but extreme poverty
remained endemic in indigenous areas. Between 2003 and 2008, poverty fell from 36.8 to 32.0
percent, while extreme poverty was reduced from 16.6 to 14.5 percent. Extreme poverty,
however, remained almost universal among indigenous groups. The intransigence of poverty,
particularly in rural areas, despite high growth was the result of pattern of economic driven
primarily by the services sector, which tends to employ relatively high-skilled individuals. With a
Gini coefficient of 0.47, inequality of consumption in Panama was among the highest in the
region and the world, and considerably higher than the average for countries with similar per-
capita income levels. Social outcomes were likewise dispersed; in the indigenous areas, for
instance, chronic child malnutrition rates are as high as 56 percent while the national average is
21 percent. The marked increase in food prices in 2007 and 2008 had most likely affected the
poor disproportionately as they spent a larger share of their income on food than the non-poor.



                                                1
A long-track record of institutional reform had contributed to this improved performance.
Panama had been actively engaged in institutional reform since the second half of the 1990s,
when trade barriers and price controls were largely dismantled, a far-reaching privatization
program implemented and fiscal reforms coupled with reducing the level of public debt to GDP
allowed Panama to regain access to international financial markets. The Torrijos Government
(2005-2209) accelerated the momentum of this structural reform agenda and placed a renewed
emphasis on fiscal sustainability, transparency and improved efficiency while, at the same time,
exploiting the advantages of Panama's open trade and investment regime. In particular, the
Government succeeded in moving ahead with a project to expand the Panama Canal. It also
introduced Panama's Social and Fiscal Responsibility Law (SFRL--Law No. 34 of June 5, 2008),
which became effective on January 1, 2009 thereby replacing the previous Fiscal Responsibility
Law (FRL) adopted in May 2002. In addition, it introduced important social assistance programs
such as the targeted Red de Oportunidades (RdO) and had engaged a broad consensus seeking
around priorities for social spending in preparation for increasing public revenues arising from
the expansion of the Panama Canal.

Macro-economic outlook in the context of the global crisis

At the time of appraisal the impact of the global financial crisis had been modest and the
financial system remained stable, but prudent lending in the face of the crisis was
restricting resources to the private sector. Panama's banks had experienced only limited
capital losses as a result of the crisis because of low exposure to toxic assets--less than .1 percent
of total assets. The liquidity position of the International Banking Sector (CBI) and the National
Banking System (SBN) banks remained comfortable, on average. Private Panamanian banks
(holding 45.8 percent of the national banking system assets) were less liquid than foreign and
public banks, with their liquidity ratio falling from 50.5 percent in 2006 to 40.6 percent in 2008
(4th quarter figures.) Despite the comfortable position, banks contracted credit growth and in the
last quarter of 2008 and local businesses began to report difficulties in accessing credit.

The global slowdown was beginning to have an impact as growth in construction; free trade
zones activity and shipping traffic through the Panama Canal were beginning to slowdown.
The growth rate in the value of construction and maintenance had fallen from 33.9 percent in
2007 to 18.7 percent in 2008. Although this did not mean trouble for the banking sector with only
12percent of its portfolio in real estate and construction, it meant a potential impact on
unemployment, given that construction had provided the bulk of new employment opportunities
over the last four years. In addition, the Colon Free Zone (CFZ) and tourism sectors were
slowing as Panama's largest trading-partners experienced declining growth. Activity at the
Panama Canal had fallen by 2.3 percent in 2008 owing to reduced trade between Northeast Asia
and the US East Coast--the most important trade lane of the Canal. Container traffic growth at
Panamanian ports is also falling for related reasons. The growth rate in container movement fell
from 38 to 15 percent in the year to November 2008.

    b. Core issues prior to loan approval

A key development challenge facing Panama was to ensure that economic stability and
growth were maintained and that benefits were broadly shared. At the point of loan approval,
the global slowdown threatened the stability of the economy and the livelihood of the poor. In
addressing these issues, the challenge of the government was combining attention to the short-
term risks while maintaining a focus on the reform agenda that was underway and had led over
the last five years to significant institutional gains and improvements on the ground.

                                                  2
Declining incomes threatened a reversal of the social gains of the recent years. Of concern
was that the expected drop in fiscal resources associated with the slowdown would lead to a drop
in social expenditures, which could make it difficult for the government to deliver on social
expenditure commitments emerging from extensive consultations with a broad range of civil
society organizations around the use of forthcoming resources from the expansion of the Panama
Canal. At the same time, the poor were likely to need additional support as incomes could drop
and unemployment increase during the crisis. Lastly, there was concern that the focus on
continued improvements in the social assistance programs (targeting, etc.) would be lost affecting
programs such as Red de Oportunidades, basic health services to the poor in rural and isolated
areas and scaled up and accelerated activities to improve the quality and access of educational
services in indigenous areas.

Given its size and its increasing role as an international center, the fate of the financial
sector was of particular concern for the stability of the economy. The consolidated assets of
the banking system represented around 250 percent of Panama's GDP, and the share of bank
assets owned by foreign banks was close to 60 percent. Financial intermediation services played
an important role in Panama's recent economic boom, contributing around 9 percent of 2007
GDP. Although, Panama's financial sector was relatively well positioned going into this global
financial crisis, thanks to prudent policies, the downside risks were high.1 Concerns included a
potential deterioration of the domestic portfolio of the banks given the likely slowdown in
Panama's services-export oriented economy, and possible withdrawal of deposits from the
banking sector as liquidity tightened in other countries.

At the time of loan approval the country faced a presidential election in May 2009 and a
change in administration on July 1, 2009. Primaries the previous year had determined as the
main contenders the Partido Revolucionario Democrático (PRD) and the Partido Panameñista
(PP.) The DPL document did not see this as a major concern as all the main candidates in the
presidential race supported deepening poverty reduction efforts and were expected to maintain
Panama's current economic policy framework.

      c. Alignment of the DPL program with Government and Bank strategies

The DPL operation supported progress towards medium-term program outcomes related to three
CPS objectives: (1) reducing poverty, especially among the rural poor and indigenous groups
through targeted social interventions; (2) improving health and nutrition outcomes through the
expanded supply of basic public services, and (3) promoting broad-based economic growth by
means of supporting financial sector stability. The CPS, in turn, was tightly aligned with the
strategic objectives of the Torrijos administration. In addition, the DPL's narrower focus was
aligned with the government's initiatives to protect the stability of the country and to soften the
impact of the economic slowdown on the poor.

1.2 Original Program Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

This Development Policy Loan (DPL) was designed to support the poverty reduction efforts of
the Government of Panama in the context of the global economic crisis.

1.3 Revised PDO and Key Indicators, and Reasons/Justification

Single tranche operation: neither PDO nor key indicators were revised.

1.4 Original Policy Areas Supported by the Program:

The one-tranche DPL supported two complementary policy areas:

   Mitigating the impact of economic shocks on the poor through improved targeting and
   coverage of social sector programs.
   Reducing economic risks of a banking crisis through enhanced risk management and
   strengthened regulation and supervision.

A. Mitigating the Impact of Economic Slowdown on the Poor

The DPL supported steps that the Government took in 2008 to help mitigate the expected
negative impact of external shocks on Panama's poor population. The Panamanian authorities
adopted a three-pronged response to the external economic shocks which have buffeted the poor
since the economic slowdown began in 2008. First, they strengthened the safety net through an
increase in the size of the conditional cash transfer to beneficiary families of the Red de
Oportunidades program and an improvement in the targeting of other social programs to better
cushion the poor against negative impacts. Second, the quality and coverage of health and
nutrition services to the extreme poor were strengthened, including through mechanisms to
monitor and improve the nutritional status of children, highly vulnerable during an economic
slowdown. Third, the Government committed to maintaining levels of social spending during the
economic deceleration and thus avoiding budget cuts in social spending should fiscal pressures
arise in a downturn.

B. Promoting Financial Stability

The DPL supported actions and measures that the Government had taken to mitigate the
impact of the global financial crisis on Panama's banking sector. The Panamanian authorities
adopted a two-pronged approach to ensure banking sector stability. First, the national regulatory
and supervisory framework was being strengthened, moving toward a risk-based consolidated
supervision approach. Second, regulations were issued to protect the solvency and liquidity of
banks. These measures were expected to contribute to ensure the solvency and liquidity of the
banks and hence to maintain credit flows, a necessary condition for economic growth and poverty
reduction.

1.5 Revised Policy Areas

Policy areas were not revised. The DPL was single-tranche.

 II Maintaining stability

 II.1. The government has, through Executive Decree- The same legislative framework for the financial
      Law No.2 of the President and Executive Decree       sector remains in place.
      No. 52 of the Ministry of Economy and Finance,
      amended Banking Law No. 9 of 1998, thereby
      (i) extending the regulatory and supervisory
      powers of the Superintendency of Banks to
      financial conglomerates and cooperatives and
      savings and loans associations; (ii) introducing
      new procedures for the reorganization and
      liquidation of troubled banks; (iii) and
      improving the legal protection of the Borrower's
      Superintendent of Banks and his staff while
      acting in their official capacity.

 II.2. The Superintendency of Banks has, through           Directive No. 2-2008 has been rescinded.
       Directive No. 2-2008, instituted new general
       parameters for the evaluation of guarantees for
       mitigating credit risk.

 II.3. The Superintendency of Banks has issued             Principles for the management of liquidity risk
       Directive No. 004-2008 and Circular No. 047-        remain in place. Periodicity of reporting has
       2008, which together institute: (i) new             returned to once per week.
       conditions regarding policies, procedures and
       control systems available to banks in the
       Borrower's territory for the management of their
       liquidity risk, and (ii) new requirements for the
       banks to submit more detailed information
       regarding the structure of their liquidity
       positions.

 II.4. The Superintendency of Banks has, through           Directive No. 005-2008 remains in place, with
       Directive No. 005-2008, established new             some amendments and complementary directives.
       provisions regarding capital standards for credit
       risk applicable to banks on a consolidated basis.


2.2 Major Factors Affecting Implementation:

A strong CPS program supported the actions and the achievement of results under this DPL. Two
previous DPL operations had provided the client with a good understanding on how the budget
support operations work. The CPS program under implementation was quite strong in supporting
targeted assistance and expansion of health and nutrition services through the Panama Social
Protection Project and the Health Equity and Performance Improving Project. Analytical work
such as Poverty Assessment (FY07) and a Public Expenditure Review (FY06) supported the
design. To the contrary, the Bank had not been involved in the financial sector and relied on
assessments from the IMF such as the 2006 ROSC, which examined compliance of the banking
regulation and practices with Basel principles. In addition, a joint IMF/WB policy note on the
global financial crisis for 2008, as well as the inputs of special technical missions helps support
the design of the operation. The change of government affected the achievement of results in
certain areas. The DPL document had properly identified the change in government as a risk area.



                                                     6
Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization:

The Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF) was responsible for the implementation of the DPL
operation as well as for coordinating the actions among the concerned agencies, including the
Superintendency of Banks (SBP), the National Bank of Panama (BNP), the Ministry of Social
Development (MIDES), and the Ministry of Health (MINSA). Together with MEF and the
National Institute of Statistics (INE), these institutions collect the necessary data for the identified
monitoring indicators. The MEF and the Bank agreed to monitor the progress in the program
supported by the DPL and to utilize its evaluation to inform preparation of a new Country
Partnership Strategy, programmed for fall 2009 and delivered one year later in the fall of 2010.

2.4 Expected Next Phase/Follow-up Operation

The FY2011-FY2014 CPS, considered by the Board August 24, 2010, includes a substantive
lending and AAA in support of the themes under this DPL. On social issues, besides continued
implementation of the Social Protection and Health and Equity Performance Improvement
projects, proposed new operations include further support for the social protection system and
improving public sector efficiency. In addition, the FY2011-FY2014 CPS includes a
Programmatic Broad-Based Growth and Efficiency DPL series in support of the competitiveness
agenda of the government. The Bank will be participating jointly with the IMF in the preparation
of a Financial Sector Assessment (FSAP) upon the request of the government.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

The objectives and design of the DPL were relevant to Panama, which as an open economy was
highly exposed to the global crisis. The specific focus on protecting the poor was relevant to the
priority policy of government that sought to create mechanisms to share the benefits of growth
and wanted to avoid a reversal of the gains achieved. The focus on the financial sector to protect
against a downside risk was relevant given that difficulties in the banking sector were likely to
have a major and lasting impact on the competitive position of the economy. The design of the
DPL as a single tranche was adequate as it avoided committing the incoming administration to an
inherited policy framework.

3.2 Achievement of Program Development Objectives

Table 4 below, is a summary of actual achievements under the DPL Protecting the Poor under
Global Uncertainty relative to baselines and targets. Detailed Indicators provide evidence of
progress toward achieving PDOs including both quantitative and qualitative values and

Panama fared well during the global crisis. Economic growth at 2.4 percent in 2009 was one of the
highest in the region. Growth in 2010 is expected to reach 4.8 percent. The authorities maintained a
prudent macro-economic stance that further enhanced its public debt rating, which has now reached the
level of investment grade. The country upheld the limits set by the SFRL fiscal rule on the Nonfinancial
Public Sector (NFPS) fiscal balance, excluding the PCA, with a public sector deficit below 1 percent of
GDP, excluding the Panama Canal Authority.2 The government maintained level of its social expenditure.
Information on the impact of the crisis on the poor suggest that overall poverty rate continue to decline,
but that improvements for the extreme poor stagnated. The labor market remained, with unemployment
continuing to drop in 2009. The financial sector remains strong: high on liquidity, low levels of non-
performing assets, and well capitalized. The agenda to improve its regulatory framework and practices
continues. In 2010, the country debt reached investment grade status according to Fitch and Standard and
Poor's.

3.2.2 Mitigating the Impact of the economic shocks on the poor (Moderately Satisfactory)


3.2.2.1 Harnessing social programs to respond to crises.

The Red de Oportunidades program remains in operation benefitting around 63,000 households. The
current government maintains the B./50 transfer set in mid-2008 in response to the global food price
crisis. In real terms, the current transfer is higher than the previous level of B./35 in place up to mid-2008.
The program is covering 63,000 households, a lower number than in March 2009 because the database
has been cleaned from double counting.3 In addition, the program is well targeted; surveys indicate that
80 percent of the recipient households are in the lowest quintile of the distribution of income.4 The
incoming administration audited the Red de Oportunidades program and suspended one of the two private
agents managing the transfers to the beneficiaries because the contractor was not maintaining adequate
bookkeeping. The transfers to the beneficiaries were frozen while a new transfer system was put into
place; but, once the new system became operational (November, 2009), the government resumed the
transfers including the backlogged amounts. The new administration remains committed to the CCT
Program and has included it in its economic and social strategy. The following step foreseen in the
strategy is to utilize the existing network to strengthen the capacity of and the opportunities in the local
communities and to deliver other complementary services (training, education) that will allow the poor to
increase their incomes.

Coordination across the various social assistance programs is improving. The household registry and
management information system constructed to support the Red de Oportunidades program identified
around 200,000 poor households and potential beneficiaries, of which the Red de Oportunidades provides
financial assistance to those that meet the health, education and elderly presence eligibility criteria. The
household database provides a foundation upon which build additional programs to help the poor, as done
in the previous administration through: (a) income generating activities for disabled people; (b)
agricultural training programs executed by INADEH; (c) a housing improvement program for the poor.
The new government main social assistance initiatives, linked to their electoral commitments
("inperdonables') were not targeted to the poor. Thus, a leading program for the elderly, 100 Balboas at
70 years of age, was launched untargeted covering 85,000 individuals. Since this program was launched,
efforts are underway to refocus the 100 B./ at 70 program on the poor, by cleaning the its database
utilizing the information from Red de Oportunidades. In addition, the coordination between Red de
Oportunidades and health and nutrition programs has tightened during this administration both to
facilitate the proof of eligibility and to benefit from each programs' databases. The databases of the
conditional cash transfer (CCT) program and the health and nutrition program are built from different
sources, but the overlap is considerable and an increasing and timelier exchange of information is
benefiting both programs.

3.2.2.2 Improving quality and coverage of health and nutrition services to the extreme poor

Improving the quality and coverage of health services to the extreme poor continued to expand
during the economic slowdown of 2009. The expansion of coverage of health services has taken place

in line with the Estrategia de Extensión de Cobertura (EEC) that now assists communities that are more
than one hour away from a health center that has, at a minimum, one doctor and one nurse. This health
package is currently being offered, through mobile teams of health providers, to poor and isolated rural
communities without access to a health facility. As a result of the expansion, the Ministry of Health
reports that, since January, 2009, 76, 000 additional people living in the indigenous areas (Comarcas)
benefit from the ambulatory health services. According to the Ministry of Health, the EEC serves around
451,090 persons. The Ministry of Health plans to incorporate the lessons learned from expanding
coverage to the isolated areas to improve and strengthen the delivery of health services through the main
health services network.

In addition, the program that seeks to expand a comprehensive nutrition component in the package
of basic health services delivered to poor and isolated communities is on track. The Ministry of
Health and the National Nutrition Secretariat (SENAPAN) published a National Plan to Combat Child
Malnutrition (2008-15), a key action of which was the inclusion of an integrated package of nutritional
services in the basic package of preventive and promotion health services (Paquete de Atención Integral
de Servicios de Salud, PAISS) provided by the Coverage Extension Strategy, Estrategia de Extensión de
Cobertura (EEC). Under the new national plan, nutrition services are to include growth promotion and
monitoring at the community level following a strategy known as AIN-C (Atención Integral a la Niñez en
la Comunidad). As of today, nutrition services are provided in the basic package of preventive and
promotional health services, although four of the 15 of components of the nutrition package have yet to be
fully rolled out to all communities. The expectation is that they will be fully rolled out by the end of 2010.

3.2.2.3 Maintain levels of social protection spending during economic downturns

The government maintained the level of social expenditure (health, education and social assistance)
as programmed in the 2009 Budget Law (Law No. 69--2008) in line with the priorities of the
Acuerdos de la Concertación Nacional. An examination of the 2009 budgetary outturns suggests that
social expenditure (health, education, and social assistance) increased in 2009 in line with overall public
expenditure. In 2009, public expenditure of the Central Government increased by 25.1 over the previous
year, while public investment increased by 13.1 percent. At the same time, outturns of public investment
in social ministries increased as well: Education (8.8 percent), Health (42.1 percent); and, Social
Development (15.6 percent.) 5 While a formal stock-taking of individual social projects was not available
at the time of the ICR, overall execution of the resources allocated in the 2009 Budget Law (Law N0. 69)
were in line with the priorities identified in the Acuerdos de Concertación.6 During the transition between
administrations, however, the institutional mechanism for verifying implementation of the Acuerdos was
not operative, and therefore a formal evaluation of the compliance with the accords did not take place.

  In 2006, the Government initiated a national dialogue around development priorities and the document Directivas
de la Concertación Nacional para el Desarrollo of October 2007 summarized the agreements reached with
representatives from a broad range of social, political, religious, professional, and social organizations.
The Acuerdos foresaw an allocation of 360 million B./ in 2009 for investment in projects covering a broad range of
objectives: poverty reduction, education, health, water and sanitation, environment, transport, scientific
development, titling, training and skills development, etc. According to Ministerio de Economía y Finanzas (MEF),
the 2009 budget included a total of 1880 projects related to the Acuerdos to be carried out by 42 agencies. In
addition, the budget included 39 strategic projects monitored by the Presidency for a total of 630 million B./ These
projects included important initiatives such as the Red de Oportunidades, health and nutrition, transport and water
and sanitation. Formal auditing of implementation of individual projects has not taken place.




                                                        12
Law 20 set the institutional framework to implement and monitor the agreements; this law established the
legal basis for the National Council for the National Development Dialogue and the Presidential Secretary
of Goals and the Social Cabinet. The Council and the Secretary were responsible for verifying the
implementation and goals of the Concertación Nacional, while the Social Cabinet was to be responsible
for the coordination of all social agencies in the implementation of the Agreements.

The new government has just completed the institutional arrangements to continue implementation
of Law 20. The government has just completed the process of setting in place the mechanisms mandated
by Law 20 to monitor compliance with the Acuerdos de Concertación Nacional. On September 23, 2010,
the Consejo Ejecutivo de la Concertación para el Desarrollo installed a technical committee in charge of
monitoring the implementation of the Acuerdos, composed by the Ministerio de Economia y Finanzas
(MEF), the Secretaria de Metas Presidenciales, el Ministerio de Desarrollo Social (MIDES) and the
Executive Secretary. Reportedly the government plans to align the commitments under the Acuerdos de
Concertación, the Government Strategy 2010-2014, the Millennium Development Goals and the priority
commitments of the Presidency ("inperdonables".)

The ICR rates achievements of results under this pillar as moderately satisfactory. Of the five
results expected under this pillar, four have been achieved--increasing the real value of the CCT
transfers, expanding the coverage of health, expanding the nutrition program and maintaining social
spending. The hiatus in the operation of the institutional mechanisms under Law-20 to monitor the
agreements under the Acuerdos de Concertación has meant that a formal assessment of the
implementation of the related commitments included in the 2009 Budget was not undertaken. However,
maintaining the level of social expenditure during 2009 and financing of key programs such as Red de
Oportunidades addressed a key concern under the DPL. Now that the mechanisms to track
implementation of the agreements under the accords have been reactivated, the national dialogue on
social development and tracking commitments to social expenditure should improve. Lastly, while the
social assistance initiatives of the new administration did not emphasize targeting, the interest of the
government in coordinating social programs and focusing on the poor has increased.

3.2.3 Maintaining stability by strengthening financial sector supervision and stability: Satisfactory.


The Government successfully contained the potential impact of the crisis on its financial sector
through initiatives aimed to tighten regulation and oversight as well as continuing with the
program to improve on the regulatory practices. As a result of the measures taken, the tighter
oversight and the resilience of the economy, the final impact of the economic slowdown and the global
financial crisis on the financial sector of Panama was small. Thus, the overall goal of protecting the
financial sector during the crisis was met. In addition, regulatory practices are under improvement to take
better account of risks.

The productive sectors did not need access to special lines of credit in the amounts initially
envisioned. Given the tightening credit market conditions in 2008, the government created the Programa
de Estímulo Financiero, PEF, a fund, for up to US$1.1 billion, intended to offer banks access to medium-
term credit in order for them to increase their lending activities to productive sectors. The Fund resources
available reached US$400 million of which US$240 million have been committed and US$60 million
disbursed. Intended financing from multilateral institutions was not necessary. The Fund will close at the
end of 2010. The limited size of commitments from the fund as compared to the original intention reflect
the success in averting any major disruptions in the flow of funds from the financial sector to productive
agents through a tight oversight that assured investors and depositors of the soundness of the banking
sector.


                                                    13
Temporary measures taken to reduce the negative impact of extraordinary global financial
volatility on bank's equity position is being phased out as they are no longer needed. Specifically
Directive-8-2008 allowed banks to request transfer securities held by them under the `available-for-sale'
category to the `Held-to-maturity' securities to reduce the possible negative impact of drops in the market
value of securities on the value of assets of the banks and their equity position. Directive-8-2008 included
in the eligible securities : (a) obligations issued by the Panamanian state; (b) Treasury Bills and Notes of
the USA; and (c) sovereign debt obligations of Latin American governments. As the threat of a crisis was
lifted, Directive-1-2009 cancelled Directive-8-2009, allowing banks to keep in place the reclassified
values.

The Directive to tighten the valuation of collateral to cover credit risk has rescinded. Directive No.
2-2008 tightened the parameters and basic general guidelines regarding the uptake of collateral for
mitigating credit risk as protective measure during the crisis. This Directive, however, was cancelled by
Directive No. 8-2009, which stipulates that a new proposal for collateral valuation procedures will be
prepared. The view of the SBP is that the postponement does not represent a major weakness as asset
valuation guidelines under the law and other Directives (such as Directive-5-2008) provide minimum and
satisfactory guidelines. Moreover, crisis concerns have eased.

Tightened norms on liquidity management are under implementation. Directive No. 4-2008
(October 1, 20008) replaced Directive No. 9-2006 updating conditions regarding the banks' policies,
procedures and control systems needed for an effective management of liquidity risk and compliance with
liquidity requirements. The norm established the responsibilities of the boards of directors to set up
policies and strategies for the daily management of liquidity, and to establish contingency plans to
manage potential liquidity needs. The norm also requires that banks have liquidity risk assessment
manuals with policies and procedures for the valuation of the liquidity risk adequate to the structure and
complexity of their operations. The norm reiterated the minimum of 30 percent weekly legal liquidity
requirement that most banks must keep at all times and of 20 percent for those banks that keep an
interbank deposit quarterly greater than 80 percent of their total deposits. These norms are under
implementation.

During this DPL, Panama continued implementing its program to improve its regulation of the
financial sector through the Superintendence of Banks (SBP).7 The Decree-Law 2 of 2008 amended
the 1998 banking law and mandated a consolidated new text called the new Banking Law---Executive
Decree 30 of 2008. The result has been strengthening of the regulatory framework by filling existing
vacuum and making explicit powers that were not openly defined in the previously legislation. The new
law contains all the relevant elements of a modern banking law, addressing concerns noted by the IMF
ROSC noted above. Specifically, it strengthens the SBP institutionally and improves the legal protection
of its officials, granting the SBP more autonomy to administer its human and financial resources and
creating the career of Bank Supervisor as a specialized profession with professional standards and clear
rights and obligations. In addition, auditing standards have been improved thus giving the SBP a better
understanding of the impact of the international financial crisis on Panamanian banks. The law
strengthens external auditing standards by requiring compliance with accounting norms approved by the

7
   The SBP was created by 1998 Banking Law. According to the 2006/2007 IMF Report [Panama: Detailed
Assessment of Observance of Standard and Codes for Banking Supervision, Insurance Supervision, and Securities
Regulation--February 2007], Panama met all but 2 Basel-1 Core Principles. The scope for improvement, however,
was considerable given that for several of the principles the country was only largely (not fully) complaint. Based
on the lessons learned, the recommendations from external reviews and the need to bring the regulatory practices to
international levels to enhance the relevance of Panama as a regional financial center, the government and the SBP
engaged in a thorough revision of the regulatory financial framework.

SBP. The SBP has the authority to reject the hiring of external auditors that fail to meet standards of
independence and experience as well as reject audit reports that have not been elaborated according to the
law.

New procedures under the new Banking Law for addressing troubled banks (including
reorganization and liquidation) helped SBP face the challenge posed by Stanford Bank. Using the
powers granted by the new Banking Law, in February 17 2009 the SBP ordered the administrative
takeover of Stanford Bank, later extending the period of takeover to undertake a reorganization of the
Stanford Bank in order to protect the investors, facilitate its sale, and unblock assets in the U.S. (Texas)
and Switzerland. The process was completed in April 2010 with the sale of the bank to private investors.8

The SBP is carrying out consolidated regulation and supervision of the banks under its purview.
The new Banking Law extends explicit powers to the SBP to undertake consolidated regulation and
supervision and to enter into agreements with other jurisdictions to carry out this mandate. According to
the SBP these norms are under implementation. The rapid compliance with the expected results is due to
the fact that the SBP was already undertaking consolidated supervision relying on article 17 of the 1999
law that extended various powers to the President of the SBP and agreements already signed with the
supervisory bodies of other jurisdictions (now at 24). Indeed, the IMF 2006 ROSC found the country
compliant with consolidated supervision (Principle No. 20). 9 It remains the case though that the new
Banking Law made more explicit the powers of regulation over conglomerates enhancing the capacity to
adequately monitor and manage risks. According to the SBP, today all conglomerates are supervised and
report to the SBP consolidated accounts.

Capital Asset Ratio (CAR) regulations on a consolidated basis are now being met. Directive No. 5-
2008 (October 1 2008) replacing Directives No. 5 y No. 6 of 1998 established norms defining the main
factors to be considered for the calculation of primary and secondary capital and the deductions that apply
in the calculation of the CAR. The Directive 5-2008 responded to the growth and evolution of the risk
profiles of both banks with general license and with international license. Directive 5-2008 required
compliance with the CAR a consolidated basis, and not by bank, as previously was the case. In
accordance with the new Banking Law, Directive 5-2008 reiterates that the CAR cannot fall below 8
percent of the total weighted assets and off-balance sheet operations that represent an irrevocable
contingency, weighted in proportion to their risks, and that the total CAR will be calculated on a group
basis. The law allows the SBP to modify the ratio, if required, given the risk profile of a bank or bank
group, and to include other risks (market, operational and country risk) in the valuation of the capital
requirement. The SBP reports that banks comply with Directive No-2008, which became effective July
2009. Previous progress with consolidated supervision has facilitated compliance with Directive 5-2008.

  The IMF 2007 ROSC noted "The on-site supervision teams conduct inspections of all entities controlled by banks,
including non-banking activities in Panama and banking in foreign jurisdictions carried out through subsidiaries or
branches of Panamanian banks." In addition: "The on-site examinations program for consolidated supervision is
active and includes deep analysis of relevant risks of all components of the banking groups, including inspections of
non-banking activities. Economic groups are subject to consolidated supervision requirements for balance sheet and
income statement and a requirement that the year-end consolidated financial statement supervision program

The ICR rates the achievements of results under this pillar as satisfactory.

The financial sector of Panama came out in a strong position from the financial crisis as feared downside
risks did not materialize in part due to the careful monitoring of liquidity risks by the regulatory
authorities and in part because of the impact of the crisis on economic activity was relatively mild. Feared
deposit withdrawals by foreigners did not take place. Today, liquidity remains high, the percentage of
non-performing loans remains low, and the aggregate financial system capitalization exceeds Basel
criteria; the profitability of the sector understandably has decreased. Thus the overall objective of
protecting the downside risk of a financial shock to the economy was met. Concurrently, the government
(SBP) continued strengthening of the regulatory framework and practices initiated under the new Banking
Law of 2008, with an emphasis on consolidated supervision and focus on identifying and managing
potential risks. Three of the expected four results were met. These include (a) monitoring of liquidity; (b)
consolidated supervision of conglomerates; and (c) capital deductions in line with risk criteria in the
calculation of the capital required ratios on a consolidated basis. A directive tightening the valuation of
collateral on loans was rescinded, but given the ebbing of the crisis and the existence of complementary
regulation, the issue is not of great concern. In addition, the SBP used the powers to take control of
troubled banks under the new Banking Law to sort of the difficulties presented by Stanford Bank.

3.3 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Ratings: Moderately Satisfactory

The transfer of government affected the timely delivery of all of the expected results. However, the
likelihood is high that all of the results under the DPL will be achieved, as corrective actions such as
setting of the mechanisms to monitor social expenditure and the renewed focus on targeted social
expenditure are underway. In financial sector, the implementation of the Directive on valuing of
guarantees for loans was not implemented, but the drafting of a new one is under consultation.

3.4 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

The actions supported under the DPL had a direct impact on softening the impact of the economic
slowdown on the poor through recuperating the real value of the CCT transfer, the expansion of health
and nutrition services to isolated areas, and the maintaining the level of public expenditure. In addition,
successful efforts to soften the impact of the global crisis on domestic economic activity prevented high
income losses and emergence of unemployment. Moderate poverty in 2009 is reported at 29.9 a
significant reduction from 37.1 percent in 2005. Absolute poverty decreased from 22.5 percent in 2005 to
16.1 in 2009. The Gini coefficient decreased from .538 in 2005 to .521 in 2009. The rate of
unemployment continued to drop through 2009.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

Institutional impact is high in all areas of engagement. The DPL program continued to support the
strong institutional transformation process that the Bank had been supporting during CPS period and the
previous Interim Strategy. On social assistance, the DPL helped advance two important agendas; (a) the
institutional consolidation of the conditional transfer system and (b) the extension of health and nutrition
to isolated populations. Work on both of these agendas is continuing under the current administration,
which, in addition, has incorporated its own initiatives on social assistance and is examining next steps to
improve the coordination across social programs possibly through the development of a unified
beneficiary database. The social dialogue on public expenditure priorities and monitoring of the Acuerdos

                                                    16
de Concertación will continue now that the government has appointed the staff in charge to implement
the law.

The agenda that the DPL supported in the financial sector is having and will continue to have a major
impact on the quality of the regulatory design and its implementation. That agenda is grounded in the
support that the new Banking law provides and focused on beginning implementation of Basel II
principles thus emphasizing the identification and management of risks for banks and conglomerates. 10
Complementary actions include the plan to complete 12 tax-treaties by the end of 2010 as part of the
process to qualify for the OECD to remove Panama from its gray list. Progress in this institutional agenda
in the financial sector is fundamental for Panama to deepen its competitive advantage in financial
services, while at the same time adhering to international practices.

N/A

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome (Negligible to Low)

The risk to development outcomes is negligible to low. In the financial sector, the risk to the sustainability
of the gains in design and quality of banking regulation is nil because of the commitment of the
authorities to enhance risk-based supervision and to adopt Basel II regulatory requirements. In addition,
the authorities will have the technical support of a forthcoming FSAP that will access thoroughly the
design and practice of banking regulation and will identify actions that will help the country strengthen
consolidated risk-based regulation. In the social arena, the government's social agenda supports the
continuation of the health and nutrition programs and the institutions to oversee social expenditure
(Acuerdos de Concertación, MDG, government program and Imperdonables) are in place. The emphasis
on consolidating social expenditure and targeting it preferentially to the poor might take longer, given the
technical and coordination challenges and much will depend on the role played by the Ministry of Social
Protection and the Ministry of Finance.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry (Satisfactory)

The design of the DPL was appropriate, timely, and focused on critical challenges for the country arising
from the global financial crisis. The one-tranche design was consistent with acting promptly at the end of
one administration, when mid-term commitments involving the next administration may not have been

                                                     17
appropriate. In addition, the design aligned with advancing a reform agenda that had been under
implementation under the previous ISN and the on-going CPS. Thus the DPL agenda fit the main country
challenges, which were curtailing short-term risks while continuing with the implementation of the
institutional building agenda that was underway. The DPL design built on work the Bank was already
supporting in the social sectors; The Bank, however, had not been involved in the financial sector. Here,
the Bank design relied on previous work that the IMF had undertaken, timely background analytical notes
and the cooperation of the client.

(b) Quality of Supervision (Moderately Satisfactory)

The Bank supervised implementation as part of the verification of compliance with the triggers for the
operation, all of which were met. After disbursement, the Bank supervised the program as part of the
preparation of a new Country Partnership Strategy, with focus on those areas that needed attention in the
dialogue with the new government to assure smooth continuity of the program. Bank supervision of has
been an important factor in informing the incoming authorities on technical aspects of the DPL program.
The Bank took remedies to reduce the risks to the program from the transition between governments, such
as an active dialogue with all key political parties and the preparation of policy notes for the incoming
administration. In addition, the dialogue and supervision of other Bank operations, including the Social
Protection Project and the Health Equity and Performance Improvement Project helped mitigate
institutional capacity risks. Still, the Bank may have underestimated the risks of the transition across
administrations to the full and timely delivery of results and also should have paid more attention to
follow-up on the particular results and outcomes of this operation.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance (Moderately Satisfactory)

The design and timing of the operation was highly satisfactory, but the institutional risks of the transition
may have been underestimated, even after the substantive efforts of the bank to monitor key
developments. Overall the performance of the Bank is considered moderately satisfactory. The Bank
provided timely and relevant support to Panama with a program that had institutional impact, focus on the
poor and where the risk to the development outcomes is negligible to low.


5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance: Moderately Satisfactory

Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

The Government showed strong ownership the design of the DPL and delivered on all of the triggers of
the operation. After the change in governments, the commitment of the authorities to continue improving
the quality of the regulatory practices as mandated by the new Banking Law has continued, under the new
leadership of the SBP. The new authorities are keen as well with complying with OECD guidelines and
removing the country from the OECD gray list and they intend to move to implement Basel 2. The
strategy of the new government is committed to social development, whose agenda combines programs
under implementation with new initiatives. However, in some areas, the transition meant delays such as in
the implementation of the institutions to follow on the Acuerdos de Concertación or the attention given to
the targeting social assistance to the poorest segment of the population. In addition, focus on monitoring
of intended results and coordinating the actions among the concerned agencies, including the
Superintendency of Banks (SBP), the National Bank of Panama (BNP), the Ministry of Social
Development (MIDES), and the Ministry of Health (MINSA) was weak.

6. Lessons Learned

       To support a country during a crisis situation through a budget support operation the Bank
       should not limit its intervention to areas where it has an on-going program. An on-going
       program of lending and AAA facilitates the delivery of timely and well design budget support
       operations. However, in a crisis situation a country may need support in areas where the Bank has
       not been actively involved. In these situations, the Bank should be guided by the relevance of the
       areas of intervention and not by the on-going program. Still, the design should mitigate the design
       risks through cooperation with other agencies and preparation of timely diagnostics. Under this
       DPL, the Bank team's focus on the financial sector was adequate even if the Bank had not been
       actively involved in the sector.

       A one-tranche DPL is an adequate instrument to support a country in a crisis situation at
       the end of an administration, but the design should seek to minimize the risk to the delivery
       of results. A one tranche DPL operation avoids committing an incoming administration with
       development commitments. Still, the process of transition between two administrations may delay
       delivery of expected development results under the DPL, because it may take time to align new
       and preceding strategies and because of the lack of commitment to a programmatic agenda going
       forward. The experience under this DPL is that those risks are high even when the project teams
       make the best efforts to minimize them. Hence, the importance of designing sturdy results
       frameworks by minimizing dependence on the actions of the incoming administration.
