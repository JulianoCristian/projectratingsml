At the time the project was formulated\n            (1996-97), municipal finance in Colombia was expanding\n            rapidly, and longer terms with funding from local financial\n            markets seemed imminent. Although private participation was\n            mainly concentrated in 2 or 3 sectors in this project, its\n            role has proved important in accomplishing the main outcomes\n            of the project, and crucial in increasing loan volume in\n            response to the crisis. FINDETER has played an important\n            role in traditional sectors as water and sanitation,\n            education and transport. Although automatic rediscounting\n            has proved to be an excellent lending instrument, FINDETER\n            should improve this mechanism, partly by learning from other\n            second-floor banks' automatic rediscounting. The\n            project has demonstrated the need for flexibility, financial\n            innovation and continuous learning under the complex\n            framework of the economy. Close Bank involvement as part of\n            the FINDETER team clearly made important contributions to\n            the organization and the operation during the eventful\n            period of the project (1997 to mid 2004)."}, "docdt": "2004-12-09T00:00:00Z"}
