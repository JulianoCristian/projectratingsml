Re:  Colombia

First Amendment to the Loan Agreement
Dear Sirs: 
 
Please refer to the Loan Agreement (the “Loan Agreement”) for the above-
referenced Project between the 
Financiera de Desarrollo Territorial S. A.
 
(FINDETER)
 
(the “Borrower”) and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (the 
“Bank”), and to the Guarantee Agreement (the Guarantee Agreement) between the 
Republic of Colombia (the Guarantor) and the Bank, both dated July 31, 1998. 
Terms not defined herein shall have the meaning assigned to them in the Loan  
Agreement. 
Pursuant to your letter dated July 29, 2002 and discussions between the Borrower 
and the Bank, we are pleased to inform you that we agree to amend the Loan Agreement 
as follows: 
1. 
Schedule 1 of the Loan Agreement
–
pursuant to Section 6.01 of the General 
Conditions applicable to Loan and Guarantee Agreements, the Bank hereby cancels as of 
July 29, 2002 the amount of twenty six million dollars (US$26,000,000) equivalent from 
the Loan
 
as set forth in the table attached to this letter. As a consequence, Schedule 3 of 
the Loan Agreement (the Amortization Schedule) is being revised by the Bank as a result 
of the cancellation, and the revised figures will be sent to you shortly. 
2. Schedule 
6
,
Section 1, subparagraph 2 (c)  the Loan Agreement is hereby 
amended so as to allow new commitments of Project funds until December 31, 2002; 
therefore, said paragraph is replaced to read in its entirety as follows: 
Page  2
-2-  
 
“(c) 
Applications and requests made pursuant to the provisions of 
subparagraphs (a) and (b) of this paragraph shall be presented to the Bank on or 
before December 31, 2002.” 
 
Section 3, Part A, paragraph 3 to the Loan Agreement is hereby amended so as to 
allow subloans of less than eight years to be financed by FINDETER up to 100%; 
therefore said paragraph is hereby replaced to read in its entirety as follows: 
 
“(3) 
Subloans shall be financed up to 100% of their amount. 
Please confirm your agreement to the foregoing amendments by signing and 
dating this letter in the spaces provided below.  This amendment letter will be 
executed in two counterparts, each of which shall be an original. Upon confirmation, 
please return one fully executed original to us.  The provisions set forth in this 
amendment letter will become effective, as of the date of this letter, upon receipt by 
the Bank of one fully executed original of this amendment letter. 
Very truly yours,
