Experience with\n            these projects highlight the following lessons: 1) Policy\n            and programs should continue to focus upon urban services\n            improvements, which local authorities and entities should be\n            willing to implement and finance, if strengthened local\n            credit markets are to be effectively established to work. 2)\n            The market for local sub-sovereign credit may be shallower\n            than commonly believed. 3) To be profitable and still\n            affordable to the poor, local urban services must operate\n            very efficiently in order to keep costs down."}, "docdt": "2006-06-19T00:00:00Z"}
