"versiontyp": "Final", "abstracts": {"cdata!": "Ratings for the Second Multi-Donor Trust\n            Fund (MDTF2) for Public Financial Management Modernization\n            Project for Vietnam were as follows: outcomes were\n            moderately satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was\n            moderate, the Bank performance was moderately satisfactory,\n            and the Borrower performance was also moderately\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned included:  MDTF2 was\n            restructured after about two and haft years of slow\n            implementation so as to fit it into the new reality and to\n            keep it running at difficult times. The task team, from the\n            design stage, already envisioned a flexible mechanism in\n            adjusting the scope and result framework over the course of\n            implementation. The restructuring helped sharpen the\n            project's focus and better articulated its role in the\n            Government overall PFM reforms. Appropriate restructuring,\n            as shown in this case of MDTF, attributed to accelerating\n            the political momentum for reforms on the MOF side that in\n            turn led to successful completion of the project by the end\n            of 2013. This innovative approach to project management\n            provided tangible incentives and accountability for the\n            beneficiaries to deliver. It is worth noting, however, that\n            the delegation by itself could not guarantee success.\n            Rather, it had to be conducted in tandem with: (1)\n            appropriate institutional arrangement whereby the Project\n            Management Unit or PMU retained its role as coordinator,\n            facilitator, and supervisor; and (2) enhanced frequency and\n            efficacy of communication among the Bank task team, or PMU,\n            and implementing agencies. For future Technical Assistance,\n            or TA operation, it will be desirable to define at the\n            design stage a few selected key areas of strategic focus for\n            support while keeping a small part of the program open to\n            respond to newly identified priorities and adjust for\n            changes in the pace of on-going reforms."}, "docdt": "2014-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
