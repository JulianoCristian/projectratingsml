F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)

The project development objectives (PDOs) of this MDTF on public financial
management are for the Bank and contributing donors to support the client to develop
capacities towards strengthened public finance management system through a)
developing robust and efficient systems for raising and deploying resources, b) improving
quality and effectiveness of expenditures in achieving government’s social and economic
policies, c) supporting the introduction of market orientation for public finance
management, and d) promoting transparency and accountability at all levels in the
management of public finances. The PDOs are complementary to three higher level
objectives of the country's four key reform pillars, namely improved business
environment, social inclusion and governance. These will also support the achievement
of the country's Socio-Economic Development Plan goal of becoming a middle income
country in 2010 with strengthened public governance.

Revised Project Development Objectives (as approved by original approving
authority)

Strengthened capacity for increased coordination and transparency in public financial
management; improved revenue mobilization; and effective and efficient public
expenditure management.

The revised PDO has three intermediate outcomes and 15 outcome indicators, which will
be measured through progress on various reform activities and programs of the Project
(see Annex 2 for details). The reform activities are linked directly to the achievement of
the intermediate outcomes, which in turn will contribute to the overall PDO.

1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

The objectives of the Project were to support the Government of Vietnam to develop
capacities to strengthen its public finance management system through: (a) developing
robust and efficient systems for raising and deploying resources; (b) improving the
quality and effectiveness of public expenditures in achieving the Recipient’s social and
economic policies; (c) supporting the introduction of market orientation in public finance
management; and (d) promoting transparency and accountability at all levels in the
management of public finances. The objectives were complementary to three higher level
objectives of the country’s four key reform pillars, namely improved business
environment, social inclusion and governance. These were to support the achievement of
the country’s Socio-Economic Development Plan goal of becoming a middle income
country in 2010 with strengthened public governance.

1.1 Context at Appraisal

Country and Sector background: At the time of the project preparation in 2008,
Vietnam had been among the fastest-growing economies in the world for almost two
decades. Over these years, comprehensive economic reforms had led to rapid economic
growth and remarkable progress on development outcomes, including rapid poverty
reduction. Vietnam was expected to be reaching middle-income country status by 2010.
However, reaching middle-income status would require further financial deepening to
support capital mobilization, the regulation of access to and pricing of infrastructure
services, the gradual development of modern social insurance, more effective tools for
environmental protection, public financial management reforms, legal and judiciary
reforms, and the effective containment of corruption, among others.

Vietnam’s economic development over the previous decades had been accompanied
by continuous efforts to establish a sound public financial management system in
the country. With the adoption of the first organic budget law in 1996 and its revision in
2002, a solid legal framework for public resource management had been put in place. A
centralized treasury system was set up with branches extending from the center to all
provinces and districts to provide basic essential financial services to all government
agencies. Steady progress had been achieved in making the budget more predictable and
pro-poor and the budgeting process more transparent and participatory. Substantial
efforts were made to improve transparency in the use of public resources through
provision to the public of increased information on detailed government spending as well
as wider disclosure of government expenditure policies, regulations and procedures.
Vietnam had been recognized for its relatively prudent fiscal policy.

Despite positive progress, considerable challenges remained. Although fiscal trends
had been positive, a number of threats to fiscal sustainability existed in the forms of off-
budget bonds to finance infrastructure and contingent liabilities arising from the
operations of the Vietnam Development Bank, banking sector and other subnational



                                             1
development funds. The composition of public expenditure remained imbalanced in favor
of capital expenditure, negatively affecting the efficiency of public resources. Processes
for prioritizing expenditures remained ineffective and expenditure planning was still
conducted without reference to medium-term resource constraints. There were
shortcomings in Vietnam’s public financial management information systems and public
accounting regulations. The lack of a fully consolidated budget made it difficult to
monitor total revenues and expenditures, as well as the true fiscal position. Extra-
budgetary funds, on-lent official development assistance were not consolidated into the
budget. The lack of common accounting structures resulted in numbers which were
inconsistent and hard to compare. The lack of integrated, electronic data recording and
reporting resulted in laborious manual consolidation and manipulation of data from
multiple satellite databases, and in financial reporting which was neither timely nor
accurate. These deficiencies contributed to the poor flow of budgetary information
between government ministries, provinces, development partners and the public.

There were significant weaknesses in revenue administration as well. Vietnamese
Customs were still considered low, unresponsive, inconsistent and vulnerable to
corruption. A long-term vision with clear strategic goal was lacking. Customs
administration needed to change significantly, shifting from a culture of domestic
protection and control of all transactions to one that facilitates foreign trade and promotes
private sector development. Tax administration was characterized by low compliance and
vulnerability towards corruption. Significant modernization in tax administration was
needed: (1) to streamline the legal framework related to tax administration; (2) to ensure
effective coordination and information sharing between the tax administration and other
government agencies; (3) to provide taxpayers with better knowledge about the tax laws
and compliance procedures; (4) to provide equate professional skills and staff training;
and (5) to upgrade ICT system to be in line with the requirements of a modern tax
administration. Tax laws and policies would need further reform to broaden the tax base,
reduce the number of rates and exemptions.

Since late 2007, the Ministry of Finance had adopted the Single Strategy Document
(SSD) aiming at speeding up and improving the quality and effectiveness of reforms as
well as the collaboration between specific sub-sectors reforms of overall PFM reform
within the ministry over the period to 2010. Those reforms were organized around seven
pillars: strengthening state budget expenditure management, state budget revenue
management, public debt management, financial market supervision and bond market
development, corporate finance management, public assets management, and price
control.

Project Background: The Project, MDTF-2, was a continuation of a successful trust
fund operation (MDTF-1) which was a first attempt to pool funding from development
partners to provide efficient and consistent TA advice to support PFM reform in
Vietnam. Six development partners (Australia, Canada, European Commission,
Denmark, the Netherlands, and Switzerland) agreed to finance the second MDTF for
Public Financial Management Modernization (MDTF-2) until the end of 2012. The
MDTF-2 would mainly finance the needs of technical assistance and capacity building
activities, and analytical and diagnostic work as laid out in the SSD. The MDTF-2 was to


                                             2
provide for greater strategic focus of the activities to be financed, greater MOF ownership
in project selection and financial management desired by MOF in consistent with the
Hanoi Core Statement on Aid Effectiveness (HCS), and more institutional capacity
building. The MDTF-2 was designed to be a four year technical assistance project
executed by the government and administered by the World Bank.

Rationale for Bank Assistance: Public Financial Management, a comparative advantage
of the Bank in Vietnam, had been one the key priorities of the previous two Country
Assistance Strategies of the Bank and remained a priority for the Country Partnership
Strategy for the period 2007-2011. In addition to the MDTF, the Bank had been very
active in supporting the PFM reform through its lending operations and AAA works.
Furthermore, MDTF-2 would continue to strengthen the Bank’s coordination role in PFM
reform in Vietnam.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as
approved)

The project development objectives (PDOs) of the MDTF-2 for Public Financial
Management Modernization were to develop capacities towards a strengthened public
finance management system.

Project development objectives have seven intermediate outcomes:

   a) Better budget estimation with a medium term vision and a focus on outcomes, and
      improved effectiveness of resources allocation and utilization.
   b) Consistent and equitable system of tax policies, enhanced tax management and
      inspection capacities; transparent customs legal system, unified clearance system
      and professional staff.
   c) Public debt including borrowings of SOEs adequately managed, contributing to
      fiscal sustainability and the safety of national finance.
   d) Financial market especially bond market developed and supervised in a stable
      manner to provide the best financial resource for the economy.
   e) SOEs restructured with synchronized mechanisms for their corporate and
      financing management in line with international practices and eliminated
      privileged treatment in line with WTO commitments.
   f) Public assets and land in particular managed and utilized in a better integrated,
      effective and accountable manner to improve public services delivery and benefit
      all economic sectors.
   g) Pricing controlled and regulated basing on market mechanism, with monopoly
      pricing or dual pricing abolished as much as possible.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key
Indicators, and reasons/justification




                                            3
Revised PDO: Strengthened capacity for increased coordination and transparency in
public financial management; improved revenue mobilization; and effective and efficient
public expenditure management.

Intermediate outcomes: The revised PDO had three new intermediate outcomes, down
from seven in the original results framework. The intermediate outcomes related to the
areas directly supported by PFM MDTF 2:

   (i)    Increased coordination and transparency across the national PFM system
          through a clear reform strategy, greater disclosure, improved oversight capacity,
          more secure IT systems, and compliance with PFM legislation.

   (ii)   Improved revenue mobilization through equitable and efficient tax policies; and
          efficient customs administration.

   (iii) Strengthened expenditure management through higher accounting standards,
         and improved capacity in financial reporting, cash management, and state asset
         management.

Output indicators: The intermediate outcomes were measured by 15 new output
indicators, reflecting the breadth of areas covered under PFM MDTF 2, replacing the set
of 42 indicators in the original results framework. The proposed changes were fully in
line with the Project Appraisal Document for PFM MDTF 2, which indicated that the
original results framework was tentative, and that specific indicators would be identified
during implementation.

Reasons for revising PDO: The original PDO and Project results framework were a
summary of SSD objectives. PFM MDTF 2 was expected to only support a subset of
these. The intention as set out in the Project Appraisal Document was therefore to update
the results framework once specific projects and activities under PFM MDTF 2 were
agreed. The proposed revisions to the PDO and results framework accordingly reflected
the expected outputs and outcomes from agreed projects and activities. As the original
PDO and results framework were too broad to provide a reasonable basis for reviewing
Project performance, the restructuring, therefore, helped to tackle this issue by defining
more clearly the expected results of the Project.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

The main beneficiaries of the project were implementing departments of the Ministry of
Finance. These included: State Budget department, Accounting and Auditing Policy
department, State Treasury, Corporate Finance department, State Asset Management
department, IT department, Legal department, Debt Management and External Finance
department, Price Control department, Banking and Financial Institutions department,
Tax Policy department, General Taxation department, Personnel and Training
department, Insurance Management and Supervision department, Finance Institute. Other
individuals and organizations were also expected to benefit from the project such as line



                                             4
ministries and sub-national governments through the assessment of the PEFA and
attendance of training seminars and workshops supported by the Project.

1.5 Original Components

The project at design was expected to finance mainly technical assistance and capacity
building activities, and analytical and diagnostic work to be undertaken by the
Government. The project was designed as a pool of flexible funding made available to
MOF to support its public finance management reform program which consisted of the
following components:

   a) Budget management: strengthening institutional framework, capacity building,
      developing the Treasury and Budget Management Information System (TABMIS)
      as well as developing a medium and long term public expenditure framework to
      meet the requirements of public financial management.
   b) Budget revenue management (taxation and customs): strengthening the tax
      administration system and customs modernization to meet the requirements of
      economic growth and intensive international economic integration.
   c) Debt management: strengthening the system for recording domestic and external
      debt, and developing a debt management and risk management systems.
   d) Financial market supervision and bond market development: establishment of a
      financial service supervision agency (Financial Supervision Agency – FSA) and a
      road map for bond issuance and development of a bond market.
   e) Corporate finance management: strengthening financial management capacity and
      mechanism in Government’s business activities to speed up the equitization
      process and increase the efficient use of capital by state enterprises.
   f) Public assets management: strengthening the legal framework, strengthening the
      capacity of officials in-charge of managing public assets, developing a better
      system of monitoring public assets; enhancing the examination and inspection
      over the management and utilization of public assets.
   g) Price control: developing and improving legal system for price control;
      developing a professional price valuation system under the socialism-oriented
      market economy in Vietnam.

1.6 Revised Components

After the restructuring, project activities were not grouped into components; they were
rather reported by two implementation plans (IP1 and IP2). Activities were linked to the
outputs as set out in the revised result framework which had three components:

   (i) Increased coordination and transparency across the national PFM system through
       a clear reform strategy, greater disclosure, improved oversight capacity, more
       secure IT systems, and compliance with PFM legislation.

   (ii) Improved revenue mobilization through equitable and efficient tax policies; and
        efficient customs administration.



                                           5
    (iii)Strengthened expenditure management through higher accounting standards, and
         improved capacity in financial reporting, cash management, and state asset
         management.

1.7 Other significant changes

The Project went through two restructurings.

First restructuring: The first restructuring (January 6, 2011) involved following changes:

       Additional financing: The Swiss State Secretariat for Economic Affairs (SECO)
        joined the MDTF-2 in 14 December 2009 with contribution of CHF 2 million. As
        a result, the total commitments of the TF increased to USD 7,188,320 equivalent.
        Accordingly, allocation of expenditure categories was also revised as per table
        below :
                                                  Allocation                 % of Financing

        DPs’ administrative agreements1.

Second restructuring: The second restructuring (June 25, 2012) included the following
changes:

       Closing date: The restructuring extended the Project closing date from June 30,
        2012, to December 31, 2013.

       Change in PDO: The PDO was revised as described in section 1.3.

       Project financing: Total Grant amount based on the development partner
        commitments was approximately $7,563,320 (using FX rate at the time of
        restructuring) and the transfer of donor funding was conditional on

  The original closing date of the TF was set for June 30, 2011 to accommodate the end of disbursement
date (EOD) of 31 December 2011 in the Administration Agreement signed with the European Commission,
despite the fact that EOD of all other DPs was set for December 31, 2012. The EC then extended its EOD
to December 31, 2012 to be aligned with other development partners.

       implementation progress. Due to slow progress in the project implementation, the
       donors were not been able to disburse their full committed amounts. Total final
       paid-in contributions from donors amounted to $5,862,417 which was considered
       sufficient to cover the costs of IP 1 and IP 2, after taking account of the Bank’s
       administration costs. Among Development Partners, Canada, the European
       Commission, the Netherlands, and Switzerland had undisbursed commitments.
       The Netherlands decided not to extend their support and exited the MDTF-2 at the
       MTR.

2.   Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

Quality at Entry: An informed-decision was made to keep the project broadly aligned to
the SSD at design. Since specifying details and the funding level for each component was
not possible at preparation stage, the project (as a Trust Fund) was designed by mutual
agreement between all parties involved to be flexible and available to respond to the
needs of activities as they would arise. Prioritization and strategic focus was expected to
be identified by MOF in the annual implementation plans (IPs) based on the proposals
submitted by beneficiary departments and agencies.

The SSD contained long lists of activities across seven areas to be implemented over the
four-year period. It was unlikely that all those activities would have the same strategic
importance, or even among priority actions, appropriate sequencing was to be the key to
success. Supporting the implementation under the SSD across its seven pillars would
require being selective within each of them and paying attention to the content of the
most important measures.

To help mitigate the risk of insufficient capacity of MOF to manage and implement PFM
reform, the design included a peripatetic Chief Technical Advisor or Program
Implementation Advisor to be hired on long-term contractual basis for support to MOF in
(i) ensuring that the program is implemented with a strategic vision; (ii) formulating
Implementation Plans (IPs); and (iii) developing Terms of Reference (TORs).

Soundness of background analysis: A series of AAA had been undertaken to provide
sound analytical underpinnings to the formulation of the Government-led PFM reform
program that the project would support. These included the joint IMF-World Bank study
of 1999 "Towards Fiscal Transparency"; the joint 2000 Government-donor Public
Expenditure Review; the 2001 Country Financial Accountability Assessment; the 2002
Country Procurement Assessment Report, the joint government-donor 2004 Public
Expenditure Review and Integrated Fiduciary Assessment (PER-IFA) and the 2007
Country Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA) which were being finalized during
the project preparation. The predecessor MDTF-1 had been effective in assisting the
Government in implementation of the recommended reforms in the 2004 PER-IFA, while
this project was expected to continue the support with extension to recommendations of
the 2007 CFAA.



                                            7
Lessons learned and reflected in the project design: The design of the MDTF2
incorporated lessons learned from the previous operation, the MDTF-1. These included
(i) a need to better link the support to strategic areas of Public Finance Management
Reform and avoid ad-hoc activities, (ii) a lack of adequate attention to institutional
capacity building in some areas due to relative short-term horizon by the design (18
months), and (iii) a lack of a single strategic document to guide planning and
implementation of the MDTF-1.

To address the above problems, several additional design features were introduced
in this project. First, contributing donors would commit their funding for a longer period
of time (four years). Second, the Government had prepared a Single Strategic Document
(SSD) laying down FPM strategies based on the PFM reform objectives contained in the
2006-2010 Socio-Economic Development Plan. The SSD was a framework of reform
strategies for the overall development of public finance sector. It comprised specific
reform activities of each public finance management area. It also set out expectations on
timeframe, resources and financial sources as well as requirements for technical
assistance. The annual implementation plan of project activities would be prepared based
on this SSD. Third, it was agreed that the SSD would be an open document in the sense
that it would allow for including new reforms to be identified through diagnostic studies
being and to be carried out in the future years such as the CFAA-2007. Fourth, it was also
agreed that preparation of annual implementation plan would address the capacity
building needs more actively and this should be a high priority criteria for screening
proposals submitted by beneficiary departments and agencies.

Alternatives considered and reasons for rejection: An alternative for donors to provide
funding through a Bank-executed trust fund was discussed but found not preferable. The
modality of a Recipient-executed trust fund would better meet the following requirements
from contributing donors:

      First, the support should be in line with the strengthened ownership of the
       government, provided that there was a stronger and more explicit linkage between
       funded activities and the strategic areas under PFMRI. The operationalization of
       the SSD had fulfilled this requirement.

      Second, the Project should be consistent with the Hanoi Core Statement on Aid
       Effectiveness (HCS, October 2005), the associated spirit of the PRSC
       arrangement, and the flexibility and transaction efficiencies demonstrated under
       MDTF-1. Trust Fund operations were inherently consistent with HCS, as
       Government had a stronger decree of self-control than under traditional projects,
       and efficiency gains were realized through the pooling of donor resources.

      Third, the Project should more explicitly address the capacity building issue.
Risks and Risk Mitigation Measures: The Project Appraisal Document (PAD) had
identified some risks; and mitigation measures as deemed appropriate at that time were




                                            8
taken during the preparation stage. Although in most areas the risks were identified as
moderate, these risks were managed appropriately as indicated in the PAD.

Adequacy of participatory processes: The project was prepared jointly by the MOF,
the contributing donors and the World Bank. The choice of the instrument (Government-
executed trust fund), the design, the governance structure and operating principles were
intensively discussed and agreed among all parties involved during preparation.

Adequacy of government commitment: There was strong ownership in the Vietnamese
Government of the PFM reform agenda that the project would support. The Government
had prepared a Single Strategic Document (SSD) laying down PFM strategies based on
the PFM reform objectives contained in the 2006-2010 Socio-Economic Development
Plan. Support to the implementation of reforms was coordinated through the
Government-led PFM partnership group which overarched the activities of government,
donors, meeting half yearly to discuss progress. PFM remained at the center of
Government’s Public Sector reform program. Other focus areas were organizational
restructuring, pay and employment reform and institutional development.

2.2 Implementation

PFM MDTF 2 became effective in September 2009. Two Implementation Plans (IP1 and
IP2) made up of a series of short-term technical assistance (TA) activities were agreed in
March 2010 and June 2011, respectively. A Mid-Term Review (MTR) of PFM MDTF 2
was conducted during August-September 2011. The MTR found that despite some good
progress, overall implementation had been difficult and slow due to lack of a sequenced
PFM strategy, the breadth of engagement, and operational inefficiencies resulted from
lengthy review and approval process.

The project was restructured on June 15, 2012 to: (i) revise the Project Development
Objective (PDO) and accompanying results framework to align these with agreed project
activities and government priorities; and (ii) extend the project by eighteen months to
enable completion of activities and progress towards PDO.

Following the MTR, the MOF took a number of steps to strengthen project management,
most notably through appointment of a senior MOF official as full-time Project
Coordinator and greater delegation of authority and implementation responsibility to
beneficiary Departments. Implementation picked up since the Mid-Term Review, then
continued to progress reasonably well during 2012 and earlier 2013, and accelerated
significantly during the last six months of the project life. By the closing date of the
project, all activities of IP1 and IP2 were completed and all payment obligations were
fully settled by the end of the disbursements date.

Factors affecting     implementation:     The    following    factors   affected   project
implementation:

(i)   MOF capacity to coordinate a complex TA program had not been sufficiently
      developed in time to manage such a large TA program such as the MDTF-2. The


                                            9
       PFM reform strategy outlined in SSD was complex in its dimensions and the
       relationships between different components of the strategy required coordinated
       implementation of a large number of activities.
(ii)   The process for preparing Implementation Plans was lengthy. This was in part
       related to the lack of strategic framework (due to the breadth of the Single Strategic
       Document and transition to the new 2010-2015 FDS). Delay in agreeing on the cost
       norms also made it difficult to prepare budget proposals in a timely manner.
       Furthermore, the CTA was not able to play the roles envisaged at the design to
       assist in prioritization.
(iii) There were lengthy MOF and Bank/DPs review and clearance processes at the
      initial stage of implementation. Due to a lack of clear criteria for screening
      proposals, substantial amount of time was spent on reaching consensus between
      MOF, WB and DPs on what proposed activities fall under PFM areas and hence
      qualify for MDTF-2 support. This problem was later corrected with the World
      Bank proposing a set of criterion for screening proposals. As a result, the review
      and processing the IP2 were smoother than the IP1.
(iv) Due to the time gap between MDTF-1 and MDTF-2, the PMU had to be set up
     anew and due to the changes in the local labor market, it took time to find qualified
     personnel to fill all PMU positions. For the first three years of project
     implementation, there was no dedicated project coordinator to assist the PMU
     Director who was not a full-time position either.

(v)    Lack of empowerment of beneficiary departments in managing their activities in
       the first half of project life (until after the Mid Term Review). The large areas of
       work mean that the PMU found it difficult to handle all logistic arrangements for
       the activities of the beneficiary departments and this was identified as one of the
       bottleneck in the earlier stage of the MDTF2 implementation.

(vi) Difficulty in finding suitable international consultants and local consultants (e.g.
     procurement for local consultant, and a number of other areas for international
     consultants).
(vii) Dual (government and World Bank) procurement procedures that the PMU had to
      comply with increased the workload of PMU whose capacity in procurement had
      not been sufficiently augmented (due to difficulty mentioned in bullet point 5
      above). In addition, sometimes there was no clear guidance from PMU regarding
      procurement procedures, which put excessive burden on beneficiary departments
      and thus caused delays in project implementation.

Donor Contributions: As this is a donor trust funded project, the table below summarizes
the contribution of each donor at the project’s closing. There were originally five donors
for this project. However, one donor ended their involvement in June 2012.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

M&E Design. Given the flexible nature of the project, the results framework at the
design stage provided only indicative outcomes and indicators, which were built on the
overall objectives of PFM reform in 2006-10 in related strategies, the Single Strategy
Document (SSD) and the Program Memorandum between the Government and
contributing donors (PM). The deliberate intention was to update the results framework
once specific projects and activities under PFM MDTF 2 were agreed. The PDO and
results framework were subsequently revised at the Mid-Term Review to reflect the
expected outputs and outcomes from agreed projects and activities. These projects and
activities were grouped into Implementation Plan 1 and 2 (IP1 and IP2). The revised
result framework and indicators were formulated taking into account latest developments


                                           11
in PFM performance measurement, including the PEFA framework. It attempted to link
what the project was supporting with standardized measures of improvement in PFM
system performance that they would contribute to. As in other public sector projects,
however, the actual impact in terms of outcomes can take a while to materialize. As such,
it would involve continued efforts that build on project activities. The project supported
activities would, therefore, only constitute the building blocks for moving toward
achieving these expected outcomes.
M&E Implementation. The PMU had developed the milestones of IP1 and IP2 to better
monitor implementation progress of each project activities. The monitoring and
evaluation tables that were regularly updated, and kept consistent with the project
procurement plans, had proved useful tools to help track project milestones. These data
were closely monitored and the actual figures were compared with the target values by
the Bank and MOF.
M&E Utilization. Appropriate data collected by MOF were evaluated and used for
decision making on certain activities. If any activity was no longer needed, it was either
revised or dropped. For example, when the Custom Single Window project could not
proceed due to limited time available within the remained timeline of the project, it was
dropped from the scope of the project. Funding earmarked for this activity was released
to finance newly identified priorities. In other case, thanks to close monitoring of budget
and actual expenditure, the PMU was able to identify savings and decided to use them for
extending the pilot of standardized state asset registration procedures to three more
provinces.
Overall reporting on project outputs and results had been limited until the later stage of
the project life. Things were substantially improved in the last year of project
implementation when the PMU started sharing local and international consultants’ reports
as well as newly issued laws and regulations that had benefited from the inputs provided
by the MDTF2. This proved to be very helpful for assessing the progress of the
consultants’ work and their quality, the extent to which the international experience and
practices were shared and considered for application in Vietnam context. The MOF also
made efforts to engage development partners in seminars/workshops to discuss and/or
disseminate critical MDTF2 outputs such as the PEFA assessment report and the draft
Medium Term Action Plan (MTAP) for implementation of the Financial Development
Strategy 2020.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

Fiduciary
The project complied with fiduciary covenants during implementation. Internal control
arrangements were in place, and financial management aspects were generally in
compliance with Bank procedures, although there were a couple of issues during the
earlier stage of project implementation. The quality of procurement management was
acceptable to the Bank, though some flexibility had been adopted taking into account the
nature of assignments under the project where the pool of qualified candidates is
relatively limited. For details see Section 5.2 (b).



                                            12
The PMU still needs to submit audited financial statements for the period from 1 January
2013 to 31 December 2013 plus the four month’s grace period (i.e. till 30 April 2014) to
the Bank as required by the Financial Covenants.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

(a) Sustaining Project’s achievements. Since all activities supported by the Project
were part of Government’s on-going PFM reform program, it is likely that the project
achievements will be sustained. The MOF departments confirmed to ICRR mission that
many follow-up actions did take place after the Project closure. For examples: Minister
of Finance has signed a decision (on February 17, 2014), approving the MTAP developed
with the support of the MDTF-2; implementation of TSA is progressing well with roll-
out completed in three out of four commercial banks; MOF has submitted to the Prime
Minister the centralized procurement mechanism; Department of Financial Information
and Statistics (DFIS) has prepared the ICT security strategy and road map to submit for
Minister’s approval, implementation of the revised Tax Administration Law is in full
swing, PEFA assessment results are being used as the basis for determining priorities of
reform and future TA needs.

(b) Follow on project. The Swiss State Secretariat for Economic Affairs (SECO) and
the World Bank (WB) are exploring the possible scope and arrangements for a Capacity
Building, Analytical and Advisory Assistance (AAA) Program to support the Ministry of
Finance (MOF) and if possible the National Assembly in its ongoing Public Financial
Management (PFM) reforms. The support is expected to focus on reform initiatives
aimed at improving the effectiveness and efficiency of PFM, public service delivery,
fiscal risks monitoring, and fiscal transparency and accountability. The strategic focus of
a possible future support will be guided by findings of the Public Expenditure and
Financial Accountability (PEFA) self-assessment completed with MDTF-2 support, and
the Government’s priorities. Specific supported areas will be identified based on potential
impacts, realistic tangible results and comparative advantages of funding agencies.

3.   Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

Rating: The objectives, design and implementation is highly relevant to the country
priority and Bank assistance strategy.



                                            13
The objectives, design and implementation of the project remain relevant to the country’s
current priorities and development agenda. The objectives of the project were to
strengthen Public Financial Management (PFM) system in Vietnam, which had been one
of the main priorities of the previous Country Partnership Strategy for the period 2007-
2011 and remain a priority for the current Country Partnership Strategy 2012-2016. There
are three key pillars that the CPS 2012-2016 identified as key areas of engagement with
the Government including competitiveness, sustainability, and opportunity. Addressing
weakness in public financial management falls in the competitiveness pillar and is
measured by ten result indicators. Some of which were achieved through the activities
supported by the MDTF2.

Given the unclear strategic prioritization in the SSD and FDS which are used to anchor
the development of IP1 and IP2 under the scope of MDTF2, the project from the design
stage allowed for flexibility for efficacy and efficiency of the targeted interventions. It is
important to note that MDTF 2 set objectives for PFM TA: It would help establish the
building blocks for important reforms but it was not designed to deliver large PFM
reforms from start to finish. The approach for design was relevant. Given how MDTF 2
was structured, it would not be possible to finance all elements of a particular PFM
reform measure. The support was mostly short-term technical input, rather than large,
long-term projects, which were designed to tackle one major reform from start to finish.
MDTF 2 was a flexible instrument that can provide much needed supplemental and
complementary support in targeted areas of the Government’s overall PFM strategy
2011-2020.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

There were two sets of PDOs – one was at design stage and the other at restructuring.
Until restructuring (June 2012), the MDTF implementation did not progress well.
Operational inefficiencies were duly accounted for in the MTR. The new PDO after
restructuring were decomposed into three components aimed at strengthening the
government institutional capacity for:

    increased coordination and transparency in public financial management;
    improved revenue mobilization; and
    effective and efficient public expenditure management.

These three components of the PDO were set to be achieved through various reform
activities and programs included in IP1 and IP2 (see details on outputs in Annex 2 and
analysis of achievement of intermediate PDO indicators in Section F of the Data Sheet).
The Bank also provided lending operation support to the Ministry of Finance through the
Public Finance Management Reform and Tax Administration Management projects. The
outputs and outcomes of these projects contributed to the achievement of the MDTF 2
PDO. In addition, the Bank also produced many analytical reports that were
complementary to the outcomes of the MDTF2.


                                             14
Strengthened capacity for increased coordination and transparency in PFM : The
successful completion of a number of programs contributed to enhancement of the MOF
capacity to coordinate across MOF departments and external public institutions at sector
and sub-national levels in assessing and benchmarking the PFM institutional
arrangements and processes (flagship completion of PEFA), enhance the credibility,
transparency, and accountability in planning and budgeting (programs targeted at
managing public debt as well as SOEs). The first self-assessed PEFA highlighted the
wide and substantive participation and leadership across MOF and other relevant
departments and was considered an important achievement. The publication of the PEFA
is a clear indication of government commitment to transparent assessment of PFM system
and practices. The development of the FDS 2011-2020 Action Program and preparation
of the Medium Term Action Plan 2014-2016 provided not only an important opportunity
to coordinate and prioritize reform efforts but also a projection of resource requirements,
both internal and external, for implementation as well as an assessment of
implementation risks. The engagement also helped DPs better understand the
government’s reform priorities and align their support to GOV reform plan.
Implementation of the public debt and SOE performance and financial reporting and
monitoring decrees developed with the TA provided by MDTF 2 would make important
contributions to increasing PFM transparency. In addition, the development and operation
of the Macro-Economic Database with public access aimed to facilitate wider
dissemination of a large number of macro- fiscal data for planning, budgeting and
citizens’ oversight.

Strengthened capacity for revenue management: MDTF2 directly supported the
strengthening of tax policies and legal foundation for revenue administration as to inform
the Government’s new reform strategy until 2020. The review of implementation of tax
policies provided critical inputs to numerous tax law revisions, some of which were
already adopted and other would be considered in the pipeline over the next two years.
The entire process to review all tax policies (including major taxes such as CIT, VAT,
excise, and trade taxes as well as politically difficult emerging taxes such as
environmental and property taxation) was built on consultative principle and involved a
wide range of stakeholders. The decision to reallocate funding from the Customs Single
Window to tax administration legal framework was made in 2013. The new project on
developing detailed guidelines for implementing the amended Tax Administration Law
helped adopt measures to: (i) simplify tax administration and reduce burden of
compliance in particular for SMEs; (ii) adopt modern practices of risk-based audits and
Advance Pricing Mechanisms to deal with transfer pricing issues; and (iii) improve the
efficiency and effectiveness of tax administration.

Strengthened capacity for effective and efficient expenditure management: Efficiency
and effectiveness of expenditure management was being attained under various program
and activities of MDTF 2. MDTF2 helped to address some of the central reform agenda
identified in the 2007 Country Financial Accountability Assessment, issues raised in the
PEFA assessment; and to support functional departments of MOF to implement specific
reforms set out in their sub-sector development strategies. MOF was making slow but



                                            15
steady progress toward aligning its accounting framework (for both the government and
the commercial sectors) with international standards. Through MDTF2 TA support, the
MOF officials gained solid understanding of the international standards (IPSAS) and to
identify gaps between those standards and Vietnam’s ones and the needs for revisions to
align with the international practices. Government bank accounts management was being
rationalized through TSA implementation which would enhance cash management and
contribute to more efficient budget planning and execution. Increased information with
improved accuracy and consistency on state assets had improved transparency and
accountability of government agencies in asset management, one of the cornerstones in
public investment management. The developed centralized procurement model, once
implemented, would promote more transparent and efficient use of public resources.

It has been recognized that MDTF 2 was not intended to deliver large PFM reforms from
start to finish but would contribute to strengthening capacity in the three outcome areas of
the PDO. With successful completion of all the IP1 and IP2 activities, the Project is
assessed to have fully achieved its deliverables. The support of MDTD2 has helped
introduce certain new international PFM good practices and induce new ways of thinking
on managing expenditures from the MOF perspective. On the other hand, because many
reforms initiated with the support of the MDTF2 are still at the early stage of their
implementation (e.g. IPSAS adoption, TSA implementation, centralized procurement,
ICT security policy, SOE finance disclosure regulations, revised tax legislations etc…)
they have not yet made fundamental changes on the ground due to very short time. Full
achievement of the PDO would, therefore, require more time and further efforts and
supports, in light of this, the PDO achievement is rated as Moderately Satisfactory.

3.3 Efficiency

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

The project as set out in the PDO at design and restructuring stage aimed to enhance
efficiency, effectiveness, transparency and accountability in PFM. A full-fledged
financial and cost benefit analysis (or cost effectiveness analysis) was not required for
this type of MDTF. The breath of its interventions, and its multi-dimensional scope
involving various stakeholders and implementing agencies made it impossible to gauge
specific fiscal and economic benefit flows.

By the end of the project, all the planned project activities as set out in both IP1 and IP2
had been completed within the budget. The procurement was conducted in full
compliance with the procedures stated in the Grant Agreement and in the agreed
Procurement Plan. Though there was no cost-overrun in project implementation, the
project suffered from operation inefficiencies resulting from a lengthy process of review
and approval of the project activities at the early stage of implementation. Furthermore,
as reported to the ICRR team, transaction costs incurred by the Bank were rather high.
The Bank task team, including senior management, spent a higher than usual amount of
time and resources on project implementation support for a project of the size of the
MDTF-2, especially to resolve the project bottlenecks in the earlier stage and to provide



                                            16
technical inputs for numerous TORs and technical proposals throughout project life. In
many respects, the Bank task team had performed some tasks which should have been
performed by the CTA. In addition, due to some rigid project administration procedures
of MOF, the Bank task team leader was even requested to clear many small details of
project implementation such as changes in the location of workshop, small changes of
budgets for agreed activities.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Given the ratings of (1) relevance of project objective, design, and
implementation relevance, (2) PDO achievement, and (3) efficiency are High,
Moderately Satisfactory, and Moderately Unsatisfactory respectively, the combined
rating of the overall outcome of MDTF2 is Moderately Satisfactory.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

Poverty impacts: None identified

Gender Aspect: None identified

Social development: The MDTF-2 assisted the Government to improve the budget
planning to align more public spending to meet the socio-economic development
objectives of the SEDP. The Trust Fund also contributed to increased transparency and
accountability in public finance management and thus, contributing to better provision of
public services.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

By design and over the course of implementation, the project financed technical
assistance and capacity building activities. After restructuring, ten departments of the
MOF became both the implementing agencies and beneficiaries of MDTF2.
Considerable learning and knowledge exchange were achieved through a mixture of TA,
diagnostic assessments, training, and study tours. International good practices have been
gained in critical areas of PFM, ranging from revenue mobilization, budgeting, and asset
management to general state accounting, information and communication technology, in
the setting whereby international experts and national consultants work side by side with
staff of the responsible departments to deliver the planned outputs. The complexity and
intensity of the MDTF-2 implementation also enhanced project management capacity of
the PMU and beneficiary departments and thus the quality of the MOF in coordinating
and managing donor-financed programs. Noteworthy was the MOF capacity to conduct
the first PEFA self-assessment, draft the MTAP, develop technically sophisticated PFM
legislations, and inform policies in the areas such as cash management, internal audit,
asset management, IT security, taxation, and procurement.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops
N/A

4.   Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: Moderate

There exist some major risks to the sustainability of the PDO attained under the MDTF2.
The success and sustainability of PFM reforms are dependent upon strategy, resources (in
terms of both institutional capacity and financial resources), and political will. The
MDTF2 (and the predecessor MDTF1) helped lay the ground for strengthening the
upstream legal framework and establishing roadmaps to continue the implementation of
reform activities. The World Bank and other development partners are strongly
committed to supporting the government’s PFM reforms. The Bank is working jointly
with other interested DPs to develop the new TA program. Capacity of various
departments – through the process of learning by doing during the implementation of
MDTF2 – has been significantly improved. As mentioned in section 2.5, the MOF is
following on a number of MDTF-2 identified actions to further deepen the PFM reforms.
However the overall public sector governance that would govern the direction and speed
of PFM reforms remained weak, coordination between MOF and other MDAs challenged
while internal and external oversight continued to be ineffective. The extent to which the
FDS and MTAP could be further prioritized, better sequenced over the long haul, and
effectively implemented would depend largely on sustained political commitment and
momentum as well as the sense of ownership and motivation at MOF, sector ministries
and provinces and implementing agencies at all levels. In addition, PFM is not isolated
from the dynamics of the world’s economy. This was evidenced in the most recent
global crisis when the MOF had to divert its attention from long-term strategic PFM
reform actions to immediate stimulus packages on the one hand and ad-hoc revenue
raising measures on the other. Given a number of challenges-- their likelihood and risk
magnitude-- may not be completely seen and properly evaluated at this stage, the risk to
development outcome is rated moderate.

5.   Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

The design was done in a highly participatory manner and consistent with ongoing then
efforts among donors to directly align their support with the mainstreaming government’s
strategies and plans. The design also adequately reflected lessons learned from the


                                           18
previous TF operation with additional design features introduced. In addition, major risk
factors and mitigations measures were considered and incorporated into the project
design. A number of alternatives were considered in arriving at the chosen design. The
project was consistent with the World Bank CPS and government priorities in the sector
at the time.

While it was well justifiable to move quickly to process the MDTF-2 to provide
continuous funding stream to support PFM reform following the closure of the MDTF-1,
in hind sight, it may have made sense to spend a bit more time to specify and agree on
some selected priority areas that the MDTF-2 could immediately support and also to
work out a clear set of criterion for selecting projects/proposals to be supported by the
MDTF-2. That could have saved some months in the initial implementation stage,
spending on prioritization across all seven areas of SSD. This would limit the scope of
the MDTF-2 to a reasonably manageable level.

(b) Quality of Supervision

Rating: Satisfactory

Since the beginning of MDTF2, the Bank had conducted full-team regular supervision
missions to assess the implementation progress and the fund’s fiduciary aspects. Four
supervision missions were conducted since the approval of the second implementation
plans in June 2011. The fiduciary reviews were also duly carried out on a regular basis.
The project implementation was however sluggish at the outset and by the time of the
MTR in August 2011, various TAs under IP1 and IP2 did not even start while the
clearance process was considered as lengthy. In this context, the MTR was conducted to
review implementation progress, assess overall performance at mid-term, and agree on
the ways forward to help achieve the MDTF2 PDO. The MTR findings and agreements
led to the critical decisions that included the program restructuring, strengthening
mechanism for policy dialogue between DPs, the Bank and MOF, simplification of the
MDTF2 results matrix, and measures to improve project management (particularly the
decision by the MOF to delegate the authority to implement project activities by
responsible departments).

The team has prepared and archived five ISRs since the inception of the project in June
2010, October 2011, March 2013, October 2013, and December 2013. According to the
last ISRs, it was projected that all the contract commitments would be fulfilled by the
closing date of December 31, 2013. By the time of the last ISR, about 98 percent of the
budget programmed under IP1 and IP2 were to be disbursed. The significant turnaround
of the project implementation was partly attributed to joint efforts by the Bank team and
the MOF counterparts. Following the MTR conclusions, the Bank enhanced quality of
implementation support and supervision with more frequent and effective communication
and engagement with the PMU and all responsible departments to provide technical
support on terms of references or project proposals. The Bank team worked closely with
the PMU to help screen and select projects to be financed under MDTF2 with more direct
links to the PFM priorities and supported the PMU to simplify the results framework and
monitoring indicators. The Bank field-based task team has mobilized technical expertise


                                           19
from Washington-based staff as well as from staff located in the Bank office within the
EAP region to support project implementation.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

Given the two ratings, Moderately Satisfactory for the Bank performance in ensuring
quality at entry and Satisfactory for quality of supervision, the rating for overall Bank
performance is rated Moderately Satisfactory.

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

As already mentioned, the MDTF2 implementation did not go smoothly with slow
implementation, delays in decision making, inadequate monitoring and weak reporting
until the MTR. The MOF leadership acknowledged the candid MTR assessments and
reiterated its strong commitment to ensure successful implementation. The management
of MOF closely supervised the MDTF2 implementation through quarterly Steering
Committee meetings, review and guidance of monthly project management monitoring
reports. The strong leadership and effective steering drove more effective collaboration
and coordination among MOF functional departments and strengthened project
management. The Government’s financial contribution was adequately provided and
substantial government staff time was invested into implementation of MDTF2.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

MDTF2 started at slow pace. The finalization of the first IP took longer than expected (4
months after the Bank offered its comments) and this reflected in large part the
coordination and procedural issues within the government. After the MTR, the PMU,
with support from the Bank task team, developed a detailed M&E framework. The
framework was particularly helpful for tracking progress against project milestones and
was a tool for strategic management by the Steering Committee. After delegating the
implementation of project-specific activities to functional departments, the PMU stepped
up its management role as a facilitator, advisor, and supervisor. With better
communication and frequent information exchange between the World Bank, the PMU,
and responsible departments, the pace of project implementation had picked up and the
quality of reporting was gradually improved with more timely and detailed information
on individual project activities.

Project Procurement: Though experienced delays in the first half of project
implementation period, the procurement activities in the second half of project timeline


                                           20
progressed generally well. This achievement was especially commendable given the
limited number of PMU staff and the heavy workload in coordinating different
beneficiary departments for different project components. The quality of procurement
management was acceptable to the Bank, though some flexibility had been adopted
taking into account the nature of assignments under the Project where the pool of
qualified candidates is relatively limited. Overall, the procurement performance of the
Project was rated Moderately Satisfactory.

Financial Management: The Project, throughout its life cycle, had adequate financial
management system in place that could provide, with reasonable assurance, accurate and
timely information that the Grant’s proceeds were being used for the intended purposes.
The budgeting, fund flows, financial management staffing, accounting and financial
reporting, internal control systems and external audit, and maintenance of supporting
documents at the Project’s implementing agency were generally adequate. There was also
a noticeable improvement in financial management performance of the Project, where
after experiencing moderately satisfactory financial management performance during the
first three years, this was restored to a satisfactory level during the last two years of the
project life.

Although financial management (FM) aspects were generally in compliance with Bank
procedures, there were a couple of issues during implementation of the project such as (i)
delays in expenditure verification; and (ii) delay in 2012 budget/implementation plan
preparation and approval. These aspects of FM, however, were improved in the last two
years of the project implementation.

Monitoring and Evaluation: The M&E was ineffective at the beginning of project
implementation. Systematic reporting on outputs and outcomes was limited until the
later years of the project implementation. After MTR, detailed M&E tables were
developed, regularly updated, and kept consistent with the project procurement plans.
PMU kept detailed records of project activities and was able to provide quick feedback
whenever requested.

The performance of the PMU and the implementing agencies significantly improved
during 2013, especially in the last six months and could have been rated Satisfactory.
However, project delay and slow progress during the first two years of implementation
leading to the 18 month extension gave the rating of overall implementing agencies
performance Moderately Satisfactory.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory.

With government performance rating of Satisfactory and IA performance of Moderately
Satisfactory, the overall borrower performance is rated Moderately Satisfactory.




                                             21
6.   Lessons Learned

 (i) Mid-term project adjustment to ensure achievement of PDO. For a complex,
     multidimensional project involving multiple implementing agencies like MDTF2,
     mid-term adjustments should not be regarded as weakness but necessity in project
     cycle management. MDTF2 was restructured after about two and haft years of slow
     implementation so as to fit it into the new reality and to keep it running at difficult
     times. The task team, from the design stage, already envisioned a flexible
     mechanism in adjusting the scope and result framework over the course of
     implementation. The restructuring helped sharpen the project’s focus and better
     articulated its role in the Government overall PFM reforms. Appropriate
     restructuring, as shown in this case of MDTF, attributed to accelerating the political
     momentum for reforms on the MOF side that in turn led to successful completion of
     the project by the end of 2013.

 (ii) Effective delegation of role, responsibility and accountability in
      implementation of specific project components. Given quite broad and ambitious
      project structure spanning across ten different departments of the MOF reporting to
      different vice ministers, limited resources and capacity of PMU (both in terms of
      staffing and a diverse set of required technical expertise), the decision to
      decentralize implementation authority to intended beneficiaries proved to be a good
      strategy to speed up implementation. This innovative approach to project
      management provided tangible incentives and accountability for the beneficiaries to
      deliver. It is worth noting, however, that the delegation by itself could not guarantee
      success. Rather, it had to be conducted in tandem with (1) appropriate institutional
      arrangement whereby the PMU retained its role as coordinator, facilitator, and
      supervisor; and (2) enhanced frequency and efficacy of communication among the
      Bank task team, PMU, and implementing agencies.

 (iii)Maintaining frequent, effective communication between the Bank, DPs and the
      government throughout the implementation phase. The complexity of resource
      pooling in MDTF with multiple intended beneficiaries dictates that the success of
      implementation be underpinned by effective communication among all concerned
      parties. Continued communication and consistent support by the Bank team and
      management were instrumental for MDTF2 to undergo effective and timely
      restructuring and to achieve its PDOs despite mounting challenges from the time of
      design through completion.

 (iv) Proactive and effective support by the World Bank task team. Facing
      operational challenges, the Bank team proactively provided direct assistance and
      guidance to the PMU and implementing agencies. The Bank support in various
      areas of operation, helping the clients to prioritize and screen their overextended list
      of proposals while there was an absence of clear general guidelines on MDTF 2
      prioritization. Support by the Bank task team management was instrumental to cut
      down the lengthy clearance processes and enhance the quality of procurement
      through direct TA to develop quality Terms of Reference and share the pool of



                                             22
     prospective international consultants. During the second half of 2013, given that the
     MDTF2 was entering its critical final stage of implementation, the Bank task team
     proactively demanded for MOF’s better monitoring to ensure the project’s timely
     completion and therefore had requested the PMU to provide frequent updates on
     progress. The Bank team also proactively organized multiple TAs in various forms
     of training, knowledge sharing and dissemination in complex PFM areas such as
     management and monitoring of SOE financial performance, state assets
     management, legal framework for internal audit, taxation, and procurement. These
     TAs were organized in parallel to MDTF2 and such parallel mechanism proved
     highly valuable for the overall achievement of the project outcome.

 (v) Trade-off between flexibility and strategic focus of the program. As discussed
     earlier in the report, the high degree of flexibility in the project original design,
     intended to allow the project to respond quickly to emerging needs of the PFM
     reform and adjust for changes, had caused delay in finalizing the project plan of
     activities in the initial phase. As a result, the coverage of the MDTF-2 activities in
     the IP1 was spreading into many different areas, including those that were outside
     the core PFM functions. For IP2, the activities were more prioritized and selective,
     thanks to the adoption of clear screening criteria and guidance provided by the CTA
     and the Bank team. For future TA operation, it would be desirable to define at the
     design stage a few selected key areas of strategic focus for support while keeping a
     small part of the program open to respond to newly identified priorities and adjust
     for changes in the pace of on-going reforms.

7.   Comments on Issues Raised by Grantee/Implementing Agencies/Donors

(a) Grantee/Implementing agencies

The PMU provided detailed comments on the draft ICR report (see Annex 7). Comments
concerned mainly two aspects of the draft ICRR: (i) the facts related to actual project
outputs under several intermediate indicators and (ii) the Bank’s assessment on factors
affecting implementation and the performance of the Borrower. The ICR team has
revised the ICRR to correct the actual outputs and their dates of delivery. With regard to
the assessed lack of the capacity of MOF to coordinate a large and complete TA project
such as the MDTF2, the PMU felt that the MOF had set up a separate Steering
Committee to be in charge of coordinating all TA activities funded by the MDTF2 and
this Committee had fulfilled its tasks. On the other hand, the PMU acknowledged that
lack of coordination of related stakeholders in reviewing and approving IPs, especially
IP2 was contributing to delayed implementation. There was disagreement with the draft
ICR report’s assessments on some minor points regarding M&E utilization, project
performance at MTR, and efficiency. Since these assessments were consistent with those
of the MTR and Implementation Support Missions, the ICR team decided to maintain its
assessments and would communicate its views to the PMU.

(b) Co-financiers/Donors




                                           23
The draft ICR report was shared with all co-financiers, comments and feedbacks obtained
from SECO and EC (detailed responses of SECO and EC can be found in Annex 8). The
Donors felt that the draft ICR report documented well the project evolution throughout
the project cycle, adequately presenting key moments, turn-around, and challenges of the
project implementation process. Donors suggested that more nuanced ratings might be
needed to provide assessment to various aspects of the project: relevance of objective,
design and implementation. Since the ICR has to follow the Bank guidelines on ICR
preparation methodology and ratings, the ICR team found it difficult to accommodate this
suggestion. The main thrust of Donors comments concerned the lessons that one should
draw on the design, project approach (to support building blocks versus implementing a
full reform cycle), strategic focus and administration modality adopted by the Donors,
WB and the Government for the MDTF2. The ICR team felt that most of the issues raised
were valid, and to a large extent, were discussed in various sections of the report.
Nevertheless, the ICR team has further strengthened to ICR report where appropriate to
address the comments, including adding a lesson learned on the trade-off between
flexibility (to accommodate emerging needs and adjust for changes) and strategic focus
of the program.

Annex 2. Outputs by Component

1. State Budget Expenditure Management Reform

    Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA) Review: MOF
     completed the Report on Pilot PEFA Assessment. Upon approval by the
     Government and MOF leaders, the report was publicly disseminated through a
     dissemination workshop held in Nha Trang City on 4-5/7/2013.
    State Accounting General (SAG): The State Treasury completed developing the
     model, roadmap and solutions to implement SGA function
    Government Cash Management Reform: Under IP1, MDTF2 supported the
     MOF to develop and promulgate the processes on inter-banking e-payment with
     SBV, and on bilateral e-payment with commercial banks; establish the
     infrastructure to ensure safety and security in payments of the State Treasury, which
     formed the foundation for the development and completion of the ST’s TSA
     system. On this basis, MOF issued its Circular on management of cash revenue and
     expenditure through ST system (Circular 164/2011/TT-BTC dated 17/11/2011).
     Under IP2, the MOF (ST) completed developing the cash flow forecast system and
     the cash fund control and risk management system. These outputs contributed to the
     development of the Circular guiding the cash flow forecast processes, as well as the
     Decree on cash fund management, including contents related to cash fund risk
     management. Draft Circular and Decree were developed, but their issuance would
     be contingent on and made after the adoption of Revised Budget Law.
    Public Sector Accounting Standards (PSASs): Completed development of the
     Implementation Roadmap for Application of PSASs in Vietnam. Accordingly, the
     development of standards is split into phases, and under each phase a number of
     standards will be issued. Specifically, it is planned that, during 2013-2015, Vietnam
     will update some 15 out of 32 PSASs; during 2016-2017, Vietnam will update 8
     PSASs; and in 2018 it will update the remaining 9 PSASs. At present MDTF2 has
     supported to draft 5/ 15 first PSAPs.
     In addition, under MDTF2, MOF has gained better understanding of the details of
     IPSAS, and analyzed the gap between the existing regulations of Vietnam and
     IPSAS. The differences require revision of the regulations and financial and
     accounting reporting formats.
     MOF has also clearly determined the objects or who will be to apply the PSASs.
     Accordingly, the administrative and public service delivery units will apply the
     accrual based accounting standards while the revenue-creating and spending units
     will for the first hand apply the cash based accounting standards and later on these
     entities will move to apply the accrual based accounting standards.
     On that basis, it has clearly identified who will be responsible to prepare and
     aggregate the Government reports. Also, the format of whole of Government
     reports, and a set of general reports for the whole nation have been determined to




                                           26
        improve the accuracy and integrity of financial reporting as well as to be aligned
        with international accounting standards.
       VAS (corporate): Updating of VAS was split into two stages, with 13 standards
        for each stage. The original objective of this sub-project was to review and update
        selected accounting standards. To date, 13/26 corporate accounting standards were
        reviewed, in which, 8 out of them have been submitted for the issuance by the
        MOF, and 5/13 are under the final review prior to submitting to the MOF for
        issuance

        application of APA in tax administration.

2.2      Customs Administration

MDTF2 intended to provide support for implementation of GDC’s Proposal on
Development of National Single Window; however, MOF’s leaders decided not to use
the funds from MDTF2 to implement this proposal but a domestic resource instead2.


2
  In August 2013, the Government/MOF implemented the first phase of “Pilot National Customs Single
Window Mechanism”: the pilot covered the relevant units under MoTI, MOF (GDC) and MOT.
Implementation of a second phase is planned to start from June 2014 to cover some other ministries,
including MoH, MARD, MONRE (this was originally approved for support by MDTF2) to realize the Pilot
NSW Roadmap under PM Decision 48/2011/QD-TTg of 31/8/2011 and Inter-agency Circular

3. Government Debt Management Reform

     MDTF2 helped to develop the Circular No.56/2011/TT-BTC dated 29/4/2011 to
      provide guidance on monitoring indicators for public and foreign debt.




                                             28
        Public Debt Bulletins thereafter have been issued twice a year to include
         information on domestic debt. The Debt Management and Financial Analysis
         System (DMFAS), which initially recorded only government external public and
         publicly guaranteed debt, was expanded to record domestic debt also.
        MDTF2 helped to finance an international conference on debt management. The
         conference provided inputs for the development of a Prime Ministerial Decision No
         958/QD-TTg dated 27/7/2012 regarding granting approval to the National Public
         and Foreign Debt Management Strategy 2011-2020 with Vision to 2030 in order to
         strengthen the institutional framework for debt management and establish
         prudential fiscal targets and thresholds for medium-term sustainability. The
         Decision sets out a long-term strategy (2011-2020) for public debt management,
         consolidating for the first time external, domestic, sub-national, off-budget, and
         SOE debt. It adopted following policies: (i) medium to long-term deficit targets
         and borrowing limits; (ii) changing the composition of the debt portfolio so as to
         increase the share of domestic debt; (iii) medium to long-term thresholds for public
         debt stock and debt servicing capability.

4. Financial Markets

Developed and adopted roadmap for the development of Vietnam’s bond markets to
2020: by end of 2012, the development of draft Bond Market Development Roadmap to
2020 was completed and subsequently MOF approved the Roadmap through its Decision
261/QD-BTC dated 01/2/2013. The roadmap focused first on the government bond
market, including method of primary issuance and secondary transactions, buy-back,
development of market service infrastructure, and development of institutional investor
system.
Under this component, MDTF2 also financed the Insurance Management and
Supervisory Department to implement its Proposal on “Subsidy/Support Policy from
State Budget toward Agricultural Insurance”. The proposal aimed at ensuring the
necessary conditions for the formation and development of the insurance market of this
kind, moving forward to developing a modern agriculture, implementing the program on
agricultural and rural industrialization and ensuring the livelihood of farmers. Outputs
included the following:
         Research report regarding other countries’ regulations on subsidy/support policies
          toward agricultural insurance ;
         Detailed rules and plan for pilot implementation of agricultural insurance in
          Vietnam during 2011-2013 ;
         Draft support policies from State budget for agricultural insurance, particularly
          the Government’s Decree on Support for Agricultural Insurance.
After implementing the Proposal, the MOF (DIMS) has developed a system of legal
documents providing guidelines for the implementation of the PM Decision 315/QĐ-TTg
regarding pilot implementation of agricultural insurance for 2011-2013. This serves as
the legal basis for the review of agricultural insurance pilot implementation nationwide
after its completion. This also helps to ensure that the agricultural insurance scheme in


                                              29
Vietnam be implemented with appropriate roadmap and effectively, and enhanced the
role of agricultural insurance. The implementation of support policy from state budget for
agricultural insurance is bringing about the effectiveness both in terms of insurance
management, and of ensuring agricultural production and rural development and
improvement of the people’s lives.

5. Public Asset Management Reform

Roadway transport infrastructural assets: MDTF2 supported development and
promulgation of PM’s Decree No. 10/2013/NĐ-CP dated 11/1/2013 regarding
management, utilization and exploitation of roadway transport infrastructural assets; it
also supported development and issuance of MOF’s Circular 178/2013/TT-BTC
regarding provision of detailed regulations and guidelines for implementation of a
number of articles of this Decree.

centralized purchase of public assets (including the relevant legal documents); and
recommended the contents and direction, and improved the legal framework on
centralized purchase of public assets.

6. Price Control Management Reform

MDTF2 financed the MOF (Price Management Department) to implement a number of
activities regarding improvement of the institutions and the system of legal documents
related to price management and capacity strengthening to cater for the transformation
process from a centralized planning to a state regulated market economy and the
international economic integration process. Specific outputs were, as follows:
    Evaluated the current situation and capacity of valuation in Vietnam;
    Developed the draft roadmap for development of price valuation system in
     Vietnam;
    Transferred some advanced valuation techniques and methods that are being
     applied in the region and suitable with the conditions of Vietnam;
    Developed a specialized document on valuation consisting of six themes covering
     basic and necessary contents for training and capacity strengthening of valuation.
     The document has been used as a standard training material nationwide for training
     as well as granting of valuator/appraiser certificate;
    Transferred some advanced valuation techniques and methods that are being
     applied in the region and suitable with the conditions of Vietnam (3 training courses



                                           30
     on valuation were held with the participation of officers in charge of price
     management at both central and local levels).
The support provided by MDTF2 had a positive impact on the establishment of
infrastructure for asset valuation in Vietnam in the context of the market economy, thus,
creating a foundation for the GoV to come up with strategies and action plans to
modernize and develop valuation capacities in Vietnam. In addition, it also helped the
team of MOF officials responsible for price management policy making to have access to
advanced valuation methods based on the market rules to meet the requirements on
reform of price management and valuation in Vietnam.

7. Corporate Finance Management

MDTF2 financed the MOF (CFD) to strengthen SOEs’ corporate finance management,
focusing on reforming and improving the institutions and policies, enhancing the
corporate finance management capacity for SOE sector, increasing the transparency of
SOE financial performance through disclosure of SOE financial information. Specific
outputs are, as follows:
    The criteria/indicators for oversight of SOE were developed and piloted at selected
     State-owned Economic Groups/General Corporations, namely: Vietnam Railway,
     State Capital Investment Corporation, and Vietnam National Chemical Group.
    Legal documents regarding oversight and management of corporate finance were
     issued, namely: Decree 61/2013/ND-CP regarding promulgation of regulation on
     financial supervision, financial performance evaluation and disclosure of financial
     information of the enterprises owned by the State and of the enterprises with State
     capital; Circular No. 158/2013/TT-BTC dated 13/11/2013 and Circular
     No.17/2013/TT-BTC dated 20/11/2013 of MOF to guide the implementation of
     Decree 61/2013/ND-CP dated 20/11/2013.
    Relevant recommendations, contents and lessons/experience drawn from the
     international best practices will be considered and incorporated in the draft Law on
     Management and Utilization of State Capital Invested in Enterprises, which is
     planned to be submitted to the NA in 2014.
MDTF2’s support has positively contributed to the successful implementation of the
finance sector’s overall action plan under which one of the task and solution related to
SOE corporate finance management is “to dramatically renovate the corporate finance
management mechanism in order to separate the state finance from the corporate finance,
ensuring the right regarding freedom of doing business, self-reliance and accountability
of the enterprises in accordance with the market mechanism”. In particular, MDTF2 has
supported the MOF to do research and improve the monitoring mechanism for 3
designated SOE groups including Vietnam Railway, State Capital Investment
Corporation, and Vietnam National Chemical Group in particular and for the SOEs in
general. During the implementation of the proposal, the international and national
consultants have transferred specific experience, knowledge and best practices to the
MOF (CFD) regarding policy making on how to manage the State capital, as well as to
analyze, monitor and evaluate SOE performance, recommending implementation


                                           31
solutions to facilitate SOE reform, improving efficiency of corporate governance,
strengthening internal supervision, making full use of available resources and creating
greater competition.

     across the country.
With the support of MDTF2, the MOF completed development of the legal framework
for monitoring of implementation of legislations in the financial sector, and improved the
legal basis, standardization, synchronization and consistency in monitoring and
evaluation of the law implementation in the PFM sector in particular and of the law
implementation in general. The outputs of this activity played an important role in
guiding and developing implementation plan of the related activities in the coming years.
At the same time, the capacity for the MOF staff has been enhanced in terms of the
experience, knowledge, method and approach shared by the international and national
consultants, thus contributing to improvement in the quality of monitoring and evaluation
of the law implementation in the future.

8.2. Implementation of FDS2011-2020

With the support of MDTF2, the MOF completed developing its Action Program for

        security.
The results of the proposal achieved its objective to improve the quality of finance sector
information safety and security, contributing to successful implementation of the IT
system in the finance sector, well catering for public finance management and public
administrative reform and modernization of the finance sector. Such results have a
positive impact, which creates standardization, synchronization and consistency in
managing and ensuring the finance sector information safety and security, as well as
plays an important role in the orientation and development of implementation plan of the
activities related to finance sector information safety and security. The outputs of this

information safety and security related works in the finance sector till 2020.

9. Project Implementation Support

The activities under this component were performed by the PMU, including coordination
of project implementation, planning, procurement and bidding, financial management,
project monitoring and evaluation, project extension, reporting, etc… They all have
contributed to the successful implementation of the MDTF2.
   Coordination of project tasks, from planning, implementation, monitoring and
    evaluation through reporting between Beneficiary Departments (BDs), PMU and WB
    has been increasingly strengthened and well implemented.
   Completed developing the implementation plans, including IP1, IP2, IP1 Procurement
    Plan, IP2 Procurement Plan, Annual Plan and Project Closing Plan.
   Based on the long list of proposals for support proposed by BDs and using the
    specific selection criteria, the MOF and WB/Donors have selected for implementation
    of 15 proposals under IP1 and another 14 proposals under IP2. In addition, during the
    course of project implementation, some additional activities (under IP2) were
    approved for implementation in order to increase the Project’s impact.
   Project procurement and contract management were fully complied with the required
    processes and procedures of both the GoV and those of the WB/Donors. During the
    project implementation lifetime, i.e. 2009-2013, PMU carried out 131 procurement/
    bidding packages, signed 129 contracts, with total value of 2,751,734 USD,
    monitored their execution and conducted final acceptance and liquidation of all
    signed contracts.


                                            34
   Financial management and accounting were fully complied with all processes and
    procedures of both the Government and the Donors. Procedures relating to
    disbursement, accounting, regular reporting of disbursement for both the Government
    and the Donors, and tax and auditing obligation were well implemented.
   Extension of project was done in a timely manner, thus providing sufficient time to
    effectively complete all project activities and contributing to the success of the
    project.
   The PMU carried out monitoring project implementation on a monthly and quarterly
    basis; updated the project implementation progress on a monthly basis (for 120
    activities under IP1 and 210 activities under IP2) and organized monthly review
    meetings to urge, remind and work out the solutions to address the difficulties faced
    by BDs. These were very important effort to help accelerating the implementation
    progress of project activities.
   Reports were prepared and sent to relevant parties on a quarterly, semi-annually and
    annually basis following the formats and within the deadline required by both the
    Government and the WB/Donors. In addition, MDTF2 PMU also prepared monthly
    progress reports and sent them to MOF’s leaders and PSC’s members to keep them
    updated about the project implementation and disbursement status and at the same
    time to seek timely guidance from them.

MOF Summary ICR

1.     Background

The Multi-donor Trust Fund for Support of the Public Finance Management
Modernization (MDTF) has two phases. Phase 1 was implemented in 2004 and
completed in 2007 (MDTF1). To follow up the achievements, maintain the success and
increase the sustainability made under MDTF1, a second phase of MDTF (referred to as
MDTF2 Project) has been established, which is co-financed by the governments of
Canada, Denmark, EC, Netherlands, Switzerland and Australia. MDTF2 was approved
by the Prime Minister on May 5, 2008, and the project implementation started in 2009
and was initially expected to close by June 30, 2012, but then was extended to December
31, 2013.
The overall objective of MDTF2 is to support Vietnam in strengthening its capacity to: (i)
increase coordination and transparency in PFM; (ii) improve revenue mobilization; and
(iii) effectively and efficiently manage public revenue and expenditure (according to the
amendment to the Financial Agreement of June 28, 2012).
Project scope is to provide technical assistance (consultancy service), organize
workshops, training and survey to enhance MOF capacity in (i) developing a financial
sector strategic plan; (ii) preparing and implementing PFM policies and processes
regarding prioritized areas in PFM.
In accordance with the initial Financial Agreement (TF094240) between WB and SBV on
June 2, 2009, the committed amount of grant for the project was USD 5,120,000. Later
on, at the Amended Financial Agreement of January 6, 2011, the grant committed was
increased to USD 7,188,320. However, due to global economic and financial crisis, the
Amended Financial Agreement of June 28, 2012, has provided a disbursement principle
that the Project can disburse more than the amount contributed by donors to WB (i.e.
USD 5,324,761) to implement the approved Implementation Plan 1 (IP1) and
Implementation Plan 1 (IP2) by December 31, 2013.

2.     Technical Assistance

Implementation of the project objectives: After four years of project implementation,
all the expected outputs specified in the Project Results Framework have been achieved
by MDTF2 Project. These important outputs contributed to the achievement of overall
development objectives that are “to strengthen capacity for increased coordination and
transparency in PFM; improved revenue mobilization; and effective and efficient
management of public revenue and expenditure”.
Intermediate Outcome 1: Increase coordination and transparency across the
national PFM system through a clear reform strategy, greater disclosure, improved
oversight capacity, more secure IT systems, and compliance with PFM legislation.



                                           38
Output 1.1: Complete the Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA)
Review: With the support of MDTF2, the MOF completed the PEFA Report. The report
has been approved by the Government and then made public through a dissemination
workshop of July 4-5, 2013 at Nha Trang. The output of this activity is considered as an
important achievement of the Project. Performance indicators in the PEFA Report have
informed the development of PFM reform activities and served as the baseline data for
the M&E system under the medium term action plan 2014- 2016 (MTAP 2014-16) of the
financial sector.
Output 1.2: Action Plan for implementation of FSDS (2011-2020) is approved by the
MOF and the M&E Framework of FDS is fully developed: The MOF has completed
developing its Action Plan for implementation of Financial Sector Development Strategy
(FSDS) 2011-20, accordingly, the action plan was approved by the Finance Minister on
January 30, 2013, through the Decision 224/QD-BTC approving the Action Plan for
implementation of FSDS 2011-20 in order to realize the objectives and
solutions/measures specified in the FSDS 2011-20.
The Medium-term Action Plan 2014-2016 (MTAP 2014-16) has been finalized and then
approved by the Finance Minister through his Decision 304/QD-BTC dated February 17,
2014. MTAP 2014-16 is designed to detail and elaborate objectives of the Action Plan by
identifying focal projects and tasks of the financial sector to better prioritize and
coordinate the reforms across the area for 2014-2016 period, with specific activities,
expected outputs, required implementation resources and potential risks that may arise
over the course of its implementation. MTAP 2014-16 also include a M&E Framework,
indicators and reporting format to monitor the performance of PFM reforms.
Output 1.3: Adopt regulations on information disclosure of public debts and
government guaranteed debts: With support of the project, the MOF developed and
issued Circular 56/2011/TT-BTC dated April 29, 2011, providing guidance on
monitoring indicators for public and foreign debt. The government, thereafter, planned to
expand the scope of its twice yearly Public Debt Bulletins to include information on
domestic debt. The Debt Management and Financial Analysis System (DMFAS), which
initially recorded only public debts and government guaranteed debts, was expanded to
domestic debts.
The MOF also prepared Decision 958/QD-TTg, which was promulgated by the Prime
Minister by July 27, 2012, approving the National Public and External Debt Strategy
2011-2020 with vision to 2030 to strengthen the institutional framework for debt
management and establish prudential fiscal targets and thresholds for medium term
sustainability.
Output 1.4: Develop and adopt indicators and monitoring system to oversight SOE’s
financial performance: Support from MDTF2 has either a direct or indirect impact on
the formulation of Decree 61/2013/ND-CP stipulating regulations on financial
supervision, financial performance evaluation and disclosure of financial information of
enterprises owned by the State and of enterprises having State capital; of Decree
71/2013/ND-CP stipulating regulations on State capital investment in enterprises and
financial management of enterprises with 100% state-owned charter capital; and
Circulars 153, 158, 171 and 173 providing guidelines for implementation.


                                           39
The Project also developed criteria/indicators and procedure used to evaluate financial
situation of SOEs and enterprises with State capital in selected areas of transportation,
industry and financial organization.
Results and experiences drawn from the overseas study tour funded by the Project will be
examined and incorporated into the draft Law on Management and Utilization of State
Capital Invested in Enterprises which is submitted to relevant committees of the National
Assembly in July or August 2014 and then to the National Assembly for adoption in
November 2014.
Output 1.5: Complete the assessment of IT security arrangements in MOF with action
plan for follow up implementation: The project has: (i) completed the report on technical
security review of TABMIS; (ii) conducted As-is assessment of information safety and
security in the financial sector; (iii) developed an implementation roadmap for
information safety and security to 2020 in the financial sector; (iv) proposed policies on
information safety and security of the financial sector; and (v) developd a FS Report for a
Project on information safety and security of the financial sector. The report will serve as
a a foundation for the Project implementation on information safety and security of the
financial sector in coming years.
Output 1.6: Pilot the evaluation of PFM legislation implementation in selected areas of
Vietnam. The Project has conducted a pilot evaluation of PFM legislation
implementation in four areas, namely: (i) State budget management; (ii) corporate
finance; (iii) tax administration; and (iv) social security. During the course of pilot
evaluation, MOF has developed method, criteria and processes to evaluate PFM
legislation implementation; these have been finalized and incorporated into the
“Regulation on PFM legislation implementation”. The Regulation has been approved by
the Finance Minister through his Decision 2247/QD-BTC dated September 6, 2013, and
become a legal basis for evaluating the implementation of PFM legislations across the
country.
Output 1.7: Adopt legal framework for the establishment of internal audit mechanism
in Vietnam. MDTF2 has helped to develop a draft Decree on Internal Audit. The Decree
was submitted to the National Assembly’s committee for review in 2011. However, the
issuance of the decree has been postponed because the Constitution and the Budget Law
would be revised at that time, and therefore, a number of legal documents, including the
decree on internal audit, would be issued at time after the promulgation of the
Constitution and the revised Budget Law.
Output 1.8: Develop database catering for fiscal analysis and forecast, development of
financial policies and financial strategy 2010-2020. MDTF2 has helped to develop a
macro-economic database based on the National Statistical Indicators System under the
PM Decision 43/2010/QD-TTg dated June 2, 2010. This database includes 10 groups of
macro-economic, financial and fiscal indicators; some 120 tables (2,400 indicators); 64
disaggregates (1,072 indicators); 4,150 import data files; 97 import samples – which can
be looked up on monthly, quarterly or annually basis for data series from 2010-2012.

         fees and charges); and helped to draft the law on fees and charges which is
         planned to be submitted to the NA in 2015 (i.e. upgrade the Ordinance-level to
         the Law-level on fees and charges);
   10.   MOF developed a draft law on amendment and supplementation of the law on
         import and export duties which MOF planned to submit to the NA for adoption

update some standards. To date, under this sub-project, it has reviewed 13/26 corporate
accounting standards, in which 8 of them has been submitted to the MOF for issuance,
while 5 of them are are under the final review before submitting them to the MOF for
issuance.
Output 3.3: Develop model and implementation roadmap for State Accounting General
function. The State Treasury has completed developing the model, roadmap and
solutions to implement the SGA function.

development of dealer system and secondary market, investor based development and
diversification, and development of market service infrastructure.
Output 3.5: Develop modern cash and risk management system toward security and
effectiveness with improved coordination between cash and debt management . Under



                                            42
IP1, MDTF2 has helped the State Treasury in its development and issuance of the inter-
bank and bilateral payment processes, and developed the safety and security processes on
bilateral payments, thus helped to establish a Treasury Single Account (TSA). Based on
these, State Treasury has developed and then submitted for the issuance of the MOF the
Circular on management of cash revenue and expenditure through State Treasury system
(Circular 164/2011/TT-BTC dated November 17, 2011)
Under IP2, the State Treasury has completed developing the cash flow forecast system
and developing the cash fund control and risk management system. These outputs have
fed in the development of the Circular guiding the cash flow forecast process, as well as
the Decree on cash fund management, which includes the content regarding cash fund
risk management. The draft Circular and Decree have been completed but their issuance
will be made upon the revised Budget Law.
Output 3.6: Develope model for asset management system with reviewed business
processes and finalized gap analysis. With technical assistance provided by MDTF2,
MOF has selected an appropriate asset management model to implement asset
management in a proactive manner. MOF has assessed IT technology applications in
process management of current assets, reviewing data in the national database of State
Assets; assessing the gap and thereby deliver a legal and recovery process to consolidate
existing databases. On that basis, the consultants has helped build standardized process
data in the national database. The standardized business processes, on public asset
management, after being developed, have been piloted at the 2 ministries and 2 provinces
for the first time, and then at another 3 ministries and 43 provinces. The processes for
public asset data review and standardization was approved by MOF through the Decision
1505 issued by October 31, 2012.

3.          Disbursement Progress:

From the start of PFM MDTF2 till April 30, 2014 (i.e. end of grace period), total
disbursement made by MDTF2 amounted to USD 5,404,830 (equivalent to 96% of the
approved budget), in which:
           Grant fund:
                Total approved amount:        USD 5,355.885
                Actual disbursement:          USD 5,097,659 (accounting for 95%)
           Counterpart funds:
                Total amount set in PD:       USD 375,000

Total (including some estimated
additional expenditures by June            6,900,000,000            6,459,443,648         94%
30, 2014)
After four years of project implementation, MDTF2 disbursement rate reached 95% of
the approved grant, and 94% of the approved counterpart fund to implement IP1 and IP2.
This is quite a high rate of disbursement. Factors that contributed to the success were that
the stronger decentralization and empowerment to implementing units, the effective
management and coordination of the PMU, and close guidance of the Project Steering
Committee and MOF leaders – all of these have contributed to accelerate the project
implementation and disbursement progress.
The remaining 4% of project budget amount is established from some savings, and
cancellation of some activities at ending late period of the project implementation.
Disbursement against expenditure categories: according to the original Financing
Agreement (FA TF094240), the percentages of budget allocation for expenditure
categories are: (i) consultant services is 60%; (ii) training/workshop/survey/study tour is
36%; and (iii) incremental operating cost: 4%, and in the actual, the actual percentages
are 47%, 47% and 5%, respectively. So, the actual percentage of expenditure financed for
the consultant services is lower than that in the Financing Agreement and for the
training/workshop/survey/study tour is a little bit higher than the amount in Financing
Agreement. This adjustment is suitable with the objective, the implementation plan of
MDTF2, the support needs of implementing units and ensure the successful
implementation of the project.

4.          Project Management

The project management includes coordination of project implementation, planning,
procurement and bidding, financial management, project monitoring and evaluation,
project extension, reporting, etc. These all have contributed to the successful
implementation of the MDTF2.
o Coordination of project tasks, from planning, organizing for implementation,
     monitoring and evaluation through reporting between implementing units, PMU
     and WB have been increasingly strengthened and well implemented.
o IT has completed developing the project implementation plans, including First
     Implementation Plan (IP1), Second Implementation Plan (IP2), General
     Procurement Plan for IP1, General Procurement Plan for IP2, Annual Plan and
     Project Completion Plan.




                                            44
o Based on the long list of proposals for support proposed by implementing units and
     using the specific selection criteria, the MOF and WB/Donors have selected for
     implementation of 15 proposals under IP1 and another 14 proposals under IP2. In
     addition, during the course of project implementation, some additional activities
     (under IP2) were approved for implementation in order to increase the Project’s
     impact.
o Project procurement and contract management has been fully complied with the
     required processes and procedures of both the GoV and of the Donors. During the
     project implementation lifetime, i.e. 2009-2013, implementing units and PMU
     carried out 131 procurement/ bidding packages, and signed 129 contracts with
     total value of USD 2,751,734, monitored their execution and conducted final
     acceptance and liquidation of all signed contracts.
o Financial management and accounting has been fully complied with all required
     processes and procedures of both the Government and of the Donors. Procedures
     relating to disbursement, accounting, regular disbursement reporting have been
     done in accordance with the requirements of both the Government and of the
     Donors; and tax and auditing obligations have been well implemented and
     complied.
o The extension of project timeframe was done in a timely manner to provide adequate
     time for the implementing units to effectively complete all the project activities
     and thus contributed to the success of the project.
o The PMU carried out monitoring project implementation in a monthly and quarterly
     basis; updated the project implementation progress in a monthly basis (for 120
     activities under IP1 and 210 activities under IP2); and organized monthly review
     meetings to urge, remind and work out the solutions to address the difficulties
     faced by implementing units. This is also a very important effort to help
     accelerating the implementation progress of project activities.
o Reports are prepared and sent to relevant parties in a quarterly, bi-annually and
     annually basis using the formats and within the deadline required by both the
     Government and the Donors. In addition, MDTF2 also prepares monthly progress
     reports and submit the same to MOF leaders and Project Steering Committee
     members to keep them updated about the project implementation and
     disbursement status and at the same time to seek for timely guidance from them.
o Monthly meetings of PMU are organized, particularly in the second half of the project
    implementation, to review the project implementation and disbursement progress
    of the month, and to find ways to remove the obstacles faced during the project
    implementation. Project Steering Committee meetings are held twice a year, or
    when needed.

5.     Lessons Learnt

With regards to MDTF Model:
o The project is designed in the form of multi-donor trust fund so it has a high degree of
     flexibility to response to both the “long-term” and “short-term” needs of PFM


                                           45
       reform process and of a developing economy like Vietnam. This model has been
       also response quite well to the diversified reform needs under various sub-sectors
       of the financial sector.
o MDTF model has helped the MOF to strengthen its capacity and ownership capability
    to better be able to develop and implement by itself the reform and development
    programs/strategies in the future. Through the MDTF model, the institutional and
    implementation capacity of the MOF has been enhanced in both terms of quality
    and quantity.
With regards to project management and execution:
o Thanks to the right identification of objectives for project by the preparation of
     MDTF2, the design of project activities and their expected outputs have been in
     line with practical needs and aligned with MOF’s tasks assigned by the
     Government. In addition to that, there have been (i) due attention and guidance
     provided by the MOF leadership and of Project Steering Committee members to
     the project; (ii) the active participation of implementing units in project activities
     as well as due attention and guidance paid by the departmental leaders; and (iii)
     the assignment of civil servants and officers with adequate qualification and
     capacity to involve in project implement – all have contributed to the successful
     project implementation.
o Project’s annual implementation plans are developed based on consensus among the
     beneficiary departments, the donors and the PMU, so they are of high feasibility
     and flexible enough for any potential adaptation to the practical conditions and
     actual circumstances in timely manner.
o Implementation of sub-projects or proposals was done in a manner that ensured
     strong connection between hypothetical research (through international and
     national consultants) and surveys/studies (both in-country and overseas),
     especially consultation was done through seminars/workshops, exchange of multi-
     dimensional opinions by relevant experts - all together have also contributed to
     the project's success.
o Having implemented the MDTF1, the PMU has gained lots of experience in relation
     to project management, organization for implementing, monitoring and handling
     day-to-day operations, managing, urging and reminding implementing units in
     their implementation of project activities, working out promptly and effective
     solutions. Especially, by organizing and maintaining PMU’s monthly review
     meetings, it has been able to review the project implementation progress,
     reminding of and removing the constraints faced by the project, thus accelerated
     the project implementation progress and helped the Project in completing all the
     tasks and outputs within the project lifetime.
o Project management is carried out in a manner that based on the output/results where
     an M&E Framework is developed with specific indicators to measure the
     results/outputs and progress as well to identify potential risks so as to work out
     the solutions in a timely manner. The project has developed a system of scientific




                                            46
       and effective reporting and transparent communication among stakeholders and
       the MOF leaders.
o In addition, through organizing the annual meeting between WB/donors and MOF to
      review the project performance results, particularly the project implementation
      and disbursement progress, it has helped accommodating appropriate and timely
      adjustment decisions. With the inputs of the MTR and Project Completion
      Review mission, the project has been able to timely adjust the M&E Framework
      as well as obtained approval on project time extension to provide implementing
      units with adequate time to complete their sub-proposals at high quality.
o The recruited staffs working for the PMU Office have all meet all requirements in
     terms of experience, qualifications and skills to facilitate the project
     implementation.
o The new decentralization mechanism under which more devolution of authority and
     empowerment is given to the functional departments of the MOF in all steps of
     project implementation, from planning (formulation of proposals/sub-projects),
     implementation of the approved activities through reporting, while at the same
     time, the PMU focus on project management, monitoring and evaluation,
     supervision and facilitation kinds of tasks – all has contributed significantly to
     accelerate the project implementation progress.
o A timely and effective coordination and collaboration mechanism between
    implementing units, PMU and WB to discuss and consult to resolve constraints
    arising over the course of project implementation has been put in place. The
    transparent and reliable communication mechanism established between PMU,
    implementing units and WB has facilitated the successful implementation of
    project activities.
o The arrangement of the project to which the part-time key project personnel of the
     PMU (particularly the Project Director, Project Coordinator and Chief
     Accountant) have allocated more of their time spending for the project work have
     contributed significantly to accelerated project implementation progress.
o Along with decentralization of project implementation to implementing units, the
     Project has trained their staff on mechanism and processes to manage and
     implement project activities under this decentralized mechanism. Specifically, the
     Project has, in collaboration with WB and the Department of Planning and
     Finance from MOF, carried out training courses on the project
     procurement/bidding processes, financial management, project management of
     WB and Government to equip implementing units with better understanding so as
     to ensure their compliance with requirements.

6.     Recommendations

       The project has completed all expected outputs under the Results Framework and
these important outputs have contributed to the achievement of project objectives. More
importantly, MDTF2 has started setting the initial building blocks for important PFM
reforms in Vietnam, with most of these are to develop FSDS 2011-2020, MTAP 2014-


                                          47
2016 and implementation roadmaps or models of inevitably long gestation, which would
require continued efforts beyond the lifetime of MDTF2. Hence, in order to ensure the
continuity and sustainability of the Project as well as to promote important PFM reforms
in Vietnam, a post-MDTF2 support is highly necessary and, hence, DPs/WB and MOF
should urgently proceed with the formulation of a new project.

Annex 8. Comments of Co-financiers and Other Partners/Stakeholders

Following are the comments on the draft report by SECO:

1. The draft well documents the project evolution throughout the cycle. It adequately
   presents key moments, turn-around, challenges of the project implementation process.
2. The rating of the relevance of objective, design and implementation is difficult to
   assess, because it mixes different things. While it is undisputed that the relevance of
   the objective is high, donors have repeatedly discussed with the WB difficulties
   rooted in the design of the MDTF and its implementation mechanism. Therefore it
   seems a more nuanced rating might be more appropriate.
3. We have the following comments regarding the assessment of the design:

   We miss an explanation of the problems in the beginning (i.e. it took over 1 year for
    the Swiss contribution to be officialised despite being the lead donor), which
    generated a perception among DP of difficulties in program administration, which
    should be noted in the report. We also note the typo made in page 5 concerning date
    of SECO funded agreement: The correct date counter-signed by WB vs. SECO was
    14 December 2009.

   The report points rightly to the fact that more time should have been given in the set-
    up phase. Project implementation modalities and issues which were hindering at the
    beginning (i.e. CTA issue, staffing of PMU, program management capacities at WB)
    could have been better anticipated. Early phase problem should be better accounted
    either in text or rating on design. We think this passage could be more elaborated.

   The Vietnamese counterpart gave the consistent feedback that the project approval
    process was too tiresome. As a consequence, some department chose not to seek
    funding support of MDTF2, even though they would have had a case; e.g. the Debt
    Management Department. This should be better reflected.

   We miss a clear justification of change of PDO, in particular because it entails a
    substantial downgrade on expectation, pointing to the fact that problems were
    encountered with absorption capacity. Absorption capacity in general has been
    overstated in the beginning and should be reflected in rating the project design. This
    is further evidence that originally four IP were expected, where it was only possible
    to have two.

   The report misses a reflection on whether the design was appropriate in the VN
    context. Among others, whether is it a binary option: on the one hand, the recipient
    executed mechanism is claimed to slow down the implementation process due to lack
    of absorbing capacity, on the other hand, it increases ownership.
4. The explanation on page 6 (project financing) is misleading. It should be clearly
   stated that because of low absorption capacity and slow progress, donors were not



                                            53
    able to disburse all funds, originally committed. By 2012 it became clear that the 5.8
    million USD, paid-in the TF were deemed sufficient to cover the costs of IP1/2 and
    Bank admin cost, still leaving some funds undisbursed (12.7%). It is important to note
    this, because this also points towards an overestimation of absorption capacity.
    Further in the same paragraph, it should specify that NL exited the TF after the MTR.
    It seems DANIDA is omitted.
5. The report could have drawn up valuable lessons for any future TAs in VN in general
   and TAs in PFM in particular. To this end, the assessment leading to conclusion
   should be sharpened with further explanations, extrapolations on systemic issues,
   such as the approach of building-blocks (i.e. lack of follow-through), strategic focus,
   stakeholder involvement/ownership, leadership, in-house technical competence,
   recruitment of consultants, support modality, etc.
    It is interesting to see that the lessons learnt from MDTF1 (i.e. link to strategic area
    support and underlying strategic guiding document) have not been properly accounted
    for in MDTF2. While at the beginning, the perception of the SD as a big step, donors
    still keep the flexibility of the support provided under MDTF 2 (the report also notes
    so on several occasion); and accept that strategic underpinning was not sequenced nor
    weak. The report should better discuss this issue and the implication for any
    upcoming support. In this spirit, we miss the following lessons learnt, which are
    pertinent for future support vehicle.

   Project approach, i.e. building block: On the one hand, the VN administration is
    known to be weak at implementation of legal framework due to the lack of capacity;
    and weak enforcement. On the other hand, due to the lack of follow-through (equal to
    laying foundations for other projects funded by other sources), MDTF PFM is
    primarily focusing on short-term TA inputs for producing several regulations, studies,
    etc. rather than supporting the implementation of targeted policies. In another word,
    the MDTF PFM does not address the weak chain. To this end, it is unclear of the
    effectiveness of the support to yield the expected results, namely: increased
    coordination a transparency in PFM; improved revenue mobilization; and effective
    and efficient public expenditure management.

   Strategic focus through a good quality of the Financial Sector Development
    Strategy/Action Plan/MTAP: Strategic focus and proper sequencing have been off-set
    by the equalisation of the resource allocation (i.e. any departments of MOF has
    benefited from the program) by using the single document as an excuse. As a
    consequence, MDTF PFM entails ad-hoc activities that lack follow through for a
    tangible result. The strategic focus should have been achieved by the guidance of an
    international Chief Technical Advisor who has rich experience in PFM reforms in a
    transitional economy being transformed to the market based economy.
    It is important to have the foundation of MTAP documented. Why does MTAP come
    to the fore despite the available action plan of the financial sector strategy? What are
    the lessons learnt in this regard? Is it advisable that donors convince MOF to accept




                                            54
    external TAs for a good quality strategic document or donors should instead be
    pragmatic at selecting sensible topics for their funded TAs?

   Leadership: Individual leaders of the project are WB task team leader and CTA.
    Whether the performance of these leading positions is the success driver? The
    performance of these essential positions and their impacts on the overall project
    performance should be assessed. Why does MOF resist the long-term presence of
    CTA?

   Project focal point: The implementing coordination has been miss-located at a body
    (ICD) which is marginalised from the PFM reform.

   Recruitment of Consultants: The report rightly points out that the recruitment of
    qualified consultants is a big challenge. The causes should be identified. Whether it is
    hindered by the cost norm that is below the market rate; or it is MOF’s motive to hire
    their internal roasters (i.e. retired officials) for a routine mind-set rather than being
    challenged with new way of thinking?; or there has been a lack of back-up from WB
    and CTA who have richer pool of international consultants?
    In our view, TA of a reforming project can add best value through bringing in
    international expert who is knowledgeable and experienced in a similar PFM reform
    elsewhere, both failure and success. Therefore, MDTF PFM should have maximised
    the inputs of international consultants. In contrast, a national consultant, especially
    who has long-term engagement in the VN PFM system carries the downside effect
    that he/she reinforces traditional way of doing business in PFM.

   Inter-ministerial coordination and cohesion: the report touches upon 2 major topics
    that require inter-ministerial collaboration and coordination. They are internal audit
    (page v) and procurement (page 15). The earlier topic involves MOF and SAV while
    the later MOF and MPI. It is interesting to learn about the assessment of the project’s
    contribution to the improved inter-agency coordination through these 2 concrete
    activities.

   International good practice: The report commends the project to introduce several
    international good practices to change the local system such as IPSAS. It should also
    assess the consequences of significant divergences associated to the project activities.
    Amongst others, that MOF imposes on private accounting standard; and SAV is in-
    charge of regulating internal audit is deviated from international practice.


Comments by EC:


Detailed Ratings (pages i-ii, xi)

As there is no clear definition of the ratings, these come across as somewhat subjective in
the summary tables (although these definitions may well be evident to Bank insiders). At
times, the ratings seem to contradict the narrative in the latter parts of the document. A


                                             55
more nuanced assessment would have been preferable, particularly in line with the issues
identified later in the document.

Results Framework Analysis (page iii)

There is no clear narrative to explain why a significant restructuring of the results
framework was necessary. Like SECO, we believe that there is no clearly articulated
justification for the change to the PDO, and no mention is made of the downgrading of
expectations in light of the significant problems encountered.

Project financing (page 6)

The section on project financing does not accurately reflect the decisions taken with
regards to the outstanding funds. While EU (and others) indeed argued that the
disbursement of the remaining funds should be based on implementation performance,
the Bank also advised donors (particularly EU and SECO) not to disburse their remaining
commitments due to low MOF absorption capacity (contractually, the disbursement of
remaining EU funds was subject to the request for those funds by the Bank). In other
words, full disbursement was not reached due to slow implementation and weak
absorption capacity.

Project Design (pages 7-8)

The report fails to sufficiently reflect on the lessons learned from the design phase.
In particular, the report could acknowledge that better efforts should have been made to
anticipate problems (on the basis on MDTF-1 lessons learned) and develop appropriate
mitigating measures during the design phase. The failure to address some of these evident
problems (see for example, the comments of donors – dated April 2008) at the design
stage directly led to implementation problems at a later stage. For example,
      With regard to the SSD itself, no mention is made of any perceived weaknesses in
       the SSD during project design (although a number of issues were evident at the
       time if preparation). Yet in the subsequent sections, implementation is said to be
       have been slow due to weaknesses in the SSD (e.g. lack of sequencing).
      The need for a CTA focused on technical rather than logistical and defined roles
       and responsibilities for the PMU was repeatedly emphasised by all the
       participating donors. Donors identified the CTA as a significant "risk mitigation"
       measure.
      A clearer delineation of roles and responsibilities (WB and PMU) was another

Implementation (pages 9-11)

The document only refers to two implementation plans (IP1 and IP2). The original aim
was for annual IPs, yet no mention is made of this or indeed why there was a deviation
from the plan.

There is a positive spin on the rationale for revising the PDO, which plays down the
significance of major structural and operational issues which hampered overall progress
to this stage. Indeed, the ROM mission, undertaken in parallel to the MTR, found that
“actual results are likely to be scarce with limited impact on Vietnam’s PFM reform,
unless immediate corrective action is taken”. This was the rationale for the revision of the
PDO.
The findings of the MTR are only briefly covered in the narrative on implementation, and
do not accurately reflect the number of problems identified with the MDTF at the time of
the MTR. For example
      There is no reflection on the appropriateness of ICD to lead on the
       implementation of the project
      There is no reflection as to why the CTA was sidelined, and the impact on the
       strategic direction of the MDTF
      There is no reflection on the role (or lack thereof) of MOF leadership in the
       implementation of the project (and the role of the Steering Committee). The
       report later suggests (page 19) "strong leadership and effective steering"
      There is no reflection on the "bidding" (or cake sharing) approach that became
       apparent in the preparation of the IPs. The lack of selection criteria led to a great
       deal of frustration among the beneficiary departments who felt that their "valid"
       proposals were unnecessarily rejected
      There is no reflection on the inadequacy of the process for recruiting experts
       (international and local), or of the clear "preference" for local experts and the
       implications for the quality of the technical support. A more proactive approach to
       support beneficiaries (on the part of WB or PMU) to identify suitable experts was
       necessary
      Given the scope and breadth of the MDTF, there is no reflection as to whether the
       Bank allocated sufficient human resources to the management of the project.

Visibility

There is no reflection on the visibility impact of the MDTF, which was of particular
concern to the EU (and articulated on a number of occasions). The project website never
really materialised in time to be of use to the project in terms of visibility, donor
coordination or even consultant recruitment

Post completion / Next phase

Overall, we find the report weak on lessons learned for future PFM project design and
implementation, given the particular country/institutional context and the experience of
MDTF 1&2 (i.e. we are in full agreement with the comments previously made by SECO
on this point).
