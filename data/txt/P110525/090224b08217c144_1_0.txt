                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The MDTF2 is now reaching its closing date after more than four years of implementation. Project implementation has accelerated significantly during last six months and it is
                         projected that all confirmed project activities will be completed by the closing date. To date, all contracts have been awarded, of which the majority have been completed and a few
                         remaining will have the final reports submitted within December 2013. It is estimated that in total 98% of the programmed budget will be disbursed.

                         Good progress in implementing project activities suggests that the Project is progressing toward reasonably achieving the project development objective, which is: Strengthened
                         capacity for increased coordination and transparency in public financial management; improved revenue mobilization; and effective and efficient public expenditure management. It
                         has been emphasized that the objectives of the MDTF2 is not to deliver large PFM reforms from start to finish but it will contribute to strengthening capacity in the three project’s
                         outcome areas. Most of these are reforms of inevitably long gestation which would require continued efforts and supports beyond the life of MDTF2.

                         On strengthened capacity for increased coordination and transparency in PFM, completion of the PEFA assessment report with wide and substantive participation and leadership
                         across MOF and other relevant departments is an important achievement. The publication of the PEFA is a clear indication of government commitment to transparent assessment of
                         PFM system and practices. The development of the FDS 2011-2020 Action Program and preparation of the Medium Term Action Plan 2014-2016 provide an important opportunity to
                         coordinate and prioritize reform efforts. TA under MDTF2 has helped initiate important discussions within and beyond MOF on the sequencing and coordination of PFM reforms. The
                         engagement has also helped DPs to better understand the government's reform priorities and align their support to GOV reform plan, which should strengthen the effectiveness of the
                         development policy dialog, investment lending, and technical assistance programs. Implementation of the public debt and SOE performance and financial reporting and monitoring
                         decrees developed with TA provided by PFM MDTF 2 will make important contributions to increasing PFM transparency. The development and operation of the Macro-Economic
                         Database with public access will facilitate wider dissemination of a large number of macro-economic and fiscal data.

                         On strengthened capacity for revenue management, the review of implementation of tax policies provides critical input to numerous tax law revisions, some of which have already
                         been adopted and other are coming up in the next two years. The process has been consultative and involved a wide range of stakeholders, which is critical in an area like tax policy.
                         The new project on developing detailed guidelines for implementing the amended Tax Administration Law has helped adopt measures to: (i) simplify tax administration and reduce
                         burden of compliance in particular for SMEs; (ii) adopt modern practices of risk-based audits and Advance Pricing Mechanisms to deal with transfer pricing issues; and (iii) improve
                         the efficiency and effectiveness of tax administration.

                         On strengthened capacity for effective and efficient expenditure management, PFM MDTF 2 has helped address some of the central reform agenda identified in the 2007 Country
                         Financial Accountability Assessment, issues raised in the PEFA and support functional departments of MOF to implement specific reforms set out in their sub-sector development
                         strategies. MOF is making progress toward aligning its accounting framework (for both the government and the commercial sectors) with international standards through updating
                         private sector accounting standards to be consistent with revised IFRSs and developing IPSAS consistent public sector accounting standards. Government bank accounts
                         management is being rationalized through TSA implementation that has reduced substantially government idle cash accounts. This is facilitating better cash management and
                         contributing to more efficient budget execution. Increased information with improved accuracy and consistency on state assets has enhanced the transparency and accountability of
                         government agencies in asset management and helped making better informed decisions on investment in and purchase of new assets. The developed centralized procurement
                         model, once implemented, will promote more transparent procurement practices and result in more efficient use of public resources.
