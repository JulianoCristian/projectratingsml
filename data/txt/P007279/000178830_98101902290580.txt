PROVINCIAL TOWNS WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
Credit and ProJect Summary
Borrower:           Republic of Haiti
Beneficiary:        Service National d'Eau Potable - SNEP
Amount:             US$6.6 million equivalent
Terms:              Standard IDA Terms
Relending Terms:    Proceeds of the credit would be relent to SNEP for
30 years, including 3 years of grace, at 6 percent
per annum.
ProJect
Description:      Project objectives are improvements and extension
of the water supply systems of seven Haitian
provincial towns. The project will provide potable
water to about 155,300 people by 1981 and establish
adequate production capacity to serve 215,500
people by 1993. Major components of the project
are: (i) construction of 10,500 house connections
and 109 public standpipes, chlorination facilities,
storage tanks and 111.6 km of transmission lines
and distribution pipes, and (ii) 270 man/months of
technical assistance and consulting services.
Parallel to this project UNCDF has given a grant
of US$1.34 million for the construction of water
supply systems in three provincial towns with a
population of 54,400 people.
Prolect Risks:      SNEP, which will be entrusted with overall responsibility
for project execution, is a new and untried institution
which the project will aim to strengthen. Realization
of the expected benefits will depend heavily on Government
support of SNEP and on the capability and dedication of
its staff to the project objectives.

REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED DEVELOPMENT CREDIT TO THE REPUBLIC OF HAITI
FOR A PROVINCIAL TOWNS WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed devel-
opment credit to the Republic of Haiti for the equivalent of US$6.6 million on
standard IDA terms to help finance a provincial towns water supply project.
The proceeds of the Credit would be onlent to Service National d'Eau Potable
(SNEP) at an interest rate of 6 percent with a repayment period of 30 years,
including a grace period of three years.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        The most recent economic report on Haiti, Report No. 1243-HA entitled
"Current Economic Position and Prospects of Haiti" was distributed to the
Executive Directors on December 15, 1976. Social and economic data are pre-
sented in Annex I.
3.        Haiti is one of the poorest nations in the world, and one of two
countries in the Western Hemisphere included in the U.N. list of least devel-
oped nations. GNP per capita in 1976 stood at US$200. An infant mortality
rate of about 150 per thousand live births, an average life expectancy of 50
years, low nutrition and sanitation standards (malnutrition and gastroenteric
diseases account for over half the deaths in the country) and an adult illit-
eracy rate of about 80 percent characterize the depressed living standards of
the population.
4.        In marked contrast to the 1960-67 period when the economy stagnated,
Haiti enjoyed some growth in 1968-74. Expansion of small-scale manufacturing
and assembly operations, tourism and construction led to real average annual
increases of GDP of about 3.4 percent while population grew at an estimated
annual rate of 1.6 percent. These activities contributed noticeably to improv-
ing economic conditions in Port-au-Prince. Employment in assembly operations,
for example, increased from 10,000 in 1971 to 19,000 in 1974. Agriculture,
however, which constitutes the economic base of almost 80 percent of Haiti's
population and accounts for about 42 percent of GDP and 55 percent of merchan-
dise exports has, as yet, shown little dynamism. Progress in agriculture
will require the adoption of improved production techniques, provision of
greater incentives to farmers, as well as improvement of the transport infra-
structure.
5.        The economy's total output stagnated in 1975.   Agricultural output
declined mainly as a result of a severe drought which particularly affected
the northwestern part of the country. World recession brought about declines
in exports of mining products and manufactures as well as in industrial



-2-
investment. Construction activity also slowed down significantly. However,
mainly because of favorable bauxite and sugar prices, the country's terms of
trade improved, thus allowing a moderate real increase in the Gross Domestic
Income. In 1976, the economy recovered from the effects of the 1975 drought
and world recession. Production growth was led by mining, manufacturing and
construction, but agriculture also performed satisfactorily. Preliminary
estimates point to a real growth of GDP of nearly 5 percent. This development
was again accompanied by a substantial improvement of the terms of trade,
mainly owing to a sharp increase in world coffee prices. Consequently, growth
of Gross Domestic Income is estimated at about 10 percent.
6.        During the first 4-5 months of 1977, the country was again hit by
a very severe drought with strong negative impact on agricultural production
(mainly domestic food crops), on power generation and consequently also on
industrial production. These effects will be reflected by a deceleration of
GDP growth in 1977. A rough forecast points to an increase in real GDP of
about 2.5 percent. The shortfalls in agricultural production caused serious
supply shortages. The situation was relieved by food grants from multilateral
and bilateral emergency programs and by direct Government imports. At the
same time, the reduction in hydro-power generation led to the importation of
generators, both by the Government and the private sector. Since the drought
did not affect coffee production, increased earnings from coffee exports,
resulting from further increases in coffee prices, offset the foreign exchange
outflow caused by emergency imports.
7.        After several years of continuously decreasing net international
reserves, Haiti's balance of payments improved in 1976 and 1977, largely as a
result of higher coffee prices. In September 1975, the net reserves of the
banking system reached their lowest negative level of US$24 million. Since
then, they increased to reach a positive level of about US$15 million as of
May 1977 (which corresponds to one month's merchandise imports).
8.        In the past three years, the Government has adopted several measures
to encourage agricultural production. In 1973, the specific tax on coffee
which, by absorbing a large share of export proceeds, weakened producer incen-
tives when international prices were low, was replaced by a progressive ad
valorem levy. In 1974, a nationwide five-year coffee production program was
initiated with the support of USAID to provide small farmers with a package of
credit, technology and training. A substantial increase in the domestic
prices paid to farmers for sugarcane and to mills for sugar production was
approved. The export tax on sugar was lowered from its previous rate which
was as high as 80 percent at the margin. The tax on agricultural products
marketed domestically, levied each time a commodity changed hands, was elimi-
nated.
9.        The Government is carrying out an important investment program in
which infrastructure facilities, essential to the development of the directly
productive sectors, occupy a central place. Public investment increased by
about 68 percent in real terms during 1975 and again by some 35 percent in



-3-
1976. In the area of Port-au-Prince, projects are under way to expand and
improve port facilities and the water and power supply systems. Major roads
linking the northern and southern regions of the country were reconstructed,
and the network of agricultural feeder roads is being improved. The current
Five-Year Development Plan stresses regional development and it envisages the
expansion of health, sanitation and education services to the population in
rural areas and provincial towns. To meet even the most modest demand in
these areas, public sector development expenditures will have to increase from
about US$37 million per year in 1973-75 (or 5.1 percent of GDP) to about US$87
million per year in 1976-80 (or 7.2 percent of GDP) (all in current prices).
10.       The successful execution of such a program will require a substan-
tial increase in the flow of external assistance. In the early seventies,
when the level of public investment was still low, net external lending
accounted for only a fraction, less than one-tenth, of development expendi-
tures. Grants financed another 37% of development expenditures. The
share of external lending has grown to about 30 percent in 1975, with the
remaining 41 percent financed from foreign grants, 16 percent from net inter-
nal borrowing and 13 percent from savings. On the basis of disbursements of
loans already committed and of likely future annual commitment levels of
US$45-US$50 million from official lending agencies, it is expected that the
importance of foreign lending will increase and that it will finance about
40 percent of development expenditures in the 1976-80 period. Capital invest-
ment grants from bilateral agencies are expected to finance 5 percent of devel-
opment expenditures. Other official grants and private donations are expected
to continue to represent an important, albeit declining, share of development
expenditures (about 20 percent). The remaining 35 percent will have to be
financed internally, mainly through public sector savings.
11.       The Government recently took some specific measures to increase
revenues. Among these measures are the levy of an additional specific coffee
export tax, which is applicable at prices above US$1.00 per kg, adoption of
a new system of taxation of bauxite exports and the improved administration
of import duties. Furthermore, a new income tax law which became effective
October 1, 1977 increases the taxation of higher incomes, mainly received by
members of the liberal professions. In addition to these measures, a compre-
hensive tax reform is in preparation including action with the assistance of
the IMF to subject various extra-budgetary accounts to normal budgetary
procedures. Finally, the Government has allocated 50 percent of the profits
of the Regie du Tabac, an autonomous public sector monopoly, to a National
Investment Fund. The Government estimates that the Regie's contribution in
FY1977 will be of the order of US$4 million.
12.       The growth of public savings will, nevertheless, be constrained by
the need to increase substantially current budget expenditures in order to
upgrade the quality of public administration and to meet sharply rising
operating expenditures related to new development projects in agriculture,
education, health, road maintenance and other sectors. In view of the extreme
poverty of the country, its fragile balance of payments and the constraints to



- 4 -
raising additional fiscal resources -- taxes already represent about 11 percent
of GDP, no mean achievement for a country as poor as Haiti -- the successful
execution of the development plan will require external financing -- on con-
cessionary terms -- covering a high share of the cost of development projects.
In some sectors, financing of part of local costs would be necessary.
13.       A High Level Commission for the Implementation of External Assist-
ance to Haiti convenes twice a year to consider the country's economic
situation and expected technical and financial assistance. The Commission,
for which the organization of American States (OAS) provides Secretariat
Services (including background reports), is composed of senior government
officials and of representatives of the multilateral and bilateral aid agencies
active in Haiti. The Government has proved to be receptive to advice from the
Commission, which also serves to coordinate the efforts of participating
agencies.
14.       The country's balance of payments is very fragile, mainly because
of high and rapidly increasing food imports which account for more than 25
percent of total merchandise imports. Although export performance in 1976
and 1977 has been satisfactory as a result of a sharp increase in coffee
prices and rising earnings from manufactured exports and tourism, the deficit
on the balance of goods and services has remained substantial; in 1976 it
reached about 4 percent of GDP. This development reflects the country's
increasing dependence on food imports and substantial investment programs
(which, in the longer run, are likely to contribute to strengthen the economic
structure and the export base). The strengthening of the country's external
reserve position was made possible by improved coffee prices and by a large
inflow of grants and official loans.
15.       Since there has been relatively little net foreign borrowing other
than on highly concessionary terms, the debt service ratio is relatively low
(about 7 percent in 1976). Nevertheless, the balance of payments is
likely to constitute a severe constraint to economic development in view of
the limited growth prospects of Haiti's agricultural exports, and because
export diversification through the development of manufacturing and tourism
is still at an early stage. In view of the country's poverty and the depen-
dence of its balance of payments on world demand for a few commodities, Haiti
will continue to require external assistance on concessionary terms for a long
time if it is to achieve a significant improvement in the standard of living
of its population.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN HAITI
16.       The Bank Group has had seven operations in Haiti.    A US$2.6 million
Bank loan (141-HA) was made in 1956 for highway rehabilitation and a US$350,000
IDA credit (32-HA) was made in 1962 for highway maintenance. Two credits --
US$10 million (478-HA, Third Highway Project) in 1974 and US$20 million
(556-HA, Fourth Highway Project) in 1975 -- were made for reconstruction of
the Northern Road linking Port-au-Prince to Cap Haitien. In February 1976, a
credit of US$5.5 million was made for a First Education Project (618-HA); in



July 1976, a credit of US$16 million was made for a First Power Project (645-HA)
and in January 1977, a credit of US$10 million was made for a Rural Development
Project in Haiti's Northern Department (675-HA). The Third and Fourth Highway
Projects are making good progress, with disbursements ahead of appraisal
estimates. The Project Unit for the Education Project is functioning well,
although there were delays in preparing plans for school construction and in
obtaining technical assistance. The Power Project, after some delays, is pro-
ceeding substantially on schedule. The Rural Development Project became
effective on May 26, 1977 and is still at an early stage of execution. Annex
II contains a summary statement of the Bank loan and IDA credits as of
September 30, 1977, and notes on the execution of ongoing projects.
17.       USAID is financing a road maintenance program, the improvement of
feeder roads and the construction of secondary roads. IDB is financing con-
struction of the Southern Road, linking the capital to the southern part of
Haiti, and expansion of the Port-au-Prince harbour. France is financing con-
struction of a road linking Jacmel to the Southern Road and is providing
assistance to improve provincial airports. UDNP is financing the technical
assistance component of the Third Highway Project (with the Bank as Executing
Agency) including training of local contractors in administration, engineer-
ing and management as well as a study of Haiti's transportation sector. This
study has been completed. The Government organizes twice-yearly meetings to
coordinate assistance to the transport sector.
18.       IDB, Canada, France and IDA are cooperating closely with the Govern-
ment in projects aimed at meeting the most urgent needs of the education
sector. IDB has lent for rural education; Canada is supporting two technical
education projects in Port-au-Prince and France is providing technical assist-
ance to the National Pedagogic Institute and for training of technical and
vocational teachers.
19.       IDB has also made loans for agricultural and industrial credit and
for improvement of Port-au-Prince's water supply. It is providing assistance
to the Government for the preparation of integrated rural development projects
in the Cul-de-Sac and Artibonite Plains. USAID has given assistance for
Haiti's malaria eradication program, for community development, for a maternal
child health and family planning program, and for modernization of the produc-
tion and marketing of coffee. USAID is also providing assistance for inte-
grated agricultural development in two regions; this activity will be gradually
expanded to include other regions of Haiti and will also provide assistance
for control of soil erosion and for improvement of agricultural extension and
research. Canada (CIDA) is supporting a rural development project in the
southern peninsula and has undertaken a survey of Haiti's water resources for
both irrigation and power production potential. The Federal Republic of
Germany is providing financial and technical assistance for regional develop-
ment in the Gonaives Plain. France is providing experts to assist in the
implementation of the IDA-financed Rural Development Project, for which
experts from the Federal Republic of Germany are also expected.



-6-
20.       Prospective IDA operations take into account the ongoing and planned
roles of other official lending agencies. In line with the Government's Five-
Year Economic and Social Development Plan (1976-81) and with the priorities of
Haiti's perceived needs, current and planned IDA operations are meant to
support the improvement and expansion of basic infrastructure in transportation
and power; to expand educational opportunities and upgrade technical skills
and to promote regional development both in rural areas (as in the Rural
Development Project in the Northern Plain) and in provincial towns, as in the
water supply project now under consideration.

21.       The water supply project is consistent with the high priority which
the Government attaches to the improvement of health conditions and to the
revitalization of provincial towns. It would also strengthen the public
services responsible for providing water supply to the countryside and to all
towns other than the capital city.
22.       A Second Education Project proposed for IDA financing has been
appraised and is tentatively scheduled for consideration by the Executive
Directors in the spring of 1978. It would continue the programs for improve-
ment of rural primary education, curriculum reform and teacher training
initiated under the ongoing First Education Project.
23.       The recently appraised Fifth Transport Project takes into account
the recommendations of the sector study mentioned in paragraph 17, which
emphasizes the rehabilitation of secondary roads and the development of
coastal shipping.



-7 -
24.       The Bank is Executing Agency for a UNDP-financed power study which
is presently under way. The study estimates energy supply/demand balances
and recommends investment priorities, taking into account the possibility of
using Haiti's deposits of lignite as fuel for thermal plants as well as the
country's hydropower potential determined on the basis of the CIDA-financed
survey mentioned in paragraph 19. It is expected that a second power project
for IDA financing will be identified as a result of the study.
25.       The Bank Group's share in Haiti's public external debt outstanding
and disbursed amounted to 17 percent at the end of 1976. The Bank Group's
share of external public debt service in 1976 was about 0.3 percent. Its
share of outstanding public external debt would rise to about 29 percent by
1980, raising its share of external public debt service to about 6 percent.
PART III - THE SECTOR AND SUBSECTOR
Level and Quality of Service
26.       Water supply service levels in Haiti are the lowest in the Americas.
Only 10.2% of the total population have access to piped water: 40.6% in urban
areas 1/ and 3% in rural areas. Of the total population served only 39% have
house connections. Water service levels in the Port-au-Prince metropolitan
area, though far from adequate are the highest in the country with 45% of the
population served through house connections or public standpipes. The
situation in other urban areas is much worse with only 25% of the population
served by house connections or public standpipes.
27.       Quality of service is poor.   In urban areas, piped water is often
provided for no more than 2 to 4 hours a day. Water is not chlorinated.
In general, the water works are very old and in poor condition. Many of
the standpipes are not operative, and in cases where they do operate, sanitary
conditions are so poor that they frequently constitute health hazards.
28.       There are no sewage systems in the country.   However, Port-au-Prince
and Cap-Haitien, the two largest cities, are served by limited piped drainage
systems to which illegal connections have been made. These systems are
inadequate to meet the needs of the population. Many pipes are obstructed
and the low lying areas of these cities are flooded during heavy rains thereby
constituting a health hazard. Septic tanks and latrines are in common use in
urban and rural areas and are frequently a source of contamination of public
and private water sources due to lack of adequate control.

8-
Health Situation
29.       The health situation is precarious as indicated by a high infant
mortality rate (150 to 200 per 1,000), and low life expectancy (about 50
years). There are no meaningful statistics on waterborne or water related
diseases, but all indications are that their incidence on mortality rates is
high. A survey undertaken in 1975 indicated that waterborne diseases, diarrhea
and typhoid, represented 15% of the registered cases of diseases in the coun-
try. According to reports from hospital centers, 54% of reported deaths in
1973 were caused by gastroenteric diseases. However, since more than 90% of
total deaths are not reported, these statistics must be interpreted with
caution.
Institutional Framework
30.       The Centrale Autonome Metropolitaine d'Eau Potable (CAMEP) is in
charge of supplying water to the Port-au-Prince Metropolitan Area. CAMEP has
received two loans from IDB during the last decade for the rehabilitation and
expansion of its water supply system. In addition, IDB has provided assis-
tance to CAMEP in technical and financial matters.
31.       Until a recent reorganization (see para 36 below), the Services
Hydrauliques (SH) was responsible for the planning, execution and operation of
water works in all other urban communities. In 1975, there were 14 communities
with more than 5,000 inhabitants, in addition to the capital. Only 9 of these
communities have public water systems operated by SH. The other five communi-
ties have systems operated locally or are not serviced at all.
32.       The Cooperative pour l'Alimentation d'Eau Potable (COALEP) was respon-
sible for providing water to rural communities. COALEP was a cooperative
society under the authority of the National Council of Cooperatives. SH's
staff operated five out of six COALEP water systems, and one is operated by a
local community. Three other rural communities have water systems operated by
local bodies without COALEP's participation.
33.       SH and CAMEP have operated under the Ministry of Public Works,
Transportation and Communications, which also controls Electricite d'Haiti,
Telecommunications d'Haiti, and the Road Maintenance Authority. While CAMEP
is an autonomous agency with its own Board of Directors, SH was a Division of
the Ministry itself without any administrative or financial autonomy.
34.       There is no clear definition of the agency with overall respon-
sibilities for providing sanitary (i.e. sewerage) systems in both urban and
rural areas. The Ministry of Health has a Sanitation Division but the
Ministry of Public Works has authority in the sector as well. A clear defi-
nition of responsibilities within the sanitary sector is necessary so
effective programs can be developed and health hazards reduced. The Govern-
ment, with PAHO's assistance, is considering the necessary administrative
arrangements to deal with this problem.



- 9 -
35.       The Conseil National de Developpement et de Planification (CONADEP)
is responsible for preparation of national investment plans and coordinates
all sector planning. However, water and sewerage sector planning developed
by the individual institutions has been weak in practice and hampered by
lack of funds.
36.       The Government is conscious of the weakness of the present sector
organization, and especially of the need to strengthen the planning, finan-
cial and executing capabilities of the water supply sector. To this end,
the Government has enacted a law creating the Service National d'Eau Potable
(SNEP), which merges the functions of SH and COALEP. In addition, all
future investments in the water supply sector, with the exception of the
metropolitan area of Port-au-Prince, will be channeled through SNEP (Section
3.03 of the draft Credit Agreement). SNEP has the necessary autonomy in
financial, administrative and technical matters.
37.       It is the objective of the Government of Haiti to use the proposed
credit as a means to strengthen the water supply sector both financially and
institutionally. Repayments of the proceeds of the proposed credit (see
para 42 below), as well as other funds allocated to finance SNEP's investments
would be credited to a revolving fund in the National Bank of the Republic of
Haiti (BNRH) to be used to finance future high priority development projects
(Section 3.04 of the draft Credit Agreement).
PART IV - THE PROJECT
38.       The project includes improvements and expansions of the water supply
systems of Cap-Haitien, Gonaives, Jeremie, Port-de-Paix, Jacmel, Miragoane
and Aquin. The project is intended to eliminate the deficiencies of the exist-
ing systems and to extend service to a large segment of the population which
does not presently have access to adequate and safe water supplies. It would
also contribute to improve the institutional and operational capabilities of
SNEP, the sector agency, to develop long-range policies for the sector, and
to assess needs and define priorities for future programs. The project would:
(i) provide potable water to about 155,300 people by 1982 by rehabilitating
and expanding distribution systems, especially to low income areas; the
systems will have adequate capacity to serve 215,500 persons by 1993;
(ii) control water wastage by the use of flow-limiting devices in all house
connections and public standpipes; (iii) improve the efficiency of SNEP's
management and operations; and (iv) develop a long-range plan to improve
service levels in both the urban (except for the metropolitan area of
Port-au-Prince) and rural areas.
39.       The project includes the construction of 10,500 house connections
and 109 public standpipes, chlorination facilities, storage tanks and
installation of 111.6 km of transmission and distribution pipes. The physical
components of the project are designed to substantially improve the existing
system and permit phased expansion in capacity as demand increases. SNEP is



- 10 -
currently occupying inadequate rented facilities.   The project also provides
for the construction of a small headquarters office (500 m ) in Port-au-Prince,
storage and shop maintenance facilities and for the rehabilitation of local
offices.
40.       Parallel to this project UNCDF has made a grant of US$1.34 million
(with UNDP/OPE as executing agency) for the construction of water supply
systems in Saint Marc, Les Cayes and Leogane. Close coordination has been
agreed by UNCDF and IDA to ensure that the same design and construction
standards will be applied to the two projects and to improve SNEP's organization
and finances. The UNCDF project will provide safe water to a population of
about 54,400 people by 1982 and will have adequate capacity to meet demand to
1993.
Prolect Cost and Financing
41.       The estimated cost of the proposed project is US$8.0 million with
a foreign exchange component of US$6.6 million. A summary of project cost
estimates is given below:

42.       The proposed credit of US$6.6 million would finance the full foreign
exchange cost of the project: the Government would onlend the proceeds of
the proposed credit to SNEP under a Subsidiary Loan Agreement for 30 years,
including three years of grace, at 6 percent per annum. Signing of the
Subsidiary Loan Agreement between the Government and SNEP would be a condition
of effectiveness of the proposed credit (Sections 3.02(a) and 5.01(a) of the
draft Credit Agreement). The Government has also agreed to provide SNEP with
the local currency required for the project. These funds are estimated at
US$1.4 million equivalent and it is the Government's intention to make the
funds available to SNEP as a loan on the same terms as those used to onlend



the proceeds of the proposed credit. Debt service to the Association and the
foreign exchange risk would be borne by the Government. Moreover the Govern-
ment has agreed to cover SNEP's expected cash deficits through the construc-
tion period (Section 3.01 of the draft Credit Agreement).
Market and Production Aspects
43.       Waterworks are very old and in poor condition and water losses are
believed to be substantial due to lack of proper operation and maintenance.
Water production and consumption statistics are inadequate for lack of meters
at production sources and house connections. Production estimates have been
based on limited flow measurements or pump production based on electricity
consumption and pump characteristics. Average production ranges from a low
67 lpcd 1/ in Port-de-Paix to a hign of 235 lpcd in Gonaives. Because of
high water losses, intermittent service, low pressures in the distribution
systems and the limited number of houses with water-borne waste disposal
facilities, per capita consumption of water is low.
44.       Production forecasts have been based on comparable water use in
similar projects and take into consideration the proposed use of flow limiting
devices in all house connections and public standpipes (Section 2.09 of draft
Project Agreement). Per capita consumption in house connections is expected
to be low due to limited availability of plumbing and waste disposal facilities.
Average production figures have been based on an allocation of between 100 and
150 lpcd for house connections depending on each town's population and its
industrial and tourism potential and 30 lpcd for public standpipes. There are
no major industries in the project towns that will generate a heavy demand on
the water supply systems and tourism related demand is insignificant and is
not expected to increase significantly. Water production allowances will
satisfy basic human requirements for cooking and personal use. Demand during
the peak-period days is estimated at 130 percent of average daily flow.
45.       The number of house connections in all towns has decreased or
remained stationary as dissatisfied consumers have withdrawn from the systems
due to the poor service provided. This trend is expected to change once the
new systems enter in operation. The number of house connections and average
population served were estimated on the basis of a survey in each town. The
location and number of public standpipes were calculated by a similar survey
and their numbers were based upon average service densities of 400 to 600
persons per standpipe.
Project Execution
46.       The project will be carried out by SNEP, an autonomous government
agency under the Ministry of Public Works. SNEP's Board consists of a
chairman (Secretary of State for Public Works) and five members representing
the Banque National de la Republique d'Haiti (BNRH), Ministry of Agriculture,
1/ liter per capita per day.



- 12 -
Ministry of Finance and Ministry of Health. SNEP's general manager is a
member without voting rights. The General Manager is appointed by the
President of the Republic for a five-year (renewable) term. Board members
are appointed for a period of 4 years. SNEP has three major departments:
Operations and Maintenance; Projects; and Finance and Administration. A
Community Participation Unit, to be set up within the Department of Finance
and Administration (Section 2.08 of the draft Project Agreement) would seek
to promote community participation in future SNEP projects: it would encour-
age potential users to connect their homes to water supply systems and obtain
their participation in the construction and operation of new systems. To
ensure that SNEP's organization and top management will be adequate, major
changes in its organization structure and appointments to the posts of general
manager and department heads should be satisfactory to the Association (Section
3.04 of the draft Project Agreement). Moreover, within nine months of signing
of the proposed credit, SNEP would prepare by-laws for the regulation of its
operations (Section 3.06 of the draft Project Agreement). Appointment of the
three department heads would be a condition for effectiveness of the proposed
credit (Section 5.01(c) of the draft Credit Agreement).
Technical Assistance
47.       In order to develop and strengthen the institutional capacity of
SNEP, the project aims to develop sound procedures with respect to organiza-
tion, maintenance and operations, and design and construction standards. To
accomplish this target, SNEP should: firstly, appoint competent heads for
each of the three departments (para 46); secondly, appoint management and
engineering consultants to assist it with the design and implementation of
sound administrative, financial and engineering practices and train SNEP's
staff in these areas. To this end, the project includes a technical assistance
component. SNEP has asked that the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO)
coordinate this technical assistance and training program and PAHO has agreed.
Hiring of consultants to carry out the technical assistance program would be a
condition for effectiveness of the proposed credit (Section 5.01(b) of the
draft Credit Agreement).
48.       The technical assistance program would be carried out over a period
of 30 months and would mainly cover: (i) accounting, (ii) planning and
budgeting, (iii) internal control, (iv) organization structure and personnel
administration, (v) commercial procedures and practices, (vi) tariffs,
(vii) design and construction standards, (viii) maintenance, and (ix) community
participation. The estimated manpower for this assistance is 100 man-months
and the cost of these services, excluding contingencies, is US$0.4 million.
The cost per man/month is US$4,000. A detailed implementation schedule for
the technical assistance program, satisfactory to the Association, would be
proposed by SNEP prior to effectiveness of the proposed Credit (Section 5.01(d)
of the draft Credit Agreement).
49.       To assist in the execution of the project, SNEP would retain engi-
neering consultants for detailed engineering design, preparation of tender
documents, evaluation of tenders and supervision of construction. SNEP would
agree with the Association regarding terms of reference and qualification
of consultants (Section 2.02 of the draft Project Agreement).



- 13 -
Reporting
50.       SNEP would send quarterly reports to the Association on the progress
of project execution and on achieving the financial covenants and agreed
monitoring indicators. SNEP would take such required remedial action as the
Association may reasonably request (Section 2.06 of the draft Project Agreement).
Procurement and Disbursement
51.       All procurement will be made in accordance with the Bank Group
Procurement Guidelines. Contracts in excess of US$50,000 for civil works
or US$20,000 for purchase of equipment would be awarded on the basis of
international competitive bidding. Contracts of less than US$50,000 but over
US$10,000 for civil works, or of less than US$20,000 but over US$10,000 for
purchase of equipment would be awarded on the basis of local competitive
bidding, subject to the aggregate maximum of US$500,000. Contracts of less
than US$10,000 would be procured directly on the basis of a minimum of three
quotations and subject to an aggregate maximum of US$200,000. Bidding and
procurement procedures would be developed by SNEP with the assistance of
consultants. Evidence that SNEP has obtained clear title to the land for its
office building would be a condition for disbursement for office construction
expenditures (Schedule 1(4) of draft Credit Agreement).
52.       Foreign suppliers are expected to win all equipment and pipe supply
contracts and foreign contractors, probably in association with local firms
to win all major civil work contracts, although local firms are in a fair
position to be contractors and subcontractors on civil works. While none of
the required equipment and pipes for the project is manufactured in Haiti,
basic materials for civil works can be obtained locally. Practically all
required labor, with the exception of some specialized skills, is available
locally. Goods manufactured locally would, in those cases where interna-
tional competitive bidding is used, be allowed a preference of 15% or the
level of applicable import duty, whichever is lower, over foreign goods.
For civil work contracts, pre-qualified domestic contractors would be granted
a 7.5% preference over foreign contractors.
53.       The proceeds of the proposed credit would be disbursed over a three-
year period to cover: (i) the foreign exchange cost of all equipment and
materials for the water systems, maintenance equipment and for SNEP's office
building, (ii) 56% of total expenditures for civil work contracts for the
water systems and office building, (iii) 100% of total expenditures for the
cost of the technical assistance program, and (iv) 89% of total expenditures
for engineering consultants. The proposed credit would retroactively finance
up to US$200,000 of expenses incurred since October 1, 1977 for engineering
consultants and for the technical assistance program to SNEP.
Financial Aspects
54.       After an increase in 1959, water rates remained unchanged until
October 1977, when a new tariff was introduced.   The revenues of SH and COALEP



- 14 -
have never covered their operating costs and cash deficits have been covered
by government grants, which came to about US$80,000 a year during the last
three years. These operating deficits resulted from the small number of house
connections (people being reluctant to connect because of the poor quality of
service) and/or a limited ability to pay.
55.       Water tariffs are monthly flat rates and are the same for all towns.
There are no meters and consumers are classified by the diameter of the con-
nection and differentiated by type of service (residential, commercial and
industrial). Considering the delivery capacity of each tariff group (connec-
tion diameter), the tariff structure supplied water at a lower price per unit
volume to house connections with larger diameters. The October 1977 tariff
partially corrects the latter distortion and increases water charges--to a
weighted average tariff of Gourdes 18 per connection per month. The monitoring
indicators shown in Schedule 2 of the draft Project Agreement are designed to
maintain the average weighted tariff, in real terms, at a level equal to
Gourdes 18 per connection per month in 1977 prices. A tariff study would be
completed by December 31, 1978, with the following objectives: (i) to develop
a tariff structure based on long-term incremental costs and which discourages
excess consumption, charges consumers according to their ability to pay and
possibly takes into account cross subsidization between consumer groups;
(ii) to study a practical system to establish a charge for standpipe users;
(iii) to assess the advisability of installing water meters for large consumers
and to design and implement the necessary administrative procedures for doing
so. The resulting tariff and its implementation schedule would be agreed
upon with the Association (Section 3.07 of the draft Project Agreement).
56.       To help improve SNEP's financial performance a cash covenant would
require SNEP to establish tariffs--beginning in October 1980--that would cover
for each fiscal year: (i) all SNEP's operating and maintenance expenses;
(ii) the higher of either annual interest and debt repayment on all its loans
or the annual depreciation charge on revalued fixed assets (Section 4.03 of
the draft Project Agreement). It is estimated that a 20 percent tariff
increase in real terms over the October 1977 tariff, would be necessary in
1980 to meet the requirements of the cash covenant. The financial rate of
return on revalued assets would be negative during the construction period but
would increase to 1% in 1981 and to 2.3% in 1985. Thereafter, the financial
rate of return would depend, inter alia, on the feasibility of charging low-
income groups served by standpipes and on SNEP's ability to enlist community
participation in the construction and operation of new water systems. For the
first three years of the project the Government would provide the required
funds to cover SNEP's cash deficits; SNEP would not undertake new capital
investments in any one year during the construction period, in excess of
US$500,000, without prior consultation with the Association. Moreover, SNEP
would not undertake any borrowing, other than that required for the Project,
without the Association agreement if as a result its internal cash generation
(excluding debt service) were to cover maximum projected annual debt service
less than 1.4 times (Sections 4.04 and 4.05 of the draft Project Agreement).



- 15 -
Auditing
57.       To improve the reliability of the financial information and the
soundness of the accounting practices of SNEP, its financial statements would
be audited annually by independent auditors, acceptable to the Association.
Audited reports would be sent to the Association no later than four months
after the end of SNEP's fiscal year (Section 4.02 of the draft Project Agree-
ment).
Project Benefits
58.       The project will, through the rehabilitation and expansion of the
water system in seven provincial towns, benefit 155,300 inhabitants or 90% of
the population of those towns by the year 1982. In addition, it will improve
SNEP's technical, financial and managerial capabilities to allow it to expand
its activities in the near future. At present, the population served is
estimated at 40,100 inhabitants or 28% of the population of the seven towns.
Although no complete statistics on income distribution are available, it is
estimated that some 50% of the population of the project towns do not earn
enough income to have access to basic nutrition and sanitation. The project
would provide safe water to about 70,000 persons by the year 1982 through
public standpipes. This corresponds to about 80% of the population in the
service area, who are defined as being in the absolute poverty category. In
addition, some 85,000 inhabitants would have access to a reliable system of
water supply through house connections by 1982.
59.       At present, service is erratic and deficient and most of the popula-
tion is not connected. Correspondingly, there is no historic evidence of
"willingness to pay." Moreover, people to be served by public standpipes lack
both income and knowledge of water-related health benefits in order to be will-
ing to pay for safe water. Thus, project benefits relating to improvements in
health, to labor productivity and to overall living conditions are not meaning-
fully quantifiable. The incremental rate of return (IRR) of 8 percent has
been calculated as a proxy for the internal economic rate of return, based on
the new tariff which came into effect in mid-October 1977 and on an assumed
tariff increase of 20 percent, in real terms, in 1980. Sensitivity tests show
that the IRR is highly sensitive to a change in tariffs or to a change in
the number of house connections. If the 1980 tariff increase were not imple-
mented, (or if the number of connections were 20% less than forecast), the
IRR would decrease to 5 percent. A lower number of house connections than
forecast is unlikely since this is a conservative estimate based on a socio-
economic study undertaken in 1976. If operating costs were 15% higher than
those projected, the IRR would be 7 percent, which is still considered accept-
able, since health benefits were not quantified. Capital costs are not
likely to increase (in constant terms) in view of the relative simplicity of
construction works involved in the proposed project.
Project Risks
60.       The successful implementation of the proposed project carries higher
than average risks. SNEP, which will be entrusted with overall responsibility



- 16 -
for project execution, is a new and untried institution which the project
aims to strengthen. To counter the institutional risks, SNEP would be pro-
vided with substantial technical assistance to help train its staff and pursue
a carefully planned expansion and maintenance program in the water supply
sector. Assurances were obtained from the Government that adequate tariffs
would be adopted and that a subsidy would be provided during the construction
period of the project to place SNEP on a sound financial base. In the final
analysis, the success of the project will depend on the Government's continuing
support of SNEP and on the capability and dedication of SNEP's staff in imple-
menting the project.
Environmental Aspects
61.       The additional volume of waste water resulting from the project
and from the expansion of the water supply systems would not create a serious
environmental problem as most houses with connections have latrine or septic
tank facilities. The volume of water used by people served through public
standpipes would be modest. It would allow users to satisfy basic requirements
for cooking and personal needs and should not lead to any serious disposal
problem.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
62.       The draft Development Credit Agreement between Republic of Haiti
and the Association, the draft Project Agreement between the Association and
Service National d'Eau Potable, the Recommendation of the Committee provided
for in Article V, Section 1(d) of the Articles of Agreement and the text of a
draft resolution approving the proposed credit are being distributed to the
Executive Directors separately. Special conditions of the project are listed
in Section III of Annex III.
63.       Special'conditions of effectiveness would be:
(a) that the Subsidiary Loan Agreement between the Government
and SNEP has been signed.
(b) that SNEP has appointed competent senior personnel accep-
table to the Association to head its three principal
departments;
(c) that SNEP has appointed consultants and experts acceptable to
the Association, under terms and conditions satisfactory to
the Association.
(d) that SNEP has prepared a detailed implementation schedule
satisfactory to the Association, regarding the technical
assistance program.



- 17 -
64.       I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the
Articles of the Association.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
65.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
credit.

C.   PROJECTS IN EXECUTION 1/
Credit 478     Third Highway Project; US$10 Million Credit of June 6, 1974;
Effective Date: September 9, 1974;
and            Closing Date:   December 31, 1977.
Credit 556     Fourth Highway Project; US$20 Million Credit of June 11, 1975;
Effective Date: October 8, 1975;
Closing Date: December 31, 1978.
Both projects, which comprise reconstruction of the Northern
Road (250 km) linking Port-au-Prince to Cap Haitien, are near-
ing completion. Remaining works include: (i) putting up
traffic signs, (ii) a 125-m bridge across the Limbe river,
and (iii) additional minor improvements to be financed from
the balances of the two Credits. All works are expected to
be completed by the end of 1977, substantially ahead of
schedule in the case of Credit 556-HA.
Consultants retained under Credit 556-HA are helping to prepare
a coastal shipping ports component for a possible Fifth Trans-
portation Project.
Credit 618     First Education Project; US$5.5 Million Credit
of February 27, 1976;
Effective Date: May 20, 1976;
Closing Date: June 30, 1980
Physical works are about five months behind schedule because
of initial delays in appointing architects. At present, the
situation is satisfactory and contracts have been signed for
the construction of 18 rural primary schools under a first
phase of the construction program, and bids have been received
for the second phase of school construction. A new common
curriculum for teacher training has been prepared, equipment
lists have been completed and, after a year's delay, a con-
tract was signed with UNESCO regarding technical assistance
aspects of the project and the specialists have arrived in
Haiti.
1/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding the
progress of projects/investments in execution, and in particular to report
any problems which are being encountered, and the action being taken to
remedy them. They should be read in this sense, and with the understand-
ing that they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of strengths
and weaknesses in project execution.

Credit 645     First Power Project; US$16 Million Credit of July 2, 1976;
Effective Date: September 28, 1976; Closing Date:
September 30, 1978.
All the main contracts have been awarded. The major elements
of the project should be completed roughly within the original
schedule although the first two smaller units of the diesel
power plant have been delayed by nine months.
Credit 675     Rural Development Project; US$10 Million Credit
of January 14, 1977;
Effective Date: May 27, 1977;
Closing Date: December 31, 1981.
The Credit became effective on May 27, 1977 and is still at an
early stage of execution. The French-financed Deputy Project
Manager arrived on May 23 and the Agronomist and Credit
Specialist on June 15. The three German engineers financed
by the Federal Republic of Germany are expected to arrive
early in 1978. Sufficient Government funds for project
financing/prefinancing were made available after some delay.

UNDP, with assistance of Bank staff.
(c) First presentation to IDA: April 1976
(d) First IDA mission to consider the project: July 1976
(e) Departure of appraisal mission: May 23, 1977
(f) Completion of negotiations: November 2, 1977. The Government
was represented by the Secretary of State for Finance and Economic
Affairs and SNEP by the Secretary of State for Public Works and by
SNEP's General Manager.
(g) Planned date of effectiveness: March 1978
II. Special Bank Implementation Actions
None.
III. Special Conditions
The Government has enacted a law creating the Service National d'Eau
Potable (SNEP) as an autonomous agency. The Government and the executing
agency (SNEP) agreed to:
(a) Select experts for the technical assistance program. The
appointment of such experts and preparation by SNEP of a
satisfactory detailed implementation schedule would be a
condition of effectiveness (paragraphs 47, 48 and 63);
(b) Appoint consultants to prepare final designs and supervise
construction. Appointment of these consultants would be a
condition of effectiveness (paragraphs 49 and 63).

(c) Appoint competent personnel to head the departments of
(i) Operation and Maintenance, (ii) Project Design and
Construction, and (iii) Administration and Finance. The
appointment and qualifications of the senior personnel
should be acceptable to the Association and would be a
condition of effectiveness (paragraphs 46 and 63);
(d)  Signing of a Subsidiary Loan Agreement providing for the
onlending by the Government of the proceeds of the proposed
credit to SNEP for 30 years, including 3 years of grace, at
6 percent per annum (condition of effectiveness, paragraphs
42 and 63);
(e)  Channel to a revolving fund in the BNRH repayments of the
proceeds of the proposed credit. These repayments, together
with other funds allocated to investments by SNEP, would be
used to finance future high priority projects (paragraph 37);
(f) Carry out, by December 31, 1978, a detailed tariff study and
propose a tariff structure that will differentiate between
consumer groups and their ability to pay, and consider the
possibility of charging standpipe users. This tariff structure
and its implementation schedule should be acceptable to the
Association (paragraph 55);
(g) Adopt adequate tariff levels to comply with a financial covenant
that will allow SNEP to cover each fiscal year, starting on
October 1, 1980: (i) all its operating and maintenance costs
and working capital requirements and (ii) the higher of
either annual interest and debt repayment or the annual
depreciation charge on revalued fixed assets. During the
construction period of the project, the Government would
provide the required funds to cover SNEP's cash deficits.
SNEP would not undertake new capital investments in any one
year during project execution in excess of US$500,000 without
prior consultation with the Association; moreover, SNEP's
ability to incur debt would be subject to a debt-limitation
covenant (paragraphs 42 and 56);
(h) Prepare quarterly reports on the progress of the project and
monitoring indicators. Furnish such reports to the Association
and take such remedial action as the Association may reasonably
request (paragraph 50);
(i) Install water meters or flow limiting devices in all house
connections and standpipes in the project cities (paragraph 44);



ANNEX III

(j) Provide evidence that SNEP has been given clear title to the land
for its office building; provision of such evidence would be a
condition of disbursement for office construction expenditures
(paragraph 51);
(k) Create a Community Participation Unit in SNEP, not later than
January 1, 1979, to be in charge of promoting and organizing
community participation toward construction and operation of
new water supply systems (paragraph 46);
(1) Ensure that SNEP's financial statements will be audited annually
by independent auditors acceptable to the Association (paragraph 57);
(m)  Ensure that SNEP will have the exclusive responsibility for all
future investments in the water supply sector (other than those
in the Port-au-Prince metropolitan area) (paragraph 36);
(n) Prepare, within nine months of signing of the proposed credit,
by-laws for the regulation of SNEP's operations (paragraph 46).
