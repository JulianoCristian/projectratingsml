    extension of the water supply systems of seven Haitian\n            provincial towns. The project will provide potable water to\n            about 155,300 people by 1981 and establish adequate\n            production capacity to serve 215,500 people by 1993. Major\n            components of the project are: (i) construction of 10,500\n            house connections and 109 public standpipes, chlorination\n            facilities, storage tanks and 111.6 km of transmission lines\n            and distribution pipes, and (ii) 270 man/months of technical\n            assistance and consulting services. Parallel to this project\n            UNCDF has given a grant of US $1.34 million for the\n            construction of water supply systems in three provincial\n            towns with a population of 54,400 people."}, "docdt": "1977-11-30T00:00:00Z"}
