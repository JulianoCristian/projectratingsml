Project\n            will expand domestic investment in energy efficiency\n            projects, through the aggressive development of China's\n            nascent Energy Management Company (EMC) industry, thus\n            achieving large-scale energy efficiency improvements, and\n            associated reductions in the growth of carbon dioxide\n            emissions, and other pollutants. The project includes three\n            components: 1) the EMC service component consists of a large\n            capacity building, and technical assistance program to\n            assist EMC develop businesses, and help develop policy\n            support. The function of the EMC Service Group is to provide\n            service to emerging EMCs, in developing a training programs\n            for their establishment, corporate structuring and\n            identification of types of corporate partners, and in\n            overcoming operational problems. In addition, EMC will\n            advocate, and recommend policy support activities to the\n            Government, international institutions, and other groups to\n            foster industry growth; 2) the project management and\n            monitoring component, will support central coordination,\n            monitoring and reporting of project activities; and, 3) the\n            EMC loan guarantee program is designed to provide emerging\n            EMCs with enhanced opportunities to receive loans from\n            domestic banks, and to engage the banks in the development\n            of a sustainable EMC industry."}, "docdt": "2002-09-25T00:00:00Z"}
