environmental review sets the\n            framework to disseminate key screening criteria to the\n            energy management companies (EMCs) applying for support from\n            the project, to follow environmental guidelines when\n            discussing potential renovations. In its review, the EMCs\n            should assess the current environmental status of the\n            potential subproject, the original pollutant emission, and\n            estimated status of the subproject from the processes\n            concerned, the types of pollution, or negative environmental\n            impacts possibly caused by the subproject, and the types of\n            processes and product output of the subproject enterprise,\n            to then complete an environmental review checklist, for\n            subsequent subproject processing. Potential adverse impacts\n            identified will follow mitigation measures, where EMCs\n            assume legal responsibilities to ensure environmental\n            compliance. The project will not finance subprojects in\n            direct violation of environmental policies; specifically the\n            following will not be financed: asbestos manufacturing;\n            nuclear energy related products; manufacturing of\n            ozone-depleting substances, or persistent organic\n            pollutants; toxic wastes, insecticides, nor tobacco\n            production. Mitigation includes the following technical\n            measures: for industrial boilers: layer-by-layer coal\n            feeding devices, with pulverizing coal injections to form a\n            floating combustion, with appropriate arch shapes, or,\n            transform combustion boilers into CFB. Steam pipes: condense\n            water recovery, and avoid loss of steam trap leakage, but\n            include pipeline heat insulation. Motor driving systems:\n            adjust frequency conversion technology, and frequency\n            converter. Lighting and power distribution: upgrade\n            distribution voltage, shorten distance of power supply, and\n            upgrade transformers. Control systems: change manual-control\n            into automatic control, with attention to controlling\n            increased energy consumption, and nitrous oxide compounds.\n            Industrial kiln, and furnaces: use heat insulation of\n            furnace body, replacing small furnace and kiln with large,\n            more advanced technology. Combustion systems: use new energy\n            saving burner."}, "docdt": "2002-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
