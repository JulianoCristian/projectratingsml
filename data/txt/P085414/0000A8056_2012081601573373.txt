                         Implementation Status Overview
                         This ISR follows the second STATCAP project restructuring that was approved on June 29, 2012.

                         The restructuring follows the decision to extend the project as agreed with Government of Kenya during the recent supervision mission in June 2012.

                         This ISR is therefore more limited in scope given the very short period of time that has passed since the last ISR in the middle of June 2012.

                         The second STATCAP project restructuring includes:

                         A. An extension of the closing date from June 30, 2012 to September 30, 2012; and
                         B. A reallocation of SDR 1.1m from the spending category 'Consultants Services' to 'Training'. The overall project allocation remains SDR 14.1m.

                         The extension period will enable KNBS to complete the ongoing NASSEP V (the new master sample frame) field work and finalize the installation of the Enterprise Resources
                         Planning system in KNBS.

                         Notably, there has been progress on financial management since the last supervision mission in June. In preparation for the financial management clearance of the restructuring,
                         KNBS cleared the outstanding Kenya National Audit Office audit qualifications. These were the audit qualifications for the fiscal year FY10/11.

                         KNBS also produced work and procurement plans for the extension period of three months. The Bank reviewed them and found them to be in good condition.

                         See the previous ISR for more detail on the current state of implementation across the project components.
