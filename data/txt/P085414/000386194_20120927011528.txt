7a. Project Development Objectives/Outcomes
Original/Current Project Development Objectives/Outcomes
The original project development objective (PDO) has not been changed. It is to establish a sustainable
national statistical system to provide reliable, timely and accurate data in accordance with international
standards through: (a) strengthening the capacity of the relevant statistical agencies through training and
adoption of new information and communication technology; (b) carrying out legal and institutional
reforms that promote statistical data development; (c) establishing linkages among statistical data
producers; (d) promoting statistical information sharing among data users to strengthen the quality of
decision making; and (e) developing a data access and dissemination strategy in conformity with relevant
legislation and international good practice.

     DEVELOPMENT OF THE NATIONAL STATISTICAL SYSTEM PROJECT

                               RESTRUCTURINGPAPER

  A. SUMMARY

    1. Following the request of Ministry of Finance on May 22, 2012, the proposed
restructuring consists of (i) a reallocation of funds to increase the total amount in the
training category from SDR 4.3m to SDR 4.9m and (ii) a total cancellation of SDR
5,690,000 (USD 8.8m) from the total credit of SDR 14.1m (USD 20.5m).

    2. This is the third restructuring of the project. The first restructuring in December
2010 consisted of i) an extension of the closing date to June 30, 2012, ii) a reallocation
across spending categories, and iii) a shift to 100% financing. The second restructuring in
June 2012 consisted of i) an extension of the closing date to September 30, 2012 and ii) a
reallocation across spending categories.

    3. The total cumulative extension does not exceed two (2) years, and therefore does
not require RVP approval.

    4. The recently completed Implementation Support Mission in June 2012 concluded
that overall progress towards the project development objective (PDOs) has been
substantial and six out of seven indicators have reached their performance targets.

    5. In particular, there has been appreciable progress in data production, institutional
reform, capacity and infrastructure development, and in coordination of the national
statistical system. However, the project components on project management, particularly
financial management and procurement, and access to data and dissemination
hasperformed below expectations.

    6. The total projected disbursements for the project is SDR 8,410,000 (USD
12.94m). The final disbursement ratio by the end of the four month grace period is
projected to reach approximately 60% of the total IDA credit.

   7. The difference of approximately SDR 5,690,000 (USD 8,753,846) is therefore
cancelled.

   8. The cancellation is effective May 22, 2012 as requested by the Government of
Kenya.

    10. KNBS addressed the outstanding audit qualifications in June 2012, but the latest
Interim Financial Report is pending World Bank approval. The current financial
management rating is Moderately Unsatisfactory, while the financial management risk
rating is Substantial.

    11. Despite financial management and procurement challenges, disbursements have
improved over the last 12 months, and in total the project has disbursed USD 11.98m. In
addition, existing commitments will be settled during the extension period and the four
month grace period following project closure on September 30, 2102. The total expected
disbursements are expected to reach approximately 60% of the original IDA credit
amount of SDR 14.1m. The remaining balance of SDR 5,690,000 will be cancelled.


    12. While the majority of planned activities have been implemented with good
results, there appears to be overestimates of costs for several main activities, leading to a
balance of SDR 5,690,000 of the IDA credit unutilized. At the same time, the
Government of Kenya has clearly indicated where the funds can be better used within the
Bank’s country portfolio.
