The second restructuring in June 2012\n            consisted of i) an extension of the closing date to\n            September 30, 2012 and ii) a reallocation across spending\n            categories. The recently completed implementation support\n            mission in June 2012 concluded that overall progress towards\n            the project development objective (PDOs) has been\n            substantial and six out of seven indicators have reached\n            their performance targets."}, "docdt": "2012-09-17T00:00:00Z"}
