(b) carrying out legal and\n            institutional reforms that promote statistical data\n            development; (c) establishing linkages among statistical\n            data producers; (d) promoting statistical information\n            sharing among data users to strengthen the quality of\n            decision making; and (e) developing a data access and\n            dissemination strategy in conformity with relevant\n            legislation and international good practice. The\n            restructuring consists of (i) a reallocation of SDR 1.10m\n            (USD 1.6m) from the spending category consultant services\n            and audits to training and workshops, and (ii) an extension\n            of the closing date from June 30, 2012 to September 30,\n            2012, as requested by Government of Kenya in its letter\n            dated the June 22, 2012. This is the second extension of the\n            closing date after the project was restructured the first\n            time in December 2010. The total cumulative extension does\n            not exceed two years, and therefore does not require RVP\n            approval. The restructuring will facilitate completion of\n            two ongoing priority activities: 1) finalizing the ongoing\n            installation of the Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP)\n            system in Kenya National Bureau of Statistics (KNBS), which\n            includes automating all financial, administrative and HR\n            systems. The ERP is expected to improve some of the\n            weaknesses identified in the recent procurement and\n            financial management reviews; 2) completing the third phase\n            of the master sampling frame National Sample Survey and\n            Evaluation Program (NASSEP) in the arid and semi-arid parts\n            of Kenya. The NASSEP will form the basis for all national\n            household-based surveys in Kenya until the next census in\n            2019. The recently completed implementation support mission\n            concluded that overall progress towards the project\n            development objective (PDOs) has been substantial and six\n            out of seven indicators had reached their performance\n            targets. In particular, there has been appreciable progress\n            in data production, institutional reform, capacity and\n            infrastructure development, and in coordination of the\n            national statistical system. However, access to data and\n            dissemination had performed below expectations."}, "docdt": "2012-06-29T00:00:00Z"}
