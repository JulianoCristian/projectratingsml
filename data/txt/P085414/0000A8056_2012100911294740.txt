                         Implementation Status Overview
                         This ISR follows the third STATCAP project restructuring that was approved September 26, 2012.

                         The restructuring followed the request of May 22, 2012 from Government of Kenya to reallocate and cancel the remaining STATCAP project balance before its closure on September

                         30, 2012.

                         This ISR covers i) developments since the final supervision mission in June 2012 and ii) the content of the September 2012 restructuring. For the full assessment of the
                         implementation progress since the September 2011 supervision mission see ISR sequence number 9.

                         Progress in implementing the project since June 2012.

                         The main project progress since the supervision mission in June includes finalization of the Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system and undertaking the third phase of the new
                         master sampling frame (NASSEP V) based on the 2009 census. Both activities are expected to be fully implemented by end of September 2012.

                         There has been little progress in increasing the amount of available online information from KNBS, neither on the KNBS website, nor on the Kenya Open Data site. However, KNBS
                         recently released the Census shapefiles to partners, including the Commission for Revenue Allocation and the World Bank, and also signed up for Kenya data to be made public
                         through the World Bank’s Survey-Based Harmonized Indicator Program (SHIP) initiative. Initially survey data from the 2005/06 Kenya Integrated Household and Budget Survey and
                         the 1997 Welfare Monitoring Survey micro data will be uploaded and placed in the public domain, but additional datasets are expected to follow in the coming months.

                         STATCAP procurement challenges were never fully addressed and the current procurement rating of Unsatisfactory remains. However, there has been some progress in
                         implementing the approved procurement plan for the project extension, including undertaking training activities and procuring logistics for NASSEP V field work. The forthcoming post
                         procurement review will provide the full details.

                         There has been appreciable progress in addressing the outstanding FM issues, particularly reconciling the project cash books and the IFRs, although the identified issue is not fully
                         resolved yet. KNBS submitted updated IFRs and complementary cash books to the World Bank FM team and remaining issues are expected to be addressed by KNBS shortly after
                         project closure. The current rating of Moderately Unsatisfactory remains unchanged.

                         The September 2012 restructuring consisted of:

                         Following the request of Ministry of Finance on May 22, 2012, the September 2012 restructuring consists of (i) a reallocation of funds to increase the total amount in the training
                         category from SDR 4.3m to SDR 4.9m to avail sufficient funding for outstanding training activities and (ii) a total cancellation of SDR 5,690,000 (USD 8.8m equivalent) from the total
                         credit of SDR 14.1m (USD 20.5m equivalent). The cancellation was necessary as a number of planned activities could not be undertaken, including the next KIHBS II which was
                         delayed until after the next elections in 2013 and recurrent procurement challenges.

                         Key Decisions for Disclosure

                         As a consequence of continuing project management issues and the little progress in data dissemination via the KNBS website, the Implementation Progress rating is being adjusted
                         downwards from Moderately Satisfactory to Moderately Unsatisfactory.

                         The PDO rating remains Moderately Satisfactory.
