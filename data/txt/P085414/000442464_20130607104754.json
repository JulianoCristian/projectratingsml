unsatisfactory, risk to\n            development outcome was substantial, Bank performance was\n            moderately satisfactory, and Borrower performance was\n            moderately unsatisfactory. Some lessons learned included:\n            the Bank project team should have taken a harder line and\n            tried to overhaul the project at some point. This can have\n            included downgrading the project when product disbursement\n            was below projections, restructuring the project to have a\n            narrower focus, and refusing to provide a no objection to\n            extending the contracts of non-performing Transition Support\n            Unit (TSU) staff. The eight Project Development Objective\n            (PDO) indicators should have been overhauled at the time of\n            the first restructuring to more properly reflect the PDOs.\n            In future statistics projects, a close connection between\n            indicators and objectives should be insured at the time of\n            project design. Closer attention should be given to\n            measuring relevant results. This applies to both information\n            used to inform the PDO indicators and to information that\n            will enable the project team to better understand project\n            performance. Data that is collected with public funds should\n            be freely available to the public. A set of activities can\n            be identified in the project design phase, and the project\n            can focus on ensuring that those particular activities take\n            place. This less ambitious approach will have a greater\n            chance of achieving its objectives, and the Bank can be\n            confident that its funds are well-spent. Focusing the\n            lending instrument on results will closely tie the money to\n            what it is intended to the objectives, presumably increasing\n            the likelihood of success, and also reducing the burden of\n            supervision for the project team."}, "docdt": "2013-05-23T00:00:00Z"}
