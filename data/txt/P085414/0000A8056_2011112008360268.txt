                         Implementation Status Overview
                         A joint DFID/Bank supervision mission in September 2011 reviewed project performance since the last supervision mission in July 2010 and noted progress towards a number of the
                         five STATCAP development objectives. The mission also identified five critical areas where substantial progress is required if the overall development objectives are to be achieved
                         before the closing date of the project in June 2012.
