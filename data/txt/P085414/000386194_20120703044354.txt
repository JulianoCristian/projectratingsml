Original/Current Project Development Objectives/Outcomes
The original project development objective (PDO) has not been changed. It is to establish a sustainable
national statistical system to provide reliable, timely and accurate data in accordance with international
standards through: (a) strengthening the capacity of the relevant statistical agencies through training and
adoption of new information and communication technology; (b) carrying out legal and institutional
reforms that promote statistical data development; (c) establishing linkages among statistical data
producers; (d) promoting statistical information sharing among data users to strengthen the quality of
decision making; and (e) developing a data access and dissemination strategy in conformity with relevant
legislation and international good practice.

     DEVELOPMENT OF THE NATIONAL STATISTICAL SYSTEM PROJECT

                              RESTRUCTURING PAPER

  A. SUMMARY

    1. The proposed restructuring consists of (i) a reallocation of SDR 1.10m (USD
1.6m) from the spending category Consultant Services & Audits to Training and
Workshops, and (ii) an extension of the closing date from June 30, 2012 to September 30,
2012, as requested by Government of Kenya in its letter dated the June 22, 2012. This is
the second extension of the closing date after the project was restructured the first time in
December 2010. The total cumulative extension does not exceed two (2) years, and
therefore does not require RVP approval.

    2. The proposed restructuring will facilitate completion of two ongoing priority
activities:
      a. Finalizing the ongoing installation of the Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP)
           system in KNBS, which includes automating all financial, administrative and
           HR systems. The ERP is expected to improve some of the weaknesses identified
           in the recent procurement and financial management reviews.
      b. Completing the third phase of the master sampling frame (NASSEP V) in the
           arid and semi-arid parts of Kenya. The NASSEP will form the basis for all
           national household-based surveys in Kenya until the next Census in 2019.

    3. The current contracts of staff members of the project’s Transitional Support Unit
(TSU) will be extended on a sole-source basis in order for them to continue managing the
project during the extension period and settle outstanding commitments and close all
project books after the project’s closure.

    4. The recently completed Implementation Support Mission concluded that overall
progress towards the project development objective (PDOs) has been substantial and six
out of seven indicators had reached their performance targets. In particular, there has
been appreciable progress in data production, institutional reform, capacity and
infrastructure development, and in coordination of the national statistical system.
However, access to data and dissemination had performed below expectations.

    5. With respect to institutional reform, Kenya National Bureau of Statistics (KNBS)
has been transformed from a Government department, Central Bureau of Statistics
(CBS), to a semi-autonomous agency, KNBS, and the planned staff transition process,
from GoK to KNBS staff, has been completed. In terms of data production, the project
funded 13 out of the 15 surveys undertaken under the current Strategic Implementation
Plan (2008-2012), including a number of important economic surveys that have
significantly improved the compilation of the national accounts. The Government of
Kenya funded the majority of the 2009 Census costs, which generated comprehensive
results in one year. Impressive progress has also been registered across the national
statistical system (NSS), both with respect to administrative data production in ministries,
departments and agencies (MDAs), and coordination of data producers across sectors. In
MDAs, in general, there has been a marked increase in the quantity and quality of data

                                              6
produced, and support from the project has helped to reduce the production time in some
MDAs.

    6. Despite the progress in data production, there has been limited progress in user
access to the data and other statistical information produced by MDAs. The Censuses and
surveys undertaken by KNBS are traditionally launched in hard copy with only headline
statistics being made available in electronic format online. Access to anonymized micro
data is very limited and KNBS’ dissemination framework is largely viewed as
functioning poorly by data users. Indicators that are regularly updated on KNBS’ website
are limited to the monthly CPI, the quarterly GDP aggregates, and basic monthly
economic indicators, including as coffee and tea prices. Most of the economic and social
survey reports that have been completed over the last decades are not available online. In
addition, for a large period of the project, KenInfo, the national database for development
results, which is housed in KNBS, has either been inaccessible to users or key indicators
have been several years out of date. Although recently, the Mid-Term Priority indicators
were updated to the year 2010 – one year short of the latest 2011 indicators that have
been available since October 2011.

    7. The total projected disbursements for the project is SDR 9,285,365 (USD
13,500,000). The final disbursement ratio is projected to reach approximately 65% of the
total IDA credit. The difference of approximately SDR 4,814,634 (USD 7,000,000) is
likely to be cancelled.

   8. However, continuous challenges in financial management and procurement as
well as lack of progress on public data access resulted in an overall assessment of
Modestly Satisfactory for the project.



                                             7
   9. Despite these challenges, the Bank agreed to extend the project by three months
pending progress in the three areas below:

   a) The Bank required a formal request from Ministry of Finance to extend the
      project until the September 30, 2012.

   b) Completing a procurement plan for the three months extension period.

   c) Addressing the financial management issues of (i) clearing the outstanding audit
      qualifications with Kenya National Audit Office (KNAO) and (ii) settling the
      differences between the IFRs and cash book that were identified during the recent
      in-depth financial management review.

    10. Progress in all three areas has been significant: a) the letter from Ministry of
Finance requesting three months extension was received on June 26, b) the updated
procurement plan for the extension period was received on June 25, and c) the project
also presented the Bank with the clearance letters from KNAO on June 27.

   11. It was agreed with the Bank’s FM team that the reconciliation of the difference
between the cash books and the IFRs would require additional time. The exercise is
expected to be completed before the end of August 2012.

     12. The difference between the project cash book totals and the IFR totals originates
from the early years of the project, e.g. 2005-2007, when KNBS (then Central Bureau of
Statistics) was a department in Ministry of National Planning and Development (MNPD)
and did not have its own financial management or procurement units. During this period
all cash books were handled by MNPD and expenditures for CBS and MNPD were
manually entered in the same hand-written cash books. The substantial process of
separating the CBS and MNPD related expenditures recorded in the cash books has
begun and is expected to be completed before the end of August 2012.

    13. Therefore, the current extension has been approved by both procurement and
financial management.

# A constant conversion rate of 0.69 has been used to covert USD to SDR.


    15. The outlined reallocation entails allocating an amount of SDR 1.10m (USD 1.6m)
from the spending category Consultant Services & Audits to the spending category
Training and Workshops. The proposed reallocation is necessary to have sufficient funds
in the spending category Training & Workshops to (i) finalize the third phase of the
above-mentioned national sampling frame (NASSEP). This activity will include training
of field enumerators. The activities were foreseen in the original PAD, but delayed for
reasons including Census implementation, the post election violence, and recently
procurement issues.

    16. Substantial progress has been made in the project implementation since December
2010 when the project was extended for the first time, including towards the Project
Development Objectives. The recently completed Implementation Support Mission
concluded that six out of seven outcome indicators had reached their targets, including
with respect to progress towards adopting the international GDDS standards that Kenya
has signed up to. There has also been good progress towards strengthening data

                                           10
production across line ministries and towards completing the institutional reforms in
KNBS. However, there was insufficient progress towards making produced data publicly
available online, and previously identified financial management and procurement issues
have persisted and not been satisfactorily resolved.

   17. In addition, the financial sustainability of the project results is uncertain as the
Government of Kenya budget allocations for statistics remain insufficient to fund core
economic and social statistical work.

    18. Nevertheless, the team believes that a further project extension of three months
will enable KNBS to complete the Enterprise Resource Planning system, and the third
phase of NASSEP V.

    19. Therefore, the closing date for The Development of the National Statistical
System (STATCAP) Project, Project ID P085414, Credit No. 42760-KE will be extended
from June 30, 2012 until September 30, 2012, as requested by Government of Kenya in
the request for extension letter dated June 22, 2012. This will be the second extension of
the project.

     20. The proposed extension of the project closing date meets the requirements of OP
13.30, paragraph 3, on the Extension of the Closing Date. The requirements consist of:
(a) the project objectives continue to be achievable; (b) performance of the borrower and
other project implementing agencies is satisfactory; and (c) the borrower has prepared a
specific action plan acceptable to the Bank to complete the project.

   21. The Interim Financial Reports and audits have been approved. The financial
management rating is currently Moderately Unsatisfactory, while the financial
management risk rating is Substantial.

   22. Despite financial management and procurement challenges, disbursements have
improved over the last 12 months, and in total the project has disbursed USD 11.31m. In
addition, existing commitments will be settled during the extension period. The total
expected disbursements are expected to reach approximately 65% of the IDA credit
amount. The remaining balance is expected to be cancelled.

    23. In line with the new World Bank the project will continue to be 100% financing
of Project Cost Categories.
