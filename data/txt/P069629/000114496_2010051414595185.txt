A representation made by the Recipient in or pursuant to the Agreement, 
or any statement furnished in connection therewith, and intended to be relied upon by

withdrawals has been restored in whole or in part, as the case may be.
Section 1.16.  Cancellation by the Administrator
If (a) the right of the Recipient to make withdrawals from the Grant Account 
shall have been suspended with respect to any amount of the Grant for a continuous 
period of thirty (3) days, or (b) at any time, the Administrator determines, after
