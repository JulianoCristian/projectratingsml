In addition,\n            lenders cannot rely upon courts enabling the enforcement of\n            creditors rights and contracts within a reasonable period of\n            time, and at a reasonable cost. 2) In post-conflict\n            situations, project performance indicators for emergency\n            FILs should be designed to measure the impact of the\n            emergency financing in restarting economic activity rather\n            than the volume of loan disbursement. The lack of\n            appropriate performance indicators causes problems during\n            supervision because it prevents a proper monitoring and\n            evaluation of achievement of project development objectives.\n            3) Effective risk mitigation measures are generally not\n            available in the emergency of a post-conflict situation.\n            They become available during project implementation to the\n            extent that the authorities are strongly committed in\n            reforming the economy, and have well-prioritized and\n            successfully implemented their reform plans. 4) The\n            implementation of a line of credit in a post-conflict\n            situation requires intensive supervision and a strong\n            ability and willingness to adjust the project's\n            sub-lending arrangements to the rapid developments of the\n            banking sector, and to the changing capacity of the banking\n            sector to absorb credit risks. 5) The existence of\n            non-market based, fully-subsidized grant programs with\n            similar development objectives negatively affects the\n            repayment records of credit programs on market-based terms.\n            6) In a post-conflict situation characterized by the absence\n            of a financial intermediary willing and capable of lending\n            to small and medium enterprises (SMEs), the establishment of\n            an ad-hoc non-bank financial institution and the outsourcing\n            of its management to an experienced consulting company can\n            serve as effective measures to address the need for the\n            timely provision of much needed financing to eligible SMEs.\n            7) The establishment of an ad-hoc financial institution for\n            implementation of an emergency line of credit simultaneously\n            creates the challenge of identifying and implementing,\n            within the typically short implementation period of an\n            emergency loan, an exit strategy that does not result in\n            distortionary effects in the credit market or contingent\n            liabilities for the government's budget (e.g., a\n            state-owned development bank). Factors to help achieve a\n            successful exit strategy include: (1) careful and close\n            monitoring of the rapid changes of the intermediation\n            capacity of the banking sector; (2) a banking sector's\n            well-recognized market positioning of the project\n            implementing financial institution as an interim credit\n            intermediation mechanism that not only is not in competition\n            with the banking sector, but it also mobilizes technical\n            assistance to further strengthen its institutional capacity;\n            and (3) a good policy dialogue with authorities fully\n            committed in implementing reform plans."}, "docdt": "2004-06-28T00:00:00Z"}
