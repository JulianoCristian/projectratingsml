﻿C. INSTITUTIONAL STRENGTHENING
1.   Training/Study Tours
There will not be any significant training related to environmental management.
2.   Consultant Services
Supervision engineers need to work on developing guidelines and criteria, as well
as to monitor compliance.


﻿D. SCHEDULE
Present (preferably in Chart Form) Start Dates and Finish Dates for:
* Mitigation Activities
* Monitoring Activities
* Training Activities
Rehabilitation activities could only be decided and start after the proposal is agreed
on, and criteria for selecting premises developed. Activities on mitigation, monitoring
and training would be carried out throughout the project.
E. INSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS
The PMU will be responsible to hire and oversee supervision engineer(s) and
contractors. The PIU's responsibility includes the following activities:
-  supervise the work performed by the architectural/engineering firns to ensure
that they are applying adequate standards and are following agreed
procedures, as well as the agreed environmental plan.
-  organize tendering procedures, review tender evaluation performed by the
architectural/engineering firms, arrange for the contracts to be signed in
accordance with agreed procedures.
-  ensure that the architectural/engineering firms are providing adequate site
supervision, particularly the supervision of carrying out the environmental
plan.
