Construction, and\n            rehabilitation of community facilities, such as schools, or\n            public buildings, will require installation of quality\n            heating, be it central, or through individual electric\n            heaters, an environmental concern which will be minimized\n            through monitoring, and improvement of electric\n            installation, conducting fire prevention measures, and, by\n            replacing existing wiring as needed. Rehabilitation of\n            sanitary facilities, will follow strict guidelines on\n            environmental sanitation, namely appropriate connections to\n            clean water, and sewage disposal systems. The lack of\n            community awareness remains an issue of concern,\n            particularly when facing the need to create opportunities\n            for community action, therefore, an environmental awareness\n            program will address the need for clean-up actions,\n            vegetative propagation, with a specific commitment from\n            children, and youth alike, to oversee plants, and tree\n            growing. Institutional arrangements should supervise\n            mitigation activities, monitoring, and training."}, "docdt": "2001-02-27T10:28:05Z"}
