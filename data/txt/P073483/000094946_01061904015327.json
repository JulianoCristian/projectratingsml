risk\n            from different socio-cultural backgrounds. To this end,\n            community-based approaches will be tested to support\n            adolescents, and youth at risk, and, institutional capacity\n            will be strengthened, to contribute to the implementation of\n            a Children and Youth Strategy. The two main components will:\n            1) continue to test methods, and experimentation, through\n            existing Babylon youth centers. The inter-ethnic youth\n            activities cover sports, computer, and information\n            technology (IT) training. And, in addition to regular\n            scholastic activities, English language, social skills and\n            creativity, journalism, and seminars and workshops will be\n            supported. Innovative approaches will be explored for youth\n            social integration, through the use of outreach, and\n            targeted pilot programs, by establishing eight new centers,\n            proposed by nongovernmental organizations in a demand-driven\n            selection process, designed to elicit new ideas in\n            disadvantaged areas. Expansion of the Youth and Sport's\n            innovative drug abuse prevention program will be supported\n            for all secondary schools in the country, and to the Babylon\n            centers; and, 2) consolidate the youth component, by\n            supporting the participatory development of the Children,\n            and Youth Strategy, to promote ownership, and sustainability\n            of the program, and, by establishing monitoring mechanisms\n            to facilitate institutional capacity building."}, "docdt": "2001-06-07T00:00:00Z"}
