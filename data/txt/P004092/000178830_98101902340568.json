        step in KECO's power development program to meet the\n            load growth up to 1986. It would provide for the\n            installation of two 500 MW coal/oil-fired units and\n            associated auxiliary equipment; coal handling and storage\n            facilities, fuel oil tanks, ash system and storage area; a\n            fuel unloading dock for ships of up to 100,000 DWT\n            displacement; a pumping station and a 17 km steel pipe to\n            transport fresh water to the station; and a 160 km double\n            circuit, 345 KV transmission line between the power station\n            and Seoul, and related terminal substations and management\n            consulting services. The project will enable KECO to meet\n            part of the increased demand of the interconnected system\n            from 1984. It is expected that the project will help to\n            improve KECO's planning, organization, finances and the\n            structure of electricity rates. An important benefit is the\n            introduction of advanced technology to Korea, through the\n            participation of local manufacturers in association with\n            foreign companies, in the manufacture of some of the main\n            equipment. No major risks are expected to be encountered\n            during the construction of the project."}, "docdt": "1979-11-30T00:00:00Z"}
