GOJEONG POWER PROJECT
1. THE POWER SECTOR
Energy Resources
1.01      Korea's indigenous commercial energy resources are very limited
and are principally confined to hydroelectric power and coal. Economically
exploitable hydroelectric resources have been put at some 2,000 MW, of which
about 35% (712 MW) is now being utilized. The Government plans to build a
further 743 MW of hydroelectric capacity by 1986 through multipurpose
projects. By then, about 73% of Korea's hydroelectric potential would have
been developed. Proven workable reserves of low grade coal (average
4,600 Kcal/kg) are estimated at about 600 million tons, of which some 400
million tons could be exploited, equivalent to about 23 years supply at
present production.
1.02      Coal production reached 17.2 million tons in 1977, of which 73.2%
was produced by the pirvate sector.  The greater part (88%) of this production
is used to manufacture "briquets" which are very widely used domestically
for cooking and space heating. The remainder goes to heavy industry with
very little domestic coal being used in the electricity sector. Present coal
production does not meet internal demand (some 800,000 tons of coal were
imported in 1978). According to the consultants who recently made a review
of Korea's energy sector /1, 1983 would be a critical year since briquet
demand for the residential sector could be over 20 million tons while the
local production available for briquets might be only 16 million tons. The
gap between demand and supply would persist thereafter.
1.03      In view of the rising production cost the Government increased in
April 1979 the price of domestic anthracite by 35% from US$24.5 per ton to
US$33 per ton.   Although this price is approximately 39% higher than the
imported bituminous coal used in the power plants for the same equivalent
heat value, it is still cheaper than kerosene or other alternative fuel for
domestic purposes.
1.04      Consumption of primary energy has kept pace with overall economic
expansion between 1961 and 1977 and grew at an annual average rate of
9.0%, although during 1974 and 1975 annual energy growth was only 0.1% and
6.2%   respectively, because of the oil crisis at the end of 1973, which
affected Korea's economic development though only temporarily. During
1961-1977 the GNP per capita grew by an average rate of 9.8% a year with a
GNP elasticity of energy demand of 0.92.

-2-
1.05      Although the industrial sector is the largest energy user, about
one third of the sector's use of energy goes to electricity. Electricity
is the fastest growing form of energy in Korea; its share in total energy
demand has risen from about 6% in 1961 to 20% in 1977 and is expected to
reach some 30% by the year 2000. Energy consumption by each type of fuel
and sector is shown below:

1.06         Projections prepared by the Ministry of Energy and Resources (MER)
in February 1979 show that the energy demand would be some 2,781 x 1012
Kcal (eight-fold the energy demand in 1977) by year 2000 assuming that the
average annual GNP growth would be 9.25% and the increase in energy
demand would be 9.7% a year. The Government's objective in the long-term is
to diversify the origin of energy imports to lessen the risk of loss of
supply through failure to maintain continuity of fuel supplies. This is
aimed to reduce the present heavy dependence on imported oil (64% in 1977)
by switching to imported coal and uranium, so that by the year 2000 the
share of oil would be around 43%, nuclear power 23%, gas 10% and coal 21%
of energy demand.



-3-
1.07      This forecast appears to be optimistic since the government
decided last June to take measures in order to reduce the actual rate of
economic growth, at least for the next few years. It did so in view of the
impact of higher oil prices on world energy trade and the new import
restrictions adopted by many of the major industrial countries as a con-
sequence of the slowdown in the world economy. The Government has also
launched an energy conservation program aimed at reducing overall energy
consumption by 5% from 1979 and has created a special fund for rational use
of energy of W 4.0 billion for 1979 and of W 10 billion for 1980 to encourage
private industries to modify their energy consumption patterns to more
energy efficient forms. The program also includes special inspection teams
to conduct surveys of 900 industrial firms to seek possibilities of saving
nil and oil products. In the power sector the major measures for saving
c irgy include higher monthly rates for residential and commercial consump-
tion above 300 kWh; prohibition on air conditioning except between July 10
and August 20 and electrical signs for outdoor advertisement (para. 3.07).
A'pplication of a long-run marginal pricing system would also be advisable to
induce energy saving in the energy sector.
1.08      If the present nuclear program is carried out, the estimated
requirement for natural uranium will reach the level of 15,000 tons of U308
per year by year 2000 and the annual requirement for enrichment service will
be close to 6,000 to)ts of SWU./1   Since Korea has only low-grade uranium ore
and the presently known uranium reserves in the country are about 3,000 tons
(only sufficient for three units during its useful life), Korea will largely
have to depend on long-term foreign contracts for uranium supply, enrichment
services, etc. KECO is now engaged with Taipower Co. (Rep. of China) and
ANSCHUT (USA) in a joint venture for uranium exploration in Paraguay.
1.09      Korea's dependence on imported energy was nearly 68% of all energy
consumed in 1977 and could reach some 85% by year 2000. Accordingly, a
periodic review of energy demand and supply patterns appears to be advisable
to ensure that it matches the expected economic development of the
country at least cost. The Government is expected to carry out these
reviews.
Sector Organization
1.10      The Ministry of Energy and Resources (MER), created at the begin-
ning of 1978, is responsible for the overall coordination of the energy
sector. Through its Electricity Bureau, MER formulates the national policy
for electricity generation, transmission and distribution, and oversees and
controls the activities of KECO, approving its future plans and recommending
electricity rates to the Government. MER shares with the Economi- planning
Board (EPB) and the Ministry of Finance (MOF) the responsibility for defin-
ing investment priorities and approving KECO's annual budget. The Ministry
of Construction (MOC) retains jurisdiction over the survey, exploration,
/1 UNIP/IBRD Korea Energy Policy Study.

development and use of water resorces throughout the country.  Lastly, the
Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST) is responsible for the licensing,
regulation and supervision of the nuclear industry, although KECO is
responsible for the design, equipping, construction and operation of the
nuclear power plants.
1.11       KECO is the only public electricity distributor in Korea, and it
owns all the generating facilities, with the exception of a 325-MW steam ther-
moelectric plant owned by the Kyongin Energy Company, a private oil refinery,
and the multipurpose hydro facilities owned by the Industrial Sites and Water
Resources Development Corporation (ISWACO), a government agency, which at
present has an installed capacity of 200 MW (Soyanggang multipurpose project).
The electricity generated by these two companies is sold in bulk to KECO.
1.12       KECO is the country's largest public corporation.  The Government
owns 82% of its share capital and it should be fully government-owned by
1981. KECO is a bureaucratic organization and suffers from excessive govern-
mental regulations and controls. Several of its functions, such as estab-
lishing wage and salary levels and the number of its employees, are decided
by the Government. There has been an excessive turnover of experienced
personnel because of inadequate incentives and more attractive opportunities
in the private sector. KECO also plays a very small part in preparing the
studies for demand forecasts and for the expansion program.  These studies,
which should be conducted by KECO, have recently been assigned to the Korean
Development Institute (KDI).
1.13       Since its formation in 1961, KECO's basic function has been to
meet the growing aemand for electric power. As a result, the company's
growth has been based almost solely on its original structures, so that
today some of its operating procedures are not the best suited to accomplish
its medium-term objective with efficiency and economy, particularly con-
sidering that the present demand of 5,118 MW (1978) will almost triple over
the next 8 years (by 1986). To meet this situation, the Government
requested KDI in 1978 to conduct a study for the reorganization of KECO
(para. 2.03). Although the Government intends to support the necessary
reinforcement of KECO's organizational structure to keep pace with its
growth and the sector's needs over the next ten years, it will probably not
implement the necessary changes until it has fully taken over that part of
KECO's share capital that is still in private hands.
Bank Role and Sector Lending Strategy
1.14      Though the Bank has not made any direct loan to the electricity
sector in Korea it has assistea the sector in several other ways. Kyongu
Tourism Project, Loan 953-KO for US$25.0 million made in 1973, included an
electricity component of US$3.7 million for transmission and distribution
facilities in the resort area. Loans 1216-KO and 1218T-KO for US$60
million, made in 1976 for a rural infrastructure project included a US$18.1
million component to assist with the electrification of some 300,000 rural
housing units, which benefitted about 1.7 million people. Also Loan
1666-KO, made to ISWACO in March 1979 for US$125 million to finance part of
the Chungju multipurpose project included a 460-MW electricity component.



- 5 -
In addition, the Bank reviewed the electricity sector in 1975, and its
economic report, of February 1977, provided an overview of the energy sector
and made a number of recommendations for stimulating and rationalizing the
electricity sector, some of which have been implemented by the Government.
The Bank is also acting as executing agency for a UNDP study, assisting the
Government in drawing up a long-term energy policy. The final draft of the
study is currently being examined by the Government. The consultants'
recommendations are summarized in Annex 1.
1.15      By participating in the proposed loan for the Gojeong project, the
Bank intends to help the Government and KECO in the rationalization process,
with a view to optimizing the allocation of resources to the electricity
sector, which because of its magnitude represents approximately 14.3% of
public expenditure and accounts for almost 1.4% of GNP. The Bank will also
encourage the Government to bring electricity prices gradually into line
with actual costs for the different consumer categories so as to prevent
improper use of the service and assure KECO of sufficient revenues to enable
it to make a reasonable financial contribution to the expansion of the
electricity system.
1.16      Institution building and helping KECO achieve operational autonomy
will be another important objective of the proposed loan. KECO will prepare
studies, relative to changes in its organizational structure, designed to
improve its operations and strengthen its basic units such as the planning
departments, enabling them to perform their functions properly. Gradual
elimination of the constraints preventing KECO and the entire electricity
sector from developing is a matter requiring urgent attention. It is
expected that these points will be addressed in a study of KECO's management
and organization which would be financed under the proposed loan (para.
2.04).
Power Market and Supply
1.17      The average annual rate of increase in Korea's electricity
generation over the period 1961-78 was 18.5%, with GDP elasticity of 1.9.
Present per capita consumption is 733 kWh, which is higher than average for
Asia. Installed capacity at the end of 1978 was 7,464 MW, including 548 MW
accounted for by auto-producers. Thermal facilities accounted for 80.5% of
total electricity generation.
1.18      Korea has around 5 million subscribers in an estimated total
population of 37 million. Ninety seven percent of these subscribers are
residential and electricity service is available to 97.2% of the popula-
tion./I Consumption by large industry represented 66.4% of total consump-
tion in 1978, followed by small industry as shown below:
/1 Practically 100% of total urban population and 95.3% of the rural popula-
tion.

The labor force in the sector totaled 16,800 at the end of 1978, with a
ratio of 444 KW/ employee and 294 consumers/employee, which is considered
satisfactory.
Rural Electrification
1.19      The rural electrification program, designed to improve the living
conditions of the rural and fishing population, was started in 1965 following
enactment of the law. The program provides for the electrification of
2,834 thousand housing units. By the end of 1978, about 2,755 thousand of
these had been connected to the electricity supply system, leaving only
79,000 throughout the country (without electrification), most of these being
scattered among the islands or located in remote mainland areas not yet
reached by the system. KECO estimates that the program will be completed in
1981. Total expenditure on this program up to 1978 was W 92.5 billion at
current prices (US$ 191 million). Government support of the electrification
program amounts to W 73.8 billion, the balance was provided from KECO's cash
generation (W 11.1 billion) and consumer contributions (W 7.6 billion). The
rural consumers are meeting the entire cost of wiring their houses and part
of the cost of the distribution facilities, by means of loans at 35 years
with 5 years grace, at 7.5% interest. Repayments are included in the
monthly electricity bills.
Future Development
1.20      The long-term development plan (1978-2000) for the electricity
sector, which forms part of the overall energy plan, provides for the substi-
tution of oil (71.9% in 1978 and 12.5% in 2000) by imported coal to fuel the
future thermoelectric plants. It also includes the development of an ambi-
tious program for nuclear power plants to meet the basic load, in addition
to the development of all economically exploitable hydroelectric resources,
and the installation of pumped storage plants to help handle peak loads.
The development plan prepared by KDI for KECO provides for an increase in
installed capacity from 6,916 MW at the end of 1978 to some 80,000 MW by the
year 2000. There is some doubt regarding the feasibility of this program
since it includes the construction of about 47 nuclear power plants with a
combined capacity of the order of 50,000 MW (equivalent to total US nuclear
power installed capacity at the end of 1978), of which orly one is in



-7-
operation (KORI-1, 579 MW) and four are under construction (3,129 MW).  Part
of this capacity would be associated with the installation of pumped storage
plants (9,000 MW), although in many cases the economic studies that would
justify these possible projects have not yet been carried out.
1.21      The expansion program up to 1986 is firmly committed with the
exception of a few minor projects that should come on line in 1986. The
program comprises a net aggregate capacity of 14,280 MW, including projects
under construction (8,032 MW), new projects (6,593 MW) and the withdrawal
from service of about 345 MW of old and inefficient thermal facilities.
Most of the hydro plants included in the program are part of multipurpose
projects, and will make only a small contribution to the electricity system
(283 MW), with the exception of the 460 MW Chungju project (para. 1.14).
Details of the program are given in paragraph 3.09 and Annexes 4 and 5.
1.22      The long-term expansion program (1978-2000) is tentative beyond
1986. Because the expansion program up to 1986 has more reserve capacity
than is required to adequately meet the increased load (para. 3.10 and
3.11), and because the lead time for a nuclear power project is normally 10
years from the date the decision is taken to the date of entry into service,
KECO has agreed to submit to the Bank no later than June 30, 1981 a revised
power development program for the period to 1991, with proper justification
of its components (feasibility studies), for the pumped storage plants,
tidal projects, multipurpose hydro projects, etc. taking into account the
effects of the energy conservation measures recently adopted by the
Government, so that from 1987 the country will have an expansion program
based on the least cost solution.
Investments
1.23      Investment in the sector over the period 1979-1986 is estimated at
around US$27 billion at current prices (approximately US$19 billion at 1979
prices) of which 38% would be the foreign exchange component. Of this total,
KECO's investment would represent approximately 94% (US$25.4 billion).
The proposed expenditures in the sector up to 1986 are shown below:

Tariffs
1.24      Electricity rates are approved by Government.  Changes in the sched-
ules are first proposed by KECO to MER and after review by the Government
Price Stabilization Committee submitted to Cabinet and then issued as
Presidential Decrees. In the past changes in the rates have been approved
promptly.
1.25      The structure of rates has generally not reflected costs of supply
to the respective consumer categories. Government has tended to encourage
industrial development through low electricity tariffs and has offered special
discounts to certain industries such as aluminum. However, the discounts
were removed in November 1976. Similarly, residential consumers have been
subsidized by being excluded from general rate increases.  Some improvements
in the structure have been made since the oil price increases in 1973;
declining block tariffs have been replaced by progressive tariffs and peak
load pricing has been introduced for large industrial customers. In
June 1979, Government modified the rates for residential and commercial
consumers, as part of its energy conservation program to provide penalty
rates for consumers using in excess of 300 kWh a month. These new rates
(para 3.07) are in excess of the long-run marginal costs of supply.
1.26      A marginal cost pricing study is being undertaken for KECO by
Electricite de France (EDF) under a technical cooperation agreement with
KDI. A report is expected towards the middle of 1980. During negotiations
KECO agreed to submit a copy of the study with its recommendations to the
Bank by December 31, 1980 for review and comment. KECO has also agreed to
consider application of marginal cost based electricity tariffs and the
Government has agreed to review and consult with the Bank on this matter
and take all necessary action to implement the changes agreed between KECO
and the Bank to apply power rates based on marginal costs.
2. THE BORROWER
Organization and Management
2.01      KECO is managed by a board of directors comprising a president, two
executive vice-presidents and six vice-presidents. The president of KECO is
appointed by the President of the Republic on the recommendation of the
Minister of Energy and Resources; the executive vice-presidents are appointed
by the Minister and the vice-presidents are elected by the shareholders for
three years and approved by the Minister. The members of the board all par-
ticipate actively in the management of the company.



- 9 -
2.02      KECO's present organization is shown in a simplified form in
Chart 20409. There are several anomalies in KECO's organization which must
constrain effective planning, management and control, for example: there are
three departments concerned with planning under separate vice-presidents:
planning and control, engineering, and nuclear power planning. There are
also three departments arranging loans: finance, overseas materials, and
nuclear power planning. KECO's main function of distributing electricity
is coordinated through 21 branches. Each branch has separate sections each
independent of the others, responsible for construction, operation and
maintenance of transmission and distribution lines. Coordination between
all these sections within the branches with KECO's main head office would
appear to pose increasing organizational problems as the system is expanded.
For example in 1978, KECO's middle-management staff at the section or
subsection chief level accounted for 17% of all KECO's personnel. Clearly
the continued growth of KECO's organizational structure along historical
lines would not be appropriate to the needs of the expected greatly enlarged
system in the '80s.
2.03      Early in 1978 KDI completed a report recommending improvement in
KECO's organization and management to meet its needs in the eighties. The
KDI report recommendations included the following:
(a)  KECO be reorganized into three boards; construction, generation and
transmission and business, the last mentioned would include
distribution;
(b)  establishment of a total management information system;
(c)  development of a master plan for manpower;
(d)  establishment of a policy council to take over the Government's
regulatory functions over matters such as operating policies, devel-
opment plans, electricity rates, organization, staffing and
salaries, etc.; and
(e)  provision of greater autonomy to KECO's management especially over
procurement, staffing and budgetary affairs.
2.04      Little or no progress has been made in implementation of the KDI
recommendations. The Government appears to be under no particular pressure
to change the status quo. The reason advanced by MER for the Government's
inaction was the latter's lack of confidence in KECO's management. There is
also (as mentioned in para. 1.12) the question of the interests of the
private shareholders whose shares will have been acquired by the end of
1981. In the interim both KECO and the Government have supported the Bank's
suggestion of an independent review of KECO's management and organization
including the role of Government in the sector especially with respect
to planning, procurement, salaries, staffing and organization. KECO
has agreed to engage foreion consultants under terms of reference acceptable
to the Bank to make recommendations on the best form of management and



- 10 -
organization for KECO. The study will be financed from the proposed Bank
loan and KECO has agreed to submit to the Bank a copy of the consultant's
recommendations for review and comment by December 31, 1Q81. The consul-
tant's services have been estimated at UTS$0.75 milion at 1Q79 price levels
with approximately 72 man-months and a total cost of TUS$10,400 per man-month.
Manpower and Training
2.05      KECO is the largest Government-owned public corporation in the
country. It has over 15,000 full-time employees (excluding construction
staff) and expects to have over 20,000 by 1986. The staff establishment,
salaries and conditions are approved by the MER. Salaries are low by
comparison with the private sector. Average monthly salaries, including
overtime allowances, bonus and compensation for annual leave range from
about $350 for skilled workers to about $1,350 for managers. Staff turnover
is a problem, exceeding 6% in 1977. KECO is having difficulty retaining
competent and experienced staff at all levels. Continuation of this trend
could severely constrain KECO's ability to construct, operate and maintain
the rapidly expanding electricity system. In recognition of the problem it
is already paying staff of its nuclear divisions 20-30% above its normal
salary levels. The Government, while fully recognizing this problem is
anxious to curb inflation and not willing to engage in competition with the
private sector to retain its qualified personnel or to create differing
salary levels between its own corporations. Nevertheless, the adoption
of higher salaries especially for KECO's technical staff should be
encouraged on the basis of the highly specialized needs of the power sector.
The Government has agreed to take appropriate steps no later than
June 30, 1981 to ensure that KECO can recruit and retain qualified staff.
2.06      KECO is giving strong support to manpower development and training.
It has developed manpower plans through 1987 and has recently reorganized its
technical high school spending 5 billion won (USM10 million equivalent) on
new buildings and facilities. Total enrollment will he 1,800 students. It
also has its own training center with facilities for 324 persons. The
training center runs a wide variety of short courses with emphasis on the
technical aspects. During 1979 it expects about 8,000 of its employees to
attend these courses. Considerable emphasis is given to language training.
In 1981 KECO plans to establish an advanced technical college. "'raining
facilities have also been developed for personnel in the nuclear divisions.
Overseas on-the-job training is being carried out for plant operators and
overseas procurement staff. KECO's long-term manpower development plans and
training programs are considered adequate for its needs.
Accounts and Audit
2.07      KECO prepares an annual budget which is approved by EPB and MER.
However, it is not required to submit its long-range financial plans to the
Government for approval. Under the Korea Electric Company Act rates may be



- 11 -
set to provide a fair return on investment. However, Government and KECO0
are not committed to meeting any financial performance targets with respect
to rate of return, internal cash generation or the level of debt service
coverage.
2.08      KECO's accounting system is based on the uniform system of accounts
of the US Federal Power Commission. It is bound by Government regulations
and follows the generally accepted accounting principles in Korea which are
set out in Presidential Decrees. KECO has little autonomy in financial
matters; foreign borrowing and revaluation of assets are regulated by law. It
is required to submit its financial statements to MER 20 days prior to the
annual general meeting which is held within 2 months of the end of the year.
2.09      The accounts are well prepared and the financial statements are
completed promptly at the end of each year. Much of the accounting in the
past was until recently dependent on manual labor-intensive methods but most
functions are now being transferred to computers. KECO's financial
forecasts are prepared using a well-designed financial forecasting model.
2.10      The financial statements are audited by San Kyong and Company
which is affiliated with the international firm, Touche Ross and Co. The
auditors' reports are prepared promptly and are usually completed within 6
weeks of the end of each fiscal year. They are comprehensive, contain
detailed notes to financial statements and a summary statement outlining the
scope of the examination. The auditors are elected for two years by the
shareholders subject to the approval of MER.
2.11      Each year at least since 1974 the auditors have given a qualified
opinion on KECO's accounts because its annual provisions for employees retire-
ments benefits have been inadequate. KECO has been unable to make up the
deficits so far because Government has not permitted adequate budget provi-
sions for these commitments. KECO has recently agreed with the Government
that provisions will be increased so as to make up the deficits by the end
of 1981. KECO has agreed to submit its annual financial statements audited
by San Kyong and Co. or other independent auditors satisfactory to the Bank
within three months of the end of its fiscal year.
Insurance
2.12      KECO's property department maintains a self-insurance scheme for all
risks and automobile accident insurance. In addition to its self-insurance,
KECO takes out compulsory fire insurance on all buildings over 1,000 square
meters in the largest cities in accordance with compulsory fire insurance law
and also pays for nuclear contamination protection. The overseas materials
department takes out marine cargo and erection insurance. Given the diversi-
fied nature of KECO's assets and their value, the present insurance arrange-
ments are considered appropriate to KECO's needs.

3. THE POWER MARKET
Historic
3.01      KECO supplies the country's entire electricity market.  Since
practically the whole of Korea is served by the integrated system, with the
exception of the islands and a few remote mainland areas, this means that
over 98% of the electricity service is provided through the interconnected
system.
3.02      Electricity sales totaled 27,326 GWh in 1978, and have grown at an
average annual rate of 20.2% since 1961, the year of the company's forma-
tion. Over the same 17-year period electricity generation increased from
1,773 GWh in 1961 to 31,510 GWh in 1978. The growth of the electricity
market between 1961 and 1978 is detailed in Annex 2 and summarized below:
(1961-78)
Average %
1961      1971      1975      1978    annual growth
Energy Sales (GWh)         1,213      8,884   16,630   27,326           20.2
Lighting                     228      1,232    2,130    3,959           18.3
Small power                  148        646    1,130    5,061           23.0
Large power                  816      6,968   13,286   18,116           20.0
Agricultural                  21          38       84       190         13.9

Plant use (%)                5.0        4.4       5.5       5.1          -
Gross generation (GWh)   1,773       10,541   19,837   31,510           18.5
Load factor C%)             66.2       67.7      67.6      70.3          -
Peak demand (MW)             306      1,777    3,351    5,118           18.0
Installed capacity (MW)    368        2,628    4,720    6,916           19.0
In this period, the increase in electricity generation averaged 18.5%
annually compared with GNP growth of approximately 9.3%. This was due to
unusual growth in the demand for electricity arising from spiralling indus-
trial development. (The mining and manufacturing production increased each
year at an average of 17.3% and its contribution to GNP rose from 15.2% in
1961 to 28.2% in 1978.)



- 13 -
3.03       The demand for electricity for residential use increased more than
17 times over the period 1961-1978, at an average annual rate of 18.3%.  This
was due to the rapid rise in per capita income (US$82 in 1961 and US$820
in 1977), from the increased use of household appliances and from the
Government's countrywide electrification program, which brought the number
of consumers from 770,000 in 1961 up to 4,778,000 in 1978 (an annual
increase of 11.3% in the number of residential consumers).
3.04       Losses on the transmission and distribution systems have been sub-
stantially reduced (from 28% in 1961 to 8.4% in 1978) due to expansion of the
transmission and distribution systems, conversion of the primary networks to
higher voltages, introduction (in 1976) of the 345 KV high-voltage network,
and installation of generation facilities in the country's different
regions, allowing for a better generation/distribution balance. Also the
elimination of pilferage has contributed to the reduction of losses.
Load Forecast
3.05      The long-term demand forecast for power and energy has been
prepared by KDI and is based on the use of econometric models applied to
each end user category. KECO has also made its own forecasts, using
simpler econometric equations. Both projections are similar, with a devia-
tion between them of only 4% up to year 2,000. In both cases, the electricity
demand forecasts are based on economic parameters fixed by KDI, as shown
below:
1977-1981    1982-1986    1987-1991
GNP                                  10.20         10.00         10.00
Mining and manufacturing             15.20         12.80         11.40
Elasticity GNP                        1.60          1.31          1.17
Elasticity mining and manu-           1.07          1.02          1.03
facturing
3.06       The expert who took part in the Korean energy study financed by
UNDP considers that the procedures used by KDI for estimating the long-term
demand for electricity are questionable because of the few observations
available (1962-1976), the lack of adequate data for some of these years,
and the large number of variables included in the equations used. Also,
since the reliability of these forecasts largely depends on the accuracy of
the estimates of the independent variables, he recommends that these models
be used to supplement rather than replace the time series analysis or other
analytical methods, and that KECO be assigned final responsibility for
estimating demand. The Bank supports this recommendation.



- 14 -
3.07       In June 1979, the Korean Government adopted a number of energy-
conservation measures designed to reduce overall energy consumption by 5%.
These measures which are applied nationwide include:
(a)  air conditioning equipment not to be used during the summer except
between July 10 and August 20. This does not apply to hotels in
the international category;
(b)  no illuminated signs and no lighting of shop windows;
(c)  reduction in the number of lights in the stores (between 25% and
50%) and incandescent bulbs to be replaced by fluorescent tubes;
(d)  no illumination of sports grounds;
(e)  imposition of a very high surcharge on residential and commercial
consumers using over 300 KWh per month from USd 20.0 per KWh
between 301 and 450 KWh up to a maximum of USO 94.0 per KWh over
2,000 KWh per month (average power rates up to 300 KWh are
USj 12.2 per KWh); and
(f) more efficient use of electricity in industry.
As a result of these measures, KECO estimates that electricity consumption
will drop this year by about 1,200 GWh and about 500 MW in relation to the
demand forecasts.
3.08      The 1979-1986 demand forecasts refined by the mission show an
increase in energy sales from 27,326 GWh in 1978 to 74,844 GWh in 1986;
an average annual growth rate of 13.4%. The estimated sales distribution
shows that consumption trends in the different user categories will not
change much from 1978: large industry will consume 69%, small industry 17%,
and the residential and general sector 14%. In accordance with the Govern-
ment's present program, generation capacity will increase by approximately
14,300 MW, while maximum demand will reach about 14,000 MW by 1986. Details
are given in Annex 3 ana are summarized below:



- 15 -
1979       1983        1986

Gross generation (GWh)           36,306      60,689      86,077
Load factor (%)                     70.5       70.8        70.0
Peak demand (MW)                  5,879       9,785      14,037
Installed capacity (MW)           8,035      13,443      21,196
The Expansion Program
3.09      The generation expansion program for 1979-1986, provides for the
installation of 14 thermal stations totalling 6,553 MW, 5 hydro plants
totaling 743 MW, 3 pumped storage stations totalling 1,400 MW, and 7 nuclear
power stations with 5,929 MW. The breakdown of the various projects is
given in Annex 4.
3.10      As can be seen from the table in paragraph 3.08, the system's
reserve seems excessive. KECO is strongly against considering any change or
reduction in the present program, since construction of some of the major
projects, particularly the nuclear plants, could be delayed, and because the
growth in the demand for electricity over the medium term has traditionally
been greater than estimated.  Certain of the projects under construction
have indeed been delayed, and it is also possible that some of the projects
still to be started will not be completed on time owing to over-optimistic
scheduling.  In any case, even if these two conflicting phenomena should
occur simultaneously, namely a demand higher than the forecast and a delay
in entry into service of certain major projects, KECO should not have any
problems in satisfactorily meeting the growing demand for electricity up to
1986, since the level of reserves will still be well over 30% for that year.
3.11      Since a high reserve capacity is a nonproductive investment, some
sensitivity analysis should be carried out in the future studies of the
expansion program to avoid substantial over-investment in the sector by
adopting less pessimistic assumptions for forced outage rates, scheduled
maintenance, minimum and maximum permissible reserve margin (%) in critical
periods. The current assumed derating for the nuclear power plants (40%
during the first year and 20% during the second year of operation) should
also be modified. The isolated system should be considered separately from
the interconnected system (it was erroneously included in the current
studies), and the reliability of the service should be analyzed in terms of
a cost-benefit ratio. The implementation of the least cost power system
development models (like the WASP model used for the present power expansion
development) must be carefully planned and should be carried out by staff
with economic as well as technical knowledge of,power systems working full

time in this field. In this respect the existing arrangerents whereby YDI
is responsible for the power system developrient studies under short-term
contracts with KIC0 does not appear ideal. Steps should be taken immediately
to attract the necessary highly qualified personnel within YECO's organiza-
tion, in order that the main responsibility for the generation planning
studies be given to KECO rather than other governmental agencies.  The
Government of Korea has agreed to allocate to YECO the main responsibility
for the preparation of the electric power development program in
collaboration, as necessary, with other governmental agencies.
3.12      The WASP Program, does not allow for analysis of the alternatives
for electricity transmission. This is not of any great significance for
Yorea, because:
(a)  the number of sites suitable for the construction of large conven-
tional or nuclear power plants is limited by reason of national
security and because many of these areas are heavily populated;
(b)  the hydro and pumped storage plants under construction or at the
design stage are relatively close to the load centers; and
(c)  the 345 KV and 154 KV transmission lines are relatively short.
Thus the change in the discounted costs of the different transmission alter-
natives will be practically insignificant.
3.13      The transmission and distribution expansion program (details in
Annex 5) includes expansion of the 345 KV system with a view to inter-
connecting the different regions of the country and connecting the largest
plants to this voltage, to ensure greater stability in operation of the
system in both steady and transient conditions. The basic aim of expansion
of the 154 KV system is to supply the energy required in each region and to
establish ring main systems around the largest cities. TYECO anticipates
restricting future extensions of the 66 rV lines and completing the increase
in the voltage of the primary distribution networks from 3.3 KV and 6.6 KV
to 22.9 KV, and that of the secondary distribution networks from 100/200 v
to 230/380 V. A summary of the proposed projects up to 1986 is given below:

4. THE PROJECT
4.01      The Gojeong thermal power project constitutes the logical next step
in the program to meet the load growth up to 1986, which over the last 17
years has increased at an average of 18.5% a year.
Location
4.02      The project site is located on a hilly peninsula on the west coast
of the country in a virtually unpopulated area, approximately 14 km by road
from Daecheon city (population 45,000), the area's commercial center and
approximately 40 km north of the port of Kunsan. The site is adequate for the
ultimate installation of six units similar to the first two 500 MW units
planned for the project (see Chart 20408).
Project Description
4.03      The Gojeong project.comprises:
(a) a thermal power station with two 500 MW coal/oil fired units, and
associated auxiliary equipment;
(b) coal handling and storage facilities, fuel oil tanks, ash system
and storage area;
(c) a fuel unloading dock for ships of up to 100,000 DWT displacement;
(d) a pumping station and a 17 km steel pipe to transport fresh water
to the station, with a 5.3 cu m/min capacity sufficient for the
first four 500 MW units; and
(e) a 160 km of double circuit, 345 kV transmission line between the
Gojeong power project and Seoul, and related terminal substations.
4.04      The two units will be constructed as a complete station, using
certain common facilities but without provision for expansion of the main
buildings to accommodate additional units. The turbines will be a 3,600 rpm
tandem compound, four-flow, single reheat type. The generators will be
577,000 kVA, 2-pole, 60 cycles, rated at 0.9 power factor with the rotor
cooled by hydrogen at a maximum pressure of 4.1 kg/ sq cm, together with a
water-cooled stator. The excitation system will be a solid state type. The
steam generators will be a drum type, balance draft units, rated at boiler
outlet conditions of 170 atm and 5400C with a production of 1,679 tons/hr
of steam.
4.05      The transmission line will cross firm but flat terrain, with the
exception of about 48 km (30%) of hilly areas with elevations of up to 600 m.
Lattice steel towers for double circuit will be used carrying four bundle
conductors per phase of 954 MCM, ACSR, shielded by two 75 sq mm steel wires.
The diameter of the conductors and the arrangement of quad bundles was adopted



- 18 -
in order to increase the surge impedance level (SIL) and obtain low power
losses. Double insulator strings consisting of 18-20 units per string will
be used for suspension towers and triple insulator strings for retention
towers.
Fuel Supply
4.06      Annual consumption of imported bituminous coal for the station's
ultimate capacity (3,000 MW) is estimated at approximately 6.6 milLion tons.
This would require, according to the consultants, about 85 ships to be
unloaded at Gojeong each year. In view of the need for continuous operation,
the dock and coal unloading facilities will be built to the final capacity
to avoid serious interference that would be caused by subsequent expansion
in the same work area. Coal requirements for the project are estimated at
2.2 million tons a year and would be probably imported from Australia,
Canada, South Africa and USA. KECO received bids in March for long-term
supply contracts and is evaluating the proposals. On average, each coal
producer would supply about 500,000 tons a year for a 4-year period.
The Gojeong power station will use Bunker C as an alternative fuel.  The
project includes the installation of four storage tanks with a unit capacity
of 500,000 barrels sufficient for four 500 MW units for 30 days' operation
at full load. The fuel would be acquired from the local refineries.
Estimated Cost
4.07      The project is estimated to cost US$657 million excluding custom
duties and financial charges. The foreign currency component is estimated
to be approximately US$192 million. The costs, which are detailed in
Annex 6 are summarized as follows:

4.08      The base estimates for the thermal power station were prepared by
the consultants Bechtel International Inc. and Associates, who conducted the
Gojeong feasibility study. The estimated quantities, equipment sizes,



- 19 -
ratings, etc. were developed by the consultants on the basis of data avail-
able on other similar projects and adjusted to the requirements of the Gojeong
site. The estimated costs are based on price levels at the beginning of
1979 with the exception of the main equipment (turbine generators and boilers)
preliminary civil works and consultants services for the engineering of the
project, for which contracts were made in September 1979 on the basis of
fixed prices.  Transmission estimates are based on the costs of 345 kV
systems under construction at various locations in Yorea. A physical
contingency of 10% on the overall cost has been allowed to cover variations
in labor productivity, unit costs, quantities, etc. The price contingencies
for foreign costs were calculated on the basis of assumed annual rates of
escalation of 10% for 1979; 9% for 1980; 8% for 1981 and 7% for 1982-84.
For local costs the price contingencies adopted in the cost estimates are:
14% for the first semester and 10% for the second semester of 1979; 9% for
1980 and 8% for 1981-1984. These are in line with expected price increases
in Korea.
Project Financing
4.09       A Bank loan of US$115.0 million equivalent is proposed representing
60% of the foreign exchange cost of the project. It has been assumed that
the proposed Bank loan would be for 17 years including a 4-year period of
grace. The loan would finance part of the foreign exchange cost of pumps,
heaters, coal and ash handling equipment, auxiliary mechanical and elec-
trical equipment, communication system, materials and equipment for the
transmission system and management consulting services. No retroactive
financing is proposed. YECO would bear the foreign exchange risks on the
proposed Bank loan and would finance the interest during construction from
its own sources of funds.
4.10      The remaining foreign costs which would be for the main equipmient
items i.e., the turbine generators and boilers, would be financed by export
credits and a syndicated loan. Toshiba (Japan) would finance 85% of its
share of the cost of the turbine generators at an interst rate of 7.5% per
annum repayable over 12 years and the Export-Import Bank of the United
States (EXIM) would finance a similar percentage of the cost of the boilers
at 8% interest repayable over 12 years. The syndicated loan is being
arranged through Samuel Mlontagu & Co. Ltd. (UK) and is expected to be offered
at 1/16 of 1% above the London interbank rate (LIBOR). The local costs of
the proposed project would be met by KECO from its own internal sources and
those acquired as part of its annual borrowings for financing its develop-
ment program. Although KECO is expected to be able to obtain without
difficulty all the funds it will require for construction of the project on
reasonable terms, the Government has agreed to meet any shortfall in funds
required for completion of the project.
Engineering and Construction
4.11       KECO is financing with its own funds the cost of engineering
services for detailed design and technical advice during construction of
Gojeong. The consultant (AMTAI) would also develop a training program to



- 20 -
familiarize KECO personnel with the techniques of design of various power
plant systems. The consulting firm is considered suitable by the Bank.
AMTAI was registered as a joint venture between American Bechtel Inc. (USA)
and Taihan Engineering Company Ltd (Korea) in November 1978 under Korea's
Foreign Capital Inducement Act. Engagement of consultants for the trans-
mission component would not be necessary because KECO has good experience in
the design and supervision of projects at 345 kV.
4.12      The consultant estimates that the Gojeong construction will take
about 4-1/2 years. As the preliminary civil works (excavations and grading
of site) have started and the main equipment has been ordered, it is expected
that the first structural concrete would be poured by March 1981. This
activity determines the critical path for project completion presently
scheduled for October 1983 for the first unit and April 1984 for the second
unit (mission estimates). The Gojeong power plant construction schedule is
reasonable. There is a probability of 90% that the project will be
completed in the period roughly between 51 and 57 months from the starting
date. The simplified implementation bar schedule shown in Chart 20410,
would be used to monitor progress during the construction period.
4.13      A total of four local manufacturers of boilers and turbine-
generators equipment were invited to submit tenders at the end of December
1978.  The invitations were issued to local manufacturers in line with the
Government policy of fostering the local industry, together with the names
of foreign manufacturers (13 for turbines and 11 for boilers) recommended by
KECO to be associated with local firms to guarantee the performance of the
equipment. The contract for the turbine generators was made on September 10,
1979 to the lowest evaluated bidder, a joint venture between Daewoo (Korea)
and Toshiba (Japan). The contract is based on a fixed price and amounts to
US$39 million including spare parts and supervision during erection   The
foreign exchange component represents 82% of the total contract price. The
contract for the boilers was made on September 24, 1979 to Hyundai Heavy
Industries Co., Ltd. (Korea) with associated supervisory services from
Babcock & Wilcox Co. (USA). The contract is also based on a fixed price and
amounts to US$87.2 million including spare parts and supervision during
erection. The foreign exchange component is 36.4% of the contract price and
comprises the supply of drums, atemperators, fuel burning supply, control
system with instrumentation, training and supervision fees, spare parts and
contingencies. The costs of these equipments are attractive.
Procurement
4.14      Procurement of all equipment and materials to be financed by the
proposed loan would be on the basis of international competitive bidding in
accordance with the Bank's procurement guidelines. Bidding documents,
including recommendations for award of contracts, would be prepared by KECO
with the assistance of AMTAI and approved by the Bank.  Korean manufacturers
would receive a preference of 15% or applicable duties, whichever is the
lesser, for purposes of bid evaluation. Local manufacturers would be



- 21 -
expected to bid for certain items of electro-mechanical equipment for both
generating and transmission facilities. Contracts for equipment of less
than US$500,000 would be tendered without prior approval from the Bank.
4.15      The Office of Supply of the Republic of Korea (OSROK) is charged
with the specific responsibility to act as procurement agent for interna-
tional lending institutions for all publicly-owned bodies. The Bank
discussed with the Government the desirability of making KECO responsible
for procurement under the proposed project in view of the long-term goal of
affording KECO with the maximum amount of autonomy, and also because YECO
already has the responsibility for its procurement, both local and foreign.
During negotiations, the Government has given informal assurances that
KECO will be given full responsibility for procurement of the goods to be
financed from the proposed Bank loan.
Disbursements
4.16      Funds from the proposed loan would finance:
(a)  100% of the foreign expenditures for the imported materials and
equipment ;
(b)  100% of ex-factory cost of equipment and materials manufactured
locally; and
(c) 100% of the total cost for consultant's services.
Annex 8 shows estimated loan disbursements, assuming loan effectiveness
in lIarch 1980. The closing date would be December 31, 1984 to allow for
the payment of retention moneys.
Environmental Aspects
4.17      The area surrounding the project site is characterized by
mountainous topography, with the exception of several small valleys which
have been reclaimed by drainage. A small village of 21 houses has been
removed from the work site. The compensation payments were some TTSS3.1
nillion equivalent. The dominating wind directions are from WMI, 14.1% and
ENE, 13.2% of the time which are favorable.
4.18      The design grade coal anticipated for use at the Gojeong station
has a maximum sulphur content of 1% on an air dry basis and the oil to be used
as an alternative fuel would be limited to a maximum sulphur content of 3%
to meet the permitted emission levels imposed by the Government regulations
(Decree No. 9066 of July 1978). Therefore, no flue gas desulfurization
system would be necessary. A precipitator with a 99.5% efficiency level
would be installed at the station between the economizer and the boiler air
preheater (hot precipitator). To allow for the possible use of other fuels
with different characteristics in the future, space has been anticipated for
the installation of SO2 scrubbers for each unit (see Chart 20408).



- 22 -
4.19      A stack height of 150 m from the ground has been proposed.  However,
final selection of the stack height will be determined during the plant design
stage after completion of studies of the meteorological data of the site and
of the characteristics of pollutant dispersion of the area.  KECO has agreed
to submit to the Bank by December 1980 an air quality study and to make its
best efforts to assure that the maximum predicted ground level concentration
of S02 will be below the Bank's recommendations of 100 ug/cu m (annual
arith. mean) and 1,000 ug/cu m (max. 24 hrs).
4.20       Each unit would have a circulating water flow rate of about
20 cu m/s and a condenser temperature rise of 7.30 C.  A preliminary study
has been made by the Korean Institute of Science and Technology (KIST) to
collect data relating to the marine organisms and ecosystems in the ocean,
adjacent to the Gojeong site.  Although no significant impact on the marine
environment is expected from the discharge of hot water, the study is
continuing at different periods of the year to determine the full impact of
the power plant on the marine environment and to provide the basis for the
final design of the circulating water system.
4.21       The amount of ash production for the first two 500 MW units will be
approximately 450,000 tons per year for the grade of coal adopted. The
initial area selected for ash deposit would be of 24.6 ha sufficient for 10
years. A remaining 64 ha in the same area would serve four 500 MW units for
14 years and a 95 ha area, which would be developed later, would serve to
meet the needs of six 500 MW units for a further 14 years. The consultants
have recommended measures to control seepage and storm runoff.
4.22       The Gojeong station will be designed to ensure that the noise level
is kept as far as possible at no more than 55 decibels in compliance with
government regulations. In view of the low noise level required, it is
highly likely that sound enclosures will have to be installed on the boiler
forced draft fans and also sound panels for some miscellaneous yard
equipment.
4.23      No environmental problems with the transmission line are antici-
pated. The transmission line will cross rural areas that are sparsely
populated, with little farming activities and sparse woodlands. Compensation
would be paid for any losses sustained by the owners of cultivated areas and
for the use of rights-of-way. Radio and television interference levels
would be minimal because of the adoption of four bundle conductors per phase.
Geology and Seismicity
4.24      Geological and foundation conditions of the Gojeong site and
surrounding area have been studied by a local consultant (Sambo Geologic
Company, Ltd.).  The rock at the site is considered good enough to provide
a very acceptable foundation for all of the plant block structures.
Additional soil and foundation investigations will be done in the vicinity
of the docks. A seismic refraction survey has indicated that about two
thirds of the excavation will require blasting.



- 23 -
4.25      Several small tremors have occurred in the vicinity of the site
proposed for the project. The consultant considers, on the basis of the
seismic history of the region, (corresponding to intensity levels of less than
or equal to IV on the modified Mercalli scale) that the site is appropriate
for the erection of the station.
Risks
4.26      KECO is experienced in the construction of power-plants; Bechtel
is well known internationally and has good experience in Korea (Bechtel
is also the consultant for design and engineering for nuclear power units
5 and 6). No difficulties are expected in fuel supply or other operational
aspects. The project risks are no greater than would normally be expected
with other developments of this nature.
Completion Report
4.27      In order to inform the Bank about the results of the project, and
the lessons learned during its execution, a completion report will be pre-
pared following the closing date of the loan. KECO has agreed to prepare a
report on the execution and initial operation of the project, its cost and
the benefits derived and to be derived from it and of its performance of the
obligations under the Loan Agreement.

5. FINANCE
Past Performance and Present Position
5.01       Following the oil crisis in 1973, KECO made some structural
revisions to its electricity rates which increased revenue by about 6%.
However, it did not increase rates significantly until February 1, 1974 when
a 30% increase was introduced. In fact, it was not until December 1974 that
action was taken to try to recover the increased costs of fuel, which in the
case of fuel oil had tripled in cost since October 1973. As a result rates
were raised in December 1974 a further 42% except for domestic consumers
whose share of the market was only about 12%. Unfortunately the December
1974 increase was made too late in the year to make up for the loss in
revenue from the higher fuel costs and KECO's revenues barely covered its
operating costs. The rate of return on average net fixed assets and working
capital in 1974 was only 1%. At this rate of return, KECO's net income was
not sufficient to meet its debt service commitments.
5.02       Since the end of 1974 rate increases have been greater than the
increases in costs and as a result KECO's financial performance has improved
significantly.  In 1977, its rate of return/I reached 12.1% and in 1978 it was
11.3%, quite good returns. With these rates of return, KECO has been able
to meet its debt service commitments adequately (1 1/2 times coverage) and
finance on average, in the last two years, about 14% of its capital
expansion. KECO's financial statements are shown in Annexes 9, 10 and 11.
5.03      While KECO's financial performance has improved considerably since
1974, the results obtained need to be analyzed further to determine what its
performance would have been if its accounting had been done on a consistent
basis with that used in 1974. Firstly, effective January 1977, KECO sus-
pended the annual revaluation of its assets following the Government 's
decision to buy out the interests of KECO's private shareholders. This was
done to prevent further distribution of revaluation surpluses tco the private
shareholders which were needed for financing KECO's expansion. If KECO had
continued to revalue its assets in 1977 and 1978, the rate of return in
these years would have been lower than shown in Annex 9 by 0.6% in 1977 and
1.1% in 1978.
5.04       Secondly, KECO revised its depreciation policy in 1976 to reduce the
average life of its plant in service from about 30 years to about 18 years
because the rates in use up to 1976 were not considered to reflect realistic-
ally the useful life of the plant in view of the rapid technical changes in
the industry. This change in depreciation policy reduced KECO's operating
income and rate of return in 1977 and 1978.  If the depreciation rates had
not been changed in 1976, the rates of return would have been about 2.5%
higher than previously mentioned in the following two years.
/1 On average net fixed assets and working capital.



- 25 -
5.05      Thirdly, the audit reports for each year reviewed (1974 through
1978) contain a qualification which indicates net income has been overstated
because of inadequate provisions for employees retirement benefits. In 1977
and 1978 this has resulted in overstatement of the rates of return by about
1% each year. The problem lies with Government which until recently, has not
permitted KECO to make adequate budget provision for these commitments. The
Government has now arranged with KECO that the provisions will be adjusted
to eliminate the deficits by the end of 1981.
5.06      From the above analysis, it can be concluded that if KECO had
continued to revalue its assets after 1976, made adequate provision for
employees retirement benefits and maintained the pre-1976 depreciation rates
it would have achieved rates of return in 1977 and 1978 about the same as
mentioned in para. 5.02. However, since these changes do not alter the
volume of internal sources of funds, the level of self-financing is not
affected.
5.07      Over the past five years, KECO's debt/equity ratio has improved
from 70/30 at the end of 1974 to 60/40 at the end of 1978. This improvement
in its financial structure would have been greater if it had continued to
revalue its assets after 1976. The debt/equity ratio would have been about
54/46 in 1978. KECO has made new issues of shares annually to its
shareholders and now has issued 429 million shares of its authorized share
capital of 600 million shares. Up to the end of 1976 KECO had made bonus
issues of stock to its existing shareholders from the surplus arising from
revaluation of assets. The Government share of the revaluation surplus and
dividends due on its shares have been retained and reinvested in KECO thus
helping to strengthen its financial structure. KECO's existing level of
debt to equity will support its plan to borrow a substantial part of its
investment requirements in the next few years provided it can maintain an
adequate level of earnings and debt service coverage.
5.08      The source of KECO's borrowings has changed slightly since 1974.
About 60% of its long-term debt is now from foreign sources compared with
about 50% in 1974. About 7% of its long-term debt is being provided in
foreign currency by local banks; principally the Korean Foreign Exchange Bank,
38% by foreign commercial loans and 15% from Government guaranteed loans
principally from USA, Canada and the United Kingdom. Whereas some years ago
much of KECO's borrowing was on concessional terms, it is now having to pay
the U.S. prime or the London interbank rate (LIBOR) plus a margin of from
1.75% to 2.25%. The average interest rate on all borrowings in 1978 was
almost 9%. Although the LIBOR and prime rates are much higher (being in the
15-16% range), KECO is now obtaining commercial bank loans with margins below
1%; indicative of the high regard which the banks have for KECO's financial
position and prospects. With commercial bank rates now so high, export
credits and multilateral sources like the Bank and ADB represent very



- 26 -
attractive sources of finance for KECO at the present time.  This is
especially so given the high cost of local currency loans in Yorea. Loans
from the Korean Development Bank, KECO's main source of local currency
loans, are expensive with interest rates around 15% last June, 1979.
Because of the high interest rates on local borrowing, KECO has stopped
issuing local bonds and plans to repay in 1979 all bonds outstanding at the
end of 1978.

5.09      KECO's forecast of sources and applications of funds for the cons-
truction of the Gojeong Project (1979-84) is given in Annex 11. A condensed

- 27 -
5.10       It will be seen from the above plan that KECO will require about
9,011 billion won (US$18.6 billion) to finance the cost of construction
(including interest charged to construction) and increased working capital
through 1984.  About 84% of this amount will be borrowed, 3' is expected to
be obtained from increases in capital and about 13% from internal sources
after meeting debt service obligations of 3,581 billion won (US$7.4 billion).
Considering the size of the proposed construction program which will
increase the value of KECO's gross plant in service by 1984 more than 4
times at current prices and the higher costs of borrowing, the plan is a
reasonable one. Critical to achievement of this plan will be the
Government's willingness to approve tariff increases sufficient to maintain
KECO's creditworthiness and to meet increased costs especially for fuel and
debt service.
5.11       Athough KECO's borrowing is large, it does not expect to have
difficulty obtaining the funds it needs for financing the program. The
foreign costs of many of the larger projects e.g. Kori 2 and TJolseong nuclear
plants and Asan and Samcheonpo thermal units have already been provided
through suppliers' export credits arrangements. KECO's first foreign
Eurobond issue is planned to be offered in the latter part of 1979. If it
is successful, it is likely to be followed by others for larger amounts than
the US$50 million each year provided in the plan. Other foreign borrowings
will be obtained from the Korean Foreign Fxchange Bank and foreign commer-
cial banks. Local borrowings may continue to be more difficult and more
expensive to obtain than foreign loans because of the limited volume of
local funds available. However, KECO is expected to seek public loans
through the Korean Development Bank and also its National Investment Fund.
KECO has agreed to submit its annual budget and borrowing plans to the Bank
for review and comment within two months of the commencement of each fiscal
year. The purpose of this review would be to encourage KECO not to incur
excessive short-term debt and to minimize its borrowing from comrmercial and
other sources at high market rates. Government has agree to continue to
reinvest any dividends on its shares in KECO.
Future Financial Position and Covenants
5.12       KECO's financial plan prepared in March 1979 has been reviewed by
the Bank and revised to take account of recently introduced conservation
measures and the impact of inflation especially on operating costs, debt
service and construction expenditures. The financial forecasts and the
assumptions used are shown in Annexes 9, 10 and 11.
5.13       The forecasts show that KECO could achieve rates of return on its
average net fixed assets revalued annually and working capital of 14.4% in
1980 rising to 15.8% in 1983 before beginning a gradual decline to 11.2% in
1986 when the Gojeong project and the other major plant in the program will
have been commissioned. This level of performance is equivalent to a 9%



- 28 -
rate of return on KECO's rate base (KECO's rate includes 100% of average
work in progress). It will enable KECO to maintain debt service coverage of
at least 1.2 times; a reasonable level considering the expected high costs
of borrowing. The debt/equity ratio should continue to be adequate and will
enable KECO to attract further large-scale borrowings at close to market
rates. At the same time it would contribute a reasonable portion, about 15%
of its own funds towards investment needs. KECO is expected to maintain its
very tight control over the level of working capital and especially its good
record with respect to collection of electricity accounts which has in the
past been equivalent to about one month sales. In fact, during three of the
last five years, it has operated with a current ratio of less than one and
the forecasts show that this situation will continue.
5.14      In para. 5.04 mention was made of the change in KIECO's depreciation
policy in 1976 and the fact that the shorter plant lives adopted had reduced
KECO's rate of return performance in 1977 and 1978 by about 2.5% in each of
those years. By using the depreciation rates based on an average plant life
of 18 years, the rate of return shown in the financial forecasts are similarly
lower than they would have been if KECO had maintained the previous plant
lives averaging 30 years. KECO's pre-1976 depreciation rates were based on
the estimated useful life of the plant and the nLew rates were adopted
ostensibly to take account of expected shorter plant lives because of
technical changes but actually to increase cash availability. Taiwan Power
Company which has a similar power system to Korea's, depreciates its plant
at rates which average 30 years. Although KECO's current policy results in
accelerated depreciation of its plant, it appears to be an appropriate strat-
egy for KECO to adopt, considering its large requirements of capital, the
inflationary environment in which it is functioning and the fact that its
expansion program would tend to increase its asset base despite the acceler-
ated depreciation rate. Since we expect it will serve to increase cash
availability, the Bank should not object to it provided the financial
effects are disclosed in the notes which form part of the companies audited
financial statements.
5.15      Since KECO and Government have never established fEinancial perfor-
mance targets to assist the formulation of its annual and long-term plans,
KECO's financial performance has fluctuated according to Government's willing-
ness to approve rate increases. Although KECO is not expecting to have dif-
ficulty obtaining funds for its program (para. 5.11), this situation does not
assure the Bank and other lenders that KECO's future financial performance
will be adequate to maintain a strong financial position. At negotiations,
KECO and Government agreed to take all necessary steps to provide revenue
to produce an annual rate of return on KECO's rate base after annual
revaluation of gross fixed assets and accumulated depreciation sufficient
to cover operating expenses including taxes, to provide adequate maintenance
and depreciation to meet debt service payments and finance a reasonable
proportion of investment requirements. KECO's rate base would be used for
this calculation since it is well defined and simpler for KECO to use.



- 29 -
KECO has also agreed to maintain rates for depreciation of its fixed assets
in accordance with accounting practices acceptable to the Bank.
5.16       7<,r the purposes of the rate of return agreement, KECO and
Government gave assurances in a supplemental letter that tariffs would be
maintained sufficient to provide a return of at least 9%.
5.17       In order for KECO to meet the 9% rate of return objective, it
would need to increase its tariff about 21% in 1980, 12% in 1981 and 6-7%
thereafter through 1986 based on the assumptions contained in the Bank's
forecasts. Accordingly, if local inflation is higher than 9% in 1980 and
8% between 1981-86 or oil prices increase more than 6% annually, higher
tariff rates would be necessary. KECO and Government gave additional
assurances in its supplemental letter on the rate of return to the effect
that they would:
(a) pursue their policy of passing on increases in fuel cost to
consumers;
(b) modify KECO's investment program to correspond to changes in
power demand;
(c) minimize operating costs;
(d) minimize short-term borrowings which involve high interest
rates, and;
(e) seek additional equity contributions from Government to
meet the rate of return in 1980 and future years.
5.18       In 1979, KECO's rates were increased about 22% and as a result is
expected to earn a rate of return on its rate base of about 6.8%. Although
KECO is expected to be able to maintain an adequate level of debt service
coverage if its achieves a 9% rate of return, KECO and Government have agreed
to review the agreed rate of return target whenever KECO's debt service
coverage falls below 1.20.

6. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
Justification
6.01      The Gojeong project, which is part of the national expansion
program analyzed in paragraph 3.09, is the least cost alternative for
meeting part of the increased demand of the interconnected system from 1984.
Gojeong will be the third thermoelectric plant included in the expansion
program that will consume imported bituminous coal. The cost of the fuel
per KWh would be USC 1.4 for coal, and US( 2.4 for Bunker C, at the prices
in effect on January 1, 1979.
6.02      The project would contribute 8.2% of the system's overall net
generation requirements (64,643 GWh) in 1984 and its output would vary
between a maximum of 6,174 GWh in 1985, with a plant capacity factor of
73.8%, and minimum of 4,100 GWh in the year 2008. The average plant
capacity factor for the useful life of the plant (25 years) would be 56.3%,
according to the consultants' study. Although the investment cost in
Gojeong would be approximately 30% higher than that of a similar plant
designed exclusively to burn fuel oil, the unit generation cost of the
latter would be 23% higher in present value; at a discount rate equivalent
to the opportunity cost of capital in Korea, which is assumed to be around
14%.
6.03      A very important benefit resulting from the project is the incor-
poration into Korea of advanced technology in the construction of heavy
electro-mechanical equipment, since part of this equipment is to be manufac-
ured locally in association with foreign manufacturers. Another benefit is
that Korean industry will be rendered capable, in a very short time, of
handling a substantial part of the sector's domestic requirements, and
possibly later to participate in the international market on competitive
terms.
Return on Investment
6.04      The internal rate of return on the Gojeong project has been calcu-
lated as the discount rate at which the present value of estimated costs and
benefits (at constant prices) attributable to the project during its useful
life are equal. The chain of costs comprises capital expenditures, includ-
ing a portion of the investment in expansion of the distribution network,
and the fixed and variable operating costs. The benefits include only the
revenues from the sale of the incremental energy produced by the project at
final consumer level. The average selling price of energy is that in effect
on January 1, 1979: W 27.7 per KWh, plus 10% value-added tax, reduced by
the standard conversion factor for electricity of 0.89. Under these condi-
tions (Annex 13, 14 and 15) the rate of return on the project is 20.1%. A
sensitivity analysis shows that if the capital cost and operating costs were



- 31 -
10% higher and the income from sales were reduced by a similar percentage.,
the project rate of return would be 14.8%, which is practically the same as
the opportunity cost of capital in Korea.
6.05      Although the rates structure and current price levels for the
different consumer categories do not satisfactorily represent the economic
cost of the electricity service at the different voltages, the present
average price of the service roughly reflects the marginal cost per KWh over
the long term. The rates study currently being carried out by KDI (para.
1.26) is designed to evaluate the marginal cost of electricity in the long
term, so that the charge to the consumer will eventually reflect the real
cost of the service with a view to obtaining an optimal rate of development
in the sector.
7. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
7.01      During negotiations KECO has agreed to:
(a) submit to the Bank no later than June 30, 1981 a revised power
development program for the period to 1991 (para. 1.22);
(b) submit a copy of the EDF/KDI marginal cost pricing study to the
Bank by December 31, 1980 for review and comment and consider
application of marginal cost based electricity tariffs (para 1-26);
(c) engage consultants under terms of reference acceptable to the Bank
to make recommendations on the best form of management and organi-
zation for KECO by December 31, 1981 (para. 2.04);
(d) submit its annual financial statements audited by San Kyong and Co
or other independent auditors satisfactory to the Bank within 3
months of the end of its fiscal year (para. 2.11);
(e) submit to the Bank an air quality study, by December 1980, and to
make its best efforts to assure that the maximum predicted
ground-level concentration of S02 will be below the Bank's
recommendations (para. 4.19);
(f) prepare and furnish to the Bank a completion report no later than
6 months after the closing date of the loan (para. 4.27);
(g) submit within two months of the beginning of each fiscal year
its annual budget and borrowing plans to the Bank for review and
comment (para. 5.11);
(h) maintain rates for depreciation of its fixed assets in accordance
with accounting practices acceptable to the Bank (para. 5.15).



- 32 -
7.02      During negotiations, Government has agreed to:
(a)  review and consult with the Bank on marginal cost based tariffs
and implement changes agreed between KECO and the Bank (para. 1.26)-
(b)  take appropriate steps by June 30, 1981 to ensure KECO's ability
to recruit and retain qualified staff (para. 2.05);
(c)  allocate the main responsibility for the preparation of the elec-
tric power development program to KECO (para. 3.11);
(d)  meet any shortfall in funds required for completion of the project
(para. 4.10)- and
(e)  continue to reinvest any dividends on its shares in KECO
(para. 5.11).
7.03      During negotiations KECO and Government agreed that:
(a)  tariffs would be maintained sufficient to provide a rate of
return of at least Q% (para. 5.16); and
(b)  they would review the rate or return target whenever debt service
coverage falls below 1.20 (para. 5.18).
7.04      With the above agreements, the project is suitable for a Bank loan
of US$115 million to KECO with the guarantee of the Government of Korea.
Since the project is expected to be commissioned by 1984, the standard terms
for a Bank loan to Korea of 17 years including a 4-year grace period, would
be appropriate.

KOREA
GOJEONG POWER PROJECT
Summary of Integrated Energy Policy Objectives and Options
UNDP/IBRD Korea Energy Policy Study
A. Integrated Energy Policy Objectives and Options
1. Energy Demand Policies: Conservation -- The Efficient Use of Energy
(a) General: Korea will wish to restrict energy demand to a reasonable
minimum that reflects efficient use of energy in government and
productive sectors, and degrees of austerity and efficiency in
consuming sectors appropriate to Korea's defense and economic
situation.
(b) Productive Sectors: Industry, agriculture, transportation, commerce
and other services including government.
The leading consideration in productive sectors must be
efficiency if Korea is to compete in foreign markets and to raise
production and income levels. Efficiency in energy use will mean
more to Korea as the real cost of energy rises in the years ahead.
Korea will wish to maximize energy efficiency through use of energy-
saving technology, equipment, products, processes and economic
structure.
(c) Consuming Sectors: Housing, clothing, personal transportation,
restaurants, entertainment, etc.
The consuming sectors face sharply the dilemma of energy policy
seeking rapid increases in personal incomes. The ultimate purpose
of development and rising incomes is to improve the well-being of
the Korean people. But austerity is an essential and important
means to economic growth. Thus it is a matter of judgment how far
austerity must go at any particular time.  At present the rapid
growth of recent years is producing a boom in domestic consumer
demand. Government must deal with the central dilemma involved,
especially with respect to restricting the spread of private
automobiles.



- 34 -
ANNEX I
Page 2 of 6
2. Energy Supply Policies
(a) General: Korean energy supply policy will inevitably be to meet the
nation's needs as defined by demand policy. Supply policy will seek
to meet needs continuously, securely and at least cost. Policy
will relate to the degree of emphasis on one or another of these
three objectives. If security and continuity of supply seem most
urgent, then Korea will have to meet whatever costs are implied
by these choices. If minimum short-run or long-run cost is deemed
crucial, then some supply security may have to be sacrificed.
(b)  Optimum mix of fuels.  We can accept the fact that the proportion
of oil among the fuels consumed in Korea is too high and rising.
Because oil may at any moment be unavailable from one or more
sources, Korea has already adopted policies to slow down and, in
time, to reverse this rising trend.
The prospective increases in oil prices constitute an
additional factor in favor of a reduced share of oil. Still, the
prices of other fuels are also likely to rise. Coal, both domestic
and imported, is cheap enough to be very desirable as a partial
substitute for oil now and to a substantial extent on a continuing
basis, even after it ultimately reaches 75% of the price of oil.
Korea is also moving rapidly into nuclear energy, partly for
the purpose of reducing dependence upon oil.  And Korea is
already taking early steps to make use of tidal and solar power
and other new sources of energy.
The optimum mix of these different fuels will depend partly
on estimates of the prospective cost, availability and desirabi-
lity of each fuel and partly on the relative importance given to
price, security, environmental problems and other policy
objectives. Judgment of market trends for the longer run will
be a vital part of the choosing of the most advantageous mix.
(c)  Optimum mix of sources and channels for obtaining fuels.  Until
the time in the 21st century when solar energy and other new
sources reverse the trend, Korea must rely increasingly on imported
fuels. Whatever the fuel mix, Korea can improve its situation also
by diversifying sources from which imports come, and the channels
that bring them to Korea.
Geographical diversification of sources is possible to a
limited extent. There is also some room for choice about private
firms or government channels for buying oil and coal. Korea would
not want to cut itself off from the supply networks of the inter-
national oil companies, but could increase its security of supply
by dealing with several companies and possibly also through the



-35 -                              ANNEX I
Page 3 of 6
activities of the planned Korea Petroleum Development Corporation
on government-to-government deals. Although this last approach
has yet to prove itself in terms of obtaining more assured supply
(and at lower cost).
Likewise, different coal producers are available to sell to
Korea, and Korea may well carry its coal purchases in Korean ships.
3.  Energy Management Policies.
(a) General. It must be the main purpose of policy concerning energy
management to assure that Korea meets its energy needs and
objectives as effectively as care, forethought and human effort can
make possible, in the light of circumstances, some of which are
domestic but many of which are international in origin. Where not
all objectives can be satisfactorily met, management policies must
see to it that sacrifices are made in matters of lower priority,
and that the total sacrifice is as small and equitable as possible,
under the circumstances.
(b) Supply: Contingency planning and preparation:
(i)  Emergency Planning:  Korea is far too dependent on energy
imports, and these imports, particularly of oil, are far too
susceptible to decisions of producers. Prudence requires
that Korea have plans for emergencies resulting from inter-
ruptions to the flow of oil imports. Since there is no
possibility that in a major interruption of oil supply Korea
could procure and use substitute fuels to any significant
extent, the two requirements are an emergency stockpile and a
plan to limit consumption during the emergency.
An oil stockpile equal to 90 days current demand should
be created by the end of 1980.
(ii)  Plans for dealing with longer-lasting shortages.  If an energy
crunch arrives in the late 1980's, it is likely to be mainly
an oil shortage that cannot be made up by other fuels. One
consequence of such a shortage would appear in the form of
very high prices. As another consequence, the shortage may
threaten so many interests that other countries may prevent
Korea from procuring at any price more than a fraction of its
oil needs.
This is the principal danger that leads Korea to take
major steps to reduce reliance on oil: diversifying to coal,
nuclear energy, and possibly imported gas while pressing
development of solar, tidal and other new sources of energy.
If such a severe shortage loomed, Korea would want to press



- 36 -
ANNEX 1
Page 4 of 6
even harder than before to reduce non-essential energy
consumption to a minimum. At such a time, Korea would benefit
from all preparations that facilitate continuation of the most
important productive activities for export and domestic use,
and for residences, transportation and other equipment that
used only minimal amounts of energy and relied on fuels that
might be available during the oil shortage.
Among the steps that can be taken beforehand are long-term
contracts for supply of fuels, especially of coal and uranium,
perhaps gas, and possibly accompanied by some stockpiling of
uranium ore or enriched fuel against possible interruptions of
supply despite long-term contracts. The oil stockpile referred
to could, with a severe rationing regime, stretch supply to
some nine months, assuming no oil imports whatsoever.
(c)  Environment protection policy:  As the Korean economy grows,
threats to the environment from energy users multiply. Already
air pollution is an evident problem in Seoul and to a lesser
extent in other cities.
Policy to protect the environment relates to energy policy,
but involves many other matters as well. One of the earliest
tasks is to evaluate the environmental effects of particular
primary commercial fuels, or combinations of them, and then to
attempt to define both the economic/social consequences of a
government granting priority to one or another and on which income
levels the burden falls. Government must also approve and inspect
the installation of pollution-abatement measures.
(d)  Energy data.  Korea needs a range of energy data, reliable and
current, for management and policy formulation. It
will not do to have competing sources offering different data
about the same matters. It is recommended the creation of a
Central Energy Statistical Office (CESO), to be located in MER, to
serve all users in Korea, both public and private.
(e)  Energy research and development:  Effective energy policy and
efficient energy use require much knowledge and technology that have
not yet appeared in Korea, and nowhere else either.   Consequently,
Korea and other countries must put a large amount of effort into
energy R&D.
For the near future what Korea should do will, in many matters,
not include basic scientific research. Korea's limited number of
qualified personnel in these matters should concentrate on develop-
ment work, bringing to their country and adapting to its circum-
stances and needs scientific discoveries and inventions and
developments originating elsewhere.



- 37 -                            ANNEX 1
page 5 of 6
(f) Energy Pricing Policy:  Korea has gone far toward energy pricing
according to long-run marginal costs.  But coal is still heavily
subsidized.  It is time for all energy prices to conform to the
full-cost standard.
(g) Institutions and procedures for effective energy policy.  Korea's
institutions and procedures for making and carrying out energy
policy must reflect Korea's answers to the questions of demand,
supply and managemment mentioned in earlier parts of this chapter.
(i)  One instrument that should be considered is a review of the
energy implications of proposed major policies, programs and
projects. Korea needs to know the energy costs and commitments
implied by new factories, industrial estates, economic programs,
or economic growth policies.
A means of enforcing such reviews would be to require for build-
ing permits, operating licenses, a project or a program or a policy,
approval of an energy impact statement. Before approving the
proposed action, MER (and other concerned institutions) could discuss
the accuracy of the statement and the appropriateness of the proposed
project, etc., from the point of view of energy, withholding approval
from proposals that would commit undue amounts of energy use or in-
appropriate kinds of energy use, or would have undesirable environ-
mental consequences from the energy consumed.
(ii)  The Ministry of Energy and Resources needs to develop into a
strong and expert agency, as its leadership is fully aware.
But no matter how good MER becomes, much of its work will
involve coordination with other ministries, and with business
and public organizations. Thus MER needs to develop also a
considerable capacity for negotiating with other ministries
and official bodies, developing allies and finding ways to
persuade reluctant officials, businessmen and others of the
necessity of efficient energy use. No law, decree or
organization chart will substitute for such skills and steady
cooperation with others.
(iii)  Preparation of an annual, comprehensive National Energy Audit
which depicts progress/failures to meet objectives in
conservation, domestic and foreign supply, the GNP/energy
growth ratio, etc., and reasons therefore. Such an exercise
affords the nation a means of better ensuring energy needs
will be met. Many countries attempt such but their efforts
lack comprehensiveness and objectivity. In Korea's case, the
nation has an opportunity to serve itself through such a
rigorous exercise and to set an example for others.

C. Priorities
In summary, to improve upon the Ministry's ability to cope with the
requirements of energy policy formulation and implementation, priority should
be given to:
1. The training of personnel in all aspects of energy sources -
domestic and foreign (coal, oil, gas, etc.) including energy
policy and planning, data collection and analysis.
2. The creation of a Central Energy Statistical Office.
3. A reconsideration of energy pricing policies.
4. Strengthening environmental/pollution policies.
5. Creation of an emergency supply program.
6. An Energy Impact Evaluation program to determine if a particular
investment meets conservation policies and has the best choice
of fuel.
7. A rigorous examination of all the implications in Korea's
nuclear planning, including costs, manpower and demands upon
"localization", waste disposal and prospects for a full fuel
cycle.
8. Strengthening the competence and autonomy of KECO.
9. Attention to limitations on domestic coal and substitutes for
residential heating; preparation for increased coal imports.
10. Review of research institutes' strengths and weaknesses:
programs, personnel, funding and assimilation of results into
energy sectors.
11. Annual preparation of a National Energy Audit.

Assumptions Adopted for Financial Forecasts
The following assumptions were adopted when preparing KECO's
financial forecasts:
(a) Income Statements
(i) Electricity Sales are based on KECO's March 1979 "Long-Range
Power Development and Financial Plan" with allowance for some
reduced growth as a result of energy conservation measures
taken in June 1979 (para. 3.07).
(ii) Operating Revenues have been obtained by assuming electricity
rates will be increased each year so as to earn a rate of
return on average net fixed assets, working capital and 100%
of work-in-progress of 9%.
(iii) Fuel. KECO's constant price estimates have been increased 6%
per annum through 1986 except in 1979 when prices were assumed
to have been increased 50% during the second half of the year,
following large increases in international oil prices in the
first half of the year.
(iv) Purchased power costs are based on KECO's constant price esti-
mates (March 1979 Plan) of purchases escalated according to
estimates of domestic inflation in Korea of 1979 14% first
half of the year and 10% for the second half; 1980 9% and
1981-86 8%.
(v) Personnel Expenses (including Accrued Retirement) costs are
based on KECO's constant price estimates (March 1979 Plan) and
have been escalated according to estimates of domestic infla-
tion in Korea (previously mentioned - see Purchased Power).
Number of employees, excluding construction staff assumed by

(vi)  Maintenance and Other Expenses have been escaidted using
estimated domestic inflation in Korea (para. 4 Purchased
Power).
(vii) Depreciation Expense calculations have been based on KECO's
existing depreciation rates i.e.: assuming an average life of
18 years. Additions have been depreciated at half rates in the
year in which they are first taken up as part of assets in
service.
(viii)  Tax calculations assume the existing defense tax which is 10%
of net income will be retained during the period of the
forecasts.
(ix) Interest Expense has been based on the average rate of interest
used by KECO for its financial plan plus escalation of about
2% p.a. The rates actually used for the forecasts were:

ing long-term debt in each respective year.
(x) Interest Charged to Construction. Based on KECO's financial
plan but escalated 2% p.a.
(b) Balance Sheet
(M) Gross Fixed Assets in Service, Accumulated Depreciation have
been revalued in 1977, 9.3% and in 1978 11.3% in accordance
with the Korea Wholesale Price Index for all commodities. In
1979 gross fixed assets and accumulated depreciation were
revalued 12% and thereafter at 10% annually.
