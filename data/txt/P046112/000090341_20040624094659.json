The lessons learned indicate that preparing\n            for first-time sector investments in a context of profound\n            educational transformation requires further understanding of\n            the issues relating to: (i) the adoption of new\n            institutional and pedagogical policies; (ii) the structure\n            and management of the education sector; (iii) education\n            financing and expenditures; (iv) internal and external\n            efficiency (relevance); (v) the quality and equity of\n            education; and (vi) the appropriateness of project design\n            and targeting criteria. From the very beginning, project\n            preparation and implementation must take into consideration\n            the implications of the decentralization model for the\n            various national and local actors, including the respective\n            spheres of authority and responsibility. The Municipal\n            Education Secretariat (SEM) learned that the provision of\n            technical assistance by external entities like universities\n            was effective in building capacity and empowering schools\n            and the community. Depoliticization of the resource\n            allocation process in the education sector alters the\n            investment pattern of the state in a positive manner. The\n            project encouraged the municipality to think of education as\n            a key factor in local development. It is possible to\n            effectively develop the local capacity to plan and formulate\n            education plans, and to assign financial resources in\n            accordance with the content of those plans. Project\n            implementation improves when good practices are disseminated\n            and cross-fertilization is encouraged among provinces\n            undergoing similar education transformation. The\n            participation of all stakeholders not only protects the\n            project from political and economic instabilities, but also\n            reduces opposition from specific groups. An information\n            system for educational statistics should be regarded as a\n            prerequisite for the design of any education project, after\n            first ensuring full consistency with the national system.\n            Carrying out an impact evaluation study has many positive\n            effects. It is important to have a well-designed and fully\n            operational monitoring and evaluation system in place at the\n            early stages of the project cycle."}, "docdt": "2004-06-04T00:00:00Z"}
