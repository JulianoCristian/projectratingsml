Re:
Loan 4242-CO (Pasto Education Project)
Amendments to Loan Agreement
Dear Sirs: 
1.
This is in reference to our discussions in respect of changes required by the 
Loan Agreement between International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (the 
Bank) and Municipio de Pasto (the Borrower) for the above Project, dated December 15, 
1997, as amended as of June 18, 1998 (the Loan Agreement), guaranteed by the Republic 
of Colombia (the Guarantor) under a Guarantee Agreement also dated December 15, 1997 
entered into between the Guarantor and the Bank (the Guarantee Agreement). Such 
changes will be made taking into account the experience gained by virtue of certain 
developments which have taken place in the carrying out of the Project. Thus, we are 
pleased to propose the following amendments to the Loan Agreement:
(a)
The date in Section 2.03 of the Loan Agreement is hereby postponed to 
June 30, 2003.
(b)
The Table in paragraph 1 of Schedule I to the Loan Agreement, is hereby 
replaced by the table set forth in the Annex to this letter.
(c)
The Description of the Project set forth in Schedule 2 to the Loan 
Agreement  is hereby amended as follows:
(i)
the phrase in Part A 4 (b) of the Project which currently reads 
"(b) 'five small Schools to replace existing Selected Schools with 
safety problems;'" is hereby amended to read as follows: "'up to 
10 small Schools to replace existing Selected Schools with safety 
problems;'";
(ii)
the phrase in Part B 1 (a) of the Project which currently reads  
"', and the Principals or Directors of the corresponding Leader 
Schools,'" is hereby amended to read as follows: "',and the 
Principals or Directors of the corresponding Schools,'"; and 
(iii)
the phrase in Part C 1 of the Project which currently reads ' 
"aimed at creating 12 Redes within the territory of the Borrower'" 
is hereby amended to read as follows: '"aimed at creating, within 
the territory of the Borrower, a number of Redes not lower than 
12, so as to allow the Borrower to place itself in a better 
position to attend education needs of children forced to resettle 
to such territory from neighboring towns and villages,'".
2.
As it has become clear in the discussions referred to in paragraph 1 of this 
letter, in order to consolidate past achievements under the Project and to bring to 
fruition before the Closing Date what remains to be done under the Project, it shall 
be necessary for the Borrower to prepare an operational plan for the future execution 
of the Project. Such plan shall reflect the range of selectivity for the different 
Page  2
activities and interventions yet to be carried out under the Project, as well as the 
selection criteria, and to ensure that those activities and interventions which are 
chosen, are simple and can be carried out with agility. The above amendments shall 
become effective on the date the Bank notifies the Borrower that the said operational 
plan is satisfactory to the Bank.
3.
It should also be noted that the Bank and the Borrower have agreed that the 
execution of the operational plan referred to in 2 above shall be helped by the 
changes to be introduced in the Manuals (as the term is defined in Section 1.02 (h) of 
the Loan Agreement), as requested by the Bank pursuant to Section 3.01 (c) of the Loan 
Agreement, and which the Borrower has accepted to make by means of Dr. Jorge Idrobo’s 
letter to the Bank, on that matter, dated April 16, 2001. 
If you agree with the aforesaid, please signify said agreement by dating and 
signing the attached duplicate of this letter of behalf of the Borrower, as its 
authorized representative under Section 7.01 of this Agreement, by having H.E. the 
Guarantor’s Minister of  Finance and Public Credit signifying his agreement on behalf 
of the Guarantor, as its authorized representative under Section 3.01 of the Guarantee 
Agreement, by also dating and signing the aforesaid duplicate, and by returning to us 
said duplicate duly countersigned.
Sincerely
