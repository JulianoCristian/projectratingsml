follows: outcomes\n            were satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was low\n            or negligible, the Bank performance was satisfactory, and\n            the Borrower performance was also satisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned included: facilitators have an important role\n            providing communities with project information on processes,\n            activities and simple rules for decision making and\n            procurement. However, ensuring proper selection and\n            recruitment of facilitators based on qualifications,\n            disbursal of timely and agreed remuneration, provision of\n            timely training and refresher courses, routine performance\n            evaluations with rewards and punishments are all critical in\n            ensuring effective and accountable facilitation. Block\n            grants provided to communities as direct transfers from the\n            national level can be effective in reaching target\n            beneficiaries, reducing potential leakage, and accelerating\n            rapid disbursement. However, this needs to be accompanied by\n            creating and strengthening a participatory planning and\n            decision making mechanism at the local level to enable\n            communities to decide on their priorities, make necessary\n            allocation; plan and design sub projects and execute them.\n            Training and facilitation to communities in particular on\n            financial management including basic accounting and book\n            keeping, procurement, information disclosure, monitoring and\n            evaluation and operations and maintenance, is extremely\n            important. Grassroots monitoring is more effective in\n            reducing theft when community members have substantial\n            private stakes in the outcome, but less effective for public goods."}, "docdt": "2008-08-11T00:00:00Z"}
