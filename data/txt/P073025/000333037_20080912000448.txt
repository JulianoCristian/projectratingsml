F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)

Objectives of the proposed four year project are: (i) support participatory planning and development
management in villages; (ii) support a broad construction of social and economic infrastructure in poor
villages; and (iii) strengthen local formal and informal institutions by making them more inclusive,
accountable, and effective at meeting villagers' self -identified development needs. The project is a
continuation of a longer-term participatory program for poverty reduction that includes the two Village
Infrastructure Projects and the first Kecamatan Development Project.

Revised Project Development Objectives (as approved by original approving authority)



                                                   v

On April 15, 2005, the project agreement was amended (approved by the acting Country Director at the
time) to add funds specifically to help respond with post-disaster reconstruction. The project's
development objectives were not changed; the additional funds simply allowed the project to expand
coverage in disaster-affected areas and cover more villages. The "open menu" was not changed but
explicit approval was provided for the use of project funds for emergency social needs. The project cycle
and procedures were not amended, but flexibility was allowed to shorten planning and speed up
disbursement.

1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design
(This section is descriptive, taken from other documents, e.g., PAD/ISR, not evaluative)

1.1 Context at Appraisal
(Brief summary of country and sector background, rationale for Bank assistance)

KDP's roots lie in Indonesia's long history of using central government's spatially targeted transfer
programs to reduce poverty. As early as the 1980s, GOI began promoting block grant transfers to
subnational administrations. Many of these came with fairly tight strings attached on how the funds could
be allocated, but these were increasingly relaxed, especially a number of donor-funded pilot programs
intended to promote deconcentrated management in provinces and districts. Given GOI's ongoing interest
in poverty reduction, several large pilots were started in the early 1990s that used participatory planning
and block grant transfers to help villagers provide economic services such as water-supply, roads, and
irrigation.

Asia's economic crisis and the collapse of the New Order government brought dramatic changes to the
Bank's role in Indonesia. The outpouring of popular anger over the corruption and violence of the New
Order's final years also brought with it a backlash against development assistance, much of which was
targeted at the World Bank, which was seen as having been too close to government and too willing to
turn a blind eye to abuses taking place in development programs. Ongoing Bank programs were
restructured, with as much as 70% of the portfolio cancelled, and new lending fell to historical lows.

It was against this backdrop of political and economic turbulence and transition that the government
asked the Bank to scale-up both the VIP and the first KDP. Both projects involved block grant transfers
directly to communities, without going through the collapsing and leaky inter-governmental system. And
because they both were built on modular designs, with each block grant independent of its neighbor,
problems in one region would not impede the overall program. Between 1998 and 2001, the major crisis
years for Indonesia, the two programs together reached close to 20,000 villages, with VIP having a
heavier presence on Java and KDP providing more coverage in the off-Java areas.

KDP2 was the first indication that community-based program approaches could be part of a longer-term
program to strengthen governance and reduce poverty. GOI had just announced its massive
decentralization program, which would transfer some 60% of the development budget to district
governments. Bank policy documents such as the 2001 and 2004 CAS increasingly referred to the role of
a scaled-up CDD program providing the vehicle for promoting demand-side governance reform as part of
this overall transitional program.


1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

The objectives of the project were to: (i) support participatory planning and development management in
villages; (ii) support a broad construction program of social and economic infrastructure in poor villages;
and (iii) strengthen local formal and informal institutions by making them more inclusive, accountable,
and effective at meeting villagers' self-identified development needs.

The outcomes would be: (i) economic outputs and impacts from community investments; (ii) changes in
community's abilities to plan and manage development programs; (iii) increasing involvement of civil
society in development monitoring; and (iv) improving the interest and role of local government in
responding to community-identified priority needs.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification
Not applicable

1.4 Main Beneficiaries
(original and revised, briefly describe the "primary target group" identified in the PAD and as captured
in the PDO, as well as any other individuals and organizations expected to benefit from the project)

The main project beneficiaries were some 20 million people in 1,000 of the poorest Kecamatans (of the
3,500 in Indonesia at the time), which benefited both directly and indirectly through project investments.
These benefits for villagers in target kecamatan included direct returns from infrastructure and 89 million
man-days of labour and indirect benefits through improved access to health and education services and
increased economic activity in project villages. Other important benefits were: (i) cost-effective economic
infrastructure for communities; (ii) benefits from both the process and the products of KDP2 reaching the
poor; and (iii) high levels of end user satisfaction with the project investments. Secondary beneficiaries
were (i) the Community Development Department (Pembangunan Masyarakat Desa-PMD) of the
Ministry of Home Affairs, (ii) the National Management Consultant Unit (NMC), consultants at different
levels, village level facilitators and partner agencies providing implementation support; and (iii) local
governments.

1.5 Original Components (as approved)

KDP2 was to be implemented in 700 sub-districts and 10,000 villages (according to the project
agreement) but, as with KDP 1, immediately upon effectiveness, the scope of the project was increased, at
the government's request, and KDP 2 was expected to work across 30 provinces covering 246 districts,
1000 sub-districts and 27,500 villages. The project consisted of the following four components:

Component A: Kecamatan Grants Program.                     Project Cost: US$310.60 ($232.5 million, Bank
financing)
This component provided villages with annual sums of money ranging from Rps. 750 million to 1.5
billion per Kecamatan, depending upon population. The kecamatan grants operated on an open menu
basis with a very short and well-socialized negative list of mostly environmentally risky activities.
Basically villagers could choose public goods, village infrastructure or revolving funds. No windows or
set amounts were mandated. On average more than 70% of funded subprojects ended up being for village
infrastructure and a little less than 30% for revolving funds, scholarships, or social services.

Component B: Community Capacity Development. Project Cost: US$65.5million (100% Bank
financing)
This component supported the development of communities' ability to plan, manage, and maintain their
own projects through a sustained strategy for developing capacities and transferring skills. This will done
through (a) deploying some 2,000 local-level facilitators to provide technical support, training, and
quality oversight; and training some 30,000 village facilitators in basic project management skills; (b)
training project financial units in fiduciary management; and (c) training local government in
participatory planning.

Component C: Implementation Support. Project Cost: US$ 40.4 million (100% Bank financing)
This component supported the hiring of management consultants for every project district (two
consultants each for the 245 districts) and for the National Management Consultant office in Jakarta.
Consultants were trained before being contracted and mobilized. The training included: (i) basic skills in
development planning and management, (ii) cross-village programs in cooperative planning, (iii) village
linkages to the government and private sector at the district level, and (iv) district level participatory

poverty assessments and dialogue on sustainability. This component will also strengthen the ability of the
implementing agency and project villages to carry out pilot activities.

Component D: Monitoring and Evaluation Studies. Project Cost: US$2.9 million (100% Bank
financing)
This component supported the Department of Planning - Bappenas and Department of Community
Development - PMD's efforts to track impacts from the project and to seed pilot programs in a number of
areas that have to do with local governance and poverty. Provision was made for a mid-term review and
various surveys to trace both the effects of the project's institutional reforms and also hypotheses about
local governments and poverty reduction as well as several additional studies and pilots.

1.6 Revised Components:
Following the 2004 tsunami in Aceh and Nias, KDP2 was amended in April, 2006, to provide additional
funds for block grants for disaster-affected sub-districts/villages. These were added through a new
component that was a mirror image of Component A block grants, but specifically to be used for disaster-
affected areas. Substantial donor funds, of which a Dutch contribution of US$ 70,85 million (as a Signed
Amount), were provided as blended financing partway through the project (which in part accounts for
KDP2's achievement beyond in its original performance targets.)

1.7 Other significant changes
(in design, scope and scale, implementation arrangements and schedule, and funding allocations)
There were no changes in the project's core design. However there were changes in the coverage and
scale, activity focus, project schedule and funding allocation as mentioned below:

Project Schedule: The project was originally scheduled to end on December 31, 2006. The closing was
extended by one-year to December 2007 to respond to the Central Java earthquake.

Funding allocations: US$5 million was added as an IDA grant to KDP2 following the tsunami in
Aceh/Nias, and US$6 million was reallocated from Training to Consultant's services to support quickly
the expanded Aceh/Nias coverage. As the MDTF for Aceh/Nias became effective, an additional $84.5
million was added to the KDP program (not to this project) to support reconstruction.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry
(Including whether lessons of earlier operations were taken into account, risks and their mitigations
identified, and adequacy of participatory processes, as applicable)

KDP2's design focused on (i) establishing participatory processes for planning and managing
investments; (ii) building local government ownership of the program while retaining key features of
simplicity and direct transfers; (iii) instituting transparency and democracy from the bottom-up to
complement the ongoing program of decentralization to districts; (iv) establishing a robust system of
checks and balances to encourage transparency by taking into account both financial flows and flows of
authority, and (v) promoting local-level social inclusion, with particular attention to gender issues.

Project preparation for KDP2 included regional workshops for civil society groups and local governments
managed by independent NGOs, a consultation program for all provincial and district parliaments, a
widely available information package on the project, on-site workshops to discuss evaluations and
recommendations made by the communities at the end of their second year in the project; and a national
workshop whose purpose is to consult national NGOs and central agencies on national issues raised by
the regions.

Lessons Learned from previous Bank-assisted projects.
Some of the key lessons specifically from the KDP1 implementation that were incorporated into the
design of KDP2 were:

    · Mainstreaming CDD requires a dynamic long-term vision that sequences policy, organizational,
        and operational reforms. Striking the right balance between moving a large new agenda forward
        and overburdening a weak and at times resistant system requires constant dialogue and
        adjustment between government and the WB;
    · Complexity is the enemy of CDD ­ KDP2 continued to push on streamlining administrative
        procedures and to test changes by the ability of users to work with them effectively;
    · Community projects benefit from good engineering, but providing this requires tailored training,
        manuals, and oversight procedures ­ KDP2's big improvement over KDP1 was the increase in
        the number and quality of field engineers. Their number more than doubled, to a minimum of 1
        per sub-district, with corresponding improvements in their training and management.
    · Increased participation of women can be attained by providing a separate planning channel.
        However, to preserve overall community ownership of the process, both men and women vote
        and decide on sub-project allocations for women's proposals rather than women alone. This
        contrasts with other efforts at gender mainstreaming that segregated male and female planning
        procedures.
    · Building stronger constituencies in government through orientation for District and Kecamatan
        Heads; involvement of government agencies in coordination meetings, supervision and
        monitoring missions; financial counterpart contributions ­ matching grants from internal
        resources; feedback from all levels of government--thus minimizing interventions by local
        officials distorting choice and leading to corruption.
    · Improved transparency and improved communication material with greater use of visual-aids and
        community education material in training; and use of community-level interpersonal
        communications as well as local media such as radio and local television.
    · Monitoring through flexible approaches that combined quantitative with qualitative and
        participatory monitoring with site visits and autonomy and consistent reporting under the project.
        KDP2 was much more successful than KDP1 at using findings from M&E to guide annual and
        overall decision-making.
    · Block grants, directly transferred from the national treasury to village accounts, are central to the
        design and implementation of the project.


Risks and their mitigation are summarized in Annex 9.

Quality Enhancement Review (QER)

There was no QER conducted by the Quality Assurance Group (QAG) for the Project.

2.2 Implementation
(Including any project changes/restructuring, mid-term review, Project at Risk status, and actions taken,
as applicable)

Coverage and scale: The project was finally implemented in 30 (91% of the total in the country)
provinces covering 246 (55% of the total in the country) districts and 1,354 (26% of the total in the
country) sub-districts. A total of 22,010 (35%) villages were covered under the project. The extent of the
project increased both in response to disasters like the Bali bombing, as a result of which a new province

and new kecamatans were added and also the matching grants provided by the local governments which
resulted in addition of new kecamatans.

Project Amendment:       The project was restructured in April 2005 through the addition of a new
component whose purpose was to provide for the reconstruction of communities devastated as a result of
natural disasters.

Donor Support ­ In addition to the Aceh reconstruction grants, KDP2 benefited from significant overall
donor support. The Government of the Netherlands provided nearly $60 million of general support. Other
donors providing bilateral funding included CIDA, AusAid, DANIDA, DFID, and Japan (PHRD and
JSDF). These funds were directed to the Borrower's overall assistance program and linked to KDP
community planning and sub-project implementation. These additional funds from so many sources are
evidence of strong support for the approach and the results to date and allowed villagers to fund and
construct more priority village infrastructure.     The government itself ended up providing about $24
million additional in block grants to villagers in Aceh for recovery purposes.

Risks Due to Delays: KDP2 was considered to be at risk in the beginning owing to initial delays in
appointment of key staff and consultant procurement under a new system. Compliance with agreed
procurement schedules was intermittent, and KDP2 was rated unsatisfactory in more than three ISRs and
project management as unsatisfactory in one ISR (as noted later in this ISR, many of these delays were
because of changes to the State Finance Law, and were largely outside the control of the executing
agency).

The Bank conducted a Mid Term Review (MTR) of the project in April 2005. The MTR found that all of
the assumptions made at the beginning of the project were relevant and had led to significant results in the
field.

Factors outside government control or implementation agency's

Economic crisis: Indonesia's economic crisis and prolonged recovery affected KDP in several ways, but,
most importantly, because of the risk of heightened rather than reduced poverty in rural areas. Banks
sharply reduced lending, including local lending for SMEs and microfinance. Second, most national
poverty programs shut down, in many areas leaving KDP2 as one of the few sources of community-level
investment. Third, high-level government attention over how to handle recovery, including the role to be
played by development finance, changed dramatically from year-to-year, making long-term planning for
KDP very difficult.

Decentralization: Indonesia's national decentralization law dramatically changed the relationship between
local and central governments. Impacts on KDP included confusion over the roles and responsibilities of
civil servants assigned to oversee the project; local changes to administrative units; a process of
administrative fissioning that saw a near-doubling of the number of districts in Indonesia; and changing
rules on local government contributions to the program. Not all of these changes were negative and many
simply required some time so that the new procedures could be assimilated into the KDP program.

Conflict, Bali bombing and Tsunami: The project areas experienced a range of natural and man-made
disasters like the tsunami that affected Aceh and Nias; earthquakes in Nias, Jogjakarta, Central Java and
Papua; conflicts in Maluku, C. Kalimantan, C. Sulawesi, Aceh and W. Kalimantan; and bombings in Bali.
Following the tsunami, the project expanded to all rural sub-districts (243) of Aceh and Nias, reaching
more than 6,000 villages. Other areas where KDP responded rapidly to unexpected disasters and conflicts
include Jogjakarta and Central Java (earthquake), Papua (earthquake), Maluku (conflict), and Bali



                                                      6

(bombing). While the project successfully responded to these events, it stretched the project's
implementation capacity and also reduced the pace of implementation.

Factors subject to government control or the implementation agency's

Positive

   (i) Strong political commitment and support: The project was able to garner support at the highest
        levels under KDP-I and into KDP-II. KDP2 was also among the first GOI projects to require ­
        and receive ­ significant levels of matching finance from subnational governments.

   (ii) Serving very difficult areas: The project took cognizance of the very difficult circumstances in
        island kecamatans in Riau, Maluku and Maluku Utara; up-river kecamatans in East Kalimantan;
        and in Papua and West Papua, and made special provisions for the administration and operational
        costs for these areas including transport and communication costs and most importantly in human
        resource development.

   (iii) Anti-corruption Action Plan: KDP was the first World Bank project anywhere to introduce an
        anti-corruption action plan as part of its strategic approach to reducing corruption risks. (Such
        plans are now mandatory for all new projects in Indonesia.)

   (iv) Enhanced Disclosure of Information: During preparation, the government and Bank team
        developed a transparency policy that went beyond the existing Bank disclosure policy, which was
        being revised. The Country Director/EAP region proposed to the WB Board that KDP2 be one of
        four Bankwide pilot projects with enhanced disclosure, particularly the public disclosure of audit
        findings. This pilot program, which was the only one of the four put into practice, was executed
        over KDP2's lifetime. As with KDP1, overall GOI implemented KDP2's transparency policies
        well.

Negative factors

   (i) Delays in appointment of key staff and fund flow delays: Delays in budget releases for Indonesian
        development projects are endemic and affect all Indonesian projects other than DPLs. The delays
        in release of funds by the government were very serious and adversely affected implementation.
        Further, funds for a given financial year are frozen in December at the end of the Indonesian fiscal
        year. Delays reached as long as 10 months in a one fiscal year. In addition, during the course of
        KDP2's implementation, the State Finance Law was re-written. Poor socialization of the new law
        and an excessively detailed set of requirements for line agencies to access their budgets have if
        anything made budget releases even later in the financial year, particularly for weak agencies that
        lack internal resources to pre-finance activities such as PMD. Overcoming the challenges posed
        by late budgets has been KDP's biggest challenge.

    (ii) Slow information flow: Poor or delayed information from Jakarta to participating regions and
        slowness in response to requests plagued project start-up and lessened the coverage of the matching
        grants component. This was addressed to some extent as project implementation progressed, but
        remained a major hurdle in the decentralized management set-up.

   (iii)Insufficient investment in training: While the role of training of facilitators and communities is
        crucial for successful project implementation, the project invested too little in this. The training
        periods were reduced arbitrarily, and training for both consultants and communities remained under
        funded.


                                                      7

    (iv)Limited capacities: The decentralization of project management to the regional level and
        individual contracts with consultants was a good strategy which addressed problems of over
        centralization identified in the task team's review of KDP-I. However, the RMUs remained weak
        in the absence of well qualified staff and the ability of the RMU to manage their consultants. The
        RMUs were unable to assess consultant performance periodically and terminate the services of
        poorly performing staff.

    (v) Legal status of UPKs: The UPKs are currently custodians and managers of the repayments from
        the micro-credit program for the women's groups supported under the project. At least 60% of the
        UPK's have reasonably large amounts of revolving funds of Rps. 3 billion or more and have
        personnel trained in financial management including book keeping and auditing. However, in the
        absence of legal recognition of their status, the risks of funds being co-opted by the local
        government agencies, to the detriment of women groups, is a real risk, but remains unaddressed
        or only partially so.

    (vi) Complaints handling: The unique and innovative initiative of setting-up of a complaints tracking
        and resolution mechanism under KDP-I was extended to KDP-II and was decentralized to the
        Regional Management Units. The majority of reported cases under this involved misuse of
        project funds (67%) and deviation from project principles and procedures and amounted for very
        small amount compared to the total kecamatans grant (0.5%). However, the project was able to
        resolve only 45% of the cases, against a target of 75%. Part of the problem is an overly ambitious
        target: when the target was set there was strong momentum for judicial sector reform but this later
        fizzled out.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

(a) M&E design and implementation

The KDP2 built on the extensive Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) System of KDP1 to track its
progress and evaluate its impact. KDP2 implemented a three-pronged strategy that guided elements of the
project design as well as the M&E system: (i) eliminate complexity in project design features and funds
flow; (ii) ensure transparency of all project information including financial transactions; and (iii) respond
quickly to complaints.

The system consisted of quantitative and qualitative tools, including internal monitoring from program
stakeholders and external independent monitoring by Indonesian non-governmental organizations
(NGOs), journalists and audit teams. The program commissioned several impact and technical studies to
measure its impact on poverty alleviation and local governance.

KDP's M&E system built on the opportunities offered by Indonesia which included:

    · Nascent democracy and more open political climate ­ to build on the growing trend for citizens
        and community groups to speak out and voice their concerns to document and report
        stakeholder's feedback on project's progress.
    · Growth of civil society organizations ­ to form partnerships with the rapidly expanding media
        and civil society groups to undertake independent monitoring.
    · Skilled pool of consultants ­ to recruit educated consultants and facilitators and investing in staff
        development in the areas of community facilitation and mediation skills, technical supervision
        and reporting.




                                                      8

   · Relative ease of communications ­ to use the efficient communication network of telephones,
       faxes, post and e-mail sown to the district level to send reports and communicate to the national
       level using a single national language.
   · Firm government and World Bank support and commitment to developing a strong M&E system
       ­ to make use of the financial and technical resources committed for M&E activities including a
       22-person M&E Unit and Complaints handling Office to develop and implement this system.

Key challenges in the development of the KDP 2 M & E system are summarized in Annex 10.

The key components of the internal monitoring system were:

   · Field monitoring and reporting by Government officials and Consultants at provincial, district,
       kecamatan and village level and through the monthly reporting to enable the NMC and PMD to
       assess progress in the project cycle, monitor financial disbursements and keep track of problems
       arising in the field;
   · Community participatory monitoring by the newly elected Village Councils (BPDs), Special
       Groups or Teams in villages and NGOs;
   · Case Studies and documentation of lessons learned by two full-time staff of the NMC to capture
       the rich, descriptive information and analyses on multiple themes related to KDP implementation;
   · Procedures for handling complaints and grievances to be addressed by a five member
       Complaints Monitoring Unit responsible for ensuring that complaints and questions are answered
       promptly and investigated further in the field. The Complaints Monitoring Unit coordinates with
       KDP field managers and government officials to ensure follow-up action in response to
       complaints.

The key components of the external monitoring activities and evaluation system were:

   · Independent province-based monitoring by NGOs to amplify the voices of communities so that
       their concerns are heard and to share their experiences in the field, best practices and lessons
       learned, technical and financial monitoring, and recommendations for program improvement;



                                                       9

    · Independent monitoring by Journalists through a contract with the Institute for Social and
         Economic Research, Education and Information (LP3ES) and the Association of Independent
         Journalists (AJI) to provide systematic external monitoring and reporting on KDP and to publish
         or broadcast their findings. There is no prior review or censorship of the stories.

    · Special studies on KDP's impact upon household welfare; and the impact of KDP on community
         organization and perceptions; evaluation of the infrastructure and economic activities; and
    · Audits and/or regular financial inspections by the Finance and Development Supervision Agency
         (Badan Pemeriksa Keuangan dan Pembangunan or BPKP), the government audit agency, NMC
         Financial Supervision and Training Unit (a very effective informal, internal "audit" group, which
         worked closely with the Complaints Handling Unit), and the World Bank.

(b) M&E utilization
The KDP2 M&E components were designed to cross-validate and triangulate information from various
sources. Also, the integration of quantitative and qualitative methods allowed the programs to reach some
more generalizable conclusions as well as understand in greater depth the reasons or dynamics behind
certain outcomes. In combining these two methods, the program was able to meet more of its information
needs and gain boarder perspective of the progress and impact KDP2 was making.



                                                        10

The M&E system provided four key evaluations:

    · Check regularly on project progress ­ through routine and systematic collection of information
         through Consultant and government field reports/MIS; financial supervision; monthly
         independent reporting from NGOs and journalists; complain handling mechanisms; and case
         studies.
    · Assess project impact ­ through the 4,600 household impact survey, case studies, audits and Bi-
         annual World Bank supervision missions.
    · Elicit a variety of perspectives ­ through monitoring by implementers such as consultants and
         communities, monitoring by independent actors like NGOs and journalists, and participation of
         other donors and NGOs in World Bank supervision missions.
    · Quantitative and qualitative assessments ­ Consultant reports, MIS and household surveys for
         quantitative data; and case studies, descriptive reports from NGOs, journalists, complaints and
         grievances for qualitative reports.

The decentralized management of MIS and complaints handling system introduced in KDP2 in place of a
fairly well-functioning centralized system in KDP1 worked very well, even though initially the changes
led to delays. The optimal utilization of the M&E system was initially limited by the inadequate staffing
and limited capacities of the staff appointed for M&E functions at the Regional Management Units.
However, as the project implementation progressed, key M&E positions were filled, staff capacities built,
MIS was up and running, and key studies and surveys were contracted. With all its delays and weaknesses,
KDP2 is very well documented, with detailed implementation data and data on results.

M & E arrangements for KDP 2 have been utilized for follow on projects, for KDP 3 and 3b, and are
being used now, in 2008, after KDP 2 closed. Sustainability of the arrangements in the medium-term is
not in question. Many of the arrangements have also been copied by other community-based projects.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance
(focusing on issues and their resolution, as applicable): There were no significant deviations or waivers
from the Bank safeguards and fiduciary policies and procedures during the implementation of the project.

Financial Management
COSU played a continuous, close role in KDP2.The fiduciary system for KDP2 was a departure from
standard business practices in Indonesia. The project involved minimal prior review, with only two large
investments in each province requiring prior review. Project disbursements took place against agreed
plans that had been verified by the sub district project manager, not against actual receipts. The system
included checks and balances in funds withdrawals, accounting and reporting of expenditures as well as
periodic inspections in the field. The system was supplemented by communities' social controls and
transparency. Villager's capacities to manage these systems were supplemented by hands-on training and
technical assistance. While there were delays in fund flows and counterpart funding, the counterpart
financial contribution and government pre-financing were relatively limited, and thus did not hamper
implementation.

The project's Financial Management was rated moderated unsatisfactory in the last ISR (2/23/08) due to
the delays in mobilizing facilitators and under-utilization of the project financial management specialists
unit in Jakarta and reduced budgets for training. Overall financial management by sub-district finance
units was satisfactory and improving.

There were no outstanding audits. A consolidated Financial Management Report (FMR) was prepared
which included the progress report, financial report and procurement report. The financial report covered



                                                      11

the project financial statement, SA and SOE. In order to overcome the inappropriateness of standard audit
guidelines for the project, the PMD ensured that project audit was conducted as per the (i) Terms of
Reference for the audit of special purpose financial statement and (ii) the audit manual for the community
projects (Pedoman Pelaksanaan Audit dan Pelaporan for Program Pengembangan Kecamatan, issued by
BPKP in April 13, 1999).

Procurement
KDP2's procurement assessment risk was rated as "medium". The government's procurement
performance for the project was satisfactory to highly satisfactory despite the scale of the procurement
required (i.e. reviewing 27,000 individual CV's for field positions). Ex ante review by the procurement
unit and ex post review by the task team under guidance from the OSU group confirms the general
impression that KDP2 procurement was done well. QAG cited KDP's village procurement as regional
best practice. KDP2 introduced a system of direct contracting for community facilitators, whose salaries
are managed through a private sector payroll agent. This system reduced quality problems, overhead costs,
and other procurement risks significantly. Procurement at the village level focused as much on capacity
building as on risk mitigation. Villages procured and managed their own technical assistance for projects
from lists of pre-qualified service providers.

Safeguards
Following an OED review of KDP1 that raised questions about possible safeguard impacts under the first
KDP, in 2005 KDP2 carried out a Comprehensive Technical and Safeguards Assessment (available in
project files) that covered 116 randomly selected villages. No major negative environmental impacts were
observed and those environmental impacts observed (5% of cases) were extremely small and easily
remedied.

Land acquisition assessments were part of the proposal review process and any land acquisition had to be
approved by the district level oversight engineer. Land and resettlement were also recorded in the
project's master database and reviewed during field supervision. No significant adverse impacts from land
acquisition or involuntary resettlement were reported from any KDP2 subproject. Because KDP did not
allow involuntary land acquisition, any displacement was small (i.e. <5 families), voluntary, and kept
within village boundaries.

For indigenous people's safeguards, KDP2 had developed an overall safeguard policy framework to
ensure that project activities provided culturally appropriate benefits through informed participation.
KDP's general strategy was to improve the quality of information through better facilitation and local-
language materials (i.e. support for local language community radio programming). In a "test" case ­ the
Baduy of West Java - consultations proceeded as they were supposed to, with no action taking place until
requested by community leadership (they later requested a health center to be placed on the community
boundary)

While few adverse impacts from KDP on indigenous people were anticipated and none ever recorded, the
second goal of the IP safeguards policy is to maximize benefits, not just minimize impacts. For that
objective, nowhere was there a bigger challenge than the large, troubled, and challenging province of
Papua. In order to provide qualified field personnel in Papua, KDP2 developed a unique program to
recruit and train bright young Papuan villagers through a special training program designed jointly with
Papuan NGOs and the provincial university. Each subdistrict participating in KDP could nominate three
of its brightest high school graduates for a nine month training course in the university, which was
followed by one year of mentoring by the trainers in their field stations. Graduates of the program were
certified as civil engineers (this program was later scaled up still further by the newly elected Government
of Papua and West Papua).



                                                      12

Corruption
The World Bank's GAC strategy acknowledges KDP to be among a select group of projects in its
portfolio that have supported innovative work on transparency, accountability, and a multi-stakeholder
approach to governance and development engagement.

KDP operated in a high risk country, an environment with weak institutions for control and a long history
of corruption taking place in development projects without sanctions. KDP's design also introduced a
number of project-specific risk factors because of the responsibility given to highly dispersed
communities. At the same time, being a CDD project, KDP offered a good potential for greater oversight
through multi-stakeholder participation, collective action of communities, investments in public goods,
and low risks due to the small amounts involved.

The key elements that were introduced into the design for managing corruption were:

    ·   improving diagnostics - forensic reviews of other projects, introducing corruption vulnerability
        mapping, ethno-economic studies of community development, and field measurements;
    ·   reducing discretion ­ fixed bands for grants rather than variable amounts and limited discretion
        with a "yes" and "no" but not "yes..if";
    ·   reducing transactions - money sent directly to sub-district accounts, community withdrawals
        against thresholds, and facilitators moved to direct payroll, without firms;
    ·   promoting competition ­ good and services from private suppliers with block grants and
        competition filters which throw out bad proposals with markups or capture problems;
    ·   lowering costs of acquiring information ­ 10 public signboards per village displaying data on
        wages and materials, easy to read documents and procedures and facilitators from within the
        village;
    ·   promoting social controls ­ placing procurement in the public domain, requirement of more than
        one signature on all KDP documents, teams monitor materials delivery, public accountability
        meetings, villagers undertake cross audits and greater participation of women who steal less than
        men;
    ·   strengthening formal oversight ­ invest in good MIS, working with the legal system, use of
        auditors and World Bank's role; and
    ·   applying sanctions ­ quick response to matters, sanctions must hurt, asking for money back rather
        than reallocating it elsewhere, and developing a protocol with main partners.

KDP2's anti-corruption measures set a standard for CDD projects across the region. Particular elements
introduced by KDP and its sister program, UPP, that are now used across the Bank include:

    ·   Vulnerability "mapping" (see Woodhouse, "Village Corruption in Indonesia," files)
    ·   Handling complaints units
    ·   Web-based tracking
    ·   Tailored audits
    ·   Randomized experiments to identify interventions that produce measureable reductions in leakage
        and corruption (see Olken papers, on file

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase
(including transition arrangement to post-completion operation of investments financed by present
operation, Operation & Maintenance arrangements, sustaining reforms and institutional capacity, and
next phase/follow-up operation, if applicable):

(a) Transition arrangements
Appropriate transition arrangements have been put in place, particularly in the following areas:


                                                    13

Operations and Maintenance for infrastructure: O&M is a big concern for village infrastructure. For all
infrastructure constructed, the project requires an Operations and Maintenance (O&M) Committee at the
village level, having members from the beneficiary families as well as others selected by the community.
However, there is some doubt on the meaningfulness of standard O&M indicators: the technical
sustainability survey found much lower rates of villages forming O&M committees on Sumatra versus
Java, but with similar levels of actual maintenance. However, reasons for poor quality O&M require
better diagnostics. KDPs analysis points to three core reasons for poor O&M: (a) much of what is called
poor O&M is the result of poor initial designs and construction; (b) total cash flow in villages is too low
to support all but minor infrastructure repair; and (c) local governments do not include village level
infrastructure in their investment and maintenance plans. All three issues are being pursued under KDPs
follow-on projects. While the O&M for irrigation channels, water supply schemes, sanitation units,
schools, health centres etc. can still be handled by communities, the project is exploring a different
arrangement for roads, including handing them over to the local governments and/or line departments for
maintenance as these are truly public goods with multiple users and high costs for repair.

UPKs for managing repayments of micro-credit: Women's groups managing revolving funds repay them
to UPKs. The capacity of the UPKs has been built up for financial management and book keeping,
accounting and managing the repayments, such that these funds will always be available for micro-credit
to communities. Starting in 2005, UPKs have been receiving professional accounting reviews and
technical assistance to promote links to private banks. The key issue for the transition is the ambiguous
legal status of kecamatan financial units. GOI plans to clarify this in 2008/2009 through a Dirjen
instruction.

Government Policies: Based on the KDP1 and KDP2 experience, the GOI is now developing a national
policy supporting participatory planning and decision-making and resource allocation by communities for
self-defined development needs and priorities such as small-scale infrastructure, employment generation,
and reconstruction aid. The requisite regulations and institutional capacities are being developed for the
National Policy as part of the Government's new National Community Empowerment Program-Mandiri
(PNPM-Mandiri).

(b)Follow-up projects
KDP2 was succeeded by KDP 3 (a) and KDP 3(b), which together contributed an additional $240 million
of WB assistance. In 2007, GOI announced that a National Community Empowerment Program (PNPM-
Mandiri) built on the KDP program will be scaled up to cover 50,000 rural villages by 2009. Financed
with an annual allocation of at least US$ 1.2 billion for the next three years, GOI plans to extend the
program until 2015. A new project to support PNPM Mandiri ­Rural KDP) was approved by the Board in
May, 2008.

(c) Future impact evaluation.

GOI, with Bank support, is carrying out a series of evaluation studies to assess KDP's overall impacts.
These are described in the evaluation plan for the National Program for Community Empowerment,
which is scheduled for Board presentation on May 20, 2008. The main relevant evaluations include:

    · Long-term poverty impact of KDP
    · Infrastructure sustainability assessment
    · Disaster recovery and post-conflict assessments

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
(To current country and global priorities, and Bank assistance strategy)

KDP2 had an overall development objective of reducing poverty and improving local-level
governance in rural Indonesia, and was in consonance with GOI's decentralization and reforms agenda.
The project complemented GOI's efforts at consolidating and improving village and sub district
government, with building sound local administrations and improved procedures for popular participation
in development decision. The KDP program tied in with two of the three main CAS goals: improving
governance and reducing poverty.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives
(Including brief discussion of causal linkages between outputs and outcomes, with details on outputs in
Annex 2)

The project was more than successful in achieving its objectives:

    · targeting successfully reached poor communities;
    · infrastructure created met technical quality standards;
    · infrastructure costs were approx. 40% less than similar works built through standard line agency
        procurement;
    · rates of return on economic infrastructure are high;
    · corruption and leakage rates are low;
    · high community contributions (avg. 17%);
    · participation of the poor and of women is high;
    · social and environmental safeguard impacts are minimal;
    · flexible and responsive to disasters; and
    · government commitment to expand and sustain the project.

 The key outcomes of the project in meeting its objectives are described as follows:

    (i)     support participatory planning and development management in villages;

Governance
The project supported the establishment of a model for participatory planning and financing in 22,010
villages across the country where communities participated in a democratic, participatory process of
planning and decision-making regarding the allocation of public development funds. Community
contributions averaged 17% nationwide, with wide provincial variation. There was high government
commitment and buy-in with 40% of districts providing matching grants in KDP2.

    (ii)    support a broad construction program of social and economic infrastructure in poor
            villages;

Targeting

  a) High coverage of poor communities ­ KDP-II covered 22,010 of the poorest villages in Indonesia.
      Project processes have ensured high participation of the poor, who made up 60-70% of total
      participants.




                                                   15

 b) Targeting the poorest ­ Evaluation studies indicate that KDP-II geographical targeting is pro-poor.
     The KDP-II poverty headcount is significantly higher than non-KDP head count and the proportion
     of the poor residing in the KDP Kecamatans is bigger than the proportion of KDP population. The
     proportion of poor people in covered kecamatans is 24%, compared to 14% for non-KDP
     kecamatans.

Social and Economic infrastructure
   a) Improved access to markets, town centers, education and health facilities, and clean water supply:
        KDP-II funded some 81,464 infrastructure, economic and social activities across 245 districts in
        30 provinces. Economic infrastructure created includes 12,944 kms of roads built or upgraded,
        3,298 bridges built or reconstructed, 2,068 irrigation systems built, 4,400 clean water supply units
        and 1,760 sanitation units built. The social infrastructure includes construction and renovation of
        2,650 schools, 2,067 "packages" of school equipment and materials, 88,750 individual
        educational scholarships, construction and renovation of 2,051 village health units and posts and
        special village electrification projects for 282 villages. Work on village infrastructure projects
        provided almost 1.7 m villagers 20.2 m person days of labor.

Technical quality
   b) 90% of the infrastructure built under the project meets quality standards.

Cost of Construction
   c) Village infrastructure built through KDP methods costs 56% less on average than equivalent
        works built through government and ministry contracts.

Rates of return
   d) EIRRs for KDP infrastructure ranged from 39% to 68% (on average 53%). In most cases, these
        very large benefits resulted from either entirely new economic activities that were made possible
        by KDP infrastructure or latent production capacity that was finally able to be channeled to local
        markets. (IRRs for small infrastructure should be treated with some caution, however).

Expanded Business Opportunities and Employment
   e) 20.2 million workdays were generated through short-term employment on labor intensive
        infrastructure works, many new businesses and transport services opened up due to new roads,
        bridges, and piers; and there are almost 808,000 loan beneficiaries and entrepreneurs
        participating in KDP credit & business activities.

   (iii)    strengthen local formal and informal institutions by making them more inclusive,
            accountable, and effective at meeting villagers' self-identified development needs.

Low corruption and leakage rates
   a) The total number of corruption complaints as of 2006 came to 976 for a total value of $650,000.
        Over $170 million was disbursed over that same period, for a corruption rate of 0.4%.
        Independent audits of KDP performed by Price Waterhouse and Moores Rowland found that less
        than 1% of village subprojects showed deviations. Of that total, KDP has recovered 40% of the
        missing funds. Keeping in mind that the mechanisms for measuring corruption rates are highly
        imprecise, the general picture is one of efficient delivery of development funds to villages.

Community and local government contribution
 b) KDP2 saw high levels of local contributions. On an average 17% of project costs were provided by
     local communities. KDP2 initiated a system of local government contributions to the kecamatan
     allocations. The local governments were also allowed to add kecamatans as long a they provided


                                                     16

      the full kecamatan block grant allocations; the project would provide TA including training, M&E
      and supervision. 79 of the 190 participating Kabupatens added 147 Kecamatans in the first year
      bringing the number of Kecamatans to 1,260 against the planned 1,000. Papua, the poorest province,
      added the most kecamatans. The local governments thus provided more than US$ 50 million of
      their own funds to the project.

Participation of women and poor
  c) Participation of women in KDP meetings and activities averages over 40%. Significant impacts on
      rural household expenditure were observed with the expenditures going up by 5% in the project
      areas, with a multiplier effect of 1.6. Furthermore, the longer a kecamatan received KDP support,
      the greater the impact on its household expenditure.

Responding to natural disasters
  d) KDP2 proved to be a very robust instrument for supporting post-tsunami efforts in all sub-districts
      of Aceh and Nias reaching more than 6,000 villages. Other areas where KDP responded rapidly to
      unexpected disasters and conflicts include Jogjakarta and Central Java (earthquake), Papua
      (earthquake), Maluku and a number of other provinces as well (conflict), and Bali (bombing).

3.3 Efficiency
(Net Present Value/Economic Rate of Return, cost effectiveness, e.g., unit rate norms, least cost, and
comparisons; and Financial Rate of Return)

Under the project social and economic infrastructure covering improved access to markets, town centers,
education & health facilities, and clean water supply was created. KDP2 funded some 81,464
infrastructure, economic and social activities across 246 districts in 30 provinces (details in 3.2). Over
90% of the infrastructure built under the project meets quality standards and is still functioning 4 to 5
years after completion of construction, and the cost of construction was 56% less on average than
equivalent works built through government and ministry contracts. EIRRs for KDP infrastructure ranged
from 39% to 68% (on average 53%). In most cases, these very large benefits resulted from either entirely
new economic activities that were made possible by KDP infrastructure, or latent production capacity that
was finally able to be channeled to local markets (details in Annex 2).

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
(Combining relevance, achievement of PDOs, and efficiency)
Rating: Satisfactory

The project has exceeded almost all of the performance targets envisaged at appraisal and MTR. It has
also covered a significantly larger geographical area and higher number of households, and has been
efficient in delivering outcomes. It did this in an extremely difficult, volatile country context that saw the
scaling back or delay of most WB investment programs.

Program management has been erratic and project supervision frequently highlighted managerial
inadequacies. On balance, however, the rating team feels that while overall project management was
problematic, the fact that it could steer such a big program in such a difficult environment also merits an
overall rating of "satisfactory".

For details see Sections 3.2, 3.3, and 4.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(If any, where not previously covered or to amplify discussion above)



                                                     17

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

Poverty Impacts
A 6,000 household panel was constructed from SUSENAS (expenditure survey) data and run against
controls for the period 2002--2007. The main findings are that:

    · KDP2 has a positive impact on consumption for poor households and households in poor
         kecamatan. Households in the lowest 2002 consumption quintile participating in KDP2 saw their
         real per capita consumption increase by between 5.4 and 10.5 percentage points more than in
         control areas. KDP2 households in the poorest quintile of kecamatan saw similar impacts of
         between 5 and 13 percentage points.
    · The percentage of households moving out of poverty is higher among KDP2 participants in
         poor areas. The evidence suggests that the likelihood of households moving out of poverty was
         higher in poor kecamatan for KDP2 households. At the World Bank $2-day poverty line, KDP2
         households in poor kecamatans were 9.2 to 11.7 percentage points more likely to move out of
         poverty between 2002 and 2007.
    · Disadvantaged groups other than the poor are less likely to benefit from the program.
         Female-headed households and households with a head lacking primary education see
         insignificant or negative impacts for real per capita consumption and movement out of poverty.
    · Access to outpatient care expanded in KDP2 areas. Among those household heads not
         seeking outpatient care in 2002, KDP2 household heads are between 9.7 and 11.5 percentage
         points more likely to seek outpatient care in 2007 than household heads in the control group. In
         contrast to the real per capita consumption and poverty status results above, disadvantaged groups
         also benefit in terms of expansion of access to outpatient care.
    · KDP2 reduces unemployment. The change in the unemployment rate was (-)1.5% lower in
         KDP2 kecamatan in comparison with control kecamatan.

Gender and Social Development Aspects
    · The project had a well-defined strategy for integrating gender in the project cycle with respect to
         each stage and phase. Terms and Conditions were defined for each stage in the cycle of project
         activities to ensure that women participated in the project. Annex 11 gives details of these terms
         and conditions and impacts.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening (particularly with reference to impacts on longer-term capacity
and institutional development):

Local governments matching grants: In KDP2 (2002-2007), 79 districts or 40% of the total 190
participating KDP districts provided matching funds for subproject block grants. This precedent has since
been scaled up and most districts in Indonesia now provide either a matching grant or a direct transfer
modeled on KDP.

Auditing as a tool to reduce corruption: The project carried out a highly innovative randomized
evaluation of alternative interventions to reduce corruption and other forms of leakage. An evaluation
study found that increasing audit samples and publicizing audit results lowers losses. The National
Auditors have started to adopt this as part of their standard operating procedures to curb the occurrence of
corruption. (a full study is available in WB files)

Spin-off projects in Provinces: Many provinces adopted the KDP model for delivering development
through other programs funded from their own resources. KDP2 reviewed 26 of these spin-off projects
(report is in WB project files)



                                                      18

Adopting the project as a national model: The GOI has adopted the project model to promote more
broad-based growth under the first nationwide poverty reduction program. The program aims to reach the
every kecamatan of the country by 2009.

Grant Funds and Multi-Donor Trust Funds: The project's robust implementation arrangements
encouraged a large number of donors to partner with the project: they included Japan, AusAid, Danida,
New Zealand, CIDA, DFID, and the Netherlands. Project expansion in post-tsunami Nias and Aceh was
funded by a Multi-Donor Trust Fund for Post-tsunami Recovery.

(c) Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive and negative):

Positive

     ·   Adoption of community-based development approaches by national and district governments
         through the National Program for Community Empowerment;
     ·   Government interest in KDP's M&E systems have (in part) led to a much broader use of mixed
         methods evaluations to make policy decisions;
     ·   Ongoing consolidation of more than 95 CDD programs into the PNPM umbrella.
     ·   Use of CDD for post conflict reintegration
     ·   Trial of a community based conditional cash transfer
     ·   Adoption of KDP by the Governments of Papua and West Papua

Negative

(i) Covering the poorest of the poor. The project was successful in targeting the poorest Kecamatans.
Even within the selected Kecamatans, the socialization process was aimed at the poor households.
However, KDP's design and management structure were too rigid to allow for intense facilitator and
community training in order to negotiate decisions involving the highly vulnerable and poor members of
the community. The planning and decision making committees usually operated on a majority vote and
were not as inclusive of the poor as hoped for, and the infrastructure that got created under the project
sometimes provided the very poor only wage labour benefits during construction period. They were also
not often recipients of micro-credit as the emphasis was on having a viable enterprise, ability to repay, a
good past repayment record.

(ii) Quality of women's participation: The project did make provision for women to be represented in
forums and committees for each of the activities in the project implementation. Women actually propose
two of the three project proposals allocated to each village and decide on these in a separate women's
only meeting. However, their ability to voice opinions, defend proposals, raise issues and argue was
limited owing to social, cultural, traditional and religious environment. Also, it was the elite women too
often who were in the forefront rather than the poor. Project's impact on changing or altering these
barriers to women's participation and changes to gender equity is now being measured under the project.

(iii) Support from other Technical Departments: The interest and technical support of sectoral ministries
in executing the sub-project proposals was limited, making the project depend on its own technical staff.
This also limited the project from taking up more technically difficult activities or activities that involved
recurrent costs. Examples of such necessary activities include large-scale health provision, providing
teachers for schools, or any kind of infrastructure network planning.

(iv) Project's Micro-credit approach: The micro-credit under the project allowed communities to get
money from the project at commercial rates to be invested in private goods and village revolving funds.
This money reached the poor but not the poorest. The money was invested well with attendant multiplier


                                                     19

effects through employment, but the repayments remained low, well below sustainability levels. Internal
WB discussion of whether to allow microcredit within KDP2 was lively, with surprising alignments:
macroeconomists such as Sir Nicholas Stern (WB VP at the time) and the WB country director arguing to
retain it until the crisis was over. By 2006, microcredit was removed from KDP2 except for grants to
women's revolving funds.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops
(optional for Core ICR, required for ILI, details in annexes)

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Negligible to Low

Institutionalization of information flow, transparency and accountability: The project established
mechanisms for implementation which enabled the free flow of information to different stakeholders and
from different formal and informal sources; established intra and inter village platforms for cooperation
and decision making; and established check and balances, social oversight and transparency. However,
this social capital needs to be nurtured beyond project to impact development effectiveness in public
programs other than KDP.

Relationship between communities and local governments: There has not been as significant a change to
the attitude of local government towards communities, though local government support for KDP has
grown tremendously. The capacity of villages to voice their demands in the district-level development
planning process is still limited and remains a key challenge of the program. Government ownership of
KDP is strong and more so now with the rebranding of Bank-financed CDD projects, KDP and UPP, as
PNPM Mandiri.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
(relating to design, implementation and outcome issues)

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
(i.e., performance through lending phase)
Rating: Satisfactory

The Bank's performance in the identification, preparation, and appraisal of the project was satisfactory.
The project's objective was consistent with the government's development priorities and the Bank's CAS.
During preparation and appraisal, the Bank took into account the lessons and experiences emerging from
KDP1 in designing the KDP2. Bank undertook significant upstream work on community-level institutions
and their interface with formal public institutions ­ the organization structures, stakeholders, and the
formal legal, regulatory, and political regimes. Detailed attention was given to procurement and
accountancy practices and flow of funds and goods. In-depth understanding of gender dynamics led to
culturally sensitive responses to development priorities of men and women. Tackling corruption required
a good understanding of the incentives that drive it, creativity in designing counter-incentives, and
conviction to go into cases of fraud. The Bank worked closely with the PMD, the Government's
implementing agency, to design a robust M&E system and a complaints handling mechanism and in
expanding decentralized management arrangements.

(b) Quality of Supervision
(including of fiduciary and safeguards policies)
Rating: Satisfactory



                                                     20

The Bank fielded a multi-disciplinary supervision team with expertise in project management, financial
management, procurement, monitoring, and safeguards. The key to KDP's supervision was basing it in
the field, which allowed for more frequent site visits and more sustained follow-up..

For the ICR, the key issue to discuss is how best to assess the Bank's intense supervision effort. The issue
has two particularly important dimensions. First, overall, KDP and the other CDD operations have a
different "life cycle" than normal Bank operations: they are in general relatively cheap to prepare, but
because they are localized, dispersed over large areas, and involve a number of decentralized agencies,
they require a more sustained, on-site program of supervision simply to check whether the government
systems are operating well. Secondly, KDP2's context ­ a weak national agency, intense pressures to
scale up rapidly, a high risk national environment, and a large number of disasters, conflicts and other
abnormal events, also led to a policy choice by Bank management to provide more than normal hands-on
assistance to the government. While the choice can be debated, the opinion of the ICR team is that
without this hands-on help, the project could not have carried out all of the functions loaded onto it given
the turbulence of the overall environment and the limited capacities of the project's executing agencies.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

Based on the Bank performance during lending phase and supervision as discussed in Section 5.1, the
overall performance is rated as Satisfactory. The intense involvement in the preparation and supervision,
the quick project preparation at low cost, candid and supportive supervision reporting, robust M&E and
immediate response to complaints, defined Bank's overall performance under the project.

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

GOI remained committed to KDP throughout its lifetime, although there were a number of political
perturbations that threatened policy changes that would have ended the KDP program. GOI provided
requisite levels of counterpart financing, audit oversight, and compliance with covenants.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Marginally Satisfactory

PMD's performance needs to be placed in context. PMD was a weak agency entrusted with scaling up a
very big project in an extraordinarily difficult environment, one in which much stronger agencies and
more traditional project designs stalled or failed to achieve their objectives. By contrast, despite the many
hiccups, KDP not only disbursed well and effectively, but managed to scale-up dramatically over the
course of the project's lifetime, with few major problems, delays, or sacrifices.

However, there were also many avoidable problems that stronger management could have rectified.
Particular problems included (i) chronic delays in procurement; (ii) poor management of consultants; (iii)
slow responses to audit findings and other complaints; and (iv) delayed or low quality performance on the
training and capacity programs, especially for local governments.

Technical Elaboration of PMD's performance: PMD submitted all required quarterly and annual reports
in a timely manner and these reports were informative and provided details on project's progress. KDP2's
financial management system including accounting, controls, auditing and reporting was adequate and
satisfied the Bank's financial management requirements. Procurement of all works, goods and technical
services under the project followed the Procurement Guidelines "Procurement under IBRD Loans and


                                                      21

IDA Credits". The procurement aspects of the project in relation to the social and economic infrastructure
at the community level were managed in a satisfactory manner by the PMD.

As the project implementation progressed, tKDP management within Home Affairs weakened.
Consultant selection, training, supervision and evaluation suffered from poor oversight and divisive
leadership. Key staff positions under KDP2 remained empty for long periods of time simply because no
action was taken to recruit replacements or because the salary offers and working conditions for several
types of needed professional staff was not competitive even with other government programs. The
training programs ­ both technical and social, had not been handled well with reduced emphasis, less time
and allocations.

A critical problem with the functioning of the implementing agency was the consistently poor budget
forecasting and funds disbursements. However, the functioning of the PMD was also constrained by
systemic problems such as national budgets being released very late in the annual budget cycle; the newly
introduced performance-based budgeting of GOI not being conducive for multisectoral programs such as
KDP2; and budget preparation and release from within the executing agency that were also badly
fragmented, leading to additional delays and management problems.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

In light of the government and implementing agencies' performance as discussed in Section 5.2, the
overall performance of the Borrower was Satisfactory.

6. Lessons Learned
(Both project-specific and of wide general application)

Important factors for the success of a project:

The KDP principles and mechanisms of transparency, participation, community elected facilitators and
committees, and open public meetings are critical in supporting consensus building and decision making;
and these are critical components of good governance.

Scaling up:
    The key design features that enabled scaling up of the project were (i) project's disbursement system
    that enabled direct transfer of funds into a uniquely coded sub-district account, in a modular fashion,
    thus keeping each Kecamatan independent; and funds are transferred at the beginning of the planning
    cycle; (ii) project built on an internal architecture whose core elements were field tested for many
    years and were familiar to administrators and consultants; (iii) decentralization of management
    functions to regional management units and autonomous decision making; (iv) project offered both
    incentives and sanctions for local governments; (v) all technical, managerial and social services under
    the project were outsourced and were purchased from the national and local market and not from civil
    servants; and (vi) high levels of transparency with social oversight to limit corruption and other
    distortions and long participatory planning to limit elite capture.

Implementation:
    Block grants provided to communities as direct transfers from the national level can be effective in
    reaching target beneficiaries, reducing potential leakage, and accelerating rapid disbursement.
    However, this needs to be accompanied by creating and strengthening a participatory planning and
    decision making mechanism at the local level to enable communities to decide on their priorities,
    make necessary allocation; plan and design sub projects and execute them. Training and facilitation to


                                                     22

    communities in particular on financial management including basic accounting and book keeping,
    procurement, information disclosure, monitoring and evaluation and operations and maintenance, is
    extremely important.

    Facilitators have an important role providing communities with project information on processes,
    activities and simple rules for decision making and procurement. However, ensuring proper selection
    and recruitment of facilitators based on qualifications, disbursal of timely and agreed remuneration,
    provision of timely training and refresher courses, routine performance evaluations with rewards and
    punishments are all critical in ensuring effective and accountable facilitation.

    Facilitators working in conflict areas require specialized training in negotiations and conflict
    management skills to be able to work together with village leaders and communities to mediate
    conflicts that may arise and emphasize the common good of the entire community. Flexibility in Bank
    procedures is also essential in post-disaster and post-conflict contexts.

    Separate proposals from women and their selection/finalization in separate forums is critical as their
    experiences, habits, problems and needs are very different and may not be appreciated by men.

    The provision of technical facilitation has greatly increased project benefits and efficiency by
    improving the design, construction, operations and maintenance of village infrastructure, including
    improving local procurement.

    Sustained interventions in an area is a prerequisite for improved impacts and the larger rates of return
    for the project. Evaluation studies show that the highest returns to investments under the project are
    found in the latest years in the oldest cycles which points to the need for a sustained intervention in
    the same area instead of a "hit and run" intervention. I

Monitoring:
    Infrastructure design and construction appraisals by community members without formal engineering
    training can be undertaken using simple guidelines; enabling communities to participate in and
    monitor work of Technical Facilitators from the project.

    Threat of an audit weighs as much as its execution and is very cost effective even at 100%. To further
    increase audit effectiveness, audit assignments must be randomized to reduce repeater collusion and
    audit reports must be distributed among villagers in a written form.

    Audit and increasing probability of an audit leads to reductions in corruption on an average of 8
    percent of expenditures. For infrastructure projects, reductions come from reductions in over-
    invoicing of materials procured and reductions in over billing of labour.

    Grassroots monitoring is more effective in reducing theft when community members have substantial
    private stakes in the outcome, but less effective for public goods.

                 Annex 2. Outputs by Component and Implementation Arrangements

The twin purposes of the Second Kecamatan Development Project were to support better governance in
rural villages and to provide rural communities with public goods and development infrastructure that
would raise the incomes of the poor. The project was based on key principles of transparency,
participation, bottom-up decision-making, village financial management, and technical and social
facilitation drawn from the private sector and NGOs. The outputs by components and the implementation
arrangements are detailed below.

Component A: Kecamatan Grants Program. Highly Satisfactory
The project was finally implemented in 30 (91%) provinces covering 246 (55%) districts and 1354 (26%)
sub-districts. A total of 22, 010 (35%) of all villages were covered under the project. Kecamatans were
provided block grants ranging from Rps. 750 million to 1.5 billion each annually, depending on their
population. This grant was made available to all villages within the selected kecamatan. Grants were
channeled directly to a collective bank account held in the kecamatan. These funds were used to support
subprojects selected through a competitive selection process of proposals made by community and hamlet
level organizations. The project operated on an open menu principle--anything not on a very short
negative list would be allowed. Over 70% of the grant ended up being used for infrastructure, economic
activities, and social services allocated on a competitive basis to proposals from villages. A provision was
made allowing 10% to be allocated up-front to pre-existing, successful (verified on audit) savings-
borrowing schemes being operated by women's groups.

Socialization and Planning
    · 100% of the villages in the selected Kecamatans undertook information dissemination and
         socialization processes with workshops at province, district, kecamatan and village levels, along
         with distribution of project related printed material.
    · Two facilitators ­ one man and one woman were selected in all project villages who supported
         communities with the socialization and planning processes.
    · Most villages under the project undertook village visioning and all went through a planning
         process and identified social and economic infrastructure priorities for support by the Social and
         Technical Facilitators at the Kecamatan level. The subproject proposals required low-tech and
         labor-intensive methods and were not supplied by other sources of skills and resources. 75% of
         the village meetings were attended by local government representatives.

Matching Grant
In KDP2 (2002-2007), 79 districts or 40% of the total 192 participating KDP districts provided matching
funds for subproject block grants. This was reflective of the respect and faith that local governments have
in the capabilities of communities in KDP to identify their priorities and implement subproject which are
of high quality and are cost effective.

Outcomes
    a) Improved access to markets, town centers, education & health facilities, and clean water supply:
         KDP2 funded some 81,464 infrastructure, economic and social activities across 245 districts in 30
         provinces. Economic infrastructure created includes 12,944 of roads built or upgraded, 3,298
         bridges built or reconstructed, 2,068 irrigation systems built, 4,400 clean water supply units and
         1,760 sanitation units built. The social infrastructure includes construction and renovation of
         2,650 schools, provision of 2,067 packages of school equipment and materials, 88,750 individual
         educational scholarships, and construction and renovation of 2,051 village health units and posts
    b) EIRRs for KDP infrastructure ranged from 39% to 68% (on average 53%). In most cases, these
         very large benefits resulted from either entirely new economic activities that were made possible



                                                      26

         by KDP infrastructure or latent production capacity that was finally able to be channeled to local
         markets.
    c) 20.2 million workdays have been generated for 1.2 million villagers through short-term
         employment on labor intensive infrastructure works, many new businesses and transport services
         have opened up due to new roads, bridges, and piers; and there are almost 808,000 loan
         beneficiaries and entrepreneurs participating in KDP credit & business activities.
    d) KDP2 saw high levels of local contributions. On an average about 17% of project costs were
         provided by local communities.
    e) Participation of women in KDP meetings and activities ranged from 26 to 45%. Significant
         impacts on rural household expenditure were observed with the expenditures going up by 5% in
         the project areas with a multiplier effect of 1.6. Furthermore, the longer a kecamatan received
         KDP support, the greater the impact on its household expenditure.

Component B: Community Capacity Development. Satisfactory
In order to enable the community to plan, implement, manage and maintain their own sub-projects, KDP2
adopted a strategy for community capacity building which included sustained training, basic technical
facilitation and administrative skills, interaction of communities with district governments, inter-village
and inter-kecamatan forums to promote joint problem solving and local conflict resolution.

Outputs
    a) 90% of the infrastructure built under the project met quality standards and the village
         infrastructure built through KDP methods cost 56% less on average than equivalent works built
         through government and ministry contracts.
    b) The total number of corruption complaints as of 2006 came to 976 for a total value of
         $650,000.00. Over $170 million was disbursed over that same period, for a corruption rate of
         0.4%. Independent audits of KDP performed by Price Waterhouse and Moores Rowland found
         that less than 1% of village subprojects showed deviations. Of that total, KDP has recovered 40%
         of the missing funds. Keeping in mind that the mechanisms for measuring corruption rates are
         highly imprecise, the general picture is one of efficient delivery of development funds to villages.
    c) Local governments provided their own administrative and supervision costs, often more than the
         required 6%. KDP2 initiated a system of local government contributions of the Kecamatan
         allocations and local governments were allowed to add Kecamatan as long a they provided full
         kecamatan allocation and the project would provide TA including training, M&E and supervision.
         79 of the 192 participating Kabupatens added 147 Kecamatans in the first year brining the
         number of Kecamatan to 1260 against the planned 1000. Papua the poorest Province added the
         most Kecamatans. The local governments thus provided more than US$ 50 million of their own
         funds to the project.

Component C: Implementation Support. Moderately Satisfactory
The project hired and trained 30,000 villagers and 2,000 facilitators to work at the sub-district level, as
part of the training of trainers strategy. These Master Trainers were exposed to four sets of skills namely
(i) basic skills in development planning and management (procurement, financial management,
participatory design, technical skills); (ii) cross-village programs in cooperative planning, ex post quality
review, and conflict resolution; (iii) village linkages to the government and private sector at the district
level through monitoring and long-term development planning; and (iv) district level participatory
poverty assessments and dialogue on sustainability. Project participants including community leaders,
facilitators, NGOs, parliamentarians, women's groups, etc. were supported to meet other community
leaders from elsewhere in Indonesia and neighboring countries to learn from each other's experience in
program implementation and solving similar problems in community development.

Output

Community involvement
    · In 22,010 villages across the country, communities participated in a democratic, participatory
        process of planning and decision-making regarding the allocation of public development funds.
    · Community contributions averaged 17% nationwide with wide provincial variation. There was
        high government commitment and buy-in with 40% of districts providing matching grants in
        KDP2.

Facilitators
    · Owing to the need for a relatively high degree of facilitation and financial oversight in order to
        overcome traditions of corruption, a lack of transparency and top-down planning, the project
        employed a large number of contract staff. It is estimated that 4200 Indonesian consultants at the
        national, provincial, district and sub district levels provided technical assistance and guidance. In
        addition, every village elected two facilitators, one man and one woman.
    · Facilitator performance evaluation was carried out with involvement of local government and
        firms who reviewed and certified performance. Some non-performing consultants were
        terminated, but not in a timely manner.

Training
    · Training was provided to villagers and facilitators but there was scope for improvements in
        quality of training material, greater decentralization of training budget and greater authority to
        provincial teams for effective training and increased in-service training.
    · Training to local governments was limited and could have been expanded.

Local Government Coordination
    · In order to achieve a synergy in the project and local government planning, and promote more
        cooperation with other similar programs to avoid duplication and maximize opportunities; the
        project supported socialization of local governments and DPRDs, began to consolidate the Tim
        Koordinasi, provided guidelines for clear and decentralized procedures authorizing cooperation
        outside the project, and increased the presence of line agencies and other donors in the village
        discussions. All this resulted in increased matching grants by local governments as well as spin-
        off projects.

Component D: Monitoring and Evaluation Studies. Satisfactory
This component supported the MIS for tracking project progress and impacts. It also supported various
studies and evaluations. The MIS functioned well though some improvements are needed. This CDD
project is well monitored and documented.

MIS
    · The MIS was functional but was not fully effective owing to quality of staff, MIS hardware, and
        non-integration of different data sources into a single database.
    · The external website needed improvements.

Studies and Evaluations
    · A number of studies were commissioned during the life of the project to understand a range of
        project impacts including quality of infrastructure, EIRR, poverty impact, women's participation,
        conflict areas, etc.

                                         Economic Impact Analysis

A post-construction economic impact analysis was conducted on 113 KDP rural infrastructure projects
across four provinces to determine the overall economic benefits that have accrued to the villages that
planned and built infrastructure facilities according to the KDP's CDD approach. The study was limited
to four types of KDP infrastructure namely Roads, Bridges, Water Supply and Irrigation. These four types
of infrastructure were chosen because they have been shown over time to be the dominant types of
infrastructure requested by KDP villages across Indonesia.


Results of the Economic Impact Analysis Study

The study revealed that the infrastructure supported under the project had significant impacts on the
economies of the villages analysed. This analysis measured those impacts, both quantitatively and
qualitatively, with the following instruments:

    · Economic Internal Rates of Return
    · General Income Multiplier
    · KDP vs Contractor Cost Comparison
    · Project-Specific Quality of Life Indicators
    · Basic Technical Quality Review

1.       Economic Internal Rate of Return

    Type of Infrastructure        No. Projects             Average EIRR
 Water Supply                                41                            38.62%
 Roads/ Bridges                              55                            51.84%
 Irrigation                                  17                            67.64%
         Total Projects                     113

The study revealed that EIRRs ranging from 38.62% for water supply to 67.64% for irrigation. The
benefits were as a result of either entirely new economic activities that were made possible by KDP
infrastructure, or suppressed/latent production capacity that was finally able to be channeled to local
markets. The most frequently seen examples were roads that provided access to previously isolated
villages where, before the road, all produce had to be hand carried or carried in small amounts on motor
cycles, for kilometers before reaching the nearest market.

Likewise, a number of irrigation projects were able to more than double the area under cultivation as well
as channel water from local springs during the dry season. In some cases this resulted in triple benefits:
(1) additional area cultivated, (2) two crops per year instead of one, and (3) increased fertility due to
timely watering. The resulting increases in yields per hectare were very significant.

There were also 8 projects that produced EIRRs of over 100% due to extra-ordinarily large benefits.
These projects were not included in the calculation of averages shown above due to the risk of major
distortions.

2.       General Project Income Multiplier

 Infrastructure     No. Projects     Av. Multiplier       Rp Equivalent      Total Project Cost
 Water Supply                    41               1.143        633,730,114             4,914,301,345
 Roads/ Bridges                  55               1.180       1,124,376,465            7,874,248,178

The cash injected into the 113 village economies by the KDP projects generated additional value
equivalent to Rp 2,069,413,297 *(US$ 226,165) (US$ 1.00 = Rp 9,150). When compared to the actual
total value of all 113 projects (inclusive of village contributions, or Swadaya) this amount is very
significant.

3.       Cost Comparison Method

 Infrastructure      Projects        KDP Cost Only           Cost Pemda (Contractor    Av. Difference %
                        No.        (No Swadaya Cost)                 Price)
 Water Supply               41              4,101,268,770              6,704,995,650                66.04
 Roads/ Bridges             55              6,547,034,660             10,349,768,540                58.70
 Irrigation                 17              1,669,110,053              2,269,372,345                42.72
   Total Projects          113             12,317,413,483             19,324,136,535

The Cost Comparison undertaken during the analysis was designed to determine what the same
infrastructure would have cost had it been constructed by the local government contractors instead of
KDP. A detailed re-costing (with the help of local public works officials and FKs) was undertaken of the
project proposals prepared by each KDP village using local government (Pemda) unit costs and contractor
costs. This method was considered to be the most objective and accurate way of comparing the
construction costs of a KDP project with those of a technically comparable project built by local
government contractors. The Cost Comparison analysis showed savings of Rp 7,006,723,052
(US$ 765,762) because villages mobilized their own labour and other resources to implement the projects
themselves. The extrapolation of these figures to the total number of infrastructure projects constructed
under and KDP II, even with considerable discounting to allow for problem projects, reveal significant
additional economic value and cost savings.

4.       Quality of Life Indicators

In order to understand the direct and indirect benefits accruing from the project, project-specific
indicators were used for four types of infrastructure projects analyzed. These included:

    · Increase in number of children attending school
    · Construction of new houses occurred after the project
    · Repair and/or renovation of houses occurred after the project
    · Increase in motor cycle ownership
    · Additional incomes used to start new enterprises
    · Increase in general level of personal cleanliness
    · Increased village cooperation and self confidence
    · Increased management and planning skills.

From 113 projects 62 (55%) were ranked by villagers as "Sangat Dirasakan" (Impacts Strongly Felt). 46
(41%) were ranked as "Dirasakan" (Impacts Felt) and 5 projects (4%) were ranked as "Kurang



                                                     30

Dirasakan" (Impacts Less Felt). In other words 108 projects (95%) were ranked by the villagers who
built them as having impacts that were either `Strongly Felt', or `Felt' on a daily basis.

 Infrastructure        Impact Strongly Felt        Impact Felt       Impact Barely Felt
 Type                  Sangat Dirasakan            Dirasakan         Kurang Dirasakan
 Roads/Bridges                     33                    17                       3
 Water Supply                      20                    20                       2
 Irrigation                        9                      9

Some of the specific benefits from each type of infrastructure identified were:

    For roads and bridges:
    · Increase in transport businesses
    · New businesses opening due to increased traffic on roads and improved access to areas
    · Decrease in transport costs to bring agricultural produce to market
    · Greater access to schools, health facilities, markets, and town centers
    · Time savings due to improved ease of travel and transport

    For irrigation facilities:
    · Increased agricultural production

    For water systems:
    · Time savings due to better access to water sources, especially for women

5.       Post-Project Technical Quality Review

 Infrastructure          Baik          Cukup Baik              Kurang Baik
 Type                    Very Good     Good/Acceptable         Not Good/Unacceptable

 Total                        54                52                            7

The technical evaluation of the projects was based on the standards for technical quality and project
management that the villagers set for themselves. These basic standards are implicit in each village
project proposal and are also the basis on which the National Management Consultants (NMC) monitored
the progress the KDP. Eight simple evaluation criteria that became the basis of a questionnaire that was
used for interviews with the head of `Tim Pelaksana Kegiatan' (Head of the Village Implementation
Team) and at least three other individuals in the village who had been closely involved with the project
from beginning to end. The presence of the extra three people was meant to provide some balance and
objectivity to the opinions of the Head of the Implementation Team.

A simple scoring system was then used to provide a ranking for the project ranging from "Baik", "Cukup
Baik" to "Kurang Baik". A project that scored 80% or above was ranked as "Baik" (Very Good/All
technical criteria met). A score of between 60% to 79% ranked as "Cukup Baik" (Good/Technically
Acceptable). And a score of less than 60% ranked as "Kurang Baik" (Not So Good/ Technically
Unacceptable).

The project elicited feedback from stakeholders on KDP and some of their positive reactions are provided
below KDP produced several books, reports, and newsletters that provide additional stakeholder insights.
KDP has also been studied by a number of academics. These longer reviews are available in project files
and on WB websites.

Adhuri, Community figure in Singawada Village, Nusa Tengarra Berat
Irrigation has great benefits for us because our citizens own rice fields. Before we were having
difficulties watering our fields, especially, during the dry season. With KDP funds, Alhamdulillah (thank
god) we now have an irrigation system. Before, we were only able to harvest once a year, now we can
harvest rice two to three times.

Head of Hamlet, Binjai Village, Tayan Hulu Sub-District, Sanggeau District, West Kalimantan
"... We are so delighted with KDP's school for elementary students (grades 1 to 3)... Our children do
not need to walk for three kms and we, as parents, do not have to worry about possible accidents for kids
who used to ride on the back of trucks..."

Sirka Usamen, Head of Loulalang Village, Tolitoli Utara, Central Sulawesi
"Before, women were trembling when speaking. Now, due to the economic loans, women are
enthusiastic about attending the meetings. Furthermore, they can speak out loud..."

Villager in Pagersari Village, East Java, NGO SPEKTRA Report, East Java
"Almost every year, the Kalidawir area floods, especially Pagersari Village. Before KDP project,
Pagersari was flooded and my house also. My house is at the back of rice fields, so of course there is
flooding. The road and drainage system built by KDP was completed in March and I worked as a laborer.
The benefits of this system are very much felt by the citizens here because houses do not get flooded any
more, especially during rainy season. I can only give thanks because someone still pays attention to me
although I am just a small (marginal) person."

Woman in Giring Village, Paliyan Sub-district, Jogjakarta
"During dry season, there is not much employment in agriculture in this village. Many local residents
have to seek work outside the village. The existence of such jobs as the KDP road surfacing project helps
the community very much. Many women became laborers to add to the family income".

Arif Saleh, village representative, in Ampibabo sub-district, Parigi Moutong, Central Sulawesi
Parliament members should take examples from here. This is how community members learn from
democracy. The competition is fair, because only urgent proposals will be funded".

Sub-District Head, Abung Surakarta, Lampung
"KDP is better than other government programs. I can say that KDP is a true reflection of democracy in
development. The program allows more community involvement in planning, managing, and
implementing projects that they choose....KDP demonstrates real bottom-up planning. This is actually
suitable for the community. On the other hand to avoid bias, we need assistance from the facilitator to
guide and facilitate the community.... There are so many programs claiming to be `bottom-up' but in fact
the implementation is still top-down. I agree that KDP is the best example of a true bottom-up
development program.

    KDP aims to increase/improve community participation in village development through a cycle of
    activities, such as (i) Information Dissemination and Socialization, (ii) Participative Planning Process,
    (iii) Village/rural and sub district project selection, (iv) Community implementation of their projects,
    and (v) Accountability meetings and progress reports.

    The Kecamatan Development Program II (KDP II) is a continuation of KDP I. The Kecamatan
    Development Program (KDP) II was implemented from 2003 up to 2006. Total district/regional
    coverage for KDP II was 30 provinces, 245 districts, 1,346 sub districts, 22,010 villages. Total fund
    allocation of KDP II is US$ 400,3 million, which is funded by the World Bank with the amount of
    US$ 320,6 million, government contribution of US$ 101.30 million, and Dutch grant with the amount
    of US$ 70.85 million.

    During its implementation, KDP II involved more than 700 sub districts in each phase. In TA 2002
    (Phase IV), there were 1,264 sub districts participating (8 sub district dropped), out of 964 sub
    districts in TA 2003 (Phase V), 7 sub districts could not carry on their activities. While in TA 2004
    (Phase VI), 868 districts were involved, but 34 sub districts were dropped and 89 sub districts were
    affected by disaster. Phase VI was able to be implemented in 2005.

    The number of funded activities has exceeded the target, with a total of 18,675 activities while the
    number of activities that were targeted to be implemented in PPK II was 10,000 activities.

I.  Strengths and weaknesses in KDP II implementation

    By looking at the weaknesses of KDP I implementation, the implementation of KDP II is better.
    During KDP II implementation from 2003 ­ 2006, there are strengths and weaknesses with regards to
    the implementation:

    A. Strengths
         · The performance of KDP II is better compared to the implementation of KDP I. KDP II
             implementation is more transparent and has clearer accountability.
         · KDP II is more consistent in fulfilling the village priority since KDP II is not easily
             influenced by other parties and it also has a more open menu

    B. Weaknesses
         · There was no baseline study to see the impact of community empowerment. KDP II was also
             not doing the social mapping to decide the poor group as the project beneficiaries.
         · The government system used within PPK which is based on the representative system can
             holdup the community participation. Representative system is often more effective in
             delivering information and suggestions from bottom level (village/community members) to
             top level (village government) rather than giving out information top to bottom.
         · The mechanism and institution for observation and accountability is still weak.
         · PPK has a limited ability to involve women in the development process.

II. The Impact of KDP Implementation

    1. PPK brings positive and negative impacts to the village community and village heads' ability for
         working together to decide the development priorities in their villages.




                                                       36

    2. PPK has given lots of skills needed by the community, for example, in how to draft/plan project
         proposals and how to manage projects which will increase village capacity in fulfilling its
         development needs.
    3. PPK has increased women's participation in development.
    4. PPK has been actively involved in overcoming the poverty in the rural level which has been done
         together with the villagers.

III. Appraisal for the World Bank

     1. The problem and challenge encountered by the World Bank in the implementation of PPK is
         about sustainability. World Bank needs to find the solution to this issue. It is expected that PPK
         can improve the sustainability aspect, for example by forming a community group in the village
         or district level based on the universal value, such as honesty, care, willingness, loyalty, kindness,
         etc.
     2. A limited number of sub districts can be funded by the funds lent by the World Bank, resulted in
         the situation not all locations suggested by the local government can get PPK assistance.
     3. It is important to have consistent criteria for the determination of locations between the World
         Bank, PMD and BAPPENAS, to avoid any delays in decision on locations and project
         implementation.
     4. The World Bank has complained to the Direktorat Kelembagaan dan Pelatihan Masyarakat
         (KPM) MOHA (implementing agency) to overcome the following issues: (i) availability of the
         key consultants who are often not available when needed; (ii) the delay in DOK (operational
         fund/allowance) disbursement; (iii) not enough budget for facilitator training; (iv) the
         Management information system which is not yet functioning.

IV. Recommendations

     If in the following years PMD will be responsible for the community empowerment component, then
     it has to maintain the quality of the community empowerment process and the management of the
     facilitators and the consultants. There are few things that need to be improved:

     1. To improve the Secretariat and NMC organization/structure for PPK management.
     2. To change and or to add the number and qualification of consultants who will assist to manage
         the PPK/PNPM Perdesaan.
     3. If the above things cannot be fulfilled by PMD, it should be considered that the management of
         PPK be shifted to another Department which also has community empowerment activities in the
         villages.

If the above alternatives cannot be done, it should be considered to form a new independent organization,
apart from the Department/Ministry which will manage the empowerment.

                  Annex 10. Key Challenges in the Development of the M & E System

Four key challenges in the development of the M&E system were:

   · Ambitious objectives and the wide variety of activities ­ to capture progress towards poverty
       alleviation, setting up of processes to ensure inclusion, open and transparent discourse on
       development priorities, democratic practices, monitoring and evaluation of quality and cost
       effectiveness of a wide variety of outputs of an open menu and multi-sectoral project.
   · Geographical scope and logistics ­ to obtain standard, timely, and useful reports from vast and
       difficult geographical areas, and managing data and reports from a large number of villages
       nation-wide presented enormous data entry and quality-control issues for the MIS.
   · Combating corruption ­ to build into the M&E system measures to detect, prevent and deal with
       corrupt practices.
   · Political change and conflict ­ to continue unscathed through various political events and
       conflicts, and manage monitoring activities in areas where program and monitoring were
       suspended due to insecurities.

Some of the key impacts of these efforts include:

     · Economic empowerment: Women's credit groups supporting economic activities, small savings
         and loans were heard and considered in decision making. A total of 25,000 women's groups were
         supported under the project and a total of 16% of all kecamatan block grants funds (or about



                                                        42

    $39.6 m) was given as loans to women. Women used the credit to finance a limited number of
    traditional enterprises and were provided training, capacity building and skill development which
    were well received. However, the credit program suffered from problems related to difficulty in
    measuring returns, capture of the funds by the better-off, low recovery rates, and limited legal and
    technical advice for small ventures to sustain activities.

· Political empowerment: The socialization process of the project enabled the successful
    involvement and reaching out to women through flexible and innovative methods. The project
    ensured separate meetings for women to help them prioritize their needs and follow up on
    subproject proposals until the final decision stage. The project encouraged women to become part
    of the project implementation teams (TPKs).

Social empowerment: Separate women's proposals ensured greater responsiveness to women's needs.
Women participated but initially many of them were from elite families. Intense and innovative
facilitation saw the participation of more women from poor families. The project had some success in
redefining gender norms and attitudes shaped by tradition, religion and state ideology; with women
being FDs (village facilitators) and members of UPKs, O&M and Monitoring teams. Half of every
village delegation to kecamatan-level decision-making meetings was women. In these positions and
as participants, women's contribution to the success and sustainability of activities was noticeable.
