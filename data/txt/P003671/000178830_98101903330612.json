The first 300\n            MW unit is in operation; the second (also 300 MW) is\n            expected to be in service by the middle of 1970 and the\n            third (375 MW) is in the process of being ordered.\n            Installation of the fourth unit would be completed in late\n            1973. (ii) The addition of two 90 MW generators at the Lower\n            Tachien hydroelectric station which is about 40 km\n            downstream from the site of the Bank-financed Tachien\n            Hydroelectric project. Two 90 MW units at the Lower Tachien\n            station are scheduled to be placed in service during the\n            course of this year. The two additional units would be in\n            service by December 1972. (iii) The provision of 345 kV\n            transmission facilities for the additional generating capacity."}, "docdt": "1970-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
