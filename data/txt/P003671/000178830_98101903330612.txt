SUMUIARY AND CO1NCLUSIONS
i.        This report appraises a project for the expansion of the elec-
tricity system in Taiwan, Republic of China, for which a loan has been re-
quested by the Taiwan Power Company, the Government-owned institution res-
ponsible for electric power throughout the country. A loan of US$44.5
million equivalent to cover the foreign exchange costs of the project, in-
cluding interest during construction, is proposed; it would represent 63%
of the estimated cost of the project. This would be the second loan to
Taipower, the first Loan 574-CHA, having been made in 1968 for an amount of
US$50 million to finance the Tachien Hydroelectric project. Experience
with this loan has been satisfactory to date.
ii.       The electric power system in Taiwan has been expanding at a strong
rate to keep pace with the growing industrialization of the country. Con-
tinued rapid economic development, and correspondingly rapid development of
the power sector, is foreseen. More than US$700 million equivalent will be
spent on the expansion of power facilities during the 1970-1973 project
construction period.  The proposed project would represent 10% of the
cost of the 1970-1973 program.
iii.      The project would consist of the installation of the 375 MW Talin
No. 4 thermal unit (the major item), the Lower Tachien hydroelectric station
No. 3 and No. 4 generators, rated 90 MW each, and the associated 345 kV tran.-
mission facilities.  The project is an essential part of the program to in-
crease generating capacity to meet the anticipated load growth.
iv.       The project is technically sound and the cost reasonable.  The
arrangements planned for engineering and construction are satisfactory and
Taipower is capable of carrying out the project.
v.        Taipower is well-operated and its management and organization is
satisfactory. However, the large expansion program has thrown a heavy burden
on its management. To improve conditions financial consultants are being
engaged under the provisions of Loan 574-CHA, and the proposed loan would
provide funds for engineering consultants to assist with system planning,
and for training.
vi.       The expansion program is straining Taipower's finances and Taipower
is having to resort to a substantial amount of suppliers' credit and medium
term domestic banks financing, in addition to loans from international lending
agencies. As both Taipower's internal cash generation and tariffs are at rea-
sonable levels, it is unlikely that an increased proportion of the funds re-
quired for expansion could be obtained from this source in the near future.
However, the prospects for domestic debt financing at appropriate terms are
encouraging. The Government is currently considering the creation, in the
framework of the banking system, of financial institutions to support infra-
structure investments. In particular, plans are underway for channeling to
Taipower part of the growing public and private savings, and a satisfactory
financing plan for the project construction period, 1970-1973, has been
devised.



- ii -
vii.      The incremental rate of return on the project is estimated to
be about 17%, which is satisfactory.
viii.     The project would form a suitable basis for a loan of US$4h.5
million equivalent for a term of 20 years including 5 years of grace.



I.  DlITRODUCTION
1.01      Taiwan Power Co. (Taipower), a corporation owned principally by
the Government of the Republic of China and responsible for power supply
throughout Taiwan, has asked the Bank for a loan of US$44.5 million equiv-
alent to cover the foreign exchange cost, including interest during cons-
truction, of a project estimated to cost US$71.2 million equivalent. The
project would form part of the power development program in 1970-73, in-
clusive, which is estimated to cost a total of about US$710 million equiv-
alent.
1.02      The project comprises the installation of the 375 Mu Talin No. 4
thermal generating unit (the major item), Nos. 3 and 4 Lower Tachien station
hydroelectric generators, with a capacity of 90 MW each, and associated 315
kV transmission. This would be the second loan to Taipower. The first,
Loan 574-CHA for US$50 million for the Tachien hydroelectric project, was
made in December 1968 and is proceeding satisfactorily.
1.03      The very large scale of Taipower's expansion program arises from
the necessity to make an adequate amount of power available for the rapidly
increasing industrial growth of the country. The program, which includes
the construction of a 604 MW nuclear power plant scheduled for operation in
1975, appears appropriate to the needs of the situation.
1.04      Although the Talin No. 4 unit would be the largest single electric
generating unit yet financed by the Bark, the elements of the proposed pro-
ject are conventional and no special problems are foreseen in carrying it
out.
1.05      This report is based on the findings of a Bank mission composed
of Messrs. D. King, G. Vacchelli, and J. P. Weston which visited Taiwan in
October/November 1969, revised following a visit by Messrs. King and
Vacchelli in February/March 1970.

II. TIE BORROWER
Economic Background
2.01      The island of Taiwan  including a number of small adjacent islandr-:,
has an area of about 36,000 kmk. From north to south the island has a length
of about 425 km and from east to west a maximum width of 150 km. It exper:-
ences a substantial annual rainfall, about 250 cm, most of which falls durinig
the May-October storm season; the October/April period is comparatively dry.
The country is largely mountainous and only 2h% of its area is arable.
2.02      The population at the end of 1968 was 13.7 million, the growth
rate that year amounting to 2.7%. With 380 people per km2 , Taiwan has one
of the highest population densities in the world.
2.03      Taiwan's industrial development has been very rapid in recent yea @
and the Gross National Product (GNP) has experienced an average annual in-
crease of the order of 11% during the past five years. The power sector hai
grown at a commensurately rapid rate, as evidenced by an annual growth of abcut
l5c,;% in the period. Per capita income in 1968 was about US$240 equiv-
alent. In that year industry was responsible for 45% of net domestic pro-
duct and agriculture for 23%.
2.04      Taiwan has few important natural resources and industrial develop-
ment is based primarily on the manufacture and processing of imported raw
materials.  Emphasis in the 1960's has been largely on the production of ,wUh
primary products as chemicals and aluminum. More recently emphasis has
changed to the production of finished goods including textiles and electronic
equipment. Indications are that the fast pace of economic development will
continue. Forecasts of the rate of industrial development, and the rate of
power growth, have traditionally been underestimated. The current four-year
plan, 1969-72 has been conservatively based on a minimum annual increase ir'
GNP of 7%. In 1969 a figure of 10% would have been reached, had it not beers
for the economic impact of several unusually heavy typhoons. As it was, a
growth rate of 8.9% was achieved. A rate of the order of 10% for the next
several years seems quite possible.
Taiwan Power Company
2.05      Taipower was organized in 1946 by the Chinese Government to take
over and operate the system inherited from the Japanese. It is a stock cor-
poration almost wholly owned by the National Government (62%) and the Pro-
vincial Government (33%).
2.06      Policy is determined by an eleven-man Board of Directors, six of
whom are appointed by the National Government, four by the Provincial Gove:rmn-
ment and one by the Bank of Taiwan.  The appointments are for a two-year
period and members may be reappointed.



- 3 -
2.07      The Company's principal officers are the president, and eight vice-
presidents who have functional responsibilities for administration, commercial
activities, engineering, purchasing, personnel, planning, operations and
finance. The president and vice-presidents are appointed by the Ninister of
Economic Affairs on recommendation of the Board of Directors and are normally
drawn from within the Company itself.
2.08      Taipower's capital and operating budgets are submitted annually to
the Legislature for approval through the Minister of Economic Affairs. The
relationship between Government and Taipower is appropriate in that there is
a continuing liaison between Taipower, the Ministry of Economic Affairs, the
Council for Intermational Economic Cooperation and Development (CIECD) which
coordinates foreign assistance in development of the country, and other govern-
ment bodies. This process serves an important purpose in coordinating the
development of the power sector with the rapid industrialization of the
country.
2.09      At present there are approximately 10,500 employees in Taipower,
6,000 of whom are located in the 14 districts throughout the country and
3,000 of whom are engaged in operation of electric plant. Taipower has
approximately 2.1 million customers giving a ratio of 200 customers per
employee. This ratio compares favorably with that of industrialized countriee
2.10      While Taipower is well organized and generally well managed and
operated, the rapid expansion has imposed heavy burdens. Taipower's finan-
cial management is to be bolstered by consultants, which are being engaged
under the provisions of Loan 574-CHA to improve financial planning and systems.
In addition Taipower plans to engage engineering consultants to assist in sys-
tem planning and other technical matters, outside engineering assistance now
being confined to engineering for specific projects.  An amount of US$400,000
equivalent is included in the proposed loan to finance the cost of engineering
consultants and training of management and supervisory personnel in management,
financial, and technical practices.
2.11      Taipower is capable of carrying out the construction program with
the assistance of suitable consulting firms. It has engaged Electroconsult
(Italy) for the Tachien Project (Loan 574-CHA), and Gibbs & Hill (USA) for
Talin No. 3 Unit. The latter will be retained for No. 4 Unit as well.
Bechtel Corp. (USA) has been engaged for the nuclear power station.
Facilities of Taipower
2.12      Taipower had an installed generating capacity at the end of 1969
of 2,225 MW in 10 thermal plants and 27 hydroelectric plants, with aggregate
capacities of 1,524 and 721 !W, 67% and 33% respectively of total capacity.
Thermal capacity is concentrated in the north and south ends of the island.
The hydroelectric installations are located principally in the central and
northern regions where the most important rivers, capable of hydroelectric
development, are found. Annex 1 lists the major generating stations.



2.13      Generating stations and load centers are connected by an extensive
154 kV transmission network to supply the market which is concentrated in the
northern region, including Taipei and Keelung, and the south, including the
Kaohsiung area. Sub-transmission is operated at 69 kV, and 34.5 kV which is
being converted to 69 kV. Distribution voltages include 3.3 kV, 7.5 kV, and
11.4 kV which is replacing the lower voltages.
System Operation
2.14      The Taipower system is operated efficiently, one evidence being
that losses on the transmission and distribution system have been reduced to
the low level of 10%. The major operating problem of Taipower has been the
provision of adequate generating capacity. Load growth has been under-
estimated in recent years so that installed capacity has not quite matched
the demand. For this reason it has been necessary to curtail load from time
to timie, the extent being related to hydrological conditions experienced
during the dry season and the requirements of the generator maintenance pro-
gram.  An estimate of the amount of load curtailed is given in Annex 2. Whil-o
the magnitude of load shedding has been sizeable (41 million kl4h or 0.5% of
sales in 1968) it has not been serious enough to affect the country's in-
dustrial dZvelopment. In this sense, Taipower's capital expenditures on
system experision have been just about at the lowest level consistent with
not jeopardizing development.
Future Expansion Program
2.15      Given the situation described above, the generation expansion pro-
gram must be tailored to provide reserve capacity. Annex 1 includes a list
of the generating stations under construction and in the planning stage,
indicating about a 2700 1W increase of capacity by the end of 1975 - the
year until which planning is definite - or 120% over the installed capacity
of 2245 MW as of the end of 1969.
2.16      The charts contained in Annex 3 show the historical and pros-
pective installed capacity, until 1975, on both a peak load and average
power (energy) basis and the actual and forecast demand; Annex 2 contains
the data for demand. As noted, Taipower has operated in recent years with
less than adequate capacity to provide a reserve for unanticipated load and
maintenance. Conditions for the next several years are going to continue
difficult. With the placing in service of Talin No. 4 unit at the end of
1973, reserve capacity during the dry season (based on the driest year on
record) of about 11% will be available. This is still a small reserve for
a system which has predominantly thermal generating capacity and Taipower
plans to provide for subsequent increases in reserve in the future.
2.17      The proposed nuclear station, rated 604 MW, is scheduled for service
in 1975. Contracts have been awarded for the reactor unit and the generatirg
equipment, financed by loans from the Export-Import Bank of the USA. In
connection with the appraisal of the proposed project, IBRD reviewed the
economic justification of the nuclear facility, concluding that it was jus-
tified given the increment of capacity needed by 1975/76 to meet demand, and



- 5 -
the cost of equivalent conventional thermal capacity. It is likely that
Taipower will continue with additional nuclear power installations after
this first one, although given the rapidity of its load growth, and the
length of time it takes to provide a nuclear power facility, the provision
of additional conventional thermal units might be found necessary. A second
nuclear facility is tentatively planned for 1976.
2.18      The high voltage transmission system is being substantially ex-
panded by the installation of a double circuit 345 kV transmission line
running the length of the island, one circuit of which is to be installed
under Loan 574-CHA. The proposed loan provides funds for the installation
of the second circuit. On completion of this facility there should be
enough 345 kV transmission line capacity for the foreseeable future as
noted in para. 3.09.
2.19      The 154 kV transmission system will be expanded to some extent
each year and there will continue to be a systematic expansion of distrib-
ution facilities. The scale of these transmission and distribution ex-
penditures is very large, in 1970-75 amounting to TJS$410 million equivalent,
54% for transmission and 46% for distribution. The percentages of the total
amount expended on generation, transmission and distribution during this
period are respectively 57%, 23% and 20%, which are reasonable for a power
system on which industrial load is predominant.

III. THE PROJECT
3.01      The proposed project would consist of the construction of the
Talin No. 4 thermal generating unit with a capacity of 375 SW, the major
item of the project, the Nos. 3 and 4 generators, each with a capacity of
90 MW, at the Lower Tachien hydroelectric station, and associated 345 kV
transmission. The project represents about 10% of the cost of Taipower's
expansion program during the 1970-73 project construction period, during
which Taipower expects to place in service 1900 MW of generating capacity.
Talin No. 4 Thermal Generating Unit
3.02      The No. 4 Talin unit would be located at the south end of the
island in proximity to the concentration of industrial development in this
area.  At the site the 300 MW Talin No. 1 is in operation, Talin No. 2 with
an identical capacity is to go into service in mid-1970, and Talin No. 3 with
a capacity of 375 SW has been ordered with financial assistance provided by
suppliers' credits. Talin No. 4 will be of the same size and general char-
acteristics as Talin No. 3. Space will remain at the site for the addition
of one more unit.
3.03      Talin No. 4 will have a capacity of 375 NW. The turbine-generator
will be tandem compound. The boiler will be designed for oil firing only.
3.04      As in the case of the existing units, the electrical system will be
arranged on the unit system basis, as is the mechanical system. The generator,
with a capacity of 440 MVA, will feed into the main step-up transformer rated
450 MVA with high voltage at 154 kV. The output of the unit will be trans-
mitted to the nearby Kaohsiung substation from which point it will be dis-
tributed to the region or stepped up to 345 kV for transmission to other
parts of the island.
3.05      The characteristics of the No. 3 and No. 4 Talin units were
determined on the basis of an economic study of steam conditions carried
out by Taipower and Gibbs & Hill, Inc., their consultants.
Lower Tachien No. 3 and No. 4 Generators
3.06      Installation of these units would complete the station, the
construction of which was financed by AID, Nos. 1 and 2 units being scheduled
for service in 1970. As the major civil works will be completed as part of
the present phase, the installation of Nos. 3 and 4 units will require only
comparatively minor civil works including the penstock, in addition to the
generator, turbine and other equipment.
3.07      The Lower Tachien hydroelectric station is situated on the Tachia
River a short distance downstream from the Tachien hydroelectric project
which is being financed by the Bank under Loan 574-CHA. In this respect
the operation of the Lower Tachien No. 3 and No. 4 units will be coordinated
with that of the other stations on the river which will be regulated by the
storage reservoir to be provided as part of the Tachien project.



3.08      The No. 3 and No. h units would be of the same size and charac-
teristics as Nos. 1 and 2 units, operating under a head of 295 meters, with
Francis type turbines rated at 144,000 hp.  The generator would be rated
at 100,000 KVA and power would be transmitted to the nearby Kukuan switchIag
station for distribution to the main system.
Transnission
3.09      The project will also include the installation of the second 345 kV
circuit on the double circuit transmission line to be provided under Loan
574-CHA (para. 2.18). The line will interconnect Panchiao (near Taipei),
Tienlung (near Kukuan) and Kaohsiung, with a length of 330 km. As part of
this facility a 154/69 kV,120 MVA power transformer and associated equipment
will be installed in the switchyard at the Talin thermal station, and the
Kaokang substation will be expanded by the addition of one transformer bank
of 500 MVA, 345/154 kV. The installation of the second circuit on the 345 kV
line will complete the main trunk transmission system between the north and
south ends of the island, interconnecting all major generating facilities with
the load areas. The transmission capacity thus provided should be adequate
for many years, given that Taipower will continue to locate new therml
generating stations in proximity to the main load areas in the north and sonth
ends of the island (para. 2.12), thus limiting the transfer of power over the
345 kV system to that required for economic system operation and under con-
ditions of emergency. The completion of this facility should result in
economies in Taipower's production and improve service security.
Management Consulting Services and Training
3.10      The project also includes the provision of technical and financial
management consulting and training services, as noted in para. 2.10.

3.12      The total cost of the project is estimated to be US$71.2 million.
The proposed loan of US$44.5 million is the estimated foreign exchange cost
of the project comprising the cost of equipment for Talin No. 4, the trans-
mission facility, Lower Tachien Nos. 3 and 4, consulting and training servicess
and interest during construction of US$4.7 million. The loan would re-
present 63% of the estimated cost of the project and about 6% of the total
construction expfnditures planned by Taipower during the project construction
period.
Basis of Cost 7stimates
3.13      The cost estimate includes US$8.4 million equivalent for custom
duties on the equipment to be imported, reflecting an average levy of about
20%.  Customs duties are not included in the loan amount, are payable by
Taipower in local currency, and are shown as a local cost.
3.14      The cost estimate for the Talin No. 4 unit was prepared jointly
by Taipower and Gibbs & Hill, their consultants, and adjusted to reflect
the bids received for the turbo-generator and boiler for Talin No. 3 unit.
In view of the latter only a nominal amount of 5% has been included for
contingencies on the generator and boiler; 10% for contingencies has been
allowed for the remaining equipment. Eleven percent has been allowed for
contingencies on civil works, which should be adequate as Taipower has
considerable experience in estimating construction costs and erecting
thermal plants.
3.15      The unit cost of Talin No. 4 exclusive of customs duties and
interest is US$108 per kW. This is a reasonable price for a unit of this
size and characteristics.
3.16      The cost estimate for Nos. 3 & 4 Lower Tachien units was made
by Taipower on the basis of the cost of Nos. 1 & 2 units. It includes a
contingency amount of 10% on the foreign exchange cost and 15% on the local
cost, which is adequate. The incremental cost of the units is US$50 per kJv.
excluding customs duties and interest. This is a very low cost for capacity,
reflecting of course that the major civil works have already been carried
out as part of the Nos. 1 & 2 unit construction phase.
3.17      The cost estimate for the second 345 kV transmission line and
substations was projected by Taipower from the estimates for the transmission
facility financed under Loan 574-CHA (para. 3.09). The cost estimate includes
an amount of 10% for contingencies on the foreign exchange component, which
is adequate.
Engineering, Construction and Scheduling
3.18      Engineering and design of Talin No. 4 will be carried out by Gibbs
& Hill, a highly experienced firm in this field, which is already undertaking
this responsibility for Talin No. 3 unit. Construction will be undertaken by
Taipower, which has had a large amount of experience with thermal plant con-
struction. Taipower and Gibbs & Hill will supervise construction. These
arrangements are satisfactory.



- 10 -
3.19      In view of the urgent need for Talin No. 4 unit to meet antici-
pated load growth, it is scheduled for service at the beginning of 1974.
This entails a minimum delivery period for a unit of this large capacity but
it should be possible to meet this date.
3.20      No additional engineering is required for Lower Tachien Nos. 3 & h
units, since they duplicate the first two. Taipower plans to have the civil
works for Lower Tachien Nos. 3 & 4, which are of a minor scale, carried out
by force account. The units are scheduled for service towards the end of
1972.
3.21      The 345 kV transmission circuit to be financed by the proposed loan
will be installed under the contract which will be awarded for the transmis-
sion facility to be constructed under Loan 574-CHA, its costs being segre-
gated for the purpose of loan administration. The transmission facilities
will be designed by Taipower with the assistance of their transmission con-
sultants, Commonwealth Engineering Services (USA). The latter will also
supervise construction. The transmission line is scheduled for service in
1973, prior to the commissioning of Talin No. 4.
3.22      With respect to the arrangements for engineering and construction
(para. 3.18 and 3.21) s=d general engineering consultants (para. 2.10)
assurances have tbeen obtatned during negotiatier.@ that Taipevor will omploy
engineering consultants and contractors acceptable to the Bank, on terms
and conditions satisfactory to it.
Procurement and Disbursement
3.23      Procurement of goods financed by the loan would be on the basis of
international cormetiti-vre bidding except for coi-iponents as may be required to
be compatible with existing equipment and items of minor cost for which such
bidding will be impractical. Disbursements would be made for the full foreign
exchange cost of the equipment imported and services provided. No disburce-
ments would be made for expenditures made prior to signing of the proposed
loan. It is envisaged that any surplus loan amounts remaining on completioi
of the proiect would be cancelled.

IV. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION
Load Growth
4.01      Actual and forecast sales for the period 1967-75 are given in
Annex 2. This Annex also shows the potential sales which might have been
realized in 1967 and 1968 had it not been necessary to shed load. Actual
sales have increased at an average rate of 15% annually since 1963. They
are forecast to grow at an average annual rate of about 13% until 1975.
4.02      Taipowsr estimates sales using the projection of trends, by in-
vestigation of plans of the major industrial users, and by the correlation
of load growth with expected economic development. Since 1963 Gross
National Product (GNP) has increased at an average rate of 11.1% per annum
in real terms. The Governmentts fifth four-year plan, 1969-72 plans for the
maintenance of a minimum economic growth rate of 7% annually. The Council
for International Economic Cooperation and Development (para. 2.08) is pre-
dicting an average growth rate of 9.7% over the period. A 10% rate of growth
was maintained in 1969 until reduced to 8.9% by the occurrence of two typhoons
in October. Taipower has been advised by the Government to use a 9.7% annuaL
increase in GNP in correlating load growth forecasts with economic activity.
4.03      As noted in Annex 2 power sales are sub-divided into the categories
lighting consumers and power consumers, the former corresponding to domestic
and small commercial consumer sales. The forecast of lighting consumer sales
was prepared on the basis of past trends. The correlation between forecast
sales and forecast national income projections was found to be very close to
that which existed between past sales and past national income performance.
The average rate of growth for lighting consumer sales, 1963-69 was almost
19% annually and is forecast to grow at an annual rate of 15.7% until 1975.
Lighting sales increased from 18.J% of total sales in 1963 to 22.6% in 1969
and are forecast to increase to 26.2% in 1975. In the five year period 1963-
68, lighting sales per consumer increased by 70%; this is more than propor-
tionate to the increase in per capita income (by 40% from 1963 to 1968), re-
flecting also a concurrent shift toward the higher consumption levels met in
more developed societies. In this respect, Taipower's investigations include
the growth in use of various household appliances in terms of population,
household units and income.
4.04      For purposes of forecasting, sales to power consumers comprising
industrial and large commercial users are sub-divided into small and large
power. The forecast of small power consumption was estimated on the basis
of past trends and future economic growth. The short term projection of
large power was based on a survey of expectations of the major industrial
plants until 1971, and the forecast for subsequent years on a study of trends
and the projection of economic performance. The estimates of large and smal_
power sales were then combined, indicating an average growth rate of about l12'o
annually until 1975, compared with an annual growth rate of about 1U% in 1969d;e



- 12 -
4.05      On the basis of the foregoing the forecast of a total sales growth
averaging about 13% annually until 1975 is reasonable and well-founded. It
is a high rate of growth and would be sensitive to change in the present
economic outlook. In this respect, any change in load growth would more
likely be on the downward side. From an operational standpoint this would
result in providing a greater reserve capacity, which in itself is not un-
desirable (para. 2.16); moreover, in the event of a significant downward
turn the expansion program could be adjusted quickly so that the financial
situation would not be too adversely affected.
Economic Alternatives
4.06      The Talin No. 4 unit represents the most appropriate and economic
means of meeting the additional load forecast. The fact that the facility
required for this purpose must be a base load unit, to provide energy at high
plant factor - the system load factor is about 68% - precludes the construc-
tion of a hydroelectric plant since there are no sites with the characteris-
tics required; in any case, a hydroelectric station would take much longer
to construct. A 500 MW conventional thermal unit was considered as an alter-
native to the 375 SW Talin No. 4. However, the much longer manufacturing
period required for the larger unit, which only a few manufacturers are
capable of supplying, obviates its use. thile Taipower is planning a nuclear
unit for service in 1975, the need for capacity in 1973 precluded use of a
nuclear unit to supply the load at that time as it takes at least two years
longer to manufacture and commission a nuclear power unit than it does for
a conventional thermal unit of the size of Talin No. 4.
4.08      The installation of the No. 3 and No. 4 units at Lower Tachien
hydroelectric station is a logical means of providing additional peak gener-
ating capacity. As noted in para. 3.16 the unit cost is estimated at US$50
per kW. No other means of providing peak capacity could approach this; the
cost of the cheapest alternative, a gas turbine, being in the neighborhood
of US$90-US$100 per kW. Such a unit would also carry higher operating costs.
The completion of the Lower Tachien generating station will bring the total
cost to US$60 million, giving an installed cost of uS$168/kW (excluding
taxes), compared with the US$50 per kW for completion of the station noted
above, and reflecting the fact that the major construction cost, the civil
works, have already been borne (para. 3.16).
The Incremental Rate of Return
4.09      The incremental rate of return for Talin No. 4 unit is considered
to be the discount rate at which the present worth of the costs of the
facility, including operating charges, is equal to the benefits obtained from
it, over the life of the project, the computation being net of transfer pay-
ments. The capital charges include the cost of Talin No. 4, the associated
345 kV transmission facility to be constructed as part of the project, and
the estimated cost of other transmission facilities and distribution facili-
ties required to transmit and distribute the power generated by Talin No. 4.



- 13 -
Fuel is the most important cperat+ing cost and a price of US$15 per ton, which
Taipower would pay if taxes were excluded has been assumed. This assumpticxo
may tend to underestimate the return since the cost of fuel to the economy
may be less given that it is available in Indonesia at US$10 per ton and
conceivably Taipower could purchase it for about US$13 per ton on the open
market if it were not purchased from the Government-owned China Petroleum
Company.
4.1o      The benefits from the project are calculated on the basis of the
cost savings realized from the initial displacement of less efficient gener-
ating plant and the subsequent revenues from the supply of new load. The
revenue per kWh of 1.h3 US cents assumed is the average figure expected for
1970-75. The revenues thus estimated can also be considered conservative
inasmuch as the long term trend may be toward increasing tariffs. There is
little likelihood of reducing them in view of their comparatively low level
(para. 5.04).
4.11      On this basis a rate of return of about 17% is indicated.  Since
some of the assumptions are conservatively based, the rate of return may well
be higher. Moreover, there is reason to believe that the value of the
electric energy to the consumer is greater than the price charged, so that
the true return is likely higher. The indicated return is considered satis-
factory.

V. FINANCIAL ASPECTS
Background
5.01      The very rapid pace at which fixed assets are being acquired has
been, and will continue to be, the most striking feature of Taipower's finan-
ces. Facilities in operation or under construction at the end of 1969 totaled
about US$770 million, or double those at the end of 1963. Over the next five
years they are expected to double again, since the sustained rapid growth of
the market and the capital intensive nature of the industry will require ii1-
vestments in the order of US$165 million per year through 1975. To finance
such an expansion program would be a challenge under any circumstances. In
early 1968, when the Bank first appraised Taipower, it was becoming particu-
larly difficult because of (i) a regulatory set-up not geared to cope with
the Company's expansion needs and (ii) the lack of a domestic capital market.
Legislation restricted earnings to a long-term average of 6% on average net
fixed assets minus outstanding debt. Equivalent to a return on equity, this
level was clearly inadequate in Taiwan's economy. Moreover, a consequence of
the peculiarities of the rate formula was that increasing borrowings resulted,
other things being equal, in lowering the ceiling on earnings, 1/thus widen-
ing the Company's resource gap. On the other hand, CIECD -- at that time
Taipower's only domestic lending source -- could no longer be expected to
provide financing in the amount required because of the greatly increased
claims on its limited supply of funds.
5.02      Therefore, to make possible continued expansion at the high rates
projected, Taipower and the Government agreed with the Bank on measures aimed
at developing new sources of financing.  The most important step was the re-
cognition that, in the absence of financial intermediaries responsive to
Taipower's needs, retained earnings would have to play a major role in finan-
cing the acquisition of new assets. To make this possible, new legislation
was enacted, allowing Taipower to earn up to 12% on its rate base; should tle
return fall below 9.5%, tariffs could be increased without any further govein-
mental action. Furthermore, agreement was reached with the Bank on an inde-
pendent test of revenue adequacy, based on a conventional rate of return con-
cept (operating income/average net fixed assets plus working capital). This
test was to be placed in operation in two steps: a return of at least 9.5%
had to be achieved in 1970, and 10% in 1971 and thereafter. The proposed
loan agreement provides for a 10% rate of return. WIhile these measures were
aimed at obtaining a reasonable level of internal cash generation, it was
also clear that CIECD lending had to be supplemented by other sources. A
line of credit was therefore negotiated with two of the major local banks,
the Bank of Taiwan (BOT) and the Bank of Communications (BOC). Under this
credit facility, Taipower could draw up to about US$100 million equivalent,
at an interest rate of 10%; each annual disbursement would be amortized over
13 years, including 3 years of grace. These conditions represented a sub-
stantial improvement over traditional commercial bank financing in China.
V/ Because borrowings were deducted from assets to determine the rate base.



- 15 -
5.03      In connection with Loan 57h-CHA, it was also found desirable to
strengthen Taipower's long term financial planning. The Company is in the
process of hiring consultants to review its financial organization and tech-
niques. In addition it is contemplated that the consultants would review
aspects of the operation bearing on the improvement of Taipower's revenues,
including plant account, depreciation rates (see also para. 5.06) and so
forth. Taipower's staff will be responsible for implementing the consultantis
recommendations under their supervision, and a training program will be set
up to this effect. Under the provisions of Loan 574-CHA the Company, sub-
ject by law to Govermment audit, has in addition hired independent auditors;
the covenant has been repeated in the proposed Loan Agreement.
The Current Situation
Revenues
5.04      The legislative action described in para. 5.02 was followed in
July, 1969 by a tariff increase: as agreed with the Bank, Taipower was
allowed to retain for its own account, and incorporate into its tariffs, a
tax on electricity consumption, which the Company had been collecting for
the Government. This was equivalent to nearly a 10% increase in tariffs
from Taipower's viewpoint, although prices to consumers remained unaffected,
In 1969, average realization from sales was about NT$0.5h/kWh, or the equiv-
alent of US1.35 cents/kwh. This level is low by developing countries' stand-
ards: it is explained by the very high proportion of industrial load (see
Amnex 2) and by the efficiency of operations (see also paras. 2.09 and 2.1').
By and large, the structure of tariffs appears to be in line with the
structure of costs to supply various classes of customers. Some minor dis-
tortions are gradually being corrected.
Recent Performance and Financial Position
5.05      Taipower's performance in 1969 has been satisfactory.  (See Annex
5 for Actual and Forecast Income Statements, 1965-1975). Boosted by a 15%
increase in sales and by the tariff adjustment, operating income increased
by 34%, and a satisfactory 10.2% rate of return was achieved on the rate
base defined under Loan 574-CIIA. Net internal cash generation represented
45% of the year's construction expenditures, which, however, lagged some-
what behind the program planned. The debt/equity ratio decreased to 49%,
reflecting the satisfactory level of earnings; the ratio of current assets
to current liabilities improved to 1.4 as of December 31, 1969. Customers'
accounts receivable continued to decline in relation to billed sales: only
18 days sales in 1969, down from 21 days in 1967 and 1968. While in part
due to the high proportion of industrial sales, this low level is an in-
dication of the efficiency of Taipower's monthly billing/collection cycle.
The cash position was adequate, and inventories and fuel reserves were
maintained at satisfactory levels.



- 16 -
Fixed Assets and Depreciation Policy
5.06      Gross fixed assets in operation as of December 31, 1969 were
NT$25.3 billion, about US$631 million equivalent. (See Annex 7 for Actual
and Forecast Balance Sheets, 1965-1975). Present book values of assets re-
flect an appraisal in 195h at then current prices, and a revaluation carried
out in 1961 on the basis of the Taipei wholesale price index.  Further ad-
justments to book values have not been made since then, because prices have
remained remarkably stable: the movement of the index through 1969 has been
equivalent to a 1.6% annual compound increase. Should it accelerate, a re-
valuation would be carried out, and a provision to this effect has been built
in the rate of return covenant under Loan 574-CHA.  Depreciation is calcula-
ted on a straight line basis; the composite rate was 3.1% in 1969. In
addition, annual charges are increased proportionately to the price index
increase over the year in which assets were acquired. Such additional
charges are credited to a reserve against possible revaluations of assets.
While depreciation charges have so far been adequate, there has not been a
formal understanding between Taipower and the Government on an appropriate
level of rates. Under the proposed loan therefore, Taipower is required to
have its financial consultants carry out a review of the depreciation polic-T
by October 1, 1970, and to implement new depreciation rates subject to Bankfs
approval by the end of 1970.

various surplus and reserve accounts represented about 48% of total capital-
ization. The Government had long followed a policy of reinvesting in Tai-
power the dividends on its shareholdings and the income tax payable by the
Company on its earnings. These amounts are held as "advances to be con-
verted in capital stock", and conversion will take place in 1970. To main-
tain the existing balance betwieen the Government and other shareholders
(95%/5%) an amount of new stock proportionate to the increase in government
shareholdings will be offered at par to the other shareholders. From 1970
on, the Government will collect and retain the income tax, while receiving
its dividends in the form of additional stock.  The increase in government
shareholdings is actually equivalent to an accumulation of earned surplus,
because all income remaining after allocations to the statutory reserves
is made available for dividends (paid in cash on private shares). Tai-
power's equity is completed by various reserves (see note 12 to Annex 5)
and the provision for additional depreciation described in para. 5.06,
equivalent to about 1% of total capitalization.
5.09      As of December 31, 1969 long term debt including current matu-
rities represented about 51% of total capitalization. The aggregate amourt
was about NT$13 billion (US$325 million equivalent), of which about NT$7.4
billion was in foreign exchange and about NT$5.6 billion in local currency
(US$186 million and US$139 million respectively). Outstanding obligations
under various US aid programs, administered by CIECD, totaled about NT$7..5
billion, (US$187 million equivalent) reflecting the high dependency on this
source in the past. Part of these debts are repayable in US dollars and part
in local currency, in some of the latter cases with maintenance-of-value.
The terms of the US-origin financing vary from 3.5% to 10% and from 15 to
30 years. Although the US aid programs were terminated in 1966, funds
accruing from repayments in local currency constitute the Sino-American
Fund for Economic Development (SAFED), also administered by CIECD, and have
been available for relending.  Other debts, both domestic and foreign, aggr&--
gating about NT$5.5 billion, included a small initial disbursement under
Loan 574-cHA (NT$16 million), loans from the U.S. Export Import Bank (Exim-
bank), supplierst credits, etc. An important source of local funds is the
deferment of customs duties, granted interest-free by the Ministry of Finae cc
for extended periods depending on the amount of the duties.  Further detai-'
including the terms of outstanding long term debts, are presented in Annex 7
page 2.
5.10      Although the level of debt, at 51% of total capitalization, iE lt-
particularly high, some of its characteristics are a cause for concern. As
noted, Taipower's traditional sources of longer-term debt financing are
either no longer available (US aid programs) or cannot play a major role ii
the future (CIECD/SAFED). The Company is therefore forced increasingly to
borrow from medium, or medium-short term sources, such as suppliers' credits,
which have increased almost fourfold in the last two years, and, of course,
the banking system. The financing of the next few years' expansion programi
relies heavily on borrowings of less than 15 years term, which is not enrire-
ly appropriate for an electric utility. Possible solutions are being ex-
plored by the Chinese authorities (see para. 5.15).

The Financing Plan
5.11      Taipower's construction program, now defined in reasonable detail
through 1975, is described in paras. 2.15-2.19 and summarized in Annex 6, page.
2. In the 1970-75 six-year period, its cost including interest charged to
constructIon would amount to about US$1.1 billion equivalent, or 1.7 times
the gross value of plant in service at the end of 1969. A detailed State-
ment of Sources and Applications of Funds for the whole 1970-1975 period is
presented in Annex 6; the analysis of the following paragraphs will, however,
focus on the 1970-1973 financing plan, which covers the period of construc-
tion of the project proposed for Bank financing. During this four-year
period construction expenditures including interest during construction would
total about US$740 million equivalent.  The financing would be provided 30%
by net internal cash generation; 7% by other self-generated resources, con-
tributions, and new equity; and 63% by foreign and domestic borrowings. The
proposed arrangements would be satisfactory and they may be improved in the
future as described in para. 5.15. The following table summarizes the finan-
cing plan 1970-1973.

5.12      Internal cash generation net of debt service and cash dividends,
would, as noted, provide about 30% of the investment requirements during
1970-1973, and the proportion would increase to 35% during 1970-1975. Con-
tinuation of the current Government policy of reinvesting dividends would
result in a substantial source of funds, equivalent to about 18% of cons-
truction expenditures in 1970-1973. During negotiations the Government's
commitment to this policy through 1982 was confirmed and formalized in a
covenant under the proposed loan agreement. In terms of the investment re-
quirements, another 3.3% would be raised from disposal of salvaged assets.
1.8% from the sale of stock to private shareholders, and 4% from customers'
contributions. In the aggregate, these sources would cover about 37% of
the requirements, net of an adequate increase in working capital, and Tai-
power's own net resources would represent about 32% of construction ex-
penditures; this represents a substantial improvement in financing since
the Bank became involved.
5.13      The remaining 63% of the construction program would have to be
financed through borrowings, more than half of which would be in foreign
exchange. These would include:
Foreign Exchange
(i)  disbursements under the proposed Bank loan of
US$44.5 million equivalent3
(ii) disbursements under Loan 574-CHA;
(iii)  disbursements under the US$63 million Eximbank
loan (15-year plus 6 of grace, 6% interest)
financing the first nuclear facility now under
construction;
(iv) suppliers' credits, for a total of about US$80
million, at terms comparable to the existing
ones; and
(v)  disbursements under other loans and credits,
including financing for the planned second
nuclear facility;
Local Currency
(vi) SAFED loans, at 25 years and 10% interest, for
a total of about US$28 million equivalent (see
para. 5.14);
(vii)  drawings from the Bank of Taiwan (BOT) and the
Bank of Communications (BOC), at 10 years plus
3 of grace and 10% interest, totaling about
US$105 million equivalent (see para. 5.15); and
(viii)  deferment of customs duties, amounting to about
US$50 million equivalent.

5.14      Satisfactory assurances have been received from CIECD/SAFED that
a minimum of NT$800 million would be made available to Taipower through 1972,
to be increased to NT$1.1 billion if the need arises.  In view of SAFED's in-
creasing commitment to social development, it is unlikely that it could con-
tinue to play a major role in the financing of the power sector beyond 1972.
As noted in the following paragraph, the BOC might by then assume this role.
5.15      In connection with the proposed loan, satisfactory assurances have
been obtained that: a) the existing BOT/BOC NT$3.9 billion credit facility
would be disbursed to suit Taipower's requirements as forecast at present;
and b) an additional NT$1 billion would be made available to Taipower through
the banking system, to complete the local currency financing required in 1973
and 1974 (see also para. 5.02). As noted in para. 5.10, it would have been
preferable to rely less on banking system financing because of shorter than
desirable maturities. The present undertaking is, however, in the spirit of
providing firm assurances of funds' availability; in fact, the Government is
at present actively pursuing several plans to channel private and public
savings to development projects. A new lending institution is to be created,
possibly by amending the statutes of the BOC, to replace CIECD/SAFED in the
long term financing of infrastructure and industrial projects. Taipower could
expect to borrow sizeable amounts from the new institution, the funding of
which would be assured as follow7s:
(i)  it would be authorized to float tax-exempt
development bonds;
(ii)  it would administer the amounts deposited
in postal savings accounts, boosted by a
recent successful campaign; and
(iii)  it would receive Government allocations
from budgetary surpluses.
Expected Performance
5.16      Forecast financial performance would be satisfactory.  The rate
of return, under the formula prescribed by Loan 574-CHA (see para. 5.02),
is expected to be 11.2p in 1970 and 11.0% or higher thereafter, and would
thus exceed the minimum required level of 10%. Average revenue per kWh
is expected to increase gradually to NT$0.58 by 1975 because of the re-
latively higher proportion of total sales residential consumption is ex-
pected to assume in the future. Appropriate assumptions have been made
about the level of operating expenses; in the aggregate, they would de-
crease in relation to sales, reflecting more efficient operations not
only through larger size generating units and EHV transmission, but also
general economies of scale.



- 22 -
Debt Limitation Covenant
5.17      Under the provisions of Loan 574-CHA Taipower has agreed not to
incur debt unless it meets a debt service coverage test of 1.5 times as a
minimum, measured by comparing current net revenues (before provision for
depreciation) to maximum future service on debt drawn down. This test was
met in 1969, and the covenant has been maintained in the proposed loan
agreements.
Expected Financial Position
5.18      The forecast financial position is satisfactory.  The financing
plan provides for adequate increases in working capital and for the main-
tenance of a satisfactory cash position. The ratio of current assets to
current liabilities would remain at or above unity notwithstanding the in-
creasing current portion of long term debt. On an annual basis debt ser-
vice coverage by internal cash generation would be ample (at least 1.7
times). The debt/equity ratio, after reaching a 56/44 peak in 1972, would
decrease to 52/48 by 1975, reflecting the satisfactory level of retained
earnings.

VI. AGTREEMENTS REACHED MURING NEGOTIATIONS
6.01      During negotiations with representatives of the Chinese Govern-
ment and Taipower in March 1970, assurances were received that:
(i) Taipower will retain on or before December 31,
1970, qualified engineering consultants to ad-
vise on system planning and development (para.
2.10);
(ii) qualified engineering consultants and con-
tractors will be employed in carrying out the
project (para. 3.18 and 3.21);
(iii) Taipower will have its financial management
consultants (para. 5.03) review its depre-
ciation rates by October 1, 1970, and, with
Bank agreement on the rates recommended,
put them in force before December 31, 1970
(para. 5.06); and
(iv) the Government will continue through 1982 to
reinvest in Taipower the dividends on its
shareholdings (para. 5.12).
6.02      The undertakings agreed upon under Loan 574-CHA were also con-
firmed, in particular that:
(i)  a rate of return of not less than 10% would
be achieved on currently valued net fixed assets
in operation increased by an appropriate working
capital allowance (para. 5.02);
(ii) qualified indepedent auditors are retained (para.
5.03); and
(iii)  no long term debt would be incurred, unless ma-
ximum total future debt service is covered 1.5
times by current internal cash generation (para.
5.17).

1/ In 1967 it was necessary to shed load by an estimated amount of 201 GNTh or 2.6% of potential sales because
of lack of capacity; in 1968 figures were 41 GlTh or 0.5% respectively.  This problem was not encountered
in 1969.  In period 1963-66 load shedding was estimated to range from 0% (1964) to 3.7% (163).
2/ Taipower's 1971 load growth is lower than in other years because a large block of the Taiwan Aluminum Co.    N
(TALCO) requirements, previously supplied by Taipower wiill, starting that year, be supplied by TALCO itself.

Notes to Income Statements
1/  The rate base is composed of:  (a) average net fixed assets in
operation; plus (b) a working capital allowance equal to 2.5% of
(a), plus 11.5% of cash operating expenses.
2/  Sales of energy are shown net of company consumption (49 GWh in
1969).
3/  The increase in average revenue per ktrh in 1969 and 1970 is due
mostly to the tariff adjustment described in para. 5.04, effective
July 1, 1969. Further increases result from shifts in the composi-
tion of demand (see also para. 5.16).
4i 5% of accrued customers' contributions per books, including the
year's addition, is transferred to this account; consequently the
funds statement and the balance sheet show only net amounts. The
other principal component of this item is meter rentals.
5/  Through 1969 this acc           ded materials (about two thirds of
the total), labor ana           ocated costs.  From 1970 on, the
labor component is accounted for under "Salaries."
6/  This item includes purchased power, general expenses, insurance,
research and other minor expenses.
7/  The principal taxes paid by Taipower are:
(a) Sales tax: 6 per thousand of revenues
from power and other sales, plus 15% of
other revenues, plus an additional 30%
of the amount of the tax so determined;
(b) Stamp tax: 4% on all revenues and
annual customerst contributions;
(c) A number of property taxes on land,
buildings and net fixed assets, at
rates varying between 6% and 2%.
(d) Taxes and surtaxes at various rates
on motor vehicles.
8/ Income tax is paid at an effective rate after adjustments of 15-16%
of net income. The proceeds of the tax accrue 80% to the National
Government and 29% to the Provincial Government.



ANNE 5
Page 3 of 3
9/ The figures shown in the Income Statement for depreciation include
the additional depreciation for unrecorded appreciation of assets
described in paragraph 5.06. Depreciation allowances for a coal
mine owned by Taipower are treated as part of the coal cost and
therefore included under "Fuel". They are properly taken into
account in the funds statement and in the balance sheet.
10/ Taipower charges to plant the interest accruing during construction
on the loans financing the specific projects; the amounts so deter-
mined are added to the work in progress as of year end.
11/ In lieu of dividends, a 2.5% interest was accrued on Government's
reinvestments not yet converted in stock. These amounts, con-
sidered as interest expense for the purpose of income determination,
were also reinvested.
12/ Taipower follows rather rigid rules for the disposition of profits.
The legal reserve is credited 10% of net income before income tax.
Until 1968, all income above the 6% return (then required by re-
gulations) had to be allocated to a "Reserve for Rate Equalization"
to compensate for possible future returns lower than 6%. In 1969,
the amount credited to this reserve was transferred to the "Reserve
for Power Development", where, under the new regulations described
in para. 5.02, all income above the 10% return would so accrue.
Credits to the "Reserve for Exchange Adjustment", previously made
at a rate of NT$30 million per year, are subject now to new rules.
The allocations should be equal to 7% of outstanding long term debt
minus the accumulated provision for additional depreciation des-
cribed in para. 5.o6. The balance of net income after allocations
to reserves is available for distribution as dividends to private
stockholders (in cash) and to the National and Provincial Govern-
ments (in stock). Distribution reached about 28% of par value in
1969, and has been between 15% and 20g since 1963. In 1970, howe-
ver, it would drop to 13.8% because of the massive capital increase
which will result when the "Advances" will be converted to stock
(see para. 5.o8). For the future, distributions of around 14% would
be possible.
13/ The formula prescribed by Loan 574-CHA and used here to calculate
the rate of return is very similar to the one used by Taipower in
preparing internal statements for management information according
to what they call "tF.P.C." method, a reference to U.S. Federal
Power Commission. It consists of comparing operating income, before
interest charges, to the rate base described in note 1/.

Notes to Sources and Applications of Funds
(*)    All nei, customers are requ-.red to pay a connection charge.  If
substantial new facilities are required to provide the service,
the customer must in addition contribute 70% of the actual
construction cost, plus a fixed fee based upon the Company's
overheads (see also note 4 to Annex 5).
(OF0)   In calculating net internal cash generation - and the rate of
self-financing, debt service and cash dividends are sub-
tracted from internal cash generation. However interest
charged to construction has been considered part of the
construction expenditures, and has not therefore been
included in the debt service.
