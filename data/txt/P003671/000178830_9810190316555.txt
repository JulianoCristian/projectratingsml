INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOIENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE TAIWAN POWER COMPANY
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan in an amount in various currencies equivalent to $44.5 million to
the Taiwan Power Company (Taipower).
PART I - HISTORICAL
2.        The Government of the Republic of China and Taipower have
asked the Bank for a $44.5 million loan to finance the foreign exchange
costs of a project consisting of the installation of (i) about 550 MW
of new generating capacity; and (ii) the associated transmission
facilities. The Borrower would be Taipower - a stock corporation owned,
almost wholly, by the National and Provincial Governments and falling
under the supervision of the Ministry of Economic Affairs.
3.        Negotiations were conducted in Washington on March 16 and 17,
1970. The Government was represented by Mr. Martin Wong, the Economic
Minister at the Chinese Embassy. Taipower was represented by Messrs.
L.K. Chen (President), Stephen C.C. Chen (Director, Accounting Depart-
ment), and K.C. Ling (Director, Power Development Department).
4.        The proposed loan would be the Bank's second to Taipower.  A
$50.0 million loan (574 CHA) was made in December 1968 and is helping
to finance the construction of the 234 MW hydroelectric Tachien Dam
project and related transmission facilities. The civil works are under
way and contracts for major items of equipment are in the course of
being awarded. Disbursements as of February 28, 1970 totalled $2.8
million and progress on the project to date has been satisfactory.
5.        The following is a summary statement of Bank loans and IDA
credits to China as at February 28, 1970:

6.        A Bank loan of $18.0 million to the China Development Corpora-
tion is scheduled to be considered by the Executive Directors on April 7,
1970.
7.        Disbursements on three loans - those for the first and second
railway projects (409 CHA and 524 CHA) and the telecommunications project
(506 CHA) are behind schedule and their closing dates have been postponed.
The first railway loan included financing for a new marshalling yard and
considerable delays in the acquisition of land for it held up completion
of the necessary design work and, consequently, procurement.  In addition,
under both the above railway loans the award of a number of contracts has
been slower than expected.  This is partly attributable to the complexity
of the Goverrmentts procurement procedures which was not fully appreciated
when the original procurement schedules were drawn up. This factor has
been given attention in the case of the third railway loan (603 CHA) and
its procurement and disbursement schedules are expected to be followed



- 3 -
reasonably closely. A procurement problem of a different nature has
affected the telecommunications loan (506 CHA). The Directorate General
of Telecommunications (DGT) invited tenders for a major contract,
involving exchange and toll switching equipment, on schedule. DGT, how-
ever, deviated from the Bank's guidelines for procurement during the
evaluation of the bids. The contract had to be retendered, causing a
delay of about a year.
8.        A loan for an education project in China is at an advanced
stage of processing and I expect to present it shortly for consideration
by the Executive Directors.
PART II - DESCRIPTION OF THE PROPOSED LOAN
9.        Borrower:            Taiwan Power Company
Guarantor:           The Republic of China
Amount:              The equivalent in various currencies
of $44.5 million
Purpose:             To finance the foreign exchange cost
of the installation of (i) a 375 MW
thermal unit at Talin; (ii) two hydro-
electric generators each of 90 MW
capacity at the Lower Tachien Station;
and (iii) associated 3h5 kV trans-
mission facilities.
Amortization:        In 20 years, including a 5-year grace
period through 32 semi-annual install-
ments beginning April 15, 1975 and
ending October 15, 1990.
Interest Rate:       7% per annum
Commitment Charge:  3/4 of 1% per annum
PART III - THE PROJECT
10.       A report entitled "Appraisal of the Second Power Project -
Taiwan Power Company - Republic of China", (No. PU-29a) on the proposed
project is attached.
11.       The demand for electricity in Taiwan has grown steadily in the
last few years. The output of the industrial sector, which consumes
about 75% of the power generated, increased at an average annual rate of
16% during the sixties; consequently its power requirements rose sub-
stantially. The demand on the part of domestic consumers has also shown



- 4 -
a pronounced upward trend in recent years as the power system was extended
to cover more of the countryside and the use of appliances became more
widespread; during the five years 1963-68 electricity sales to domestic
and small-scale commercial consumers more than doubled. Total power
demand, which has been frequently underestimated in the past, rose at the
rate of nearly 15% per annum during this period; it is expected to
continue to grow by about 13% per annum through 1975.
12.       Taipower has been expanding rapidly to keep pace with this
rising demand. The value of its assets in operation and under construc-
tion doubled to a level of about $770 million during the six years
1964-69. These investments have prevented serious power shortages. How-
ever, Taipower operates with less than adequate reserve capacity to meet
unforeseen load and maintenance requirements. The correction of this
deficiency and the further enlargement of Taipower's system to meet
future demand will require substantial expenditures during the next few
years.
13.       Taipower has drawn up a development program which over the
next four years (1970-73) envisages: (i) a total expenditure of about
$740 million equivalent: (ii) an increase of about 85% in its generating
capacity (from 2,200 P1W to 4,100 1WJ); and (iii) the expansion and
improvement of its transmission and distribution systems.
14.       The proposed project forms an important part of this program.
The estimated total project cost of $71.2 million represents about 10%
of the capital expenditures planned by Taipower for the 1970-73 period.
The project consists of:
(i) The installation of a fourth thermal unit of 375 MW capacity
at the existing Talin plant in Southern Taiwan. The first
300 M4W unit is in operation; the second (also 300 MW) is
expected to be in service by the middle of 1970 and the
third (375 MW) is in the process of being ordered. Installa-
tion of the fourth unit would be completed in late 1973.
(ii) The addition of two 90 T1W generators at the Lower Tachien
hydroelectric station which is about 40 kms downstream from
the site of the Bank-financed Tachien Hydroelectric project.
Two 90 MW units at the Lower Tachien station are scheduled
to be placed in service during the course of this year.
The two additional units would be in service by December
1972.
(iii) The provision of 345 kV transmission facilities for the
additional generating capacity.
The return from the project based on cost savings and revenues from the
new load is estimated at 17%.



-5-
15.       The implementation of the 1970-73 construction program will
strain Taipower's finances. Internal cash generation, sales of equity
and customers' contributions will meet about $280 million (or 37%) of
the total capital expenditure of $740 million. The remaining $460
million required will have to be raised through borrowings. Roughly
$86 million would be provided by the proposed loan and disbursements
from the proceeds of the Bankfs $50 million loan (574 CHA) made to Tai-
power in 1968. Other foreign loans and suppliers' credits - the latter
largely of 10 years duration with interest at 6% - are expected to
contribute about $193 million. Approximately $27 million will be made
available by the Council for International Economic Cooperation and
Development (CIECD), a Chinese Uovernment planning agency, from counter-
part funds. Arrangements have been made to borrow about $105 million
equivalent from domestic banks, and the Government will defer customs
duties amounting to about $49 million on imported items. Taipower's
forecast financial position is regarded as satisfactory, despite the
substantial borrowings contemplated, but borrowings of less than 15 years
should be restricted to a minimum.
16.       The proposed Bank loan with a 20-year term would help to ensure
that Taipower will be able to maintain a sound finanoial structure; by
including the financing of interest during construction estimated at
roughly $4.7 million equivalent the Bank would further contribute to this
goal. The Government is aware of the need to secure financing on suit-
able long terms for power development. It is considering several
possibilities to channel private savings into public-sector investment
projects such as the flotation of tax-exempt bonds, the tapping of postal
savings accounts and allocations from budgetary surpluses. It is expected
that Taipowerts financial situation will be improved with the help of
Measures such as these in the next few years.
17.       Taipower is an efficient and well-managed organization.  It
is capable, with some assistance from consultants, of carrying out the
1970-73 expansion program of which the proposed project forms a part.
The Company's financial management is being strengthened by consultants,
financed from the proceeds of the Bank's loan no. 574 CHA. Under the
proposed project consultants will be provided to advise on systems
planning and technical matters.
18.       Under the provisions of loan 574 CHA, Taipower was required
to achieve a rate of return of no less than 9.5% for 1970 and 10% sub-
sequently on net fixed assets in operation plus an adequate working
capital allowance expressed in terms of inventory and cash requirements;
this is equivalent to a rate of return of approximately 10.5% on net
fixed assets alone. In 1969 the rate of return on the agreed basis was
10.2% and it is expected that it will also exceed 10% in 1970.  A 10%
rate of return requirement for 1970 onwards is included in the proposed
Loan Agreement.

19.       Taipower intends to install a nuclear power station at Chinshan.
Its first unit of 604 MW capacity (financed by the U.S. Export Import Bank)
has been ordered and is expected to become operative by the end of 1975.
The purchase of a second unit of the same capacity is being seriously
considered with a view to bringing it on stream by the end of 1976. The
economic and technical justification of the nuclear plant was reviewed by
the Bank in connection with the appraisal of the proposed project and was
found satisfactory.
PART IV - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AMND AUTHORITY
20.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Bank and the Taiwan Power
Company, the draft Guarantee Agreement between the Bank and the Republic
of China, and the Report of the Committee provided for in Article III,
Section 4(iii) of the Articles of Agreement, are being distributed to
the Executive Directors separately.
21.       The loan documents follow the general pattern of other agree-
ments used for power projects.
PART V - THE ECONOMY
22.       An economic report entitled "Current Economic Position and
Prospects of the Republic of China" (AS-142a), dated September 11, 1968
was distributed to the Executive Directors on September 17, 1968. An
economic mission has just returned from the field; its report is expected
to be distributed in July 1970. Information on recent economic data is
attached to this report.
23.       In terms of both economic growth and balance of payments via-
bility, China is continuing to make very satisfactory progress. According
to preliminary estimates, GNP increased by 8.9% in 1969 in real terms.
Because of the damage caused by two typhoons the 1969 growth rate is some-
what lower than that achieved in 1967 and 1968 (9.9% and 10.3% respectively)
but is still substantially above the 7% target of the Government's Four-
Year Development Plan. The population growth rate is about 2.3% and on
a declining trend as a result of the Government's active family planning
policy. Per capita GNP has reached about US$295 equivalent.
24.       Manufacturing and construction have consistently been the fastest
-           growing sectors of the economy.  The output of the manufacturing sector
increased by 20% in 1968 and 18.5% in 1969 in response to progress in new
and technically advanced industries. The industrialization of the economy
is evidenced by the fact that the share of manufacturing in GNP was 30.3%
in 1968 and about 32% in 1969, mainly at the expense of the share of
agriculture, which was 24% in 1968 and 21% in 1969. As a consequence of
the rapid industrialization, unemployment has been declining in recent
years. According to recent surveys of manpower resources, registered



- 7 -
unemployment was around 2% of total labor force in 1969 as against 7% in
1963. However, underemployment is still rather high with only about 60%
of total labor force estimated to be fully employed. Rapid industriali-
zation and increase in per capita income have led to a fast growth of
power demand of close to 15% per annum during the past five years.
25.       The Government's Fifth Four-Year Plan f1969-72) provides for
substantial investments in infrastructure to overoome existing deficiencies
in power generation, transportation, urban facil4ities and technical and
scientific education. While industry and agriculture can rely largely on
domestic private savings supplemented by foreign credits and some foreign
equity investment, Government savings need to increase to finance the
necessary investments in economic and social i~fmstructure.  A tax reform
commission has been established under the Cabinigt and new tax legislation
has been drafted. The tax reform is expected toi'nhcrease total Government
revenues from 18.5% of GNP in 1968 to 21.6% in 1072# Government savings
will rise from a negligible amount in 1968 to 2,6% of GNP in 1972. Total
domestic savings are 21% of GNP and are expected to rise to 25% by 1972.
26.       Merchandise exports increased by 26% in 1968 and 32% in 1969 to
a level of about US$1,100 million equivalent. The share of manufactured
goods in total exports reached 62% in 1969. Total imports of goods and
services increased by 26% in 1968 and by an estbmited 17% in 1969 to a
level of about $1,200 million equivalent. While the balance of payments
deficit on goods and services account of about $1B00 million in 1969 is
relatively small, it could conceivably increase in the future as further
efforts to expand China's exports may encounter growing resistance in
overseas markets.  The reduction of receipts with the scaling down of the
Vietnam war would be negligible s ince only 2-3% of total export earnings
are related to the conflict.
27.       Official foreign exchange reserves were $477 million at the end
of 1969, having increased by approximately $100 million during 1969; they
are equivalent to about five months imports. 'Annual debt service in 1968
was less than 6% of exports of goods and servics. It is estimated that
further foreign capital inflows, taking into apcount relatively less
favorable terms of future foreign borrowings, 'ill increase the debt
service ratio to about 10% by the mid-1970's. Given the past record of
progress and favorable prospects for future growth, the Republic of China
is creditworthy for the proposed Bank loan.
PART VI - COMPLIANCE WITH THE ARTICLES OF AGREEMENT
28.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank.

PART VII - RECOPRUINDATION
29.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
loan.
