Project\n            execution suffered from a number of technical problems,\n            since new activities were grafted onto existing ones,\n            requiring partial but appreciable reorganization within the\n            project and substantial training and retraining of staff.\n            These problems have gradually been solved. In the case of a\n            multi-phase project, it would be advisable, when successive\n            bid proceedings are held for the procurement of equipment\n            and machinery, that when subsequent contracts are awarded,\n            account be taken of the previous composition of the\n            equipment pool in order to reduce the cost of spare parts\n            management (reduction of fixed assets) and make maintenance\n            more efficient (workers finding it easier to handle a\n            standardized pool of equipment). Whenever a project's\n            objectives undergo a major revision, care should be taken to\n            appraise the short and medium-term fallout likely to result\n            from such a revision, with a view to better assuring the\n            project's future, during and after project execution,\n            on both the economic and the social level."}, "docdt": "1990-10-12T00:00:00Z"}
