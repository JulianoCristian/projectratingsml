The project consists of both national and\n            regional elements.  It includes: (a) enhancement of oil\n            spill response capabilities in Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia;\n            and elaboration of national and regional spill contingency\n            plans; (b) provision of pollution monitoring mechanisms; (c)\n            rehabilitation and expansion of reception facilities at key\n            ports to receive oily ballast and bilge waters; (d)\n            provision of floating equipment, tank trucks,\n            dispersant's sprayers, skimmer booms, etc. for\n            combatting oil spills; (e) training; and (f) technical and\n            marketing studies to evaluate re-refining or alternative\n            uses of recovery oily materials."}, "docdt": "1994-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
