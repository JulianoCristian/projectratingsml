MEMORANDUM AND RECOMM}ENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE REPUBLIC OF KAZAKHSTAN
FOR AN URBAN TRANSPORT PROJECT
1.    I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation on a
proposed loan to the Republic of Kazakhstan for US$40.0 million equivalent to help finance an
urban transport project. The pruposed loan would be at the Bank's standard variable interest rate
with a maturity of 17 years, including five years of grace. Co-financing would be provided by
the European Community (US$0.6 million).
2.    A draft Country Economic Memorandum was distributed in November 1992. The
Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) was discussed by the Executive Directors on August 3,
19931. The proposed project fits well within the CAS (para 14).
3.    Macroeconomic situation. Kazakhstan's economic reform process, initiated under the
former Soviet Union, was accelerated following the declaration of independence in December
1991. The introduction of a national currency, the tenge, in November 1993 - and the adoption
of a stabilization program to support it - has given fresh impetus to this process. The latter,
however, is taking place against the background of severe economic difficulties. As in 1992,
developments in 1993 were dominated by a continued contraction of production and runaway
inflation. For the year as a whole, gross domestic product is estimated to have declined by
around 11 percent following a 14 percent contraction in 1992. After reaching 2500 percent in
1992, inflation continued almost unabated in 1993 with prices being multiplied about twenty-
fold. In spite of these negative trends, open unemployment remained minimal throughout the
year, suggesting that little industrial restructuring has taken place, although by all accounts,
underemployment affects a large portion of the population. To overcome these difficulties,
Kazakhstan has now adopted and begun the implementation of a comprehensive structural reform
program, which is laid out in the Government's Memorandum of Structural Reform Policies and
is supported by a Rehabilitation Loan from the tank. A center piece of this reform program is
a comprehensive privatization program which benefits from a strong political consensus. The
country has also started a macroeconomic stabilization program iLnitialy with the support of the
IMF Systemic Transformation Facility and now strengthened by an Upper Credit Tranche
Standby Agreement.
A. SECTOR BACKGROUND
4.    As in most former Soviet countries, the urban population of Kazakhstan is highly
dependent on public transport. Because there are comparatively few private cars, over 90% of
I     See Report No. P-5964-KZ daled July 12, 1993 for the Technical Asisiance Loan.



ali motorized urban passenger trips are by public transport. Also, because of low housing
mobility and city structure, passenger trips are reiatively long. The quality of public transport
has deteriorated in the past few years due primarily to the lack of funding for urban transport
operations. In the three largest cities of Kazakhstan (Almaty, Karaganda, and Shimnkent), vehicle
availability is now about only 60-65% and the average vehicle provides about 190 km of service
daily; instead, ratios of 80-9C% and 230-260 km should be expected. As a result, passenger
loads are generally 50% higher than under normal efficient circumstances. During the peak
traffic periods, vehicles are so overcrowded that there is a safety problem for children and older
people.
5.    There are several interrelated reasons which explain the poor performance of urban public
transport in Kazakhstan's main cities, mainly the poor condition of the vehicle fleets, the lack
of resources, including foreign exchange, of the main public enterprises that dominate the sector,
and the shortage of drivers. These are in general a reflection of the following main issues
prevalent in the sector: (i) a modem legal and institutional framework for adequate governance
and support of public transport companies in a market economy is not yet in place - the charters
of the companies do not provide clearly for autonomy of the companies, nor for an efficient
control by the companies' owners, the regional governments; (ii) fare levels are only 15-20%
of costs despite regular increases above the rate of inflation in the past two years; (iii) there is
no mechanism to ensure that subsidies are adequate and help promote efficiency improvements,
although local governments are now setting aside substantial resources for subsidizing public
transport companies; (iv) the private sector plays only a minor role in the provision of public
transport services although the Government has in principle widely opened entry to this market;
(v) public transport companies need to modernize their organization and management practices;
and (vi) the urban road networks are deteriorating fast because of the lack of funds for road
mlaintenance.
6.    1Jntil now, the Government has focused its attention in the transport sector on defining
the sector's legal and in.wtitutional framework. Central government has given broad
responsibilities to the local governments for the administration of urban road networks, the
management of traffic, and the supervision and funding of public transport companies. However,
central government still has some funding role. For example, regional governments have been
authorized by central government to levy special taxes to fund urban tranwport operations.
Consequently, in two of the three cities included in the proposed project, revenues from special
local taxes and fares now cover all recurrent costs of the public urban transport companies.
Government has also retained control of regulations for licensing and new regulations have been
enacted that open public transport to the private sector. At the local level, other key measures
include the Almaty City Government taking preliminary steps (such as increasing drivers'
salaries and revising training programs) to make it nossible to reduce the shortage of drivers in
Almaty.
7.    The Government is also conscious that additional measures are required to encourage a
more efficient development of the sector over the long term. Therefore, the central government
and the local governments of Almaty, Karaganda, and Shiinkent have formally issued a Policy
Statement and Action Plan (PSAP), satisfactory to the Bank, describing key sector policies and
:measures to be taken to improve urban passenger transport over the next two years in the three



- 3 -
cities. The PSAP inciudes undertakings with respect to: (i) clarifying the legal status of the
project companies and establishing adequate contractual relationships between them and the local
governments; (ii) taking measures such as fare increases, reduction of exemptions, and better
controls to iincrease cost recovery; (ii) setting up systems and procedures for adequate provision
of subsidies; and (iv) improving regulations and initiating competitive tendering of bus routes
so as to increase the role of the private sector in public transport. In addition, the central and
local governments and the four project companies have substantially adopted an Implementation
Program that defines through a set of specific government decrees and company orders, most
of the responsibilities and actions to be performed by each concerned party for the
implementation of the PSAP as well as the project. The Implementation Program needs to be
complemented on a few key points, bowever. Complementary decrees and orders, acceptable
to the Bank, will be formally adopted as a condition of Loan effectiveness.
B. PROJECT OBJECTIVES
8.          The main objectives of the proposed project are to (i) help restore public transport
capacity in Kazakhstan's three main cities to adequate levels of service quality; and (ii) design
and implement some key improvements in policies and institutions, outlined in the PSAP, for
the urban public transport sector of the three cities. The project will thus help the Government
make substantial progress in addressing most of the sector's main issues in the country's larger
cities. The project was limited to three cities and to the improvement of public transport services
so as to focus on higher priorities, speed project preparation and facilitate supervision. It is
expected that the policy and institutional measures developed through the project will become
model; for improving public transport in Kazakhstan's other main cities.
C. PROJECT DESCRIPTION
9.          The project has the following main components: (i) provision of about 300 new
urban buses (100-110 passenger capacity) (US$29.9 million); (ii) rehabilitation of about 550
existing buses and 400 existing trolleybuses including provision of necessary spare parts and
supplies (US$9.3 million); (iii) provision of a limited quantity of workshop and office equipment
(US$0.3 million); and (iv) provision of training and technical assirtance (US$2.9 million). The
project's total cost would be about US$42.4 million with a foreign exchange component of
US$40.5 million. The European Community would provide US$0.6 million equivalent for
cofinancing on grant terms of training and technical azsistance. A breakdown of costs and the
financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and me;hods of procurement and
disbursements are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key processing events and the status of
Bank group operations in the Republic of Kazakhstan are given in Schedule C and D,
respectively. The Staff Appraisal Report No. 12214-KZ dated March 2, 1994, is being
distributed separately.
10.         The new buses and spare parts will be transferred to the project companies,
through local governments, as grants in order to keep project arrangements as simple as possible
and avoid adding a layer of complexity to the new and still fragile subsidy system for urban



- 4 -
transport services. In return, the local governments and project companies have committed
themselves to the PSAP and the actions that they need to take are well specified in the
Implementation Program except for some complementary iocuments required as a condition of
Loan effectiveness. (para 7).
D. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
11.         The project will be implemented by the Ministries of Transport (MOT) and of
Economy (MOE), local governments and the four public transport companies of the three project
cities. MOT will have overall responsibility for the project. It will coordinate its physical
execution and be responsible for all technical aspects, including the training and technical
assistance, and has created a coordination unit to be staffed by five engineers/economists for this
purpose. The Project Implementation Unit (PIU) of MOE will be responsible for most of the
procurement work such as preparation of the bidding and other procurement documents,
disbursements, and maintaining project accounts. The PIU has been created as the Government's
center of expertise for assisting and monitoring the implementation of foreign-financed projects,
and is already responsible for procurement for the Rehabilitation Loan (L36490-K2). A general
manager, procurement manager, and an accourting officer have already been appointed to the
PIU and Govermment is in the process of recruiting more foreign and local staff, some of whom
will be assigned to work only on procurement for this project. Actual procureme.nt processing
will be undertaken by a foreign trade agency, to be appointed by MOT under terms and
conditions acceptable to the Bank. The PIU will advise the agency on procurement in general
and on World Bank rules and procedures in particular, and -nsure that procurement proceeds
satisfactorily. Responsibility for procurement of consultant's services will be shared by the PIU
and MOT. MOT will be responsible for all procurement, contractual and logistical arrangements
while the PIU will have a coordinating and advisory role and be responsible for disbursements.
Adequate staffing of the PIU, recruitmernt of the foreign experts, and establishment of an
acceptable accounting system in the PIU is a condition of effectiveness of the loan. The project
companies will carry out the physical rehabilitation of the buses and trolleybuses, for which they
have substantial experience.
E. PROJECT SUSTAINABILrTY
12.         Improvements achieved through the project are expected to be sustainable because:
(i) the Government at central and local levels is committed to the provision of sufficient funds
for the project companies; for this purpose, it intends to increase fares and has already
established a subsidy system which the project will help make more efficient; (ii) the project will
also help establish mechanisms for sound governance of the project companies in the context of
the national policy for public enterprises; and (iii) the project includes a substantial training and
TA component to implement policy improvements and strengthen the project companies'
capability in maintenance, operations, and finance; this component is designed to disseminate
in Kazakhstan the best world practices in public transport and stimulate the commitment of staff
concerned.

F. LESSONS FROM PREV"IOUS BANK INVOLVEMENT IN URBAN TRANSPORT
13.         Main lessons include the following: (i) although the Bank's niajor objective of
increasing urban transport capacity through the use of low cost options has been met in most
projects, only mixed results have been achieved regarding institutional developments and policy
improvements; progress was not sustained tltroughout maniy projects, especially concerning
traffic management programs and cost recovery measures due largely to political instability at
the local level; (ii) the few projects assisting state-owned companies have helped them improve
their technical efficiency but financial results have not been satisfactory; and (iii) project
implementation has generally not been on schedule. These lessons have been taken into account
in the project's design. The training and t-echnical assistance component includes dissemination
of information on, and visits to successful cities and companies in order to stimulate the
commitment of the Government and companies' officials involved. Project implementation wlln
be centralized and the preparation of procurement documents has already started. The policy
measures to be implemented during the project are focused and are in general consistent with
stated government policies. The Govermnent has already tacken significant measures to impreve
the financial situation in the sector, increased fares to prevent erosion of progress made to date,
and agreed to implement further increases in fares as soon as buses are put into operation.
G. RATIONALE FOR BANK INVOLVEMENT
14.         The main objectives of the Bank's CAS for Kazakhstan are to: (i) support
macroeconomic stabilization; (ii) support structural reforms at the macro and sectoral levels; (iii)
strengthen the social safety net; (iv) help restore production capacity in energy, agriculture, and
nfrastructure; and (v) strengthen the Government's implementation capacity. The volume of
Bank lending will depend on progress in stabilization and structural reforms. Within this context,
the Bank's strategy in the infrastructure sector in Kazakhstan is to: (i) promote reforms in
pricing and financing systems, governance and organization of State owned enterprises,
expenditure programming, and private sector participation to ensure the long term sustainable
development of the sector; arid (ii) help rehabilitate essential equipment and facilities to ensure
that the sector will not be a bottleneck to economic recovery and a minimum acceptable level
of service will be available to the population.
15.          The proposed Project is fully consistent with the Bank's CAS. It will support
structural reform by assisting with (i) institutional restructuring of urban transport entities; (ii)
policy reforms, especially in financing of the sector; and (iii) initial measures to promote the
private sector in urban transport. It will also help alleviate the current crisis in urban public
transport which affects a large majority of the population, including the poorest. In addition, as
the first Bank investment project in Kazakhstan, it will help establish a sound operational
relationship between the Bank and the Government. Bank involvement in urban transport in
Kazakhstan is justified for the following reasons: (i) the Bank can play an important role in
helping the Government to establish correct expenditure priorities for public transport in the
three project cities and putting in place efficient project implementation mechanisms; (ii) based
on its broad experience in the sector and, more generally in infrastructure, the Bank can provide



- 6 -
some key assistance to the Government in designing and implementing major po!icy and
institutional reforms for the sector.
H. AGREED ACTIONS
16.         DL%-ing negotiations, agreement was reached on the following: (i) implementation
of the PSAP and the Implementation Program; (ii) passenger fares to cover at least 25% of the
operating cost of transport per passenger by the time half or more of the new buses are put into
operation; and (iii) a debt service coverage ratio of not less than 2:1 to be maintained at all times
by the project companies. The following will be conditions of Loan effectiveness: (i) adoption
of decrees and orders by the local governments and the project companies, acceptable to the
Bank, complementing the Implementation Program; (ii) submission of an action plan, acceptable
to the Bank, for reducing the shortage of drivers in Almaty; and (iii) adequate staffing and
organization of the PIU.
I. ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECTS
17.         The project has a C rating. As a result of the project, the companies would be
operating a larger number of vehicles but many would be non-polluting trolleybuses and new or
rehabilitated buses. These would produce substantially less noise ana air pollution than the old
gasoline-powered units which are still in operation and would partially be replaced. Vehicle
maintenance would also be improved, thus further reduzing emission. On balance, therefore, the
project would have a positive impact on the environment.
J. PROGRAMS OBJECTIVES CATEGORIES
18.         The project supports the Bank's programs objectives, including: (i) public sector
reform involving restructuring of urban transport companies and other tieasures to improve
efficiency; and (ii) private sector development through the establishment of systems and
regulations for private provision of public transport. In addition, the project will address the
problem of affordability of urban transport for the urban population and examine ways to direct
subsidies more to lower income groups.
K. PROJECT BENEFITS
19.         The project's main justification is that it will help considerably tc alleviate the
shortage of public transport capacity in the project cities. Given that there is no alternative to
public transport for most of the population, this shortage and the very poor quality of service
that results have a considerable negative impact on personal lives, labor mobility, and the
functioning of markets. .he poorer and older parts of the population are also disproportionately
affected. The project is the least cost solution to redress this situation. It would also help put in
place better urban transport policies and institutional improvements which would promote a more



- 7 -
efficient development of the sector in tlie long term in the project cities. In addition, the project
is expected to have a positive impact on the environment.
L. RISKS
21.         There are two main project risks: (i) delays in project execution; and (ii)
incomplete implenitatation of the PSAP. Project execution could be delayed mainly because of
the Goverrnent's lack of procedures and experience concerning procurement of goods and
services. For this reason, procurement will be assisted and monitored by a special unit, the PIU,
which would have the authority and competence (including foreign advisers) to fulfill this role.
Detailed lists of spare parts have been finalized and preparation of the procurement documents
for the new buses has already started However, close attention will be needed during
supervision to ensure that possible prot ;is in procedures and in capability are quickly resolved.
There is also a risk that the PSAP would 'ue implemented only partially if political will was to
weaken or detailed implementation measures to be prepared with the assistance of foreign
consultants were not fully satisfactory. However, some important actions regarding fares and
subsidies have already been taken and further fare increases have been agreed for when the new
buses will be put into operation. More generally, the PSAP makes explicit, and formalizes,
policies for which there is a broad consensus. The risk of unsuccessful implementation is
therefore limited provided that the political consensus does not weaken and that the
implementation measures are well designed, adapted to local needs, and conceived in
collaboratior. with all parties concerned. Bank supervision missions will need to devote enough
time to supervising the preparation of these measures. A formal mid-tern review would take
place around July 1995.
M. RECONMMENDATION
21.         I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement
of the Bank and recommend that the Executive Directors approve it.
