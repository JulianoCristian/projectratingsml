"abstracts": {"cdata!": "Overall, this project is rated\n            satisfactory. The early stages of the project were difficult\n            for both sides, but the final outcome is conspicuously\n            successful in regard to policy reform and transition to a\n            market economy. World Bank staff performed appropriately\n            throughout; and at the broad level of restructuring and\n            privatization of urban transport, the government of\n            Kazakhstan's performance has been highly satisfactory.\n            These lessons can be learned from the project: Contrary to\n            widely-held perceptions in the region, it is possible to\n            operate an effective urban public transport system in a\n            transition economy without subsidy. Privatization and the\n            elimination of uncompensated free-travel privileges require\n            firm commitment at the highest levels of government to\n            development in the private sector and hard budget\n            constraints in the public sector. Centralized purchase of\n            buses through the public sector is sub-optimal: ideally\n            operators should make their own purchase decisions with\n            commercial credit. Vehicle maintenance should be taken\n            seriously. If the government wishes to intervene to protect\n            the most socially vulnerable groups, or compensate for\n            externalities of traffic congestion and air pollution, it\n            should explore what it can do to help the bus companies\n            strengthen their finances. Encourage local capacity for\n            long-term sustainability. Minimize turnover of the task\n            manager and the project manager throughout the project."}, "docdt": "1999-06-28T00:00:00Z"}
