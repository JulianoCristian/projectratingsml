APPRAISAL OF
TEK TRANSMISSION PROJECT II
TURKISH ELECTRICITY AUTHORITY (TEK)
TURKEY
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        This report appraises a Project comprising the construction of 380
kV and 154-kV transmission system works being part of the development plan of
the Turkish Electricity Authority (TEK) for the period 1976 to 1979. The
Project also provides for engineering services and designs, the training of
TEK engineers, a manpower study of TEK's annual professional staff requirements
for each of the five years 1977-1981 and a study of the power tariff structures
of Turkey.
ii.       The total Project cost is US$145.7 million comprising US$89.7 million
for substations, and US$56.0 million for associated transmission lines (foreign
exchange US$75.7 million). A Bank loan of US$56 million to TEK towards
the foreign exchange cost of the substations and transmission lines is proposed.
iii.      Since 1952, the Bank has made eight loans (total US$298.7 million)
and IDA has extended three credits (total US$55.7 million) for the development
of the power sector in Turkey. Expansion of TEK's transmission system financed
by a loan of US$24 million (1971) is progressing well despite delays caused
by shortage of staff. Also, in 1967, the Bank approved a technical assistance
grant of US$1.95 million for help in reorganizing the Turkish power industry
and about US$1.64 million has been spent to date in stages on three phases of
work. Implementation of consultant's recommendations, with suitable modifica-
tions, is under way.
iv.       TEK, a State Economic Enterprise (SEE), was set up with the active
encouragement of the Bank in October 1970, and is charged with overall res-
ponsibility for power development in Turkey. At present TEK generates and
transmits more than 90% of all the power in Turkey selling in bulk mainly to
municipalities and some major industrial consumers.
v.        The demand for electrical energy in Turkey has been growing at an
average annual rate of about 12% since 1960 and is expected to continue to
grow at about this rate for the next five years and thereafter is expected to
reduce to 10%. The development of TEK's power transmission capacity to support
this growth, of which this Project is an essential component, is a logical part
of the whole of TEK's program for the years 1976 to 1979.



- ii -
vi.       The institutional and sectoral objectives associated with the estab-
lishment of TEK have not been realized because ever since its inception TEK
has been beset by problems relating to organization, management, personnel
and finances. These problems arise chiefly from lack of autonomy as evidenced
by lack of freedom in personnel and tariff policies, frequent management
changes inhibiting continuity in management, inherent weaknesses of the organ-
ization of management team itself and poor liquidity due to difficulties in
bill collection. The opportunity of the Elbistan Project loan was taken to
resolve some of these problems. This lending operation seeks to strengthen
TEK and to provide needed improvements in the sector.
vii.      Since commencing operations in October 1970 with the nucleus of the
Governrnent organization previously engaged in the generation and transmission
of power, TEK has, as provided in the TEK law, taken over the bulk of genera-
tion and transmission facilities of municipalities and hydroelectric assets.
Three changes of General Manager in five years have, however, detracted from
effective management in TEK. In addition, TEK has experienced an acute
personnel shortage, as high as 49% in September 1975 (59% in engineering) 1/and
a high turnover of staff resulting in an increasing proportion of inexperienced
staff owing to low civil service salaries applied to all SEEs from January 1971
under a common Personnel Law. In 1973, 1974 and 1975, the last with the appro-
val of Parliament, Government has taken certain stop-gap measures to improve
salary levels which may solve some of the immediate problems. Since TEK's
ability to manage its operations would be seriously in question should this
shortage of staff continue, Government has agreed to approve promptly on TEK's
request adequate measures under existing legislation to enable it to recruit and
retain all necessary staff to manage its operations. To improve management
performance, the Bank has also asked Government to appoint the General Manager
in future normally for a minimum three-year term.
viii.     TEK's organizational structure, inherited from its predecessor, was
not entirely suited to its expanded responsibilities and was the subject of a
15-month study by consultants financed under the Bank's technical assistance
grant and completed in December 1972. TEK has agreed to complete its reorgani-
zation based on this study in accordance with an implementation schedule
acceptable to the Bank and to be submitted to it by December 31, 1975, with
needed emphasis on finance and accounting and with decentralized authority to
regional offices. Establishment of one regional office is under way.
4x.       TEK has not earned the minimum 8% return on realistically valued net
fixed assets required by the covenants in the existing Loan Agreements. To
raise earnings to acceptable levels, as a condition of effectiveness of the
Elbistan loan, Government agreed to establish by March 15, 1975 new tariffs to
yield TEK a net average revenue of 51 krs per kWh. In view of its price stabi-
lization policies, however, Government proposed in supersession of this agree-
ment, and the Bank agreed, that TEK achieve the 8% return in 1977 and there-
after and that for 1976, Government will take by January 1, 1976 all measures
1/ Figures are based on the authorized establishment which sets upper limits
to the numbers of employees in all categories.



- iii -
necessary to enable TEK to earn a 6% return in that year. TEK's revenues
would have to go up by 20% in 1976 and 15% in 1977 to achieve this objective.
x.        Improvement of TEK's performance through optimum utilization of
power facilities depends much on tariffs, not only its own but also of dis-
tributing agencies. In order to achieve proper structuring of all tariffs
in the country TEK has agreed to have a nation-wide tariff study conducted by
qualified experts acceptable to the Bank. Also in the event of tariff adjust-
ments by TEK, Government has agreed to take all measures necessary for retail
distributing entities like municipalities to adjust promptly their tariffs
commensurately.
xi.       Owing to arrears in payments by its consumers especially municipa-
lities, TEK has had a serious cash problem forcing it at times to hold up
payments to its suppliers and creditors for months. Consolidation of TEK's
receivables and debt as of December 31, 1973 as approved by Parliament trans-
ferring the obligations either to Government or to the State Investment Bank,
has not solved the problem.  Government has however agreed to cause its agen-
cies and municipalities to pay TEK's bills outstanding for more than three
months according to a timetable and plan of action acceptable to the Bank and
TEK.
xii.      Subject to agreement being reached as set forth in Section 8, the
Project is suitable for a Bank loan to TEK of US$56 million, for a term of
20 years with a 4-year grace period. The loan is expected to become effective
within 3 months of loan signing.






APPRAISAL OF
TEK TRANSMISSION PROJECT II
TURKISH ELECTRICITY AUTHORITY (TEK)
TURKEY
1. INTRODUCTION
1.01      This Project, a continuation of the 1972-74 transmission line pro-
gram supported under Loan 763-TU, comprises the construction of the 380/154-kV
and 154/33-kV substations and related transmission lines required to be devel-
oped in the period 1976 to 1979, the engineering costs of the 380-kV works
(especially of designing a second Bosporus crossing), training of Turkish
Electricity Authority (TEK) engineers, a comprehensive nationwide tariff study
and a manpower study of TEK's personnel staffing needs for the period 1977-1980.
The additional 3,200 MVA of transformer capacity to be installed will serve
about 4 years of system growth. The estimated cost of the Project is US$145.7
million. The proposed loan of US$56 million would cover 87% of the foreign
cost of items to be financed from the loan. TEK would be the borrower and the
Government of Turkey the guarantor. Certain transmission line works of 380-kV
have been included in the Project to achieve a coherent scheme, and finance
for these would in part be arranged by Government as part of TEK's on-going
program.
1.02      The 380-kV and 154-kV substations and associated 380-kV transmission
lines forming the major part of this Project are a small part of the development
of generating and power transmission facilities of TEK of which the 1,200-MW
Elbistan project (Loan 1023-TU) is a vital component. TEK's construction pro-
gram in the years 1975 thru 1979, expected to cost US$3.3 billion, provides
for the building of transmission works of various voltages costing about LT
8,470 million (US$605 million) with a foreign cost component of LT 3,030
million (US$216 million).
1.03      The Bank has made eight loans and a technical assistance grant
(total IUS$300.65 million) and IDA has extended three credits (total US$55.7
million) for the development of the power sector in Turkey:
(a) Loan 63-TU of US$25.2 million in 1952, for the multipurpose
Seyhan dam, 36-MW power plant and associated irrigation and
transmission works;
(b) Credit 34-TU of US$1.7 million in 1963, for a third unit of
18-MW at the Seyhan hydroelectric station;
(c) Credit 59-TM of US$24.0 million in 1963, for a 100-MW thermal
station at Mersin, a 70-MW hydroelectric station at Kadincik
and associated transmission works;



-2-
(d)  Loan 623-TU of US$11.5 million in 1969, for the second stage
of Kadincik (50-MW); and
(e) Loan 775-TU of US$7.0 million in 1971, for transmission
facilities and to cover increased foreign exchange costs
of the second Kadincik hydroelectric project.
These five loans/credits were for works in the service area of the Cukurova
Electric Company (covering the four southern provinces on the Mediterranean)
and were re-lent in whole or in part to Cukurova. All projects have been
completed or are progressing satisfactorily.
(f) Technical Assistance Grant of US$1.95 million in 1967 for help in
reorganizing Turkeyis power industry. About US$1.64 million has
been spent in stages on three phases of work in Etibank (TEK's
predecessor) and TEK. Proposals for using the balance of about
US$0.31 million are under consideration;
(g) Loan 568-TU of US$25.0 million in 1968, which was re-lent to
Etibank for the 380-kV transmission lines from the Keban hydro-
electric project to Istanbul and the associated substations;
(h) Loan 763-TU of US$24.0 million in 1971, for expanding TEK's
transmission system;
(i) Loan/Credit 883/360-TU of US$44 million and US$30 million res-
pectively in 1973, for the Ceyhan Aslantas multipurpose project
(also in the Cukurova area) which would inter alia generate
annually 500 GWh of hydroelectric energy;
(-)  Loan 892-TU of US$14 million in May 1973, for the electricity
construction program of the Istanbul Electricity, Tramway and
Tunnel Co. for 1974 and 1975 and for studies to determine the
long-term electricity, transport and gas organization for
Istanbul.
(k) Loan 1023-TU of US$148 million in June 1974 for the construction
of the 1,200-MW thermal power station and 20.7 million tons p.a.
lignite mine at Elbistan.
1.04      This report is based on the findings of a Bank mission which visited
Turkey between October 9 and 26, 1974, consisting of Messrs. N. Green and I.
Mathai and on updated information obtained in October 1975.

2. THE POWER AND ENERGY SECTOR
The Country
2.01      Turkey is geographically a link between Europe and Asia bordered
by Greece, Bulgaria, the USSR, Iran, Iraq and Syria, and with a long coast-
line (8,210 km) stretching from the Black Sea to the Mediterranean. The
total area is 780,000 km2; 24,000 km2 in Europe and the rest in Asia. The
estimated population at mid-1973 was 38.2 million, growing at about 2.5% p.a.
Rivers are distributed throughout the country but their flow is mostly irre-
gular. Considerable climatic variations exist, from typical Mediterranean
climate in the south to severe continental climate with hot summers and cold
winters on the high plateaus and mountainous regions of the interior.
The Economy
2.02      Turkish development strategy since the foundation of the Republic
about fifty years ago has been based on modernization within a mixed economy,
the main emphasis being on industrialization and self-sufficiency, a policy
pursued with increased vigor following the launching of the first five-year
plan in 1963. Since 1962, GNP has grown at nearly 7% p.a., industry at over
10% p.a. and agriculture at 3.5% p.a.; the other sectors (construction, trans-
port, housing and services) have grown at about 7% p.a. As a result, the
structure of the economy has changed considerably; the respective shares of
industry, agriculture and other sectors in GDP in 1972 were 23%, 28% and 49%,
compared with 16%, 37% and 47% in 1962. Government estimates an acceleration
of economic growth to about 8% p.a. and a steady rise in industry's share of
GDP to 34% by 1987. GNP per capita would rise from US$420 in 1972 to nearly
US$1,000 (in 1972 dollars) by 1937.
2.03      The combination of rapid industrialization and urbanization (urban
population rose from 28% to 36% of total population in 1962-1970) has resulted
in a rapid increase in the demand for electricity (para. 6.02). This led to
shortages in 1972 and 1973 since the generating program had not kept pace with
demand. The projected future trend of economic growth and of urbanization
(urban population is projected to reach 62% of total population by 1987) implies
continued high rates of growth of electricity demand, which TEK's development
program is designed to meet.
Power and Energy Resources
2.04      Turkey has indigenous resources of lignite, coal and hydropower plus
some oil, geothermal energy and fissionable fuel, but depends on imported oil
for about 50% of commercial energy requirements.  Lignite reserves, found in
western and central Turkey, are estimated at 5,000 million tons. The largest
single deposit is at Elbistan where a 1,200-MW power station is now being
developed and a second equally sized station is planned. Of the estimated
usable hydroelectric potential of 73,000 GWh p.a., 31,000 GWh is in the Firat
(Euphrates) basin.  Geothermal resources have as yet not been adequately



evaluated although evidence of their existence is widespread. Estimates of
proven oil reserves, at Batman in the southeast and near Iskenderun on the
Mediterranean, vary widely from 20 to 70 million tons, and are less than the
country's needs excluding power generation. Fissionable fuel reserves are
estimated at about 3,000 tons of uranium oxide equivalent in low grade ores
(less than 0.05%), but systematic prospecting for uranium and thorium is
just beginning.
The Power Sector
2.05      The Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources controls the electric
power sector. At the time of the formation of TEK in October 1970, four
state organizations, a half-dozen or so private companies, a large number of
private industrial firms and more than 600 municipalities and villages were
involved with generating, transmitting and distributing electricity. In
place of the four state organizations which included a planning and statistic-
al organization responsible for all planning in the sector, the State Hydraulic
Works (DSI), responsible for development of hydro projects, and Etibank, a
State Economic Enterprise (SEE) whose power group constructed and operated
all major thermal production plants and transmission lines throughout Turkey,
selling energy to the distribution agencies and large industries, there are now
only two:
(a)  TEK, responsible for the major part of the generation and
transmission of electrical energy in Turkey, and
(b)  DSI, responsible for the planning of hydropower development.
It also builds hydropower stations.
2.06      Amongst the private utility companies, by far the largest is the
Cukurova Electric Company which operates in the Adana area and provides 298
MW (9%) of the interconnected system generating capacity (Annex 1). The
largest municipal distributors are in Istanbul, Ankara and Izmir; Istanbul
and Izmir buy all their energy from TEK but Ankara still generates part of
its requirements. Except for a small and ever reducing number of municipali-
ties isolated from the interconnected system, other municipal authorities
buy energy from TEK or Cukurova.
2.07      Law 1312 which established TEK charges it with responsibility for
planning the general electrification of Turkey including management of a
village electrification fund; for constructing thermal electric plants and
transmission and distribution lines; for operating the national transmission
system and all the interconnected power stations except those privately
licensed, and for selling energy to consumers in bulk or individually. DSI
still plans and builds hydroelectric projects in consultation with TEK. The
law also provides means whereby TEK can take over other power sector enter-
prises. TEK has already taken over operation of all the power stations
previously owned by Etibank and DSI, together with their staff, and also those
owned by the larger municipalities and Iller Bank, an SEE previously providing
electric facilities to smaller municipalities and villages. Distribution



-5-
networks may continue to be owned and managed by municipalities, though TEK
may take these over by mutual agreement with the municipalities or if they
fail to pay their bills promptly provided the Ministry of Energy and Natural
Resources (M of E) sanctions this. Development programs for distribution are
initiated and implemented by each municipality with TEK coordinating the
various programs.
Existing Power Facilities
2.08      The installed capacity of public utility generating plant in Turkey
at the end of 1973 was 2,489 MW, consisting of 2,101 MW (84%) in the system
operated by TEK, 298 MW (12%) in Cukurova's system and 90 MW (4%) in small
installations. In addition, private generation, mostly industrial, totals
about 300 MW. In 1974, new plant was placed in service having 260 MW of
thermal and 105 MW of hydro capacity. The interconnected system operated by
TEK which serves the western and central parts of the country supplies 90% of
the demand.
2.09      The construction of a power link with Bulgaria has been delayed
about two years. The last span to be erected across the border was completed
in 1975 enabling interconnection. The power exchange will be limited to 50
MW until the system limitations are removed in Turkey where the construction
is to 380-kV standards but is to be operated initially at 154 kV. The link
is for mutual support on a net zero transfer basis. There are no other
interconnections with neighboring countries.
2.10      Owing to inadequacy of capacity (about 12% short of demand) in
1973, TEK shed load and imposed frequency and voltage reductions. In October
1973, the situation was aggravated by plant failures necessitating interrup-
tion of supply for one hour per day to most customers on a rotating schedule.
Although improvements are expected when the Keban hydroelectric station is
in full operation, power supply difficulties were still being experienced
during the peak demand winter months of 1974/1975.
Tariffs
2.11      TEK's present wholesale tariffs (including sales to municipalities
and large industry) have been in force since July 1, 1971, when the previous
tariff was raised by about 50% to yield an average of 23.3 krs per kWh.
Changes in consumption pattern have since raised the basic tariff yield to
about 24 krs per kWh. In addition, TEK is also levying a surcharge to cover
fuel cost increases which have occurred since July 1971. At present this
amounts to around 15 krs per kWh, of which 77% was levied in December 1973 and
January 1974 following the worldwide surge in oil prices. Retail tariffs
are set by each municipality subject to the control of the Ministry of Energy
and Natural Resources, generally to meet cash flow objectives, typical retail
domestic tariffs being almost twice the wholesale tariffs, e.g. 75 krs/kWh
(US45-1/2) in Istanbul, and 94 krs/kWh (US47) in Ankara (46.20 krs before
October 16, 1974). However, in municipalities, surplus electricity revenues
are often diverted into non-energy operations such as transport.



-6-
2.12      TEK's present tariffs have a declining block-type structure and
are not directly related to the costs of providing the supply. The tariffs
are promotional, encouraging greater use of energy and a growth in peak demand,
and without enough incentive for improving the system load factor. They do
not adequately discourage loads with characteristics imposing a heavy cost
upon the system or, conversely, encourage those which involve a low cost. The
same applies to tariffs at the distribution level administered by the munici-
palities. Thus there is the danger of a potential over-investment in the
sector. With total interconnection of the power sector in the interest of
industrial dispersion, a unified tariff system is most desirable. A com-
prehensive tariff study covering the whole country with a view to establishing
appropriate pricing policies and tariff structures at the bulk supply level
and at the distribution level, including the financing needs of the power sec-
tor, is now essential for proper system planning. Financing the study from the
proposed loan would be appropriate because TEK, with about 85% of the total
generating capacity in Turkey, will be its main beneficiary. TEK has under-
taken to initiate by April 1, 1976 and to complete not later than December
31, 1976 such a study, in consultation with the Bank, with the assistance of
qualified experts under terms of reference and conditions of employment accept-
able to the Bank. Government has also agreed to assist, or cause its agencies
to assist, TEK and the experts in carrying out the study, to provide promptly
the required facilities and resources, to exchange views with the Bank on the
recommendations, and to prepare measures for revised tariff systems. Suggested
Terms of Reference for the study are given in Annex 2.
2.13      In the past, there have been serious delays on Government's part,
with consequent detriment to sector development, in permitting municipalities
and other entities engaged in distribution and sale of power to adjust their
tariffs following TEK's tariff adjustments. This has also contributed to
TEK's bill collection problem (paras 5.09 & 5.10). Government has now agreed
to take all such measures necessary for these entities to adjust promptly their
tariffs in a manner and in amounts commensurate with TFK's tariff adjustments.
Development Program
2.14      TEK's development program in the period 1975 thru 1979 provides for
2,300 MW of new thermal and 1,028 MW of new hydro plant to be commissioned.
Substantially all the thermal plants will be fuelled with lignite, half of
which is in eastern-central Turkey where also 900 MW of the new hydro power
is situated. Transmission line construction will include 2,800 km of 380-kV
and 2,700 km of 154-kV route length in the same period. TEK's total invest-
ment is presently estimated to be of the order of LT 45,930 million (US$3,280
million) for the five year period, of which the foreign component is about
LT 22,990 million (UJS$1,642 million equivalent). This does not include hydro-
electric works to be constructed by DSI involving LT 17,200 million (US$1,229
million) nor does it cover the investment by the Village Electrification
Program (para 2.15) and the distribution authorities, It is planned to spend
LT 2,505 million (US$179 million) to electrify 7,500 villages over five years.



-7-
2.15      Annex 3 illustrates the system growth forecast and shows that up to
1978 plant capacity will be just adequate to meet requirements, after which
there will be a suitable margin if plant is commissioned on time. Delays of
about one year cannot be excluded but the plan contains an adequate margin and
is considered to be reasonable. TEK's development plans have been developed
by a department under the control of one of the five Assistant General Managers
(Annex 4), in close association with the design and construction department
of TEK, D.S.I., and foreign consultants. The whole has been competently in-
tegrated and evaluated using computers and least cost program techniques.
Although this situation still applies, the present difficulties of holding
and recruiting competent staff are a constant threat to the continued devel-
opment of satisfactory plans for the future.
Village Electrification
2.16      The Government plans to provide electricity to some 36,000 villages
having populations ranging from 50 to 2,000. Prior to 1964, only 268 villages
in this category had been electrified but since then the number of villages
electrified each year has gradually increased to about 900 in each of the
years 1972, 1973 and 1974. In future it is hoped that the rate can be in-
creased to 1,500 per year.  By the end of 1974 about 5,780 villages were to
be electrified (Annex 5). The present average cost per village is LT 330,000
(US$23,600). By employing some mechanized equipment, it is hoped to reduce
the cost of construction and accelerate the rate of completion. The program
is financed by village contributions (25% of capital costs), a levy of one
krs/kWh (USd0.07) on non-village consumers of electricity excluding large
industrial consumers, and contributions from the Government budget. The
capital and other costs not funded by direct village contribution are recover-
able by way of tariffs over a period of 30 years.
3. THE PROJECT
Description
3.01      The Project is part of the Borrower's current 1976-1979 development
plan and consists of the following parts:
(a) the construction and placing into operation of 380/154 kV
substations having an aggregate capacity of 2,550 MVA, princi-
pally at Kayseri, Babaeski, Istanbul II, Istanbul III, Bursa,
Ankara II, Eregli, Keban, Osmaniye, Izmir and Adapazari com-
prising structures, switchgear, protective circuits and trans-
formers and related equipment;
(b) the construction and placing into operation of 154/33 kV sub-
stations having an aggregate capacity of about 650 MVA, princi-
pally at Etiler, Ankara, Keban, Denizli, Bursa, Sivas, Kayseri,
Orhangazi, Gaziantepe and Adapazari with structures and related
equipment including transformers;



- 8 -
(c)  construction and placing into operation, to serve the needs
of the works referred to under (a) and (b) above, of trans-
mission lines at 380 kV between Keban and Elbistan (171 km),
Elbistan and Osmaniye (174 km), Adapazari and Eregli (150 km),
Babaeski and Istanbul II (200 kIn), and between Istanbul II and
Istanbul III (60 km) - (crossing the Bosporus);
(d)  engineering services for the design of a second Bosporus
crossing at 380 kV and the supervision of the 380-kV works
of this Project;
(e)  the training of the Borrower's engineers in the design and
operation of the EHV transmission system;
(f)  a tariff study embracing the whole power sector;
(g)  a medium and long-term manpower study of TEK's annual profes-
sional staff requirements, in various professional categories,
for each year during a five-year period commencing January 1,
1977; and
(h) power system and transmission line studies.
Insofar as the specified transmission lines are necessary to the development
of the 380 kV substations but are only part of TEK's transmission line con-
struction program and are the most likely to suffer construction delays, TEK
has agreed to provide by April 30, 1976, programs and timetables for their
construction which can be monitored.
3.02      The works described in 3.01 (a), (b), and (c) are part of TEK's
current development plan and preliminary studies and design work have already
been undertaken. Items (d) and (h) are in line with TEK's normal practice.
TEK staff has now had substantial experience in the design and execution of
154-kV works. In the development of their EHV network at 380 kV they carry
out the greater part of the design functions with their own staff supplemented
by the services of a consultant. This Project envisages the use of a consult-
ant on a part time basis to supplement internal TEK capacity and also the pro-
cessing of electrical system stability and related studies by suitably equipped
agencies. No reliable estimate of consultant participation is possible. This
procedure Is satisfactory. The proposed loan therefore provides for the con-
t'nued services of a consultant to supervise and report on the technical feas-
ibilitv of each of the constituent 380-kV project works. Item (e) is closely
linked with the shortage of experienced technical manpower (paras 4.06 to
4.11). The need for item (f) was highlighted during the situation arising from
the fuel oil crisis. Item (g) arises out of the statements made by TEK and
Government during negotiations, that contrary to the conclusions reached during
appraisal (paras 4.06 to 4.11) TEK's staff shortages are not acute leading to
a need to determine the true staffing requirements of TEK.



-9-
3.03      Transmission towers and conductors are normally supplied to TEK by
local manufacturers using local and imported raw materials. TEK has long-term
agreements with these manufacturers to supply such goods. However, the rate
of construction will exceed the capacity of local manufacturers to supply
conductor and a proportion will need to be purchased from foreign sources.
Insulators and hardware will also be foreign supplies, transmission line
construction will be partly by local contract and partly by foreign contracts
and in most cases conductor stringing will be by force account. This
composite activity makes greatest use of local facilities whilst augmenting
them by foreign resources to meet targs of development. As an interim
stage to the development of wholly competent local resources and a continua-
tion of present practices, this is acceptable. Under these arrangements the
foreign exchange requirements of the transmission lines not provided out of
this loan, would be provided by Government as part of TEK's on-going program.
Status of Engineering
3.04      Load flow projections and associated transmission system studies
covering the short, medium and long-term plans to 1987 have been made and
are regularly revised and updated. On the basis of these studies the Project
works have been planned schematically and scheduled in work programs. The
preparation of detailed transmission line and substation design is in hand.

The estimates are obtained from unit cost data used by TEK for planning pur-
poses which represent current costs derived from recent experience. Physical
contingencies are calculated at a rate of 10% for erection and civil works
and 5% for equipment costs. Price contingencies have been allowed as follows:
Local Costs    Foreian Costs
1975                            15%             12%
1976                            15%             10%
1977 et seq.                    15%              8%
Financing Plan for the Project
3.06      It is proposed that the loan should cover 74% of the foreign cost
of the substation and transmission line works, training and engineering
amounting to US$56 million. The remaining foreign cost of the Project
amounting to US$19.71 million and the local costs of US$69.98 million equiv-
alent (LT 979.76 million) would be financed by TEK as part of the total in-
vestment program for 1976-1979 (para 5.13).
Implementation
3.07      The Project will be administered by the staff of TEK.  The work should
be completed by early 1979 although staffing constraints may extend it through
1979. Whilst the majority of the transmission works are executed by force
account, TF,K uses contractors for civil works, tower supply and erection and
the like, where their magnitude makes this desirable. The substation install-
ations of this Project will mainly be executed by TEK staff, which is satis-
factory.  Half the number of substations are extensions of existing sites and
acquisition of new sites for the remainder, and routes for transmission lines
do not present serious problems.
Procurement
3.08      All imported equipment for the Project works would be procured
bv international competitive bidding under procedures in compliance with the
Bank's Guidelines for Procurement.  Preference for domestic manufacturers
would be permitted in accordance with the Bank's current policy; but due to
the nature of the works, local manufacturers are unlikely to compete inter-
nationally except to a minor degree.
3.09      TEK has undertaken in the case of 380-kV Project works to submit
before bids are invited, a technical report on the engineering of such works
to be prepared by the consultant referred to in para 3.02.
3.10      A detailed training program for the utilization of the training
funds provided by this loan has not yet been developed. TEK has undertaken
to define such a program bv March 31, 1976, and to implement it.



Disbursements
3.11      Disbursement from the loan would be made for the c.i.f. cost of
equipment and materials imported for the Project and the foreign costs of con-
sultancy, system studies and training services. Although local manufacturers
are not expected to participate in contracts financed by the loan, in the
event they do develop this capacity and compete successfully, disbursements
would be made for the ex-factory costs of goods so supplied, and such supplies
would be granted the usual 15% preference for bid evaluation purposes.  Savings,
if any, resulting from favorable prices, would be cancelled. Disbursement is
e xpected to be completed by 1979. Estimated disbursements are given in Annex 7.
Environmental Impact
3.12      The impact of the Project on the environment is small.  Visual
effects and to a lesser extent noise, are the principal matters of concern;
both can and should be kept at acceptable levels. An undertaking to this
effect was obtained.
4. THE PROJECT ENTITY
Background
4.01      TEK, with headquarters in Ankara, is an SEE with an authorized capi-
tal of LT 20,000 million (US$1,429 million). It may borrow in its own name
with the Ministry of Finance as guarantor. Under the TEK law, TEK must earn
a return of not less than 8% on net fixed assets, and fix tariffs accordingly;
however, the manner of computing the return is not prescribed either in the
law or in any separate guidelines issued by Government.
4.02      SEEs, such as TEK, are required to run on commercial lines, and are
subject to taxation (e.g. income taxes of 41.7%) like private joint stock
companies, but they operate under Law 440 (passed in 1964) designed to create
more resources for investments by enabling them to be run autonomously, pro-
fitably and productively. However, SEEs are still subject to close Govern-
mental supervision and autonomy is severely limited as illustrated by their
lack of freedom in setting personnel policies and structuring salary scales
(paras. 4.06 to 4.11) and Government's active role in dictating pricing of
their goods and services. Government's propensity to make quick management
changes has also constrained the development of any real autonomy (para. 4.04).
Organization and Management
4.03      Until September 1975, TEK's organization (see Chart in Annex 4) was
essentially the same as that of the old Etibank Power Group. In October 1971,
TEK appointed Electricite de France (EdF) as consultants, with funding from
the technical assistance grant (para. 4.13), to recommend a suitable organi-
zation structure to cope with the widened responsibilities under the TEK law
and to help rationalize TEK's technical operations procedures. Ever since



- 12 -
receiving EdF's final recommendations of March 1973 the essence of which is
the setting up of a number of regional offices with full responsibility for
all day to day operations in the region subject only to policy direction and
budgetary control, TEK was planning a reorganization based on these recommend-
ations. Based on assurances that TEK had initiated action on reorganization
in stages within a specific time frame, Loan 1023-TU was negotiated with a
provision that TEK would complete the reorganization by December 31, 1974;
the date was subsequently extended to December 31, 1975. TEK has undertaken
to complete the reorganization and staffing of its administrative and technical
structure in accordance with a detailed implementation schedule acceptable to
the Bank. This schedule as well as the corporate instruments providing for
a realignment of the headquarters establishment more efficiently delineating
functional responsibilities, and for establishment, on a pilot basis, of two
regional offices as the first phase of a regionalization plan would be submit-
ted to the Bank by December 31, 1975. The reorganization of the headquarters
office is under way. One regional office was also established October 15, 1975.
4.04      TEK has a Board of four Directors comprising the General Manager
(GM), ex-officio Chairman, nominated by the Ministry of Energy and Natural
Resources and appointed by the Council of Ministers, one of the AGMs (also
nominated by the Minister of Energy and Natural Resources) and a member each
nominated by the Minister of Energy and Natural Resources and Minister of
Finance and appointed by the Council of Ministers. The law prescribes an
initial term of three years for the two representatives of the Ministries on
the Board who may be reappointed on completion of their three years of service;
it does not prescribe any term for the GM and AGM who "may be replaced accord-
ing to the specifications of their appointment". TEK is managed by the GM
assisted by five AGMs appointed by the Council of Ministries. The first GM
held office for 10 months and the second for 18 months; the third who was
previously the AGM for Village Electrification, though holding office longer
(since December 1972), has also labored under the same handicap of an uncertain
tenure., The uncertainty in the GM's tenure, reinforced unfortunately by Gov-
ernment's own past actions in ordering quick changes, detracted from effective
management in the past. In connection with Loan 1023-TU, the Bank has informed
Government that to insure continuity of management, in future, the General
Manager should normally be appointed for a period of at least three years.
In order to stress the Bank's interest in this, Government has again been
informed of this view.
4.05      On its formation on October 25, 1970, TEK took over the Etibank
Power Group's personnel. Other agencies whose facilities have been trans-
ferred to TEK have similarly transferred their staff. In September 1975 TEKrs
total sanctioned establishment as provided in its budget consisted of about
20,210 employees (3,130 technical, 4,050 administrative and other monthly-rated
categories and 13,030 daily-rated labor).
4.06      The 1966 Minutes of Agreement between the Bank and Government lead-
ing to the establishment of TEK (Annex 8) envisaged that TEK would be granted
autonomy in personnel policies with freedom to hire and fire personnel of afl
ranks and to set salarv and wage levels which would ensure the appointmenvt
and retention of competent personnel. However, as finally approved, the TEK



- 13 -
law, enacted in July 1970, requires TEK's personnel policies to conform to
the general personnel policy prescribed by Government for all SEEs, a require-
ment which has seriously undermined TEK's ability to attract and retain com-
petent staff. The rigid and inadequate civil service salary scales applied to
TEK from January 1, 1971, under a common Personnel Law applicable to all SEEs,
have proved more and more inadequate for TEK with the high inflation in the
country, leading to mounting resignations of experienced staff seeking better
avenues outside and difficulties in attracting suitable replacements (Annex 9).
The personnel problem reached crisis proportions in mid-1973, when TEK had a
total vacancy rate of 47% (48% in the technical establishment) 1/. Possible
solutions considered by Government included:
(a) engaging key staff on contract paying salaries closer to
market levels, and
(b) certain measures possible under the law such as upgrading staff
classifications and providing supplementary benefits, which how-
ever promised only modest relief since these had to conform to
the basic salary structure which had a maximum of LT 8,000
(US$571) per month.
4.07      Effective November 27, 1973, Government upgraded staff classifica-
tions and provided larger additional payments for arduous duties, job risks,
etc. An idea of the changes can be had from the following:
(a) fifty-seven positions in Grade 1 and 140 in Grade 2 were estab-
lished vs. 8 and 51 respectively existing earlier;
(b)  salary increases in typical staff positions in large and small
projects vary from 12% for the Accountant to 54% for the Depart-
ment Head (Annexes 10 and 11); and
(c) roughly the total annual payroll for large projects increased 40%.
4.08      Effective June 1, 1974, Government further increased allowances for
about 1,560 employees (typical instances given in Annex 12) which raised TEK's
payroll by about LT 39 million p.a.
4.09      Despite these measures, the staff situation in 1974 continued to be
as serious as it was in mid-1973, the overall shortage at the end of August
1974 being 47% as in July 1973. In order to halt the steady erosion of staff
salaries owing to inflation and to enable SREs to attract and retain experi-
enced staff, Government took the following major steps effective March 1, 1975
under legislation enacted by Parliament:
(a)  raised the multiplier for computing basic salaries from 8 to 9
for all personnel (including those in Government), thus raising
basic salaries 12.5% for all: and
(b)  granted a bonus equivalent to two months' pay to all SEE staff
for 1975.
1/   Based on the authorized establishment.



- 14 -
The effect of these in typical instances is given in Annex 13. The increases
in salaries generally range from 20-30%. In addition there were improvements
in starting grades especially to graduate engineers, increased special allow-
ances, beneficial adjustments in overtime and fringe benefits, etc. The total
effect of all these is not easily quantifiable. However, TEK considers that
some easing of problems in recruiting and retaining at least the lower and
middle level professional staff is already discernible and that the present
emolument package will enable it to meet its staffing needs adequately at
least through the end of 1976. Perhaps it will, or perhaps further salary
adjustments may become essential; it is too soon to form a definitive judge-
ment. Significantly, TEK has recently taken steps to hire personnel on a
contract basis in order to staff the Elbistan Project, a provision agreed
with the Bank under that loan. Annex 14 gives the comparative staff position
at the end of July 1973, December 1973, August 1974 and September 1975.
4.10      TEK has also a high turnover of engineers, departing engineers of
experience being replaced by inexperienced ones, raising the proportion of
inexperienced staff alarmingly; at the end of October 1974, 61% of TEK's
engineers had less than three years' service and 80% less than six years'
service (Annex 9). A further problem exists in that some of the small core
of experienced technical staff are opting to retire after 25 years of service.
4.11      W4hile the above described measures as taken by Government may re-
solve some of the immediate problems, the real solution would be to grant TEK
autonomv in personnel policies as envisaged in the 1966 Minutes of Agreement
(Annex 8) and to structure salary scales to suit changing needs and market
conditions. However such a radical move would have wide repercussions on
other SEEs, perhaps even on Government's own personnel policies and would
also require enactment of legislation in a sensitive area, and therefore
Government firmly does not consider this a practical option for it. How-
ever Government has agreed to approve promptly upon TEK's request adequate
measures under existing legislation to enable it to recruit and retain all
staff required to manage its affairs appropriately.
4.12      One difficulty in considering TEK's staffing problem is TEK's man-
power planning and personnel management techniques which do not provide its
management with the true magnitude and breakdown of its future staffing needs.
In order to deal with this aspect of its staffing problem, TEK has agreed to
carry out, with the assistance of qualified experts and under terms of refer-
ence satisfactory to the Bank, a detailed medium and long-term manpower study
of its annual professional staff requirements for 1977-1981 and to implement.
a program of staffing and recruitment each year based on the recommendations
of the study. TEK will submit this program to the Bank each year in September
from 1976 through 1980 and will base its annual budgets thereon.

Technical Assistance - Accounting
4.13      In 1965, the Bank made a technical assistance grant of up to US$1.95
million to cover the foreign exchange costs of studies and the implementation
of recommendations for the reorganization of the Turkish power sector. So far
about US$1.64 million has been spent from the grant, including about US$33,000
for training 13 key accounting staff in utilities in the USA; the balance will
be used in FY76 as required for other schemes, e.g. training TEK's engineering
staff in technical operations.
4.14      In Phase I of the technical assistance program, completed in 1969,
Stone & Webster Overseas Consultants (SWOCI) devised a new system of accounts,
budgeting and reporting and purchasing and stores procedures, and prepared
engineering standards. In Phase II, during November 1970-November 1972,
Arthur Young & Company (AY) worked as consultants inter alia to introduce a
comprehensive system of accounts, budgeting and reporting based essentially
on the SWOCI system, and to assist TEK in implementing it, and also to recom-
mend a scheme of revaluation of assets. TEK has now a better accounting,
budgeting and financial reporting system than before, though it has yet to
use the system adequately for management decisions. TEK has also revalued
its assets in accordance with the agreed principles and procedures (para.
5.05). As a final phase, AY made several follow-up visits in FY75 to assist
in further implementation of various systems and in revaluation of assets.
Audit
4.15      Within four months of the end of each year, each SEE must prepare
a balance sheet and income statement, and a report on the year's activities
comparing actual results with the budget, and submit them to the Government's
High Control Board (HCB) for examination from the administrative, technical
and financial standpoints. Under Loan 763-TU, financial statements audited
by independent auditors satisfactory to the Bank should be submitted to the
Bank within five months after the end of each financial year.
4.16      Although the Bank accepted HCB for the time being as "independent
auditors satisfactory to the Bank", it reserved the right to review this deci-
sion during the period of Loan 763-TU. HCB's audit is designed to suit Gov-
ernment's requirements--the audit team is headed by an engineer, and includes
a lawyer and an economist, but no accountant--and is not geared to secure the
Bank's objectives, an aspect which became increasingly clear in the Bank's
experience of the audit. It is necessary, because of TEK's proposed large
expansion program, that HCB's audit should be more closely oriented to the
Bank's requirements. To this end the Bank supplied Terms of Reference for
such audit to Government, HCB, and TEK. HCB has been accepted by the Bank
as independent auditors under Loan 1023-TU on the understanding that its audit
would include all the items mentioned in the Terms of Reference, and the Bank
would have the right to reconsider this arrangement during the period of the
loan. Agreement has been reached on extending the same arrangement to the
proposed loan.

5. FINANCES
Highlights of Financial Position
5.01      The highlights of TEK's flnancial position are as follows:
(a) since the tariff increase in 1971, there has been no effective
action to achieve the financial objectives set in the TEK law
and the Bank's Loan Agreements. TEK has not met the existing
rate of return covenants requiring an 8% return on revalued
net fixed assets by varying margins from 1970 through 1974
(by 2.5% in 1970, 3.1% in 1971, marginally in 1972, 5.3% in
1973 and 5.7% in 1974). In October 1975 Government has agreed
to take by January 1, 1976, such actions including abolition of
the existing,15% discount for prompt payment of bills as will
enable TEK to earn a return of 6% in 1976 on a revalued asset
base. Government will also take by January 1, 1977 all actions
necessary for TEK to earn 8% in 1977.  Increases of revenue
of about 20% in 1976 (inclusive of the measures stated above)
and of 15% in 1977, are estimated to be necessary for reaching
this objective;
(b) though TEK's revaluation action was late by more than two years,
TEK has revalued its assets as of December 31, 1973 and
December 31, 1974 according to principles accepted by the Bank
and has agree,d to carry out future revaluations also accordingly;
(c) if salaries are raised substantially in future to relieve the
staffing problems, still higher increases in revenue will be
necessary;
(d) TEK has been faced with a severe cash problem for the past two
years or more owing to defaults in payment of its bills by munici-
palities and villages forcing it in turn to hold up payments for
months even on debt service obligations. Though after enactment
of legislation, Government has consolidated TEK's receivables
and debts as of December 1973 transferring the obligations either
to itself or to the State Investment (SIB), TEK's collection
problem still remains. Hopefully the problem will be less severe
in future since Government has agreed to cause its agencies and
municipalities to pay TEK's bills outstanding for more than three
months (para 5.11); and
(e) it has not yet formed a firm financing plan for the bulk of the
foreign exchange costs of its investment program of LT 62,790
million (ITS$4,485 million) in the period 1975-1981, the success-
ful completion of which is dependent on Government's ability to
secure foreign exchange financing of LT 29,906 million (uTS$2,136
million).



- 17 -
Tariffs
5.02      SEEs, like TEK, were originally generally free to determine the
prices of their goods and services but by a decree of 1967, prices of basic
goods and services such as electrical power, coal, cement, steel, rail trans-
port, etc., became subject to the approval of the Council of Ministers. Under
this decree any loss to the enterprise resulting from a price change ordered
by the Council must be made good by Government. Government is also required
to take action on requests for tariff changes within one month. In practice,
however, this decree is largely inoperative in the case of TEK and tariff
decisions are reached more through informal consultations between TEK and
Government, thus avoiding any occasions for mandatory Government subsidies.
This has blurred responsibilities in the matter of setting tariffs and has
left TEK unable to fix tariffs in relation to costs so as to secure its fi-
nancial objectives as set out in the law and in the loan agreements. Govern-
ment has now affirmed its intention to ensure that a self-adjusting mechanism
is built into the electricity supply tariff procedures so as to ensure that
from 1977 onwards TEK can take such tariff adjustment measures as are neces-
sary to earn the required 8% return.
5.03      Most of TEK's sales are under a two-part tariff having a fuel-
adjustment clause whereby increases in fuel costs are automatically recovered
from consumers without a general tariff revision, a provision agreed under
Loan 763-TU.
Asset Revaluation
5.04      Periodic revaluation of assets is necessary for the realistic adjust-
ment of tariffs and for appropriate cash generation inherent in the rate-of-
return earnings objective under inflationary conditions. TEK's assets, built
up from 1948 onwards, were greatly undervalued because of substantial increases
in Turkish prices in the last two decades, as reflected in part by two devalua-
tions of the Turkish Lira; the first in 1958 to about a third of its exchange
value (from LT 2.8 to about LT 9 to the US$), and the second in August 1970
by about 40% (from LT 9 to LT 15 to the US$) before the international currency
realignments at end of 1971. From the end of 1970 through 1973 prices again
rose about 20% p.a. and in 1974 about 30%. Law 440 provides for revaluation,
as does the TEK law for assets transferred to TEK from Etibank and DSI.
5.05      In November 1970, TEK appointed AY as consultants to recommend
inter alia a method for revaluation of TEK's assets, but pending AY's study,
a basis was agreed between Government, TEK and the Bank for computing TEK's
rates of return for 1970-1972. Annual coefficients based on price changes
were established for revaluation and agreement reached for revaluing the
assets taken over from the Etibank Power Group and DSI in 1970, and the ex-
penditure through 1969 on DSI plant brought into service after January 1, 1970.
This valuation increased the asset base by LT 2,018 million. Though required
by the covenant under Loan 763-TU, TEK did not adjust its books by December
31, 1972, to reflect the agreed asset values after revaluation nor had it estab-
lished revaluation principles satisfactory to the Bank based on AY's recommend-
ations of April 1972 for computing the return from 1973 onwards. However in



l 8s
connection with Loan  1023-TU, agreement was reached between Government, 1EK and
the Bank on satisfactory principles for revaluation (Annex 15); actual revision
of TEK's books after revaluation as of December 31, 1973, which was a condition
of effectiveness of Loan 1023-TU was also completed by mid-1975. Since the
wholesale price index as of September 1974 increased more than 15% from
September 1973, the critical level of price change to trigger a further re-
valuation agreed under the terms of Loan 1023-TU, TEK has conducted another
revaluation of assets as of December 31, 1974, and revised its books accord-
ingly. The coefficients used for revaluation are given in Annex 16.
Past Performance and Present Position
5.06      TEK has not met the rate of return covenant from 1970 (para. 5.01)
mainly because of less-than-expected load growth, staffing problems, rising
employment costs, ineffective management, a general reluctance to raise
tariffs even to catch up with costs, and Government's unwillingness to approve
tariff increases. In all these years, sales growth has been below previous
estimates, 11% in 1970 vs 18%, 25% in 1971 vs. 29%, 21% in 1972 vs 29%, 10%
in 1973 vs 27%, and 10% in 1974 vs 20% mainly because of less development of
industrial load (principally the Seydisehir aluminum complex) and shortage
of power due to slippage of schemes like Seyitomer, Keban, etc. Annex 17
contains TEK's income statements for the years 1971-74.
5.07      The covenant also requires TEK to make up any shortfall in one year
within the next two years, to review its earnings semi-annually in April and
September of each year, and to inform the Bank promptly of the results and
the corrective measures proposed. Despite frequent urging by the Bank, TEK
has not complied with this review and reporting requirement.
5.08      From a debt/equity ratio for the Etibank Power Group of 78/22 for
1968 and 77/23 for 1969 reflecting the dominance of long-term debt as a source
of finance, TEK reached a ratio of 24/76 at 1974-end mainly by transfer of
DSI, municipal and Iller Bank assets as constituting part of its capital
following TEK's formation in 1970 and by revaluation increases in asset values.
At 1974-end, SIB loans provided 58% of loan capital, and foreign loans 33%.
Annex 18 contains TEK's balance sheets for the years as of December 31,
1971-1974.
5.09      TEK has always had a cash problem mainly because of slow collection
of receivables despite a 15% discount for payment within one month and a
penalty of 1% per month for payments thereafter. Receivables at end of 1971,
1972 and 1973 amounted to 37%, 31% and 36% respectively of annual revenues,
i.e. around four months' revenues, a very high level. In connection with
Loan 1023-TU it was agreed that TEK would initiate measures for prompt col-
lection of receivables and that Government would assist in prompt collection
of TEK's dues from Government departments and municipalities. Yet the posi-
tion had so deteriorated since then that in the latter half of 1974, TEK was
unable to meet its obligations from day to day and was forced to hold up pay-
ments to its suppliers and other creditors. Annex 19 shows that at the end of
September 1974, TEK's overdue payments amounted to LT 1021 million and its
receivables to LT 1774 million. Of the overdue payments, debt service to
Government in respect of foreign loans amounted to LT 101.3 million (USS7.2
million equivalent). TEK's receivables at end of 1974 totalled over LT 2
billion or about six months' revenues.



- 19 -
5.10      The most serious delinquents in paying TEK's hills are municipal-
ities (80%) but TF.K can neither enforce collection of bills from defaulting
municipalities, nor disconnect supply to them. With only limited resources,
municipalities are in turn dependent on Government for much of their finan-
cing. Government has long contemplated measures including legislation to
improve municipal finances but has been unable to take effective action to
mitigate the problem. The biggest defaulter has been Ankara municipality
owing about LT 465 million in August 1975 (rising from 153 million in
November 1973, and 400 million in October 1974), although its ability to
pay had improved with the doubling of its tariffs from October 16, 1974.
5.11      In the absence of available long-term solutions, Government pro-
posed, and Parliament approved effective May 22, 1975, legislation providing
for consolidation and payment of intra-public sector debts outstanding as of
December 31, 1974, but for TEK alone, debts and receivables are to be con-
solidated up to only December 31, 1973. Under this law TEK's receivables
due from municipalities and villages up to December 31, 1973 will be paid by
the Treasurv within 3 years after offsetting TEK's payables of tax, debt
service to SIB, etc., and TEK will pav its dues to SEEs e.g. coal and petro-
leum bills, through the SIB in 5 years (after a grace period of 5 years)
together with interest at 6%. It is seen from Annex 20 which shows the im-
pact of consolidation on TEK, that although consolidation has eliminated some
of TEK's receivables and debt, it has now to collect more net receivables than
before. Government has, however, agreed to cause its agencies and municipal-
ities to pay debts for power and services outstanding to TEK in excess of
three months in accordance with a timetable and a plan of action to be accept-
able to the Bank and TEK. In fact, Government has informed the Ankara munici-
pality of its decision under the law to cancel its right to sell power; the
matter is under litigation. This Government decision, in TEK's view, will
ease its collection problem since municipalities are now on notice that Gov-
ernment might invoke the statutory recourse for default in payment.

5.13      Of the foreign exchange requirements, about $676 million is for the
E.bistan Project.  Of this, firm arrangements have been made for $305 million
with the IBRD ($123 million), KfW ($101 million) and EIB ($81 million), and
&'h million is also reasonably assured from European bilateral agencies; the
halance of about S295 million will be covered by credits tied to bids and bv
Government's own resources. Of the balance requirements, apart from the pro-
posed Bank loan of $56 million for the Project, no financing has been arranged
for the foreign exchange costs of the program amounting to about UIS$1.5 bil-
lion. TEK looks to Government to provide all the foreign funds for the in-
vestment program approved by the latter. There is therefore a large measure
of uncertaintv about the program. However, Government has guaranteed to pro-
vide all the funds required for the Project not covered by funds available
to TEK.



- 21 -
5.14      In the discussions between Covernmient and the Bank leading to the
establishment of TEK, it was envisaged that TEK would assume all liabilities
associated with the assets transferred from DSI to help insure realism and
objectivity in power sector planning. lHowever, the TEK law, as finally en--
acted, provides for transfer of these installations free of debt, treating
their cost as part of TEK's equity capital. This substantially reduces TEK's
debt service liability and correspondingly raises its cash generation level.
During the period 1975-1981 TEK's cash generation after debt service and taxes
at 41.7% is estimated to be about 33% of its capital program, which would seem
satisfactorv. However, for proper perspective, TEK's self-financing level
should be related to the total capital expansion requirements including DSI's
construction, for DSI is constructing hydro-electric assets only for their
eventual transfer to, and use by, TEK. On this basis, TEK's self-financing
level would be only 25% in 1975-1981; if the estimated construction expenditure
were increased to allow for a 15% inflationary rate (about half the 1974 rate),
the self-financing level would be 15%. It would be still lower if TEK were
responsible for servicing the debts related to the DSI assets as originally
envisaged. Another effect of TEK not being responsible for these DSI debts
is to raise its tax liability and to make it more difficult for it to earn
an 8% return. In order to remove this added burden in attaining its financial
objective ani to promote the original objective of realism and objectivity in
power sector planning, the Bank urged, and Government agreed, in connection with
Loan 1023-TU that it may consider transferring to TEK these debt service lia-
bilities in 1976. In partial modification of this, Government will now consider
transferring these debt service liabilities to TEK in 1977.
5.15      The forecasts also show TEK with a plentiful cash balance in 1979-
1981. This is however an illusory picture since the present inflationary
trends (around 20% p.a.) would tend to create greater and greater need for
funds in com-ing years to finance higher construction costs and increasing
operating exnenses. Furthermore, if TEK's funds were used to finance hydro-
electric construction, which would be appropriate, TEK's cash surplus would
be fully used1.
Future Performance
5.16      Th. manner of treating TEK's past shortfalls commencing from 1970
in the light of the covenant was considered in connection with Loan 1023-TU.
It was considered that a strict adherence to the existing covenant viz. earn-
ing an 8% return each year on an asset base revalued continuously to reflect
changing pri.e levels, at the same time making up past shortfalls, would re-
sult in a burdensome tariff level. The surge in oil prices further complicated
the position inasmuch as the consequent fuel surcharge (para. 5.03) soared from
3.5 kurus per kWh in December 1973 to 15.1 kurus per kWh in January 1974 raising
the price of electricity to the consumer 42% in just about two months. In view
of the time required for the economy to adjust itself to such rapid price escal-
ations without disruption, Government urged, and the Bank agreed, that a longer-
term approach for TEK to meet the required 8% return would be appropriate.  The
Agreement under Loan 1023-TU therefore provided:



-22 -
(a)  for making the loan effective, Government would have established
not later than March 15, 1975, new basic tariffs yielding TEK
a net average revenue of 51 kurus per kWdh, the base fuel oil
price underlying the tariffs being set at LT 1,260 per ton: and
(h)  from 1976 onwards, TEK would earn an 8% return on a revalued
asset base, and not later than March 15, 1976 Government would
take all steps necessary to enable TEK to earn this return in
1976.
5.17     Hlowever, taking into account its anti-inflationary and economic
stabilization policies, agreement subsequentlv was reached with Government
that TEK would earn an annual return of 8% from 1977 only on a revalued asset
base as agreed, and that for 1976 and thereafter Government will:
(a)  take by January 1, 1976 such actions including the abolition of
the existing 15% discount for prompt payment, prompt reimburse-
ment of TEK's losses on rural electrifitation and other Government-
directed programs or equivalent measures, and further tariff ad-
justments as will enable TEK to earn a 6% return in 1976;
(b)  review with the Bank, and take by January 1, 1977, measures
necessary for TEK to earn the required 8% return in 1977;
(c)  review with the Bank the power sector investment program for
the next five years with a view to establishing guidelines for
the financing of such program, including reviewing how TEK can
contribute increasingly to the investment program from inter-
nally generated resources: and
(d)  consider transferring to TEK the debt service liabilities related
to the DSI assets, adjustment of tax liabilities or other fiscal
measures acceptable to the Bank to help TEK earn the required 8%
in 1977.
5.18      Assuming actions as agreed, from January 1, 1976, TEK's return
would be 6% in 1976 and 8% in 1977 and thereafter. To achieve this, revenue
increases of about 20% in 1976, and about 15% in 1977, or equivalent measures,
would be necessary. With the present inflationary conditions causing spiralling
construction costs and operating expenses, the return would be in fact much
lower on assets revalued from time to time unless tariffs are increased com-
mensurately with inflationary pressure. The main assumptions underlying the
income statements are given in Annex 22.
5.19      Increases in wages could reduce operating income substantially.
The impact of the salary increases sanctioned from June 1, 1974, raising the
wage bill by about LT 39 million p.a. and of the major emolument increases
(para 4.09) of 1975, has been allowed for in estimating the above returns,
but further adjustments of wages and salaries could reduce the rates of
return, Any such cost increase should be taken care of through tariff



- 23 -
adjustments. Additional staff for new plant and equipment to be brought into
service has also been-provided for in the estimates. Fuel cost increases,
being automaticallv recoverable through the fuel adjustment clause in the
tariffs, would not affect the estimated returns.
Proposed Financial Covenant
5.20      Loan 763-T11 required TEK to earn an 8% return on revalued net fixed
assets and to continue to revalue assets in future as prices change. Any
shortfall in a year is required to be made up within the next two years: an
overrun could be applied to offset any shortfall in one or more of the next
three years. This covenant was extended to Loan 1023-TU! incorporating also
the revaluation principles accepted by the Bank, subject to the interim
position for the period through 1976 (para. 5.16). Agreement has been
reached on repeating this covenant in the proposed loan subject to the
interim position through 1976 (para 5.17).
5.21      As required by law, TEK" uses in its accounts depreciation rates per-
missible for tax purposes but which are substantially higher than those agreed
to bv the Pank as minimum rates in Loan 763-TU.  Based on AY's recommendations,
the Bank recommended revised rates to TFK, which are lower than those now used
by TEK but are more realistic considering the service lives of the assets.
The lower rates woul.d also improve TFK's rate of return by a little over 0.5%.
Under loan 1023-TU, TFX would use these depreciation rates in the financial
statements for the Bank, but on a proforma basis, as TEK is required under
the tax law, to use in its books of account the rates used for tax purposes.
Agreement has been reached on repeating the same arrangement in the proposed
loan.
Future Financial Position
5.22      M4ainly through transfers to TEK of projects completed by DSI
(Gokcekaya and Keban) as additions to TEK's capital without any debt liability,
TEK's debt/equity ratio remains at/or lower than 1:2 through end of 1976. With
the addition of large thermal plants such as Tuncbilek, Flbistan, Soma Extensions,
etc., and associated debts, the ratio rises to around 45/55 during 1977-1980
and at end of 1981 is estimated to fall to 41/59 owing to transfer of major
debt-free DSI assets. The current ratio is estimated to be well below one
during 1975-1981 (except in 1976, 1979 and 1980 when it is estimated to be
around 1) reflecting a tight working capital position. Annex 18 contains
TEK's estimated balance sheets as of December 31, 1975-1981.
Debt Limitation Covenant
5.23      The debt covenant under 1023-TU stipulates the Bank's prior con-
currence for fresh borrowing of long-term debt from January 1, 1975, unless
TEK's net revenues before depreciation and interest for the fiscal year next
preceding such borrowing or for a later 12-month period ended prior to such
borrowing, shall be at least 1.5 times the maximum debt service including
the debt service on the debt to be incurred. Agreement has been reached on
repeating it also in the proposed loan.

6. BENEFITS AND JUSTIFICATION
Market Growth
6.01      Past sales in the system since 1960 (Annex 23) show a mean growth
rate over the period of about 12% p.a. For preparing forecasts of future
sales, TEK makes ten-year projections for each customer (excluding major
industrial customers) based on the past trend of kWh sales. Customers are
grouped by substations and then by regions. Separate projections are made
for major industrial consumers, existing and projected, to obtain total TEK
sales. To these are added projected sales by two concessionary companies,
(Cukurova and Kepez) expected to be fully connected to the TEK system by 1977,
to give the forecast for the interconnected system. The forecast is finalized
in the light of Government plans and projections for the development of the
various sectors of the economy and of the regions.
6.02      During the construction period of this Project, it is expected that
the system demand will grow by about 2,400 MW. To meet this, generating
plant in excess of 2,500 MW feeding into the 380 and 154-kV transmission
system is committed, including the Elbistan power station. To meet system
growth there is a need to provide transmission facilities to serve the present
power requirement at the load centers. In the appraisal of the Elbistan proj-
ect (Loan 1023-TU) the system development up to the time of commissioning of
the Elbistan plant (1978-80) was seen to be the least cost solution relative
to reasonable alternatives. This Project is the logical counterpart to such
a generation plan and necessary for the total system integrity. The nature
of the equipment to be procured is of standard type and its deployment on the
system in terms of place and timing can remain reasonably flexible. In the
conditions of rapid price escalation that are expected to apply during Project
implementation, the sensitivity of the Project cost to timing of capital plant
investment is relatively small.
6.03      The forecast of sales has assumed an initially high rate of growth
(on average 17% p.a. to 1976) taking up that volume of sales which has been
inhibited due in part to plant shortages in recent times, A decline there-
after to 10% is foreseen. This forecast is reasonable and prudent for system
planning purposes (Annex 24). Because the Project is only part of TEK's trans-
mission system development and benefits cannot be directly attributed, it has
not been possible to calculate its rate of return; however, the internal econ-
omic rate of return for TEK's total development plan has been assessed at 16%
(Annex 25) if benefits are measured by incremental revenues attributable to
the total investment in the system operated by TEK and financial costs
adjusted for taxes and internal transfers. However, it is likely that the
incremental revenues understate the benefits some of which will arise from
improving the reliabilitv of electricity supply (para 2.10). In these cir-
cumstances the Project is justified.

7. MONITORING SYSTEM
7.01      Annex 26 gives a few key indicators which represent crucial features
of TEK's performance in the years 1971-1974 (actual) and 1975-1981 (estimated).
The proposed loan agreement would cover the main items such as staff, tariffs,
depreciation, rate of return, bill collection and debt service coverage.
Other items have therefore not been covered in the loan agreement; however,
TEK's performance in respect of these will be monitored during supervision.
8. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
8.01      Government has agreed:
(a) to assist or cause its agencies to assist TRK and the experts
appointed for the purpose in carrying out the tariff study
and provide promptly the required facilities and resources,
exchange views with the Bank on the recommendations and prepare
measures for revised tariff systems (para 2.12);
(b) as and when TEK adjusts its tariffs, to take all measures required
to enable municipalities and other entities engaged in the distri-
bution and sale of power to adjust promptly their tariffs in a
manner and in amounts commensurate with TEK's tariff adjustments
(paras 2.12 and 2.13);
(c) upon TEK's request to promptly approve adequate measures under
existing legislation to enable it to recruit and retain all
staff required to manage its affairs appropriately (para 4.11);
(d) to cause its agencies and municipalities to pay debt oustanding
to TEK in excess of three months for power or services in accord-
ance with a timetable and plan of action acceptable to the Bank
and TEK (para 5.11);
(e) to provide the required funds in the event of possible inadequacy
of funds to carry out the Project (para 5.13);
(f) to take by January 1, 1976 such actions including the abolition
of the existing 15% discount for prompt payment, prompt reimburse-
ment of TEK's losses on rural electrification and other Government-
directed programs or equivalent measures, and further tariff ad-
justments as will enable TEK to earn the 6% return in 1976 as
agreed with the Bank (para 5.17);
(g) to review with the Bank, and take by January 1, 1977, measures
necessary for TEK to earn the required 8% return in 1977 (para
5.17);



- 26 -
(h) to review with the Bank the power sector investment program
for the next five years with a view to establishing guidelines
for the financing of such program, including reviewing how TEK
can contribute increasingly to the investment program from
internally generated resources (para 5.17); and
(i) to consider transferring to TEK the debt service liabilities
related to the DSI assets, adjustment of tax liabilities or
other fiscal measures acceptable to the Bank to help TEK earn
the required 8% in 1977 (para 5.17).
8.02      Government has also affirmed its intention to ensure that a self-
adjusting mechanism is built into the electricity supply tariff procedures
in order that TEK can take such tariff adjustment measures as are necessary
to earn the required 8% return from 1977 (para 5.02).
8.03      During negotiations, TEK agreed to:
(a) initiate by April 1, 1976 and to complete not later than December
31, 1976 a nation-wide tariff study, in consultation with the
Bank, with the assistance of qualified experts under terms of
reference and conditions of employment acceptable to the Bank
(para 2.12);
(1b) provide by April 30, 1976, programs and timetables for the
construction of transmission lines necessary for the completion
and putting into operatlon of the Project works (para 3.01);
(c)  employ consultants to supervise and report on the technical feas-
ibility of the 380-kV Project works (paras 3.02 and 3.09);
(d) define by March 31, 1976, a training program for the design and
operation of the EHV transmission systems (para 3.10);
(e) take all reasonable measures necessary to ensure that the Project
is carried out with due regard to ecological and environmental
factors (para 3.12);
(f) (i) complete the reorganization and staffing of its administra-
tion and technical structure in accordance with a detailed im-
plementation schedule acceptable to the Bank and to submit to
the Bank by December 31, 1975 the corporate instruments providing
for a realignment of the headquarters establishment and for es-
tablishment of two regional offices (para 4.03);
(g) carryvout, with the assistance of qualified experts and under
terms of reference satisfactory to the Bank, a detailed medium
and long-term manpower study of its annual professional staff
requirements for 1977-1981; to implement a program of staffing
and recruitment each year based on the recommendations of the



- 27 -
study; and to submit this program to the Bank each year in
September from 1976 through 1980 and to base its annual budget
thereon (para 4.12):
(h)  carry out a revaluation of its assets in accordance with the
agreed principles as necessary from time to time (para 5.05);
and
(i)  extend to the proposed loan the covenant under Loan 1023-TU in
regard to:
(i)  audit of TFK's financial statements (para 4.16);
(ii) the rate of return (para 5.20);
(iii) depreciation rate (para 5.21); and
(iv) debt limitation (para 5. 3).
8.04      -CB has been accepted by the Bank as independent auditors on the
understanding that its audit would include all the items mentioned in the
Terms of Reference furnished by the Bank, and the Bank would have the right
to reconsider this arrangement during the period of the loan (para 4.16).
8.05      The Bank has reiterated to Covernment its view that:
(a) one of TEK's Assistant General Managers or an official of
equivalent rank should be made solely responsible for the man-
agement of its accounting and finance divisions; and
(b) in future, TEK's GM should normally be appointed for a period
of at least three years (para 4.04).
8.06      Subject to the foregoing, the Project is suitable for a Bank loan
of USS56 million to TEK for a term of 20 years including 4 years' grace with
Government as the Guarantor.

APPRAISAL OF
TEK TRANSMISSION PROJECT II
TUTRKSH ELECTRICITY AUTHORITY (TEK)
(TURKEY)
Draft Terms of Reference for Tariff Study
Background
The electric power sector in Turkey is controlled by the Ministry of
Energy and Natural Resources (M of E). The sector is served by the Turkish
Electricity Authority (TEK) established in 1970 pursuant to Law 1312 which
charges it with the responsibility for planning the general electrification
of Turkey, for constructing thermal power plants and transmission facilities.
The State Hydraulic Works (DSI) is responsible for the development of the
hydro potential of the country taking into consideration TEK's demands. The
hydro power installations become the responsibility of TEK to operate and
maintain in conjunction with the other generating facilities under its control.
At present TEK owns about 90% of the generating facilities of the
country, the balance being owned by concessionary companies, muncipalities and
private industrial interests. TEK is the main supplier of electrical energy
in biilk to the distributors, villages, government departments and some major
industrial users. The distributors are principally municipal authorities and
concessionary companies.
Over the past years, the power facilities have been gradually inter-
eonnected and it in expected that full interconnection may be achieved
by 1979. The process of electrical interconnection has not been matched by
rationalization of tariffs and there exists a large diversity of tariffs.
Tariffs are established under a 1967 decree which provides procedures and con-
trol under the M of E. Automatic fuel cost surcharge on tariffs may be applied
by TEK, but the distributing authorities may pass this on to their consumers
only after individual authorization to the distributor by the M of E.
Object
The study should recommend principles for establishment of tariffs at
both the bulk supply and retail levels with special reference to:     -
(a) a tariff structure ihich refloeots the incremental (or marginal)
costs of xapply at different:
- voltage levels of service
- times of day and times of year
and inkdifferent regions, bearing in mind,



ANNEX 2
Page 2 of 2
(b)  the potential reaction of consumers to the new tariffs,the
costs and technical complications of metering, and the
utilization range and diversity;
(c)  the provision of adequate revenues to meet appropriate financial
targets of the various constituent parts of the power sector;
(d)  the desirabiliTy or otherwise of unifying and simplifying
tariff structures throughout the country;
(e) the equitable sharing of development costs among the constituent
parts of the power sector;
(f)  a balanced development of the electric power sector relative
to alternatives; and
(g) rational and effective procedure for adjusting tariff levels
to reflect such major factors as fuel cost fluctuation.
scope
The consultant should carry out a general review of the sector
and a detailed study of the principal generating, tran5mitting and dis-
tributing authorities in Turkey and such a sample of the remaining entities
in the power sector as will allow him to draw representative conclusions
for the purpose of the study.  The studies should include, as a minimum,
the TEK, Ankara, Istanbul, Izmir, Konya, Adana and Cukurova authorities
and a 5% representative sample of the remaining distribution authorities
of the country.
Due consideration should be given to the longer term development
of the power resources as presently known, and to the planned industrial
and other development of the country.

Minutes of AeemenL BeLwecnr thie Bank
and Goveriment regarding Reorganization of the
Electric Power Sector in Turkey
A number of meetings were held from January 19 to January 27, 1966
in the Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources in Ankara, to discuss the
need to reorganize the electric power sector entities in Turkey and the
manner in which such reorganization could be accomplished.
Those participating in the meetings were: -
For thie Government of Turkey:
Ibrahim Deriner,
Minister of Energy and Natural Resources
Kemal Noyan,
Under Secretary, Ministry of Energy and
Natural. Resources
'evf ik likret Suer,
Presidernt, Energy Department
Kutlu Buyukdoluca,
Director General, ETE Idaresi
Rasim Kursuncu,
Assistant Director General, Etibank
Arif Onat,
Assistant Director General, DSI
Galip Mutdogan,
Energy Department, Assistant Director
of Study and Planning Division
For the World Bank:
Mr. M. Piccagli and Lord Hinton of Bankside.
At the end of the meetings the Minister of Energy and Natural
Resources decided to adopt the reorganization of the electric power industry
in Turkey as set out in these Minutes, insofar as his powers and authority
permit. Accordingly, the Minister will pursue the steps necessary to achieve
the reorganization of the entities now making up the power sector which would
result in the setting up, under the  Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources, of:
(1) An Electricity Authority, a new autonomous entity to be organized
by consolidating the responsibilities and staff now held for
power sector work by EIE, Etibank, Illerbank, DSI and some of
the functions of the Energy Deparument.



ANNEX 8
Page 2 of 4
(2) An Irrigation and Flood Control Authority, which is to retain
the scope of actuivities and responsibility now held by DSI,
except for the planning design, construction and operation of
hydro-electric projects (including those multi-purpose in
nature) waich would become the responsibility of the new
Electric Authority. However, the Minister of Energy, on the
recomnendation of the Coordinating CoUIcil for multi-purpose
projects, may authorize the Irrigation Authority to undertake
directly a multipurpose project where the power benefits are
small in dimensions, negligible in regard to system plann'ng
and marginal in the justification of the project.
(3) A Coordinating Council for Multi-purpose projects.
- Electricity Authority -
A Bill will be submitted to Parliament providing for the immediate
establishment of.the Electricity Authority.  (The Minister will also promote
the consequential changes in the present DSI Act which are entailed by his
decision.) The Authority will be a fully autonomous entity under the control
of a Board whose members will be appointed by the Minister of Energy and
Natural Resources. The Chairman of the Board will be appointed to serve full
time and will be the Chief Executive of the Authority. He will be chosen among
high ranking professionally qualified candidates with experience in matters
relating to electric power supply. The members of the Board, not to exceed ten
in number, shall also be full time and will occupy senior executive positions under
the Chairman (i.e. they will be the heads of the principal Departments of the
Authority.) The principal qualification for their appointment shall be outstanding
experience in the specific field of professional responsibility of each within the
A^uthority,coupled with the necessary administrative ability. In order to ensure
stability and continuity in management the Chairman and members of the Board shall
be appointed for a period of at least 5 years and will normally be expected to be re-
appointed at the end of such period, it being agreed tha-t dismissal or failure to
reappoint will only be decided on the basis of unsatisfactory performance of their
duties.
The Authority shall have full control of all activities inherent in
the provision of adequate supplies of electricity in the entire territory
of Turkey, including particularly the following:
- planning, design, construction and operation of all generating
transmission and distribution facilities which may be required
for the provision of such supplies.
- determination, subject to approval by an appropriate Division of
the Ministry according to rules which will be specifically laid out
in the Bill, of the charges and tariffs which will apply to the
provision of such electricity supplies.
The Authority will be responsible for maintaining detailed accounts
of its activities. In particular it will prepare, immodiatoly after the ontd
of each lisc.i yuar, u lwalaice sheot and a profit and loss statement to be



ANNEX 8
Page 3 of 4
submitted to review by qualified independent auditors, the results of such
audit to become available not later than four months after the close of each
fiscal year.
At the time of vesting, the Authority shall assume the assets and
liabilities related to electricity operations, including in particular all
generating plants at that time owned by distribution authorities and
Municipalities, except as provided in later clauses dealing with licensing,
and an opening balance sheet shall be established. In such tatke-over of
facilities and establishment of balance sheet, revalued depreciated historical
costs or depreciated current replacement values shall be used.
The Bill establishing the Authority shall specify, inter alia, the
following:
- authority to borrow, in Turkey and abroad;
- authority to make reasonable use of public utility condemnation
proceedings;
- authority to hire and fire personnel of all ranks, and to set
salary and wage levels which will ensure the appointment and
retention of competent personnel;
- principles of financial policy (this may take the form of a
mandate to earn not less than a specified minimum return on net
fixed assets);
- authority to recommend to the Itnister the conditions under which
he should license third parties (municipalities or private
companies) in specific instances to construct and/or operate
electricity facilities.
In connection with the last point it was particularly discussed and
agreed in the meetings that the Authority would include a Distribution
Dbpartment. It was envisaged that this Department would undertake the
direct distribution of electricity to the ultimate consumers, probably through
a number of Regional Distribution Divisions. In the event that Municipalities
and/or other entities should apply to continue or undertake the distribution of
electricity in their territories and meet the requirements and conditions to be
laid out in the license to govern the technical and financial conditions of
service, the Authority could recommend to the Minister the issuing of licenses
or concessions to that effect. Such licenses and concessions would be revoked
and the distribution facilities and service taken over by the Authority in the
event of failure by the licensee to continue meeting the requirements and
conditions of license.

Construction
Co-ordinating Council for Multi-purpose Projects
In the organization set out for the power sector, the Electricity
Authority is responsible for the planning, design and construction of all works
required to provide an economic and coordinated supply of electricity, including
hydroelectric generating plant. An Irrigation and Flood Control Authority will
retain responsibility for irrigation, flood control, drainage, etc.
It is obvious that, in the development of river basins and in multi-
purpose schemes the two Authorities will have interests which are sometimes joint
and sometimes conflicting. In order to ensure, at sll times, that the interests
of the two Authorities are properly and fully coordinated, the Minister of Energy
and Natural Fbsources shall appoint a Coordinating Council for multi-purpose
projects.

ANNEX 15
Page 1 of 3
APPRAISAL OF
TEK TRANSMISSION PROJMCT II
TURI\-SH ELI)CXTRICITY AUTHORITY (TEK)
(TURKEY)
Main Piinciples for Revauluation of TF.K's Assets
1.  Revaluation adjustments should be limited to Ilxed asset, accumulated
depreciation, and depreciation expense accounts (including property con-
tributed by customers).
2.  Depreciation adjusted (revalued) for price-level changes should be used
for rate-making purposes.
3.  Replacement cost estimates should not be used in revaluation.
l   Revaluation should be conduc-ted using a series of annual coefficients
based on a general price-level index and not specialized indices.
Specifically, the general wholesele price index published by the Ministry
of Coammerce of the Turkish Government should be used.
5.  Revaluation should be carried out whenever the above general whiolesale
price index as of September in each year has risen more -than 15% since
the last revaluation.
6.  Import duties paid should not be considered for revaluation if they are not
payable under current laws and regulations.
7. For the Ambarli power plant and for construction work in progress at
December 31, 1970 the year of expenditure can be directly determined from
accuunting records and revaluation coefficients-should be applied to the
expenditures by year.
8.  For all power plants other than Ambarli and for transmission properties
in service at December 31, 1970 the year of expenditure cannct be reasonably
determined.  Therefore, the revaluation procedure should be:
(a) Suinrmarize original investment and accumulated depreciation by
year placed in service.
(b)  Apply coefficients for the appropriate year minus i year for
transm.ission properties, minus 1 year for thermal generation
properties, and min-u  2 years for hyc'ro plants.
9¢  tFor all other properties not included in 7 or 8 above,, determine year placed
in service and apply appropriaite coeff cienLs.

10. Losses on foreign currency payables due to the 1970 devaluation of the
Turkish lira should be treaLed as follows:
(a)  The effect of the 1970 devaluation should be considered as
a cost of the related property.
(b)  The devaluation adjustment shuuld be reduced by an estimated
factor to compensate for any duplication between the devaluation
adjustment and prior-period price-level adjustments. Foreign
currency payables affected by the deval-uation rather than
property accounts should be used as a basis for measuring such
duplication to facilitate the computation.
(c)  The net amount should be amortized over the life of the related
assets using a composite or weighted average rate.
(d)  Such amortization should be used in rate making.
(e)  The unamortized amount should be included in the rate base.
(f)  The unamortized amount shuuld be subject to annual price-level
adjustments on the same basis as other property accounts.
(g)  The devaluation adjustmnent should be kept' in one or a limited
number of separate accounts for record-keeping purposes but
grouped with related accounts for financial reporting purposes.
11.  Fixed assets acquired prior to 1941 should be revalued using the 1941
coefficient.
12.  Fixed assets acquired by transfer at current values should be revalued
by reference to year of transfer as the acquisition date.
l13   Fixed assets acquired by transfer at original cost values should be revalued
by reference to original year of acq,oisition.
14. For revaluation purposes no adjustment of Etibank property accounts
should made for interest during construction which was not capitalized
at the time the property was placed in service.
15.  If depreciation rates are changed at any future date, the effect of such
change should be spread prospectively over periods subsequent to the
date or dates of change. Fixed asset and related depreciation accounts
should not be retroactively adjusted.



ANNEX 15
Page 3 of 3
16,  T'he revaluation adjustment should be reflected in separate accounts or
sub-accounts for each power plant, transnission district, or general
property accounting unit and depreciated on a composite rate based on
rates for properties which gave rise to the adjustment. Any retire-
ments or transfers of property in the future should carry with them the
appropriate portion of the revaluation and devaluation adjustments.

APPRAISAL OF
TEK TRANSMISSION PROJECT II
TURKISH ELECTRICITY AUTHORITY (TEK)
(TURKEY)
Main Assumptions Underlying Income Statements of TEK for 1975-1981
1.   Sales
Year                    1974   1975   1976   1977   1978   1979   1980   1981
(Actual)
Percentage increase
over previous year    9.6   12.3   18.7*  17.3*  15.0   10.8    9.0    8.6
*Meeting pent-up demand which could not be met earlier.
2.   Tariffs
Existing tariffs (in force from July 1, 1971 when they were raised by
an average of about 50%) are assumed to continue through December 1975. Tariff
increases of about 20% from January 1, 1976 and about 15% from January 1, 1977
are assumed for TEK to meet the agreed objective of a 6% return in 1976 and 8%
in 1977. Thereafter slight tariff adjustments are assumed in 1979 and 1980 to
continue earning an 8% return. No further increases are assumed thereafter.
3.   Fuel Costs
Fuel costs for 1974 (actual) reflect prevalent prices during the year
from time to time. Those from 1975 onwards are based on September 1975 prices,
the fuel oil component of which is around LT 1,260 per ton. The fuel-cost adjust-
ment clause in TEK's tariffs would compensate for any subsequent changes.
Fuel consumption varies from plant to plant depending on plant charac-
teristics and age. The following estimated costs per kWh have been used for coal,
lignite and gas oil.
Coal     -  9.31 krs in Catalagzi and 22.29 krs in Istanbul
Lignite  -  Ranging from 5.5 krs in Seyitomer to 17.48 krs in Izmir
- For Elbistan 11.16 krs corresponding to a price of LT 50.51
per ton and fuel consumption of 2.21 kg/kWh
Gas Oil  -  Ranging from 81.09 krs to 108.64 krs.



ANNEX 22

4.   Wages and Salaries
(a) Labor - In year for collective agreement - 20% increase
- In following year                  -  5% increase
(b)  Monthly-rated personnel - In each year   - 10% over existing salaries
(c) Effective June 1, 1974 and March 1975, Government has taken some
measures to make salary levels competitive, the estimated impact of
which has been included in the estimate for 1975 and for future
years. The two-month bonus approved by Parliament for 1975 is assumed
to continue in future.
(d) Additional staff is provided on estimated basis as and when new
plant is brought into service.
5.   Depreciation
Depreciation is charged on straight-line basis for the period during
which an asset is actually in service in a year. For 1973, the following
rates which closely follow the actual rates charged in the accounts have been
adopted:
Thermal   -   5%
Hydro     -   3.32% (2.7% for Gokcekaya)
Network   -   3.66%
These rates are slightly higher than those established as minimums under
Loan 763-TU.
From 1974 onwards, the following revised average rates based on the
individual rates agreed for various types of assets have been adopted:
Thermal   -   4%
Hydro     -   2.70% (except Keban and Karakaya, relatively
larger assets, for which 2.39% applies)
Network   -   3.25%
6.     Income Taxes
Income taxes are provided at 41.7% of taxable income.
