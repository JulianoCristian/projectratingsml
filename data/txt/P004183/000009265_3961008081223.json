Some of the lessons learned from the\n            project are: 1) while Electricite du Laos (EdL) is effective\n            at implementing International Development Association\n            (IDA)-financed projects, its relatively inexperienced staff\n            needs to be supplemented with technical assistance and\n            continuous training; 2) EdL, as the repository of the power\n            sector's technical expertise, needs control over the\n            development, implementation, and operation of the systems\n            being developed under internationally-financed projects; 3)\n            to enable EdL to cope with the growing complexity, its\n            increasing role as regulator and supervisor, partner in\n            large-scale joint venture projects, and the geographical\n            dispersion of its business, past informal practices for\n            managing operations and implementing projects need to be\n            supplemented with more formal systems and procedures, modern\n            technology, and communications facilities."}, "docdt": "1995-11-06T00:00:00Z"}
