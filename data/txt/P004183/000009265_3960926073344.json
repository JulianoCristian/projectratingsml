      electricity supply, the Southern Provinces Electrification\n            Project seeks to (a) create infrastructure in the power\n            sector; (b) support further economic development by meeting\n            demand for power from export and domestic markets in these\n            provinces; and (c) provide electricity to households,\n            schools, cooperatives, hospitals, etc., in these areas in\n            order to improve the quality of life.  The project also aims\n            to strengthen the institutions functioning in the power\n            subsector, particularly Electricite de Laos (EDL) and the\n            southern provincial electrical power authorities.  To this\n            end, the project includes (a) an interconnection, using a\n            115 kV transmission line, between the Thai grid and the\n            Xeset hydroelectric station, together with a 115 kV/22 kV\n            substation at Pakse; (b) electrification of areas in\n            Savannakhet, Champassak, and Saravane provinces; (c) a\n            pre-feasibility/feasibility study for future hydroelectric\n            project development in the southern areas of the Lao PDR and\n            (d) an institutional development program.  Finally, the\n            project entails (e) consulting services for engineering and\n            project implementation."}, "docdt": "1987-05-18T00:00:00Z"}
