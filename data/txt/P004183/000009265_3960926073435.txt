MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE LAO PEOPLE'S DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC
FOR A SOUTHERN PROVINCES ELECTRIFICATION PROJECT
1.         The following report on a proposed davelopment credit to the Lao
People's Democratic Republic (Lao POR) for SDR 19.8 million (US$25.8 million
equivalent) is submitted for approval. The proposed credit would be on
standard IDA terms and help finance the Southern Provinces Electrification
Project. The proceeds of the credit would be onlent to the Electricite du
Laos (EDL) under a Subsidiary Loan Agreement, with a 20-year term, including
five years of grace on repayment of principal, at an interest rate of 8.0%
p.a. The foreign exchange risk would be borne by EDL.
Background
2.         The three Southern Provinces account for about 32% of the country's
population, 20% of the land area and 39% of the country's rice production.
The economic development of these provinces has been hampered in the past due
to shortage of such inputs as raw materials, machinery, motive power (in the
form of electricity or diesel), and, above all, the substantial finance
required to support development. Per capita consumption of electricity in
1985 was less than 15 kWh per year for the three Southern Provinces, compared
with 340 kWh per capita in the Vientiane area. The use of alternatives
(diesel or kerosene) is not only costly but also not reliable due to poor road
conditions. Under the Second Five-Year Plan, the Government i: giving high
priority to the economic development of the Southern Provinces.
Project Objectives
3.         The objectives of the proposed project are:  (a) to create an
infrastructure for electricity supply in the provinces of Savannakhet,
Champassak, and Saravane; (b) together with other international financial
institutions, to support further economic development by meeting demand for
power from export and domestic markets in these provinces; and (c) to provide
electricity to households, schools, cooperatives, hospitals, etc., in these
areas in order to improve the quality of life. The proposed project also aims
to strengthen the institutions functioning in the power subsector, particu-
larly EDL and (through EDL) the southern provincial electrical power
authorities.
Project Description
4.         The proposed project would include (a) an interconnection, using a
115 kV transmission line, between the Thai grid and the Xeset hydroelectric
station (to be built under a project to be financed jointly by the Asian
Development Bank (ADB), the Swedish International Development Authority (SIDA)
and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)), together with a
115 kV/22 kV substation at Pakse; (b) electrification (including house wiring)
of areas in Savannakhet, Champassak, and Saravane provinces using 22 kV medium



- 2 -
voltage lines and 400 V/230 V distribution networks, with works to include
four warehouses, one prestressed concrete pole factory, and one wooden pole
treatment factory; (c) a pre-feasibility/feasibility study for future hydro-
electric project development in the southern areas of the Lao PDR including a
detailed feasibility study for upgrading and entension by about 2000 kW of the
Selabam hydropower station, followed by implementation of that extension if
proven technically and economically feasible; and (d) an institutional
development program which would provide (i) technical assistance for an
organization, management and finance study to strengthen the institutions
functioning in the power subsector, (ii) communication equipment, and
(iii) other facilities necessary to support the loss reduction program and
accounts receivable reduction program; and (e) consulting services for
engineering and project implementation.
5.         The project would be carried out over five years and would provide
funds for some works to be executed on a turnkey contract basis, equipment and
materials, technical assistance and consulting services. The total cost of
the project is estimated at US$32.6 million equivalent, with a foreign
exchange component of US$26.1 million (80%). A breakdown of costs and the
financing plan are given in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement
and disbursement and the disbursement schedule are given in Schedule B. A
timetable of key project processing events and the status of Bank Group
operations in the Lao PDR are given in Schedules C and D, respectively. One
map showing project locations is also attached. The Staff Appraisal Report
No. 6733-LA, dated May 18, 1987, is being distributed separately.
Rationale for IDA Support
6.         The Lao PDR is the poorest country in the region and one of the
poorest in the world. The proposed project would be a continuation of Bank
Group support for the Government's strategy for electric power development,
and for an integrated economic development of the Southern Provinces based on
financing key projects in parallel with other international financial institu-
tions. It would provide (a) much needed capital for investment in a project
consistent with the country's economic development objectives and (b)
strengthening of the sector's primary institution through the conduct of a
comprehensive organization, management and finance study (OMF study) and
implementation of an action program for implementing the study's recommenda-
tions.
Agreed Action
7.         At negotiations, the Government agreed (a) to onlend the proceeds
of the credit to EDL on terms satisfactory to the Associaton; and (b) to take
steps, including but not limited to adjusting electricity rates, to enable EDL
to meet the agreed self financing and debt service coverage ratios.
8.         EDL agreed (a) (i) by June 30, 1988, to retain consultants,
according to terms of reference and procurement procedures acceptable to the
Association, to conduct the OMF Study; (ii) by June 30, 1990, to discuss with
the Association the OMF Study's principal recommendations; (iii) according to
a schedule acceptable to the Association, to implement those of the OMF



- 3 -
Study's recommendations that are acceptable to the Government, EDL, and the
Association; (b) to implement a program, acceptable to the Association, to
reduce distribution losses; (c) to implement a program, acceptable to the
Association, to reduce arrears; (d) to furnish audited financial statements to
the Association within nine months of the end of each financial year; (e) to
take steps, including but not limited to proposing increases to its tariff,
ard implementing approved increases, to cover its operating costs (excluding
depreciation), net increases in working capital, major repairs expenditures,
debt service, and Government tax obligations, and meet 20% of its average
annual investment program from internal cash generation; and (f) to refrain
from incurring additional debt unless a reasonable forecast of revenues net of
cash operating expenses, increases in working capital, major repairs
expenditures, dividends, and Government tax obligations are sufficient to meet
1.1 times its aggregate debt service obligations for each year during the term
of che debt to be incurred.
9.         An understanding was received that EDL would apply economic
criteria in the selection of sites for future rural electrification
developments.
10.        Conditions of effectiveness of the proposed Credit are:
(a) Execution of a Subsidiary Loan Agreement between the Borrower and EDL; and
(b) Confirmation that the ADB Board of Executive Directors has approved a loan
to finance the construction of the Xeset hydroelectric power station.
Justification
11.        Due to lack of public electricity supply in the south, costly
alternatives (diesel and kerosene) are being used in the remote towns and
villages, small industries and agroprocessing establishments. The cost of
these alternatives is estimated at about USi 16.0/kWh for residential and
commercial consumers and US 12.0/kWh for industrial consumers, compared with
an estimated marginal cost of electricity of USi 12.0/kWh for the Xeset-
supplied grid. In an integrated d-velopment with the Xeset Hydroelectric
Project, the proposed project constitutes the least cost solution for electri-
city supply for Champassak and Saravane provinces. Any surplus energy beyond
the consumption of these two provinces can be exported to Thailand. The over-
all economic rate of return of the project, considered together with the Xeset
Hydroelectric Project, is estimated at about 11%.
Risks
12.        No major risks are associated with the proposed project.  Land
required for the 115 kV transmission line and substations has already been
acquired by EDL. Major works will be contracted on a turnkey basis. Consult-
ing engineers have already been appointed to assist in procurement, detailed
engineering, training, construction supervision and management, start-up
testing and commissioning. Construction of the 22 kV and 400 V/230 V distri-
bution networks will be carried out by EDL's construction force, following an
approach similar to what EDL used in implementing the ADB financed rural elec-
trification projects in the Vientiane area. The proposed project's principal
locations are considered secure areas by UNDP.

Recommendation
13.        I am satisfied that the proposed Credit would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed Credit.
