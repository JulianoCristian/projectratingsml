Urban population in the country grew\n            considerably during the 1960s to about forty (40) percent of\n            the total population. As a result the education system was\n            well developed and relatively advanced; however, its output\n            lacked specialists and technicians. This education project\n            will reduce the urban workforce shortage in important\n            economic sectors like transportation and manufacturing and\n            improve the quality of primary and secondary education. The\n            country\u0092s interregional transport center accounts for about\n            fifty (50) percent of the gross domestic product (GDP), and\n            manufacturing services account for about fifteen (15)\n            percent of the GDP. The government of the Republic of Congo\n            is concerned about skilled personnel to secure proper\n            operation of existing infrastructure, as well as assure the\n            implementation of planned investments in the future. This\n            education project does not involve the sixty (60) percent of\n            the population that subsides on agriculture, working in\n            forestry, a sector that provides tax incentive to the government."}, "docdt": "1971-03-16T00:00:00Z"}
