PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CONGO
APPRAISAL OF AN EDUCATION PROJECT
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        Agricultural and industrial development programs in Congo are
aimed at diversification of production for the domestic market and for
exports and modernization of the distribution of goods. Consequently,
the country requires increased numbers of skillecl workers for industry,
commerce and agriculture.
ii.       The vocational training and technical education system is not
responsive to labor market needs and until recently did not receive sys-
tematic attention.  This has resulted in shortages of qua1ified manpower.
Moreover, the quality of elementary education is still too low to support
a broad and rapid increase of the general educational level of the labor
force. A shortage of trained teachers aggravates the situation. lt is
necessary to plan education and training facilities with due regard to
manpower requirements and to improve and expand technical and vocational
education and teacher training.
iii.      The proposed project would assist the expansion and modernization
of vocational training for rural development at the post-primary level;
of technical education and science teaching at th,e senior secondary level;
and of training of primary school teachers. It would include one new ele-
mentary (rural) vocational training center; one new technician training
iristitute; one new primary teacher training college; and expanded provis-
ion for science teaching at two senior secondary general schools. Tech-
nical assistance for project implementation, curriculum development, in-
struction and counterpart training is also included.
iv.       The project would add 100 student places at the trained worker
level, 250 at the technician level, and 240 laboratory places in senior
secondary general schools. There would be a sufficient number of qualified
pupils for entry to the institutions included in the project. The prospects
of employment for those who complete the courses are good. The number of
qualified teachers, when reinforced by those to be supplied under tech-
nical assistance, would be sufficient to staff these institutions.
v.        Accommodation schedules have been revised in conformity with
acceptable standards. Furniture and equipment costs are appropriate and
economical.  A project unit, to be set _p-within the Iinistry of Education,
would be responsible for implementation, assisted by consultant architects
who would undertake design and supervision of the construction work.
vi.       The proposed project is estimated to require 3-1/2 yeare for
completion of the construction ite=s and 5-1/2 yeara for completion of the
technical assistance. Contracts would be awarded on the basis of inter-



- ii. -
national competitive bidding. It is assumed that locally based contractors
would carry out çonstruction, but that all equipEent and about half of the
furniture would be imported.
vii.      A development credit of US$ 3.5 million would finance 85% of the
total cost of the project which is estlr.ated at US$ 4.1 million equivalent.
US$ 2.5 million or 71% of the credit would finance foreign exchange expend-
itures. The balance of US$ 1.0 million or 29% of the credit would finance
local currency expenditures.
viii.     The project i8 suîtable as a basis for an IDA credit of US$ 3.5
million equivalent to the People's Republic of Congo for a period of 50
years including a grace period of 10 years.



APPRAISAL OF AN EDUCATION PROJECT IN THE
PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CONGO Y
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      Bank/IDA economic missions which visited Congo in late 1968 and
in June 1970 have emphasized the lack of qualified,manpower at all levels.
At the request of the Government, a Unesco mission visited the country in
January-February, 1969 to identify priority projects.   Another Unesco
mission in October, 1969, assisted the Government in the preparation of
this project. In January, 1970, the Government of Congo applied for an
IDA credit to assist the development of technical and science education,
vocational training, and primary teacher training.
1.02      An appraisal mission comprising Messrs. K. Bahr (economist), A.
Stam (architect), M. Loewen (general education, consultant), R. Martinez
(technical education, consultant) and J. Voisin (agricultural education,
FAO) visited Congo in March-April, 1970.  It found that for one project
item, science and technology equipment for junior secondary general schools,
the Government had already obtained assistance from other sources. The
project was further modified to adapt it more closely to labor market needs,
to reduce costs and to encourage much needed educational reforms.  In agree-
ment with the Government, equipment lists were revised, construction itens
were reduced and the amount of technical assistance was increased.
1.03      The amended project comprises:
(i)  an elementary vocational training center;
(îi)  a technician training institute;
(iii) expansion of science laboratories at two senior secondary
general schools;
(iv) a primary teacher training college; and
(v)  technical assistance for project implementation, curriculum
development, instruction and counterpart training.
The total estimated project cost would be US$ 4.1 million with a foreign
exchange component of US$ 2.5 million.
1/   For purposes of this report referred to as Congo.



-2-
1.04      The elementary vocational training center is a pilot scheme for
training young artisans for rural employment: it would be directly related
to a regional rural development plan. Techniciap training would be re-
located and improved to meet industrial needs. The provision for science
teaching and the teacher training college would improve the quality of
education.
Social and Economic Background
1.05       Congo (Brazzaville) covers approximately 342,000 km" (132,000
sq. mi.), being almost two-thirds the size of France. Equatorial forests
cover two-thirds of the country; savannahi covers 237 and swamps form the
remainder. About 1% of the land is used for agriculture.
1.06      Estimated total population in 1970 is 936,000 (Annex 1) about
half of which is literate. Overall population density is less than 3
persons per km2 and less than 20 persons in the most densely populated
region. The estimated annual population growth of 2.4% is comparatively
high. Nearly three-fourths of the total population live in one-third of
the country's area, between Brazzaville and the coast. About 45% of the
population is below 17 years of age; some 43% live in urban areas. This
high urbanization, together with the continuing rural exodus, result in
increasing urban unemployment, particularly among youths, and in relative
overaging of the rural population. Total wage employment is about 82,000
or 16% of the active population; 22,000 of those are employed in Govern-
ment services. An estimated 57,000 persons or 11% of the active popula-
tion are self-employed. Under-employment is high.
1.07      Congo has an agricultural economy, with more than 70% of the
active population working in the primary sector, mainly in subsistence-type
agriculture, producing about 15% of GDP. Manufacturing and construction
contribute an estimated 28% to GDP whereas the tertiary sector has become
unusually large with about 57% of GDP. This is partly due to the transit
function of Congo for the Central African Republic, Chad, Gabon and Cameroon.
In addition, the Government sector has continued to expand but in directions
somewhat unrelated to economic needs. GDP in current market prices, grow-
ing at about 5% per year is estimated at CFAF 65 billion (US$ 255 per
capita) in 1969. However, because of the particular capital structure
factor payments abroad are probably large, and the per capita GNP is likely
to be noticeably lower than US$ 255. Although investments have been high
over the last six years at about 25% of GDP, this trend is not likely to
continue since the more promising investment opportunities,, which led to
the creation of several industrial plants, have already been exploited.
The country now has to develop its technical and administrative capacity
to manage and aperate the plants effectively before it can enter another
phase of accelerated investment activity.

II. THE EDUCATION SYSTEM
2.01      Congo's educational system is among the most advanced in Africa
in respect of numbers enrolled, with about 70% enrollment of the age group
7 to 16 1/. Total enrollments increased by almost 45% during 1965-70. The
rapid growth of the education sector has not, however, been related to
the specific needs for qualified manpower in the various sectors of the
economy. In particular, vocational education and training have not re-
ceived adequate attention, leading to surpluses in some fields, e.g.,
construction trades, and shortages in others, such as the electrical and
mechanical trades. Furthermore, the efficiency of the educational system
is low, rendering education costly. Drop-out rates are about 50% in ele-
mentary education and 20% in secondary education.
2.02      The average qualification of Congolese teachers is low.  Schools
are underequipped or equipment is underutilized because of shortage of qua-
lified teachers and lack of supervision.  Generally, currieula are too aca-
demic and ill-adapted to the country; teaching is based on rote book learn-
ing. A reform of education, including a new elementary school curriculum,
is being considered by the Government, and a detailed analysis of the system
has already begun, assisted by Unesco.
Structure and Organization
2.03      The system comprises 6 years of elementary, 4 years of junior
secondary, 3 years of senior secondary and 4 years of higher education
(Chart 1). Education is compulsory for children of ages 7-16 and is free
at all levels.  In order to provide the necessary number of places at,
the junior secondary level (grades 7-10), pre-vocational schools and ele-
mentary training centers have been opened. At the university level, sev-
eral courses are to be extended to the diploma (or M.A.) level. In
1969-70, total enrollments had approached 250,000, representing about 27%
of the country's population (Annex 2 and Chart 2). Almost 30% of junior
secondary and more than 80% of senior secondary teachers are foreigners
(Annex 3).
Administration
2.04      The blinistry of Education is responsible for all levels of gen-
eral and vocational education except agricultural schools but policy is
strongly influenced by the National Planning Bureau. Agricultural education
is the responsibility of the State Secretary for Development in charge of
agriculture. The structure of the Ministry of Education is satisfactory
except that technical and vocational education forms part of the secondary
1/   Comparable figures are:  Cameroon 75%, Gabon 65%, Ivory Coast 40%,
Chad 24%.

school department. It should be given adequate status to permit the devel-
opment of this branch of education independently from the largely tradition-
al, academic general education. During negotiations, assurances were given
by the Governnent that this will be done not later than February 1, 1972.
Educational planning is being developed as a permanent function of the Min-
istry in cooperation with the National Planning Bureau.
2.05      Inspectorates are either understaffed or non-existent.  Secondary
school inspection is undertaken on an ad hoc basis by_Ministry staff.  Tech-
nical education inspection covers the elementary training centers (CEFP) only
and does not include secondary technical education. Assurances were given
by the Government during negotiations that the separate division for tech-
nical and vocational education which would be set up in the Ministry (para.
2.04) would have qualified staff to provide for school supervision includ-
ing guidance to the schools on syllabus development.
2.06      Supplementary education programs for out-of-school youths, adult
education, agricultural and para-medical training, courses in government
administration and a few pre-vocational subjects are offered by various
ministries. Although of an ad hoc nature, all of these programs are ade-
quate in scope, content and responsiveness to labor market needa.
2.07      In 1968, a center for educational documentation and research was
established to cover documentation, audio-visual aids, pedagogical research
and curriculum development. Staff have been provided by the Fonds d'Aide
et de Cooperation (FAC) which will supply buildings later.
Elementary Education
2.08      219,000 pupils were enrolled in the six elementary grades during
1969-1970, of whom 32% were repeaters. Only about 12% of the sixth grade
pupils have not repeated a class. Some progress towards decreasing the
repeater incidence to 23% by 1980 (Annex 4) is being made through the ten-
tative introduction of automatic promotion.
2.09      Only 40% of the 3600 elementary school teachers are fully quali-
fied (Chart 3). The government is retraining the, others in an effective up-
grading program. Equipment and facilities are minimal and only a small
allocation is made for school supplies. A new curriculum which is being
planned by the pedagogy research office will introduce pre-vocational
courses.
Secondary General Education
2.10      Under the pressure of the rapidly increasing school age population,
secondary education was reorganized in 1967. 55 four-year junior secondary
schools (grades 7-10) had been opened by 1969-70 to absorb the large output
of students from the elementary schools, few of whom would meet highly
selective entrance requirements of the four senior secondary schools (lycees).



- 5 -
Some reform of the junior secondary school curriculum is in progress but
the traditional French system remains at the upper secondary level. Teach-
ing standards show a wide range of quality; less than 25% of those who enter
grade 7 pass the grade 10 final examination without having repeated at least
once. 22% of the age group 13-16 now have access to junior high school8.
Enrollments are expected to more than double by 1980. Teachers for the
junior high schools are adequately trained in the Ecole Normale Superieure
in Brazzaville.
2.11      In 1969/70, 2,000 students were enrolled in general senior sec-
onceary schools, the lycees, (grades 11-13) and 7,700 (Annex 4) are expected
at the end of the decade. Only about 13% of those who enter grade 11 comr-
plete grade 13 successfully. All teachers are qualified but only 20% are
Congolese. Equipment is insufficient, particularly for science subjects.
The number of classroom places would allow for a substantial increase in
enrollment but laboratory space is inadequate.
Technical Education and Vocational Training
2.12      Four junior secondary technical achools offering two-year (grades
9-10) courses for 1,100 students produce semi-skilled workers in mrechanics,
construction and office work. Whereas the graduates from the mechanics
course find employment, those from the construction courses are more slowly
absorbed due to an extended slowdown in the building sector. Equipment
of these schools is satisfactory. They have sufficient funds for teaching
material and maintenance. Qualified teachers are available in sufficient
number.
2.13      The country has one senior secondary technical school, the Lycee
Technique, (grades 11-13) offering 2 and 3-year courses in industrial, agri-
cultural and commercial subjects. Training is at the skilled worker and
technician levels but the curriculum and the syllabi are not closely linked
to labor market needs. All teachers are qualified; less than 15% are Con-
golese. Local teachers for this school are to be trained in a new inter-
state institute to be opened in Gabon. The 3-year course provides university
entrance qualifications and few graduates have so far sought employment in
industry but have continued their education in third-level institutions in
Congo or abroad. The 2-year course, which produces semi-skilled craftsmen,
does not qualify for university entrance and its graduates all find em-
ployment.
2.14      The government, faced with the problem of compulsory school
attendance up to age 16, yet without sufficient junior secondary schools
to accommodate the elementary schools output, is opening practical orienta-
tion centers (Centres d'Orientation Professionnelle, COP), offering two-year
classes in agriculture and crafts. The approach is desultory and the centers
resemble work camps where students mark time until they have reached the
age of 16.



-6 -
2.15      Twenty-five elementary vocational training centers (Centres Ele-
mentaires de Formation Professionnelle, CEFP), offering two-year courses for
about 1,000 elementary school leavers, were created some years ago to provide
farmer and artisan training. Instruction is poor and unadapted to local
needs. A more recent restructuring of the program into fewer but larger
centers with more teachers and equipment and, most important of all, inte-
gration into regional development programs, promises success.
Teacher Training
2.16      In 1969/70, 516 elementary school teacher students were enrolled
in three schools, in three-year courses (grades 11-13) and in one-year
"crash" courses (grade 11). A new, expanded 200-place upgrading program
for unqualified teachers will be implemented. Curriculum and teachlng
standards of the teacher training schools are adequate but equipment needs
substantial improvement.
2.17      Teachers for the junior secondary schools are trained at the
Higher Normal School (Ecole Normale Superieure, ENS) in Brazzaville, joint-
ly operated by the Central African Republic, Chad, Gabon and Congo. In
1969/70, 257 Congolese and 100 students from neighboring countries enrolled.
Equipment and teaching standards are good. Almost 75% of thle teachers are
non-Africans.
University Training
2.18      The Brazzaville center for higher studies (Centre d'Etudes Supe-
rieures de Brazzaville, CESB) i part of the interstate university set up
in 1961 by Chad, the Central African Republic, Gabon and Congo. The center
offers the first two years of studies in literature and social sciences, the
physical sciences, and law. Of 1,100 students during 1969-70, the great
majority were studying law, with little hope of related employment later.
2.19      Although the first two years of university training are available
in Brazzaville, it is more economical to send students abroad for the last
two years of university work and so many students are sent abroad at gov-
ernment expense. A system of selective scholarships or of using selectively
the scholarships offered by other countries has not been developed to direct
students into fields related to future needs for senior secondary school
teachers and the higher administrative cadres. In 1969-70 there were about
720 Congolese studying abroad.
III. EDUCATION FINANCE
3.01      The Ministry of Education budget pro-vides finance for all elemen-
tary, secondary general and technical schoolse primary teacher training
and about half of a large scholarship program, the other half being fin-
anced from the budgets of- other Ministries. Contributions to the inter-



-7-
state higher education institutions are financed directly through the
Treasury in agreement with the Ministry of Education.  Çertain vocational
education and training activities are organized and financed by other
Ministries. Education at al. levels is free. In addition, subsistence
grants are paid to a large numuber of pupils.
Past Expenditure.
3.02      At an estimated 6% of GDP (1970) total education expenditure is
comparatively high. 1/ Although the share of education in government ex-
penditure fell from 28% ln 1966 to 23% ln 1969, in absolute terms, it has
increased from CFAF 3.6 billion in 1966 to CFAF 4.2 billion in 1970, an
average growth of 3.9% per annum. This increase is considerably lover than
the 5.2%. annual average growth of total enrollments and also far below the
9.3% annual average growth of Government expenditure (Annex 5).
3.03      Recurrent expenditure on education expanded by about 9% per annum
during 1966-1970, at a greater rate than total enrollments. Its share of
total government recurrent expenditures grew slightly from 24.6% to 25.2Z
during the same period.
3.04      Capital outlay fluctuated, depending more on social pressure than
on a systematic plan.  Investments in plant and equipment for the period
1966-70 were low, at less than 10% of total education expenditure as com-
pared with 15Z-20% in other developing countries.
3.05      The distribution of recurrent education expenditures by the Minis-
try of Education between levels of education (Annex 6) shows an increase
in the share of junior secondary schools from 12% ln 1966 to 20% ln 1969,
at the expense of elementary education. Expenditure on technical and vo-
cational education increased from 19% to 24% in junior secondary insti-
tutions and from 16% to 21% at the senior secondary level.  The distribu-
tion between types of expenditure (Annex 7) reveals a steady increase of
the share of salaries to 90% in 1970 and a decline of equipment and teaching
material expenditures to below 5% which tends to increase the inefficiency
of the education system. Unit recurrent costs per student-year (Annex 8)
are within the range of similar costs found in other West African countries.
Foreign Aid
3.06      Foreign aid to education is mainly in the form of teachers,
amounting to 45% of all secondary level teachers ln 1970; provision of
books, equipment and buildings is also important. Foreign teachers occupy
posts provided for in the Congolese education budget and receive additional
payments from their home Governments.
1/   Comparable data:  Zambia 6.2% (1968); Uganda 5.2% (1970); Ivory Coast
5.1% (1967); Chad 3.5% (1967).



-8-
Future Expenditure
3.07      Recurrent education expenditures by all Ministries are estimated
to reach CFAF 5.3 billion (in 1969 prices) by 1975 (Annex 9). No signifi-
cant changes of the educational system are at present foreseen beyond the
expansion due to demographic development and the changes to be introduced
by the project described in this report. The estimated recurrent costs of
the proposed project (CFAF 72.5 million) would amount to less than 2% of re-
current education expenditures.
IV. THE NEED FOR THE PROJECT
Manpower Needs
4.01      Until recently economic growth depended to a large extent on for-
eign private investment and production activities but the Government has
now begun to increase public participation in the economy through creating
mixed companies in major economic branches, such as mining, textiles and
ceement production. More consistent planning, both at the macro;and the
sectoral level, is now being undertaken. A more diversified and better
trained manpower input is urgently required to develop more complex and
more efficient systems of production and distribution of goods and ser-
vices. The need is indicated not only by the scarcity of high and middle
level trained Congolese but also by the slow implementation of a number
of public sector projects due to shortages of qualified personnel.
4.02      In 1968-69 about 2% of the 55,000 persons employed outside Govern-
ment had university level training, of whom less than one-fourth were Congo-
lese (Annex 10). About 6% were employed as technicians and skilled workers,
20% were semi-skilled and a little over 70% were untrained workers.
4.03      The forecast of average manpower requirements and supply is as
follows (see also Annex 11):

This forecast is based on projections of wage employment that assume: (i) a
moderate expansion of economic activity (4% in real terms annually); (ii) the
use of labor intensive production processes; (iii) improvement in labor pro-
ductivity; and (iv) a gradual replacement of expatriates currently in high
and middle level positions. About one third of the expatriates will be re-
placed in the seventies due to increasing government participation in invest-
ment and production (para. 4.01) and an increasing supply of trained Congo-
lese.
4.04      The proposed project would help to meet two major needs:
(i) the requirement for rural artisans, industrial technicians
and primary school teachers; and
(ii) a qualitative improvement in primary and secondary education.
4.05      Manpower shortages would be reduced in those sectors most impor-
tant to economic development. The technician training institute would pro-
duce 90 new technicians annually. The teacher training college would train
190 per year, enough to supply the needs of new elementary classes. Addi-
tional teachers for replacements will come from secondary school graduates.



- 10 -
4.06      Even after project implementation, the annual supply in the cate-
gorles mentioned above will remain somewhat below the need. A larger pro-
ject, aimed at meeting demands in a shorter period, is inadvisable at this
time due to the shortage of instructional staff and fiscal limitations on the
growth of recurrent expenditures.
Elementary Vocational Training
4.07      Elementary vocational training centers (CEFP) were established [n
Congo some years ago (para. 2.15) but they have not been successful. In-
struction has been of low quality and the output of the centers has not found
appropriate employment. A recent program proposes to concentrate the exist-
ing 25 CEFP into fewer, more effective units. The first of these has been
developed with FAC assistance.
4.08      The Government is now preparing a development program for Boko and
the surrounding region southwest of Brazzaville. It is the most densely
populated region of Congo, with a population of 65,000 (about 5,000 in the
age group 15 to 20). Though the Boko region is not at present a major sup-
plier of Brazzaville, the European Development Fund (FED) will soon provide
a new road to Boko which is expected to result in a big expansion of its
cash crops. This will creat an increased demand for skilled artisans and
agricultural workers. A vocational training center has therefore been in-
cluded in the proposed project, to be an integral part of the rural develop-
ment program and provide training in the skills needed by a developing com-
munity.
Technician Training
4.09      At present the Congo has no effective technician training.  The
technician course offered by the senior seconidary techni-cal .school at
Brazzaville (para. 2.13) has too few places, is too theoretical in content,
being based on preparation for university, and it is located in a non-indus-
trial region.  It therefore does not produce technicians for industry.  The
shortfall of about 95 technicians annually is shown in para. 4.03. The
establishment of a technician training institute in the industrial area of
Pointe Noire, offering industry-oriented courses and motivating students
properly is, therefore, of high priority.
Science Teaching in Senior Secondary Schools
4.10      Education in science and technology is esnential for the devel-
opment of a modern economy, the broad foundations o.2 this knowledge being
laid mainly in the formal education process, particularly during secondary
education. At present, two of the senior secondary general schools of the
Congo cannot provide a science curriculum effectively due to the lack of
laboratories and equipment.  The introduction of science curriculum refo:.
has had to be postponed for the same reason. The provision of adequate
laboratory facilities and science equipment is ther2fore essential to im-
prove the quality of science teaching. Well qualified teachers are avail-



- il -
able. At present the majority of sciénce teachers are expatriates. How-
ever, university level teacher training programs provide for sufficient
numbers of qualified Congolese science teachers to become available.
Teacher Training
4.11      About 40% of the elementary school teachets possess a full certif-
icate but their actual professional standards are generally low. Elementary
education is therefore of poor quality, leading to sericus waste of scarce
resources (para. 2.01).  In order to raise the 4uality of the teaching force,
primary teaclher training should be improved andîexpanded. Muèh of the pre-
sent training capacity, which is inefficiently àcattered over the country,
is used for upgrading already employed teachers.i The present annual output
for employment is about 70 teachers as against a need for about three times
that figure.  Pupil-teacher ratios would then i!prove from the present 58:1
to 53:1 by 1975 and to 45:1 by 1980. Consolidation of teacher training
facilities in one location at Dolisie would provide an increased output and
decrease operating costs per graduate in addition to permitting better use
of teaching staff time. Existing elementary schools in Dolisie would serve
as practice classrooms for the new teachers.
V. THE PROJECT
A.        Technical Features
5.01      The project would comprise:
(a) the construction of and furniture and equipment for,
(i) an elementary vocational training center;
(il) a technician training institute;
(iii) the addition of 10 laboratories to two senior secondary
general schools;
(1v) an elementary teacher training college; and
'(b)  technical assistance for project implementation and curriculum
development.

Total              680         1,270
/1   Three amall teacher training institutes vill be consolidated in one
location; the number of training places will remain unchanged.
Elementary Vocational Training Center
5.03      This center would offer one-year vocational training courses for
boys in agriculture (30 places), carpentry and vehicle mechanics (30 places).
A home economics section would train 40 girls at a time in 6-month courses.
The basic skills taught would be appropriate for employment in rural areas.
The center would not be a direct continuation of elementary educatton; en-
trants would be at least 16 years old 80 that 2-3 years would have passed
between elementary education and entry to this vocational training. Pro-
vision would be made for 100 places with boarding for 80 trainees. Boarding
is necessary because of the large catchment area and the lack of suitable
communication. The estimated annual output would be 140 who are expected
to find employment related to the regional development program for the Boko
area. Ad hoc courses would also be offered to meet local specific needs of
the rural community.
5.04      The center would include a placement service for its carpentry and
mechanics graduates and an agricultural extension service to assist the agri-
culture graduates. The data collected by these services would regulate the
courses offered and the intake of new students to the training center and
would also affect the eventual building of new centers elsewhere. The faci-
lities of the school would be available to its graduates for repair of equip-
ment and for refresher courses in the latest trends in agriculture and its
markets. Short courses would be offered to farmers in the area. If this
pilot center proves successful, it is anticipated that the pattern will be
adopted by the other centers.



- 13 -
5.05      Curriculum will need revision and instructors will require retrain-
ing.  During negotiations theé Government gaveùaifti-afncés 7rëg-arn-gï
(i)  integration of the center into the regional development
program through the setting up of an advisory board to                 k
the center not later than February 1, 1972, involving
the cooperation of all Government agencies concerned
with the implementation of the regional development
program;
(ii) provision of outline curricula to IDA for comment not-
later than February 1, 1973; and
(iii)  introduction of instructor training, student placement,
and refresher courses not later than February 1, 1973.
Technician Training Institute
5.06      The senior secondary technical school at Brazzaville, which offers
2 and 3-year courses in industrial, agricultural and commercial subjects,
also has a small industrial technician training section leading to a certi-
ficate which qualifies for university entrance (para. 2.13). As a result,
the graduates do not enter industry but proceed to further education. The
section is to be closed and a technician training institute is proposed for
Pointe-Noire, the country's major industrial growth area. The new institute
would offer 3-year courses at the senior secondary level in mechanics,
electricity and civil engineering. Total enrollment would be 340. Actual
places would number only 290 since part of the final year of the course
would be spent on practical work in industry. The estimated annual output
would be about 90. The course would include more practical work than its
predecessor and award technician certificates which do not qualify for univer-
sity entrance since the training is to meet labor market needs. Preparation
for university will continue to take place at the senior secondary technical
school at Brazzaville to which pupils of the technician training institute
would have access. The space vacated by the technician section would be
adapted for use by commercial classes.
5.07      The curriculum for the institute has still to be developed and
the available teachers will need retraining. 9-1/2 man-years of technical
assistance are necessary for curriculum development, instruction and counter-
part training. An advisory board, to include representatives of indus-
trial employerse the technician training institute, the vocational and techni-
cal education department of the Mlinistry of Education, and the senior secon-
dary technical school at Brazzaville would be set up to assist t4e institute
in the placement of students during the period of industrial training, in
their placement after graduation and in the continuous adaptation of the cur-
riculum to the needs of industry.



- 14 -
5.08      During negotiations, assurances were given by the Government that:
(i)  an advisory board would be set up not later than
February 1, 1972; and
(ii)  a practically-oriented curriculum would be developed
and submitted to IDA for comment not later than Feb-
ruary 1, 1973.
Science Laboratories
5.09      At present the two senior secondary general schools at Pointe
Noire and Brazzaville (Chaminade) included in the project have only two
science laboratories for enrollments of 940 and 535 respectively. It is
proposed to add 10 laboratories - 6 at the former and 4 at the latter -
increasing the number of laboratory places from 48 to 288 places.  This
would permit operation of the full science curriculum. The increase in
laboratory places would also permit an increase in the overall enrollment
capacity by about 100 since present general classroom places are under-
utilized (para. 2.11).
Elementary Teacher Training College
5.10      This school to be located at Dolisie will replace three existing
smaller institutions at Mouyondzi, Fort Rousset and Dolisie (para. 4.11).
One section will train new teachers in a three-year program leading to an
elementary school teacher's certificate and a second section will provide
a one-year in-service program to upgrade teachers already in service. The
school will work closely with the center for educational research at Braz-
zaville (para. 2.07).
5.11      The present teacher training school at Mouyondzi will be reserved
for the upgrading of lower level monitors to the assistant teacher level,
this training at lower academic levels being more suited to a separate
institution. The teacher training section at Fort Rousset is presently
occupying facilities intended for a junior high"school which will take over
this space for its expanding enrollment. Most of the buildings on the
present Dolisie site are in disrepair and unusable for other purposes.
5.12      The course of studies would place considerable emphasis on pragtice
teaching in the Dolisie elementary schools. The school would have a total
capacity of 520 places and an estimated annual output of 190, which is
below the anticipated needs of about 210. However, a shift of emphasis
from retraining to new training during the first year after project comple-
tion provides sufficient flexibility. No additional staff is foreseen since
the Dolisie school would regroup present African and foreign personnel.  Expa-
triate teachers are being systematically replaced by qualified Congolese.

Technical Assis tance
5.13      Congo does not yet have qualified teachers and instructors in
sufficient number for the elementary vocational training center and the
technician training institute. The success of these institutions, which
are unique for Congo, will depend to a large extent on experienced teaching
personnel.  At the same time, curricula and syllabi have to be developed
for these two schools. The project would therefore include 18 aan-years of
technical assistance for instructors and teachers in technical and vocationa
training to undertake the initial work of development and instruction, in-
cluding the training of counterparts. The Ministry of, Education does not
possess sufficient experience in project coordination and execution and an
educational adviser to the project director is therefore included under               'i
technical assistance.  A school building specialist to assist the project        -    h
unit as project architect will also be necessary since no permanent govern-
vent staff is available for this assignment.  These two posts would add a
further 8 man-years of technical assistance, making a total of 26 man-years
in all (Annex 12).
B.        Cost of the Proiect
5.14      The total cost of the proposed project is estimated at CFAF 1,153

5.16      Accommodation schedules for the project schools have been amended
on the basis of acceptable standards. The estimated unit area costs applied
to construction requirements are based on recent experiences in similar
projects in Congo, with adjustments for regional differences in costs.
They average about US$ 130 per m2, which is high but compares well with
neighboring Francophone countries. The local currency component of 10%
included in equipment estimates is to cover local transportation and hand-
ling charges.
5.17      Contingency allowances (which amount to 18.8% of the total project
cost and about 24% of the total cost without contingencies) have been pro-
vided for unforeseen expenditures and price increases. They amount to 30%
of estimated cost for site development, furniture and equipment, 25% for
construction and 15% for professional services and technical assistance
(Annex 14).
5.18      All proposed sites for the project schools have been visited and
found satisfactory.  During negotiations assurances were obtained from the
Government that all sites would be acquired not later than February 1, 1972.
5.19      Estimated costs per student and per boarding place, excluding
contingencies and professional fees, are as follows:

These unit costs are reasonable and may be compared with estimated unit
costs for similar institutions in the Cameroon where academic and communal
facilities are estimated to cost $1,245 per place for teacher training and
$1,485 per place for technician training.
5.20       The government should be able to meet the annual recurrent costs
which would be created by the project and also its share of the capital
costs (para. 3.07 and Arinex 9) without curtailng expenditures for other
ongoing educational activities and without overburdening the education
budget. The estimated recurrent costs of the project would amount to less
than 2% of recurrent education expendWtures.

C.        Execution of the Project
5.21      Construction work and furniture and equipment proecurement under
the proposed project should be completed in 3-1/2 years from effectiveness
of the credit. Including completion of technical assistance, project imple-
mentation would require 5-1/2 years (Annex 15). An estimated schedule of
disbursement is shown at Annex 16.
5.22      Administration.  A Project Unit within the Ministry of Education
would be responsible for the financial and adminiserative control of the
project and its proper execution, i^ncluding (a) the engagement, briefing
and guidance of the consultant architects; (b) the preparation of master
lists of furniture and equipment; (c) the organization of international
competitive bidding for construction and the proecurement of furniture and
equipment and the subsequent evaluation of bids; (d) the supervision of
procurement and construction processes; (e) effective coordination with
other agencies, such as the Departments of Planning, Agriculture, Labor
and Finance; (f) contact with the UNESCO Regional School Building Center
in Khartoum; (g) liaison with the Association.,
5.23      The Project Unit would be headed by a senior officer of the
Ministry of Education as part-time project director, who would be assisted
by a full-time coordinator acceptable to the Association. The Unit would
be strengthened by an educational advisnr-au&ua project architect, engaged
under technical assistance and acceptable to the          â-so t"ô9n.T--he Project
Unit would also include an accountant and adequate supporting staff. The
establishment of the Project Unit and the appointment of the project
director, project coordinator, educational advisor and project architect
would be a condition of effectiveness of the Credit.
5.24      Architectural Services.  The Congo Government does not possesa
sufficient architectural services to carry out the design and supervision
work for the Teacher Training College and Technician Training Institute.
Consultant architects, acceptable to the Association, would be appointed
for these tasks. Design, the preparation of construction drawings and
documents and the supervision of construction would be carried out by the
project architect for the Elementary Vocational Training Center (Boko) and
the extensions to the senior secondary general schools (Brazzaville and
Pointe Noire).
5.25      Procurement.  Construction contracts would be awarded on the
basis of international competitive bidding by pre-qualified contractors.
There are several large foreign contracting firms established in Congo
which are capable of carrying out the project. It is assuned that locally
based contractors would carry out construction. Costs are unlikely to
exceed US$ 2 million in any single year.
5.26      Contracts for the supply of furniture and equipment would also be
awarded on the basis of international competitive bidding. Local furniture
and equipment manufacturers who qualify to compete for the bids would be

allowed a preferential margin equivalent to 15% of the c.i.f. landed cost
of competing imports or the existing rate of customs duty applicable,
whichever la the lower. It has been assumed-that foreign suppliers would
win contracts for about half of the furniture items and for all equipment
items.
5.27      Maintenance.  Maintenance of school buildings is virtually non-
existent. The Government has given assurances that adequats provision will
be made to ensure proper maintenance of the project schools. The mainten-
ance of all public buildings, with the exception of school buildings, is
the responsibility of the Ministry of Public Works and the Government is
to consider whether, as the Ministry of Public Works carries out maintenance
works throughout the country, schools should be added to its responsibilities.
5.28      Disbursement.  The proposed credit of US$ 3.5 million would cover
all the foreign exchange costs and 62% of the local cost or 85X of the total
project cost.  It would be disbursed to meet:
(a) 100% of the direct identifiable c.i.f. costs of imported
equipment and furniture;
(b) 80Z of total expenditure (representing the foreign ex-
change component) of technical assistance and architectural
services;
<c) 80Z of construction costs; and
(d) 40% of total coste (representing the foreign exchange
component) of locally procured furniture.
In the event that expenditures vould be lower than the present total esti-
mated cost of US$ 4.1 million, the surplus vould be available for cancella-
tion.
5.29      The credit would be administered by the Ministry of Education
through the Project Unit.  The Borrover would be the People's Republic of
Congo.
VI.  RECOMMENDATIONS       -- 
6.01      During the credit negotiations, 8  greement was reached on the fol-
lowing points:
(a)  change of administrative statua and staffing of the
unit for technical education and vocationai training in
the Ministry of Education (paras. 2.04 & 2.05);



- 21 -
(b) the establishment of advisory coommittees for the Ele-
mentary Vocational Training Center and for the Technician
Training Institute (paras. 5.05, 5.07 and 5.08),
(c)  the development of modern, practically-oriented curricula
for the Elementary Vocational Training Center and the
Technician Training Institute (paras. 5.05 and 5.08);
(d) the acquisition of sites for all ptoject schools (para.
5.18); and
(e) the provision of maintenance funds (para. 5.27).
6.02      The establishment of a Project Unit within the Ministry of Educa-
tion and the appointment of the project director, the project coordinator,
the educational advisor and the project architect would be a condition of
effectiveness of the Credit (para. 5.23).
6.03      The proposed project constitutes a suitable basis for an IDA
Credit of US$ 3.5 million to the People's Republic of Congo for a term of
50 years including a 10-year grace period.
