petroleum products;\n            (c) to implement and maintain an appropriate petroleum\n            pricing policy; (d) to improve national and transit\n            petroleum trade; (e) to reduce oil pollution and the threat\n            to the environment; and (f) to improve the technical and\n            managerial skills of the petroleum industry personnel.  The\n            project consists of seven parts:  (a) rehabilitation of\n            existing storage depots and construction of new depots for\n            various petroleum products, and the modification of existing\n            and construction of new railway loading and unloading\n            facilities for dedicated block train handling; (b)\n            installation of offshore unloading facility and construction\n            of a new petroleum terminal at Tanga; (c) rehabilitation of\n            existing jetty facilities and repairs to the existing\n            petroleum barge on Lake Victoria; (d) acquisition of 81\n            petroleum and six LPG railway tank wagons; (e) acquisition\n            of equipment and spare parts for rehabilitation and\n            modernization of oil company retail outlets; (f) provision\n            of LPG filling and marketing facilities; and (g) technical\n            assistance, training and office equipment."}, "docdt": "1990-12-13T00:00:00Z"}
