                         contraceptive use indicate stagnation and downward trends. Revised Basic Package of Health Services (BPHS) implementation has been initiated. Despite some improvement, urban
                         BPHS is making slow progress, while implementation of Essential Package of Hospital Services continues to make satisfactory progress. Three critical issues are effecting
                         implementation including: a) delayed payments to implementing partners; b) decreased availability of drugs at the service level in a number of provinces; and c) reduced intensity of

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The issues identified above need immediate attention of the MOPH leadership and urgent steps were agreed on during May/June 2013 Implementation support mission.

                         SHARP is envisaged to close as planned on September 30, 2013 with final ICR mission planned for first week of September. All steps are in place for a smooth transition from
                         SHARP to SEHAT and the team's assessment is that there will be no break in service delivery.
