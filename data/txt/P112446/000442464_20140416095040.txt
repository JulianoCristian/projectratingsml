1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

1. At the time of appraisal, Afghanistan, with an estimated population of 27 million and
per capita GDP of US$377, was the tenth poorest country in the world. Its human
development index of 0.343 lagged far behind to the average of 0.542 for South Asia. The
military operation, which led to the fall of the Taliban regime in 2001, and decades of civil
conflict prior to that had left Afghanistan with destroyed infrastructure, fragmented and
dysfunctional institutions, and lack of basic health, education and sanitation facilities. The
reconstruction that started in 2003 halted further disintegration of the institutions and social
services and by 2008 completely reversed the downward trend. However, despite
commendable progress, the country continued to face tough challenges in almost all
spheres of social, economic, and political realm.

2. The progress made by the Afghan health system between 2003 and 2008 was
impressive. Under-five child mortality was brought down to 191 deaths per 1,000 live
births 1 from 257. In the same period, the DPT3 coverage increased from 19.5% to 43%,
and skilled birth attendance from 6% to 24% 2. Despite these achievements, Afghanistan,
with a maternal mortality ratio of 460 still remained one of the most dangerous places in
the world for women to give birth. Immunization coverage was too low compared to other
low income countries, women still predominantly delivered without a skilled birth
attendant, and access to quality basic health care continued to be limited.

3. By project appraisal, Afghanistan had already accumulated a rich experience in
providing services to the population in a way that was unique and specific to its challenging
context. Afghanistan resorted to contracting out provision of the basic package of health
services (BPHS) to national and international NGOs. This was motivated partly by the lack
of the government capacity to deliver services especially in the rural areas, and an already
established practice of providing service through NGOs during the extended period of
conflict. However the primary reason behind this policy decision was the determination of
the MOPH to build and strengthen its role mainly as financier and steward of the system as
opposed to service provider. This proved to be a very effective strategy. This positive
experience during 2003-2008 laid a foundation for a programmatic approach to building
the country-wide health service system. The program was financially supported by three
major donors: EU, USAID, and the World Bank. The program entailed provision of the
BPHS and the Essential Package of Hospital Services (EPHS) through a contractual
arrangement with NGOs and through strengthening the MOPH-owned service delivery
network, referred to as “Strengthening Mechanism” (SM).

4. The MOPH, supported by the development partners maintained a crucial stewardship
role in planning, monitoring results, and coordinating activities. Owing to this experience,
by the time Strengthening Health Services for the Rural Poor (SHARP) was designed, the
MOPH was in a significantly better position to exercise stewardship over the program than
it was in 2003.

5. Since March 2003, the MOPH had already been implementing the Bank supported
Health Sector Emergency Reconstruction and Development project (HSERDP), which was
a precursor of SHARP and essentially identical in design. The project was rated by ICR as
Satisfactory. The implementation of HSERDP had equipped the MOPH with a solid
experience on which to build a subsequent program and development cooperation.

6. By the end of 2008, the government had already formulated the 2008-2013 Afghanistan
Health and Nutrition Sector Strategy (HNSS). The NHSS defined the objectives for the
sector; identified the BPHS and EPHS as the main priorities for service delivery; and
created a framework for donor financing. The NHSS established a good basis for donors to
move gradually towards a sector-wide approach (SWAP) in health.

7. The above described context demonstrates that there was a very strong rationale for the
Bank supported operation in the health sector. The success of ending the HSERDP project
needed to be sustained, which would not be possible without continued financial support.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

8. The project development objective (PDO) was to support the government in achieving
the HNSS goal to “contribute to improving the health and nutritional status of the people of
Afghanistan, with a greater focus on women and children and under-served areas of the
country”.

9. The Results Framework of the project had a total of 14 indicators, 7 of which measured
the PDO and another 7 measured the project’s intermediate outcomes. Please see the ICR
Datasheet for the complete list of these indicators. A detailed discussion on these indicators
is provided in Section 2.3 of this report.

12. The total population size covered by the project was approximately 8.59 million. The
provinces selected for the project exhibited high poverty rate: in 9 out of 12 project
provinces the poverty rate was above 20%. In some provinces, such as Balkh and Wardak
the poverty rates were staggeringly high – around 60%.

13. The major beneficiaries of the project were children under age 5 and women of
reproductive age. The content of the BPHS package was heavily focused on maternal and
child health and the bulk of the project funds were spent in this area. The beneficiary
profile of the project makes it very pro-poor and MDG focused.

14. Other beneficiaries of the project include the staff of the MOPH and, to a certain extent,
the staff of the provincial health offices (PHO) who received support for strengthening their
stewardship capacities.

1.5 Original Components

15. The project was composed of four components, as described below, funded from
different sources: IDA grant, Afghan Reconstruction Trust Fund (ARTF), Norwegian Trust




3
  In addition to 6 project provinces the RBF pilot was implemented in 10 other provinces not covered by
SHARP. These provinces were: Jawzjan, Bamyan, Kunduz, Daykundi, Kandahar, Laghman, Paktia,
Badakshan, Takhar, and Badakhshan. In 6 out of these 10 provinces the RBF supported the BPHS
implementation; in the remaining 4 provinces - only the EPHS in provincial hospitals

Fund for Result Based Financing (RBF), and Japan Social Development Trust Fund
(JSDF). :

Component 1: Sustaining and strengthening the Basic Package of Health Services (BPHS)
(US$97.5 million, of which: IDA US$19 million + JSDF US$15.9 million + ARTF US$62.6
million)

16. This component was to support the implementation of the BPHS through Performance-
based Partnership Agreements (PPA) between the MOPH and NGOs. It was also to
support the MOPH’s efforts to deliver the BPHS through contracting in management
services (the MOPH strengthening mechanism) in a number of provinces. The component
intended to support further expansion of health facilities, particularly sub-centers, to
improve access for the 60% of people living over an hour away from a health facility;
training of additional community mid-wives (CMW); and training of female community
nurses (CNs).

Component 2: Strengthening the delivery of the Essential Package of Hospital Services
(IDA US$1million)


17. This component was to finance an evaluation of the impact and lessons learnt from
different approaches adopted for the EPHS implementation during 2005-2008. The
component intended to support the policy dialogue to develop a systematic and coherent
package of hospital policies to ensure efficient use of resources and provision of priority
services, especially for the poor. Through a third party assessment (Component 3),
SHARP aimed to contribute to monitoring hospital performance in the country. Possible
options to support hospitals included contracting NGOs or strengthening the MOPH
delivery mechanism, based on a specific EPHS expansion plan and on availability of
resources.

Component 3: Strengthening MOPH stewardship functions (USD16.5 million, of which:
IDA 10 million + ARTF 6.5 million)

18. This component was to strengthen both the central MOPH and the Provincial Health
Offices (PHOs), while maintaining coordination and promoting decentralization. At the
central level, this component intended to finance contractual staff in critical areas of the
MOPH as well as a limited number of line manager positions. At the provincial level, the
PHOs would be strengthened through computerization and reactivation of provincial health
coordination meetings. SHARP was to contribute to the organization of semi-annual
national health coordination workshops and to upgrading of the MOPH website, as a
communication platform between the center and the periphery. The component also
envisaged capacity building of staff at central and provincial levels through training
activities as well as relevant national and international conferences. Renovation of Grant
and Contracts Management Unit (GCMU) office was also planned. This component
intended to further support monitoring and evaluation of the BPHS and EPHS through
contracting of a third party evaluator to conduct health facility surveys and household
surveys.


                                             4
Component 4: Piloting Innovations (Norwegian Trust Fund USD11 million)

19. This component intended to pilot supply-side interventions as part of a global
experiment in results-based financing (RBF) supported by the government of Norway.
One pilot would target the providers of the BPHS by paying for performance against
achievement of agreed indicators related to MDGs 4 and 5. Another RBF pilot would
support testing of performance based payments in the hospital sector. An impact
evaluation would be conducted to assess and document the effects of the pilots. To ensure
credibility and independence, a qualified research organization would be contracted to
objectively verify results, gauge annual performance, conduct annual facility surveys, and
carry out full household surveys at the beginning and at the end of implementation.

1.6 Revised Components

20.    The project components were not revised.

1.7 Other significant changes

21. There were no significant changes

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

22. At the time of the project preparation, the government had already formulated the
Afghanistan Health and Nutrition Sector Strategy (HNSS). The Bank was actively engaged
in the policy dialogue. The HNSS provided an overall policy framework, which ensured
full ownership and buy-in from the government, and created an effective platform for
coordination with other development partners, particularly USAID and the EU.

23. Several background analytical studies were carried out during the preparation phase.
The results of these studies and a full health sector review were presented at the conference
held in November 2008, followed by a strategic retreat to discuss the research finding and
the key policy actions for the government and the development partners. This also had an
impact on the project preparation and design.

24. The MOPH was effectively in the ‘driver’s seat’ during the project preparation. The
experience gained during the previous project had a visible impact on the MOPH’s capacity
to steer the process and exercise leadership. The preparation process was inclusive and
participatory. The development partners – USAID, EU, WHO, CIDA, and many others –
were actively involved and consulted.

25. The project design was influenced by an increasing popularity of the results-based
financing (RBF) in different parts of the world. Empirical evidence was clearly
demonstrating effectiveness of various RBF mechanisms, particularly in Africa. Many of
these mechanisms were catalyzed by the Norwegian Trust Fund for Result Based Financing


                                             5
operated by the Bank. The project design benefited from this evidence and from the grant
funding made available through the Norwegian Trust Fund.

26. The project design had to take into account significant risks that existed at the time of
preparation and were well recognized by the Bank team. Some of the risks are worth
mentioning here:

27. One of the most critical risks was (and still remains) growing insecurity, which was
feared to disrupt provision of services in certain areas, and to hamper monitoring and
evaluation activities. The project design addressed this risk by leveraging the flexibility of
NGOs with strong local community links to deliver services under the BPHS and EPHS.

28. The lack of qualified health care personnel at the community level, especially female
health workers, was perceived as a serious risk, which would undermine uptake of the child
and maternal health services. Therefore, training of female community health workers,
midwives and nurses became a critical activity supported by the project.

29. The risk of the political opposition to contracting out services to NGOs and potential
difficulties in demonstrating results was the main factor that influenced a very strong
emphasis on robust monitoring and evaluation arrangements in the project design. The use
of an independent third party for validation and performance measurement was an effective
way to demonstrate credible results achieved by the project and thereby to mitigate this
political risk.

2.2 Implementation

30. The following adaptions/adjustments during the project implementation positively
contributed to the project outcomes:

31. Although technical standards that the NGOs were required to meet were quite detailed,
there was sufficient room for innovation. Such flexibilities and innovations included, for
example, the permission given to NGOs to deploy contracted health workers from
neighboring countries (e.g. Tajikistan and Pakistan) to fill the staffing gaps, especially for
women health care workers. Also, where the personnel of the required grade and seniority
were not available, the NGOs were allowed to substitute with the staff of a lower grade but
comparable skills. This enabled the NGOs to mitigate the human resource constraints.

32. An important adjustment to the BPHS implementation was scaling up delivery of
nutritional services. During implementation, the content of the BPHS was revised –
additional services such as mental health, rehabilitation, prison health, and enhanced
nutritional services were added. Improving the nutritional status of the Afghan population
became a strategic priority in the MOPH’s Strategic Plan 2011-2015, thereby increasing
attention to delivery of nutritional services. However, it must be noted that not all NGOs
were able to quickly adjust to this change and scale up the delivery of nutritional services
under the BPHS scheme to the required level. Hence the progress on the nutritional front
was rather modest as the nutrition program is still at early stage of implementation.



                                              6
33. Afghanistan is one of the three remaining countries in the world with endemic polio.
The country made a good progress in reducing transmission during 2010 with 35%
reduction in the number of new polio cases as compared to 2009. However, in 2011 the
number of new cases increased. This was compounded by the fact that the polio eradication
program, financed by multiple donors, encountered a funding shortfall of US$34 million
for 2011-2012. The MOPH requested the Bank to fill a portion of this financial gap from
the project. The Bank was able to accommodate this request under SHARP, and it allocated
US$12 million for the procurement of the Oral Polio Vaccine (OPV). This flexibility
greatly contributed to ensure availability of Oral Polio vaccines for the polio eradication
initiative, a global public health initiative.

34. The project went to the Board with an envelope of SDR30.00 million from IDA and
already secured funding of US$12.00 million from the Norwegian Trust Fund for RBF.
Addition second-phase funding in the amount of US$17.65 million from the JSDF) and
US$69.1 million from the ARTF (to be drawn in 3 tranches) was also secured. The project
only drew two tranches from the ARTF: the first tranche in the amount of US$22.00
million and the second tranche in the amount of US$24.00 million. In 2010, a new funding
source, the Crisis Response Window (CRW), was opened by the Bank. The CRW did not
exist at the time of appraisal. The project team successfully mobilized funding from the
CRW in the amount of US$49.00 million, which became effective in June 2010 (the
Financing Agreement was signed in May 2010). Therefore, there was no need to mobilize
the third (last) tranche from the ARTF. Additional resources were allocated as follows:

Component         Initial funding allocation       Final funding allocation
Component 1       US$19.0 million (IDA)            US$19.0 million (IDA)
                  US$15.9 million (JSDF)           US$39.5 million (ARTF)
                  US$62.6 million (ARTF)           US$17.4 million (JSDF)
                  Total: US$97.5 million           US$41.0 (CRW)
                                                   Total: US$116.9 million
Component 2       US$1.00 million (IDA)            US$1.0 million (IDA)
                  Total: US$1.0 million            US$8.0 million (CRW)
                                                   Total: US$9.0 million
Component 3       US$10.0 million (IDA)            US$10.0 million (IDA)
                  US$6.5 million (ARTF)            US$0.2 million (JSDF)
                  Total: US$16.5 million           US$6.5 million (ARTF)
                                                   Total: US$16.7 million
Component 4       US$11.0 million (Norwegian       US$12.0 million (Norwegian Trust
                  Trust Fund for RBF)              Fund for RBF)
                  Total: US$11.0 million           Total: US$12.0million
Total:            US$126.0 million                 US$154.65 million

35. There were also a number of factors that had a somewhat negative impact on the project
implementation.

36. Increasing insecurity seriously affected the project implementation in different ways:
(a) in the remote districts/villages with frequent insurgencies it was difficult to maintain
personnel (especially female workers) in the health care facilities, and the hours of
operation of the rural facilities were often reduced, thereby limiting access of the


                                               7
population to services; (b) monitoring and supervision of service providers by the NGOs,
GCMU, provincial health authorities and the third party evaluator was somewhat restricted
in insecure localities and during insurgences; (c) outreach services, especially
immunization, were often constrained; (d) sometimes disruptions occurred in the
distribution of medicines and other supplies to villages; and (e) the population, especially
women, feared to seek services in times of higher insecurity.

37. Another adverse factor was significant delays in recruitment of NGOs for the delivery
of the health care packages. In five out of eight provinces the contracts were finalized only
in late 2009 and the delivery of the BPHS services started only in October 2009. In three
remaining provinces the contracts were not finalized until the mid-3rd quarter of 2010. The
GCMU extended the old contracts of the NGOs engaged under the previous project
(HSERDP) several times in order to avoid disruptions in the service delivery. SHARP
allowed retroactive financing to cover the cost of the contract extensions. Nevertheless,
delayed finalization of new contracts in some places negatively affected motivation and
retention of health care personnel, making it difficult for the NGOs under contract
extension to maintain performance. Also prolonged preoccupation of the GCMU with the
contracting processes somewhat weakened GCMU’s supervision of the implementation of
existing contracts during the first two years of the project.

38. There were also some staffing issues during the project implementation which created
difficulties. Despite significant efforts to engage a greater number of female health workers
and train a new cadre of them, their shortage remained a pressing challenge, particularly in
remote villages and insecure areas. Not being able to find the required number of the
Afghan female health workers NGOs deployed the female workers from the neighboring
countries, mostly from Tajikistan. This innovation/flexibility certainly helped to reduce the
negative impact of the shortage but it could not fully mitigate the problem.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

39. A well designed monitoring and evaluation function was one of the defining features of
the project. The project allocated US$11.00 million to M&E under Component 3, which
constitutes about 7% of the total project costs. While duly recognizing the strengths and
appropriateness of the design the actual implementation of M&E activities had some
limitations.

40. Despite an initial plan to update the 2006 baseline with a more recent data and to adjust
the targets respectively this never happened. John Hopkins University (JHU), a contracted
third party for all M&E activities under the project, was supposed to conduct a household
survey in 2009 in order to update the 2006 baseline. However the survey did not take place
as the finalization of the contract with the JHU was delayed. The JHU survey was
rescheduled for 2010 but then it was dropped altogether to avoid duplication with
UNICEF’s Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS) also planned for 2010.
Unfortunately, UNICEF’s survey could not be finalized by 2010 and it was carried over to
2011.




                                             8
41. The performance of the JHU was not as satisfactory as it was under HSERD. The most
important limitation was the sampling methodology and timing of the end-project survey.
Although a detailed proposal with sufficient sample size was negotiated, the survey
covered a very small sample of households that does not provide statistically meaningful
provincial level estimates. The survey was carried out in 2012, too early before the project
closing date, thereby preventing 2013 performance results to be captured in the final
assessment. The project implementing agency is still discussing with the JHU possible
solutions to remedy the problem.

42. Other issues include: the lack of comparability of health facility surveys carried out
after 2010 and before 2009 due to the revision of the survey tool; the baseline survey to be
carried out by the JHU never materialized for the reasons explained above; and
collaboration of between the JHU and the MOPH did not have sufficiently strong
developmental impact on the MOPH.

43. The health facility surveys carried out by the JHU was a ‘signature’ feature of the
SHARP project. These surveys produced indices to measure various aspects of service
provision and quality. An overall index called “Balanced Scorecard” (BSC) was
constructed in order to provide one measure to summarize each province’s performance. A
more detailed discussion on this can be found in Annex 2.

44. Initially it was planned to carry out BSC surveys annually. However, the JHU changed
the data collection cycle and moved into a “year-round” data collection mode spanning
over two years. The main reason for the change of the methodology was to reduce
‘predictability’ of the data collection time and thereby to avoid a possible bias related to
‘increased readiness’ of the service providers for the survey. This was perhaps a valid
argument, even though it made an annual comparison of performance more difficult. As a
result of this change the JHU carried out three rounds of the BSC surveys, instead of four.

45. In 2010, the BSCs for the BPHS and EPHS underwent a significant methodological
revision. As a result of this BSC rounds carried out after 2010 are not comparable with
those carried out prior to 2009.

46. The HMIS was an important source of data for the project monitoring. The HMIS
produced mostly health service utilization indicators. The HMIS has been under
institutional capacity building for many years with the support of the Bank and many other
development agencies (particularly USAID). This capacity building process had an impact.
The MOPH and the development partners confirm that the quality of data produced by
HMIS has been steadily improving.

47. For the RBF pilot the project used a well-tested model of independent verification of
results reported by the service providers. The verification was carried out by the JHU as
well. It included data audit of a sample of health care facilities participating in the RBF
pilot followed by the community verification – tracing the patients who according to the
provider records received services. According to the feedback from NGOs participating in
the RBF pilot such an independent verification was mostly helpful and contributed to the
improvement of the quality of reporting.


                                             9
2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

Social and Environmental Safeguards

48. The project was prepared under OP 8.50 Emergency Recovery Assistance and was
classified as environmental category “B”. An Environmental and Social Management
Framework (ESMF) was prepared and disclosed by the government in Dari, Pashto and
English. It was also made available at the World Bank’s Info shop. It is worth noting that
the government made all project documentation publicly available to the relevant
stakeholders through the Afghan Information Management System (AIMS). The MOPH
was requested to prepare a comprehensive bio-medical waste management plan in the first
four-six months after project effectiveness. Preparation of a revised/updated environmental
management plan by November 30, 2010 was a legal covenant for the JSDF grant
agreement (TF-95919, Article II: Project Execution 2.03 (b)).

49. The actual compliance of the Borrower with the safeguards plans had limitations. It was
planned that a designated safeguards focal officer would be appointed with a responsibility
for overseeing the proper application of the ESMF within the GCMU at the MOPH.
However, no such focal officer has ever been appointed.

50. On the social safeguards side, the Community Development Councils (CDCs) have not
been much involved in selection of the Community Health Workers (CHW), and thus, the
Community Health Workers Program received little support and collaboration with CDCs.
A compliant handling system was put in place in the health care facilities, but its scope and
reach was limited. No records of the complaints were maintained.

51. However, progress was commendable with regard to gender mainstreaming. The
MOPH upgraded the gender unit which was previously under reproductive health
directorate to an independent unit reporting directly to the Deputy Minister of
Administration. The MOPH also finalized the gender mainstreaming strategy and
conducted several studies including an assessment of access to health care from the gender
perspective. At the project level, the project managed to complete 74% of required female
staffing, which was a difficult task in the local context.

52. With regard to environmental safeguards progress was modest. The health facilities
supported by the project continued carrying out medical waste management but through
rather outdated practices. The utilization of outdated or locally made incinerators or ovens
was (and still is) common creating an environmental risk for the communities. Also, the
segregation of sharps and other medical wastes was either not happening consistently at the
place of generation, or if it was done there was no color coding and proper follow. The
medical wastes were often mixed with municipal wastes.

53. Initiating implementation of the Infectious Management and Environmental Plan was
slow. At the time of mid-term review the plan was still not translated into Dari and Pastho.
The main issue which hindered the implementation of the plan was a lack of ownership and
responsibility within the MOPH. The plan was prepared by the Directorate of Policy and
Planning and the Directorate of Health Economics and Financing, whereas the


                                             10
responsibility for the implementation rested with the Directorate of Preventive Medicine.
According to the latest ISR the related legal covenant - Article II: Project Execution 2.03
(b) – was only partially met.

Financial management and disbursements

54. The project operated under the steadily improving Project Financial Management
reforms implemented by the government of Afghanistan with the World Bank assistance.
Under these reforms, proper records of received grants and disbursed amounts were
maintained, at the central level, by the Ministry of Finance, Special Disbursement Unit
(SDU) in the Afghanistan Financial Management Information System (AFMIS). The grants
under the project - IDA H469, IDA H581 and ARTF 96362 – which all closed September
30, 2013, have a grace period up to March 31, 2014. There is another grant, TF95691 the
Norwegian Trust Fund for RBF, that is still open. This has been remapped to the currently
ongoing Systems Enhancement for Health Action in Transition Project (SEHAT).

55. Over the project period, the fund flow to the project was mostly timely, with some
delays during the beginning of the fiscal years due to prolonged approval process of the
new years’ budgets. Also, with regard to direct payments in local currency (AFN) to NGOs,
these took longer than USD payments due to the inherent time taken in validating local
currency payments. Replenishment requests were submitted periodically.

56. Proper records of eligible expenditures under the project were maintained by the
implementing agency. The subsidiary books of records were maintained in excel all
through the project duration. FM staffing was adequate and the staff were embedded within
the finance department of MOPH. However, all of the staff members handling the project
FM were consultants paid under the project due to the weak FM capacity within the civil
service.

57. The internal controls were adequate, both at the central and the implementing agency
level. There were no internal audits conducted throughout the life of the project, due to
weak capacity in the internal audit department of the MOPH. The focus of the internal
audit department was on the operational budget of the MOPH. In order to have periodic
internal audits and also to develop the capacity of the internal audit department of the
MOPH, the Bank agreed to fund two national internal audit consultants. This initiative was
not successful under the project due to delay in hiring the consultants initially (due to
inability to find the right candidates), and thereafter due to non-cooperation between the
internal audit consultants and the internal audit department. However, lack of internal
audits has not negatively impacted the project as a result of the compensating controls in
the MOPH and MOF.

58. Quarterly IFRs in the agreed format were submitted during the life of the project, but
not always within the timeline of 45 days especially in the last year of project
implementation.

59. Annual audited financial statements were submitted regularly, and on time, except for
fiscal year 2012. The report was due by June 20, 2013, but was submitted only on July 6,


                                            11
2013. The audit opinion of the Supreme Audit Office of Afghanistan was qualified for the
initial two years (FY2009 and FY2010), but thereafter for two years (FY2011 and FY2012)
the audit opinion was unqualified.

60. The rate of fund disbursement under the project was good. At the time of closing the
project disbursement status looked as in the following table:

Procurement

61. The project closed with moderately satisfactory rating for procurement, reflecting the
rating throughout the project lifetime. Only in the first year of implementation the rating
was moderately unsatisfactory. This was due to the long delays in the procurement of NGO
services for the BPHS and EPHS. There was no procurement of civil works under the
project as it would be not very sensible given numerous pockets of high insecurity and
weak procurement capacity within the MOPH. The procurement of goods was also minimal.
The largest procurement package requiring pre-review were pharmaceuticals (US$3.2mln)
and vehicles (US$200,000) under international competitive bidding procedure. Both
packages encountered significant delays and disruptions. The procurement of vehicles was
not finalized until the very end of the project. There have been few small cases where
major deviations were observed during the procurement post review.

    Disbursed amount is more than the original due to SDR-US$ exchange rate difference.

 The undisbursed amount is remapped to the currently ongoing Systems Enhancement for Health Action in
Transition Project (SEHAT).



                                                      12
62. The MOPH has a procurement directorate which carried out procurement of goods and
works with the support of the Afghanistan Development and Reconstruction Services
(ARDS) for SHARP. However, procurement of consultancy services was carried out by the
Grant and Contract Management Unit (GCMU).

63. Capacity in the procurement directorate of the MOPH is weak and still requires
significant institutional strengthening and systematic training. The staff of the procurement
directorate has a very limited knowledge and experience of procurement and only few
people can speak English and can use a computer.

64. The staff working in the MOPH is familiar only with the procurement of consulting
services, which is not a sustainable solution for the MOPH. The GCMU staff still needs
further training and practical experience, especially in other forms of procurement. The
Bank has been providing training and building the capacity through procurement clinics
and on job training which will continue.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

65. Even though the SHARP project closed on September 30, 2013, there has been almost
no disruption in continuation of the activities supported by it. The subsequent project,
System Enhancement for Health Action in Transition Project (SEHAT), was designed
while SHARP was still under implementation to ensure overlap. The total financial
envelope of SEHAT is US$408 million, of which IDA financing is US$100 million. The
project became effective on June 20, 2013.

66. SEHAT will continue financing the implementation of the BPHS and EPHS through
contracting-out and contracting-in arrangements both in rural and urban areas in provinces
now supported by the EU, the ARTF and the World Bank, covering a total of 21 provinces
in the country (out of 34 provinces). The project will also strengthen the national health
system and MOPH’s capacity at central and provincial levels, so it can effectively perform
its stewardship functions in the sector.

67. SEHAT’s development objectives are to expand the scope, quality and coverage of
health services provided to the population, particularly to the poor, in the project areas, and
to enhance the stewardship functions of the Ministry of Public Health. SEHAT has three
components: (a) sustaining and improving the BPHS and EHS services; (b) building the
stewardship capacity of the MOPH; and (c) strengthening program management. Realizing
the importance of building stronger capacities in the MOPH, SEHAT has placed a much
greater emphasis on this compared to SHARP. This component under SEHAT is going to
benefit from US$90 million investment. Putting a much greater emphasis on the MOPH’s
stewardship role SEHAT has put strong foundations for the future sustainability or results
achieved by previous operations, including SHARP.

68. The design of SEHAT took into account the lessons learnt from SHARP, particularly in
relation to contracting of NGOs and monitoring and evaluation. Procurement and
implementation arrangements provide greater ‘immunity’ to SEHAT from delays and
implementation challenges encountered under SHARP.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation (Rating: Highly Satisfactory)

69. Project objectives were highly relevant in terms of their alignment with the national
development goals, the Bank’s country engagement priorities, and the global development
agenda.

70. Afghanistan’s Health and Nutrition Sector Strategy (HNSS) 2008-2013 set the
following high-level national objectives: (i) to reduce maternal and newborn mortality, (ii)
to reduce under-five mortality and improve child health, (iii) to reduce the incidence of
communicable diseases, (iv) to reduce malnutrition, and (v) to develop health systems.
The objectives and design of the SHARP project were fully aligned with the above outlined
national policy priorities of the government.

71. The Bank’s Interim Development Strategy for Afghanistan (2009-2011) had three
pillars: (a) building the capacity of the state and its accountability to its citizens; (b)
promoting growth of the rural economy and improving rural livelihoods; and (c) supporting
growth of the formal private sector. The project contributed to the delivery of Pillar 1 of
the interim strategy.

72. The project was also well aligned with the global development priorities – in particular
from the perspective of health MDGs. The project contributed to all health related MDGs
with its strong emphasis on maternal and child health, tuberculosis, malaria, and
malnutrition.

73. The project design was highly relevant. It was essentially continuation of the previous
project, HSERDP. The main strength of the project design, was that it relied on contracting
out the delivery of the basic services to NGOs. The project very effectively leveraged the
advantages that the NGO sector possessed compared to the government sector.

74. Focusing on the BPHS and EPHS was fully appropriate for the health care challenges
of Afghanistan. The BPHS contained seven critical elements well justified by the disease
burden in the country: maternal and newborn health, child health and immunization, public
nutrition, communicable disease treatment and control, mental health, disability services,
and regular supply of essential drugs. The BPHS was revised in 2010 to add a few
interventions on nutrition, mental health, disability and provision of prison health care.

75. The RBF pilot was a strong aspect of the project design. In the challenging environment
such as in Afghanistan it is a well justified strategy to deploy performance incentives to
ensure motivation of health care providers. This was also supported by ample evidence
from other country settings. The pilot was well designed and its scale was sufficiently large
to draw useful policy lessons.

76. The project design allowed flexibility and adjustments in the areas which could not be
precisely defined at the time of appraisal. A good demonstration of this is Component 2: it
was well recognized that the EPHS package was important not to omit, even though it was


                                             14
not very clear how to deliver it at the time of appraisal. The project incorporated a learning
dimension into its design, and allowed generation and synthesis of evidence before
Component 2 was finally defined.

77. Despite strong project design features as elaborated above, there were a few elements
that could have been done better. Firstly this concerns the design of the procurement
arrangements. If the project allowed the renewal of the contracts with top performing
NGOs engaged under the previous project (HSERDP) the implementation delays could
have been avoided. Also the design of the performance agreements as lump sum contracts
did not have sufficient incentives built in to motivate the providers. The lump sum
contracts without performance management mechanisms actually could have triggered
adverse incentives to economize by providing fewer services. There were few cases when
such a behavior of NGOs was observed, but they were rectified.

78. Another limitation was relatively weak focus on supporting the provincial health offices
so that they could exercise a more active role in monitoring and supervision of NGO
performance and in overall management of the project. According to the feedback from the
provincial health leaders, had they had more resources allocated to them from the project
for supervision they would have been more actively carrying out this role.

79. While on the whole the design of the project was strong, implementation encountered a
few challenges, which are described in Section 2.2. The positive points in relation to
implementation were flexibility, strong engagement of the MOPH, building local capacities,
learning from doing, and reliance on data. All the activities were implemented almost as
they were designed. The project produced all the outputs that were envisaged.

80. Limitations during implementation included: delayed contracting of NGOs, less than
satisfactory performance of JHU in relation to baseline and end-project survey, and partial
compliance of the project with environmental safeguards plans.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives (Rating: Satisfactory)

81. A general trend for most indicators is characterized by stagnation and, in some cases,
slight deterioration of performance during the first half of the project life-time. In the
second half of the project, however, the performance started to improve markedly. This
trend is mostly likely a result of delays in recruitment of NGOs and transition to new
contracts.

82. Progress against each PDO indicator is as follows:

Use of modern family planning methods among 15-49 year old women (Rating:
Satisfactory)

83. The project intended to achieve 20% prevalence of any modern family planning method
among 15-49 year old women by 2013. This would represent 4.6% point increase from the




                                             15
baseline of 15.4% set for the project in 2009 6. Assessing project’s performance against this
indicator is rather complicated due to discordance in the estimates from three independent
surveys carried out between 2010 and 2012.

84. On the basis of 2012 Afghanistan Health Survey (AHS) by the JHU, the use of at least
one modern family planning method among women in the 15-49 year old age group was
only 13.8% (95%CI 12.1-15.6), which is 6.2% point short of the target. However,
UNICEF’s MICS survey conducted in 2011 reports a much higher estimate – 19.5%. The
Afghanistan Mortality Survey (AMS) carried out in 2010 also reports a higher estimate
than the JHU survey. According to this survey the indicator value was 19.9% in 2010,
which is very close to the MICS survey estimate.

85. It is sensible to assume that the estimates from the MICS survey and AMS, which show
higher concordance, are more accurate and reliable than that of the JHU survey. Based on
this assumption, the project has essentially achieved its target for the concerned indicator,
falling short of the target by only 0.5% (19.5% achievement versus 20% target). Therefore,
a satisfactory rating is appropriate.

TB treatment success rate (Rating: Satisfactory)

86. SHARP’s target was to reach a 90% TB treatment success rate by 2013 – a 5% point
increase from the baseline of 85%. The project fully met the target. According to the HMIS
and the National TB Control Report of 2013 the TB treatment success in 2013 reached
90.1%.

Proportion of newborns who were breastfed within one hour after birth (Rating: Highly
Satisfactory)

87. The project target for this indicator was 45% of infants to be breastfed within one
hour after birth by 2013. This would mean 8.3% point increase from the baseline of 36.7%.
The JHU household survey of 2012 did not measure this particular indicator. Therefore the
most recent estimate is available only from UNICEF’s MICS survey of 2011. According to
this survey the Project not only reached its target of 45% but exceeded it by 8% point
already in 2011 (survey estimated 53% rate of early initiation of breastfeeding).

DPT3 coverage among children 12-23 months (Rating: Unsatisfactory)

88. The project target for DPT3 coverage among 12-23 month old children was 60% by
2013, compared to the baseline of 34.6%. Considering the risks and challenges in
Afghanistan, it was probably too optimistic to hope that the DPT3 coverage could go up by
more than 20% point in four years. According to the JHU survey carried out in 2012, the
project did not achieve its target for this indicator, as DPT3 coverage increased only to



6
    As indicated earlier in the report, the project used 2006 data as baseline for 2009.




                                                         16
46.7%, which is 13.3% point short of the target. The estimate from UNICEF’s MICS
survey of 2011 is even lower - 35%.

89. It is interesting to note that the officially reported DPT3 coverage by HMIS is much
higher – 96%. The reason for this is inaccurately small estimate of the denominator,
children in the target group. The HMIS more or less correctly captures the statistics of the
children vaccinated during the calendar year, but because the denominator is
underestimated, the coverage figure ends up being artificially inflated.

90. As it is the case for many other countries, the WHO-UNICEF estimates for
Afghanistan significantly differ from the officially reported country estimates as well as
from the survey estimates. WHO-UNICEF estimate for the DPT3 coverage for 2012 is
71%. For the purposes of this ICR, the preference is given to the survey estimates. Given
the multiple measures, it was hard to make an accurate conclusion about DPT3 coverage;
however, it is plausible to conclude that the target was not met.

91. Even though the project did not achieve its childhood immunization target, it needs to
be acknowledged that some progress still was made, under very challenging and difficult
circumstances. During the project life-time, approximately 1,056,776 children were
immunized. Health care staff who were carrying out the immunization outreach often
risked their lives (some of them actually were killed) to deliver the life-saving services to
the children in remote villages.

Proportion of births attended by skilled attendants (Rating: Highly Satisfactory)

92. The project target for this indicator was to achieve a 28% attendance of deliveries by a
skilled attendant, excluding a community health worker or traditional birth attendant. This
would mean 9.1% point increase from the baseline of 18.9%.

93. The project made significant progress in relation to this indicator. According to the
JHU survey of 2012 about 47.4% of births were attended by a skilled attendant. Thus the
actual performance of the project has exceeded the target.

Proportion of caregivers of children under five who can identify at least two danger signs
of ARI (Rating – Not Measurable)

94. It was not possible to assess the progress in relation to this indicator. The project never
set the baseline or target for it. According to UNICEF’s MICS survey of 2011, only 15.2%
of women could identify at least two danger signs of an acute respiratory infection (ARI).
Due to the lack of data it is not possible to compare this estimate with 2009 or 2012/13
values. However it is worth noting that according to the HMIS the proportion of children
with ARI who seek treatment outside the home has doubled since 2003, and is now
estimated at 59%. This may indirectly indicate improved awareness of danger signs among
the caregivers.




                                              17
Percent of pregnant women receiving at least one antenatal care visit (Rating:
Satisfactory)

95. The project made a commendable progress with regard to this indicator. The indicator
target for 2013 was 50% coverage, compared to the baseline of 32.3% for 2006. This
would mean a 17.7% point increase over the project lifetime.

96. The project fully achieved its target and even slightly exceeded it. UNICEF’s MICS
survey of 2011 reported 48% coverage for 2010. In 2012, the coverage with at least one
antenatal care visit reached 54%, based on the JHU survey of 2012. These statistics are
coherent and suggest that the project exhibited a strong performance with regard to this
very important indicator.

97. The main driver of success with regard to scaling up antenatal care delivery was setting
up new health sub-centers and basic health clinics, and staffing them with a new cadre of
female health workers. During the project lifetime about 984,545 women received antenatal
care.

98. As seen from the above discussion performance across the seven PDO indicators was
largely positive, although with regards to childhood immunization, the project did not
perform very well. However, in relation to family planning, antenatal care, TB control and
treatment, breastfeeding, and skilled birth attendance the performance was satisfactory, and
the project achieved or surpassed the majority of its PDO indictor targets. Unimpressive
progress with childhood immunization is regrettable. Also the fact that one of the PDO
indicators – knowledge of danger signs of acute respiratory infections – was never tracked
and no baseline and target were established. Considering these results, a rating of
Satisfactory seems appropriate for achievement of the PDOs.

3.3 Efficiency (Rating: Satisfactory)

99. For the purposes of this ICR no net present value and economic rate of return analysis
have been conducted. Instead, the health interventions supported by the project were
assessed against the international evidence of their cost-effectiveness.

100. The BPHS covered six main groups of health interventions: (i) maternal and newborn
care; (ii) child health and immunization; (iii) public nutrition; (iv) communicable disease
treatment and control; (v) mental health; and (v) disability and physical rehabilitation
services. According to the 2010 global burden of disease estimates from the Institute of
Health Metrics and Evaluation 7 , the health conditions addressed by these interventions
account for about 59.5% of the total disease burden in Afghanistan.

101. The BPHS design favors the community based health services with the greatest
emphasis on health services delivered by health posts, basic health centers, mobile health

teams, comprehensive health clinics and district hospitals. All of these delivery modes are
least expensive and most accessible by the poor population groups. Community health
workers, nurses, and midwives are the key human resource inputs for BPHS, which makes
it much more cost-effective model of care compared to ones where physicians are the main
health care providers.

102. According to the 2010 global burden of disease estimates from the Institute of Health
Metrics and Evaluation 8, the health conditions addressed with the BPHS supported by the
project account for about 59.5% of the disease burden in Afghanistan. Most interventions
supported by the project under the BPHS fall under the cost-effectiveness ratio of $100 per
Disability Adjusted Life Year (DALY) averted, which is considered a very good value for
money. For example, vaccination of a child with basic antigens (BCG, DTP, Measles, and
OPV) is estimated to cost about US$15 per DALY; integrated management of childhood
illnesses (IMCI) will cost US$40 per DALY; antenatal care and delivery with a skilled
birth attendant - US$40/DALY; and family planning – US$25/DALY 9.

103. The MOPH has carried out a cost analysis of the BPHS in 2012. According to this
study, the per capita expenditure for the BPHS is, on average, US$2.57 and ranges from
US$1.44 (district hospitals) to US$4.56 (health sub-center). The difference in the per capita
cost between the health centers could be due to variation in population characteristics, or
case-mix. The estimated per-capita cost of the BPHS is low compared to estimates of
US$5-10 per capita annually required to provide a package of services for health related
MDGs.

104. It is interesting to compare the estimates of the per capita cost of delivery of the
BPHS from 2012 study with that from an earlier study by O. Ameli and W. Newbrander
carried out in 2006-2007. The latter study mostly focused on the provinces supported by
the USAID, while the 2012 study mostly focused on the provinces supported by the Bank
project. The average per capita cost of the BPHS by the O. Ameli and W. Nwebrander
study was estimated at US$3.78, which indicates that the BPHS delivered through the Bank
supported project was less expensive. One of the reasons for this could be that in the Bank
supported project the NGO contracts were set at the province level, which could be more
efficient than contracts to support lower aggregates of population (often the case in the
USAID supported program).

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating (Satisfactory)

105. The overall outcome rating of the project deserves satisfactory based on the
arguments presented in Sections 3.1-3.3. The project was highly relevant for the

development challenges of the Afghan health sector in 2009 and implementation was
largely successful with minor challenges. The majority of the PDO indicator targets have
been fully achieved, except for childhood immunization. However, overall, the project
made progress, which presumably contributed to the continued decline (albeit at a slow
rate) of child and maternal mortality rates during 2009-2013.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

106. Given the predominant focus of the project on rural areas, where the majority of the
poor live, the project had a strongly pro-poor and pro-rural impact. The average poverty
rate in project provinces was 31% (ranging from 9% in Helmand to 60.3% in Balkh). Thus
at least one third of the project beneficiaries were household below the official poverty line.

107. The project has established 3,150 community health posts, 191 sub centers, 192 basic
health centers, and 85 comprehensive health centers, thereby greatly increasing physical
access to health services for the rural poor.

108. Gender empowerment was an important theme of the project considering its focus on
improving cultural accessibility of health services to women and significantly increasing
deployment of female health workers in health care facilities. The project created new
employment opportunities for women. Of course a gender barrier still remains in
Afghanistan given the long rooted cultural norms and beliefs in the society. Therefore the
development partners need to keep gender issues in sharp focus.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

109. The major focus of capacity building and enhancing stewardship was placed at the
national level. The MOPH received a significant support from the project in terms of
consultants with skills and competences lacking among the cadre of civil servants.

110. The project’s strong support to monitoring and evaluation has been a crucial
contributor to the development of a data management culture. Tracking the performance of
health care providers through the Balanced Scorecard (BSC) system is one of the rare
examples in low-income countries.

111. The project also facilitated the establishment of a new mechanism of paying providers
through result based financing. This innovative pilot supported by the project is going to be
scaled up nation-wide, marking a significant policy shift in the field of health financing.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

112. The MOPH benefited from a large number of consultants supported by the project.
They filled important skill gaps in various departments of the MOPH. However the
downside of this is MOPH’s heavy dependence on consultants, as opposed to the regular
staff, for some key regular roles and functions.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

N/A



4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome (Rating: Moderate)

113. There are four main risks for the project development outcomes: (a) deteriorating
security situation; (b) insufficient financing to sustain results; (c) slow progress in
institutional capacity strengthening; and (d) shifting political priorities in the government.

114. Deteriorating security situation is the most serious risk with a high likelihood of
occurring and with a significant potential impact. It is also exogenous to the health sector.
Since 2008, the security situation has been deteriorating, which negatively reflected on the
project. It is hard to predict in which direction the risk will shift.

115. The risk of insufficient funding in the medium term is negligible. The prospect of
financing the health sector from the local sources is extremely limited; however, the donor
support to Afghanistan’s development objectives is going to be maintained in the medium
term. As discussed earlier in this report, the subsequent project, SEHAT, with a funding
envelope of US$408 million already became effective in June 2013. However, in the long
run the development partners need to think about how to increase self-reliance of
Afghanistan and domestic funding of the health sector.

116. While there has been a great progress made in strengthening institutional capacities
and the stewardship role of the MOPH, a risk remains that the progress might be slower
than needed to deliver services at a larger scale and a higher performance level. The
greatest risk in this regard is at the provincial level. The SEHAT project has recognized the
importance of this and has been designed to emphasize strengthening of stewardship
functions of MOPH.

117. Lastly, there is a risk that due to political changes, more resources could be invested
in government-operated health services, and the government may weaken the reliance on
NGOs. The most important strategy to mitigate it would be to carry out an effective
communication with key government stakeholders in order to help them understand the
advantages of contracting service delivery to the NGO sector.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry (Rating: Satisfactory)

118. The Bank’s performance during the project design offers one of the best examples of
inclusiveness, client-centeredness, building on the past lessons, and balancing short-term
and long-term development objectives. The Bank team carried out a wide range of
consultations with development partners and sought their input and support to the project


                                             21
design. The Bank also excelled in building on past lessons and ensuring continuity and
consistency between HSERDP and SHARP.

119. In retrospect, after the completion of the project, its design and the Bank’s
performance to ensure quality at entry proved to be satisfactory. One element which the
Bank team overlooked was the huge burden that would be imposed on the implementing
agency by newly contacting the service provider NGOs regardless of their past
performance. All NGO contracts had to be terminated at the end of the HSERDP project,
and an entirely new procurement process had to be started for engaging NGOs under
SHARP. This was unnecessarily cumbersome. A more sensible approach would have been
to extend the contracts of those NGOs that were performing well under HSERDP and redo
the procurement process for new contracts when the NGOs did not perform satisfactorily.

(b) Quality of Supervision (Rating: Satisfactory)

120. Overall the quality of supervision was satisfactory. The Bank team carried out formal
supervisions missions twice a year. Strong local team provided continual implementation
support, while TTL was also based nearby, which allowed him to visit the country often.
The Aid Memoires were well written and contained clear actionable recommendations.
The ISRs were timely prepared and they contained substantive information about the
project implementation progress, challenges and required actions. In the initial phase of the
project, the emphasis of supervision was largely on the operational issues (e.g. contracting
of NGOs) but at the later stage the emphasis shifted towards results, policies and
development issues.

121. The Bank team also showed a great deal of flexibility. There were few minor
adjustments made during the implementation as described in Section 2.2, which were
relevant and well justified.

122. The Bank team performed very well with regard to ensuring sustainable financing of
the project and a smooth transition to a new operation, SEHAT, without causing any
interruption in the delivery of the basic package of services.

123. The fiduciary aspect of supervision was also carried out well. The Bank team in
general reviewed all procurement packages timely even though there were some delays in
providing No Objections, especially with regard to procurement of the NGO services.

124. A relatively weak point of the Bank supervision was guiding the client in
implementing environmental safeguards requirements. The Bank’s safeguards team should
have provided more pro-active and consistent implementation support with this regard.


(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance (Rating: Satisfactory)

125. Following from the discussion above, the overall Bank performance deserves
Satisfactory rating.



                                              22
5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance (Rating: Moderately Satisfactory)

126. There was strong government commitment and ownership of the project development
objectives. The government also ensured that there was a conducive policy environment in
place to enable the project to deliver on its intended outcomes. The government was quick
in responding to the institutional reorganization needs and adjusting the structure of the
MOPH to ensure more effective stewardship functions, including project management. The
government also effectively played its role of coordinating the activities among various
development partners and ensuring synergy between them.

127. However the government’s fiduciary control mechanisms were unnecessarily
cumbersome and lengthy. This was an effect of centralization of fiduciary functions in the
Ministry of Finance. Annual procurement plans were part of the government approved
budget, which restricted flexibility during implementation. Processing of payments
required too many clearances and signatures, which caused delays in processing payments
to contracted NGOs. Government procurement procedures in some instances were
unnecessarily demanding and difficult, and when the implementing agency tried to follow
the Bank and the government procedures at the same time delays were unavoidable.

128. Lastly, the government did not pay sufficient attention to environmental safeguards
issues. Medical waste management still remains a pressing issue. Initiating implementation
of the Infectious Management and Environmental Plan was slow. The main issue which
hindered implementation of the plan was a lack of ownership and responsibility within the
MOPH. The plan was prepared by the Directorate of Policy and Planning and the
Directorate of Health Economics and Financing, whereas the responsibility for
implementation rested with the Directorate of Preventive Medicine.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance (Rating: Moderately Satisfactory)

129. Implementing agency maintained necessary implementation capacity throughout the
project lifetime, even though there was higher staff turnover than during the previous
project.

130. Annual workshops to coordinate the project activities between the MOPH and the
provincial health offices were useful and effective. In addition six BPHS/EPHS
coordination workshops were held. The workshops facilitated discussions on progress and
challenges of health service delivery in various provinces, as well as debates on various
policy issues.

131. One of the shortcomings in the performance of the implementing agency was delays
in the finalization of contracts with NGOs. This is discussed in a greater detail in earlier
sections of this report.

132. Management of service contracts (the contracts with NGOs and the JHU) was not
always performed effectively. More decisive and prompt reactions were required from the
GCMU when the performance of some NGO did not meet the required standards.


                                            23
Shortcomings in the performance of JHU may have been avoided if their contract were
managed more effectively.

133. During the first half of the project implementation period, the implementing agency
was too preoccupied with NGO contracting and other procurement and operational issues.
Therefore, the focus on the NGO performance was somewhat weakened, and monitoring
the health related outputs and outcomes was relaxed. The GCMU staff did not have time to
more pro-actively manage the contract implementation by NGOs. Other departments of the
MOPH, for example the HMIS department, should have taken a more active role in
monitoring and managing the NGO performance.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance (Rating: Moderately
Satisfactory)

134. Following from the above discussion and Moderately Satisfactory rating of the
government and implementing agency, the overall Borrower performance is rated as
Moderately Satisfactory as well.

6. Lessons Learned

135. Public-private partnerships can be an effective mechanism for scaling up service
delivery. The project demonstrated that by contracting out services to the NGO sector the
government can better focus its efforts on stewardship role, and effectively leverage the
flexibility and capacities of the private sector, especially when its own capacities are
constrained. This experience of Afghanistan could set a very useful example for many
other countries.

136. Output-based lump-sum contracts, if supported by strong performance management,
in general could be an appropriate tool for engaging NGOs in service provision. However
such contracts need to be effectively managed. The contracts allowed NGOs a great deal of
flexibility in the use of inputs to attain the quality standards specified in the description of
the BPHS and EPHS. However, the NGOs did not take the full advantage of the flexibility
they were allowed under the contracts. Partly, this was due to the reporting requirements
imposed by the fiduciary control rules of the Ministry of Finance. NGOs had to provide
detailed reports on the use of funds and inputs.

137. An important lesson for the Bank was drawn with regard to the procurement
arrangements for contracting the service provider NGOs. Terminating all NGO contracts
at the end of the HSERDP project and starting an entirely new procurement process for
engaging NGOs under SHARP was unnecessarily cumbersome. The Bank should have
supported a more streamlined mechanisms, whereby well performing NGOs could have
had their contracts extended across projects (from HSERDP to SHARP), and the poor
performing NGOs could have their contracts terminated even in the middle of the contract
period.

138. Performance-based financing is a potentially effective mechanism to incentivize
performance, and therefore NGO contracts should take advantage of it to a greater extent.


                                              24
The RBF pilot has demonstrated that it is a potentially powerful tool when used
appropriately to boost performance.

139. Strong monitoring and evaluation is critical for achieving results. The project
demonstrated the importance of robust monitoring and evaluation for attaining results.
Often health system strategies and programs fail to adequately fund M&E considering it an
administrative expense. One thing which is often overlooked in the Bank supported
projects is ensuring that the baseline statistics for the result indicators are current and
reflect the reality at the time of appraisal. Despite having a robust M&E framework,
SHARP could not escape this problem. The plan to update the baseline after project
effectiveness often fails because other competing priorities (procurement, staffing, etc.)
interfere. Therefore all efforts shall be made to have the current baseline data at least for
the majority of indicators by appraisal.

140. Strong institutional capacity is key for sustainability. As discussed earlier in this
report a clear ‘evolution’ can be observed with regard to building institutional capacities in
three successive health projects in Afghanistan since 2003. Such an incremental approach
was appropriate for Afghanistan. However at this point in time, it is important that the
Bank shifts its emphasis to building institutions, putting in place effective policies, and
ensuring adequate stewardship capacities so that the achievements of the successful
engagement with this country for the past ten years is sustained in the future.

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners
(a) Borrower/implementing agencies

141. The Borrower has not carried out a formal project evaluation after completion.
However, during the Bank’s ICR mission, the Borrower confirmed that the project was
highly relevant and it fully met the expectations of the government and produced
satisfactory results. Comments about the project provided by various departments of the
MOPH include the following:

   • According to the GCMU, the contracting arrangements for NGOs were more complex
   than necessary. It would have been more efficient if the contracts with NGOs of
   satisfactory performance record could have been directly extended. The implementation
   completion review fully supports this comment and makes the same remarks in the
   relevant sections of this report.

   • Funding available for the provincial health offices to supervise the NGO activities
   was not sufficient to exercise more intensive supervision, particularly in remote areas.
   The provincial health authorities advised that in the next operation the Bank should
   consider allocating more funds to provincial health offices. The implementation
   completion review concurs with this remark but also notes that the issue was not only
   about funding. A clear plan was lacking of how the sub-national level stewardship and
   project management should be carried out. The next project SEHAT, having recognized
   this limitation, pays much greater attention to the provincial level stewardship and
   implementation support.



                                             25
   • While the performance of JHU was deemed acceptable, the Borrower was concerned
   that the quality of their service somewhat deteriorated compared to the previous project.
   The implementation completion review fully concurs with this remark as indicated in
   the relevant section of the report. This experience needs to be taken into account in
   SEHAT project.

   • The Borrower expressed a slight concern that the activities carried out by the JHU
   were not sufficiently mainstreamed with the health information management processes
   in the MOPH and at the provincial health offices. There should be a greater integration
   and transfer of know-how. The implementation completion review considers this as an
   important issue to be addressed in the next project under the component dedicated to
   strengthening stewardship in the health system.

   • Most procurement activities were handled at the central level, which increased the
   administrative burden on the GCMU. In the next phase of engagement with the Bank, a
   possibility of delegating some project management functions to the provinces shall be
   explored, and an appropriate capacity building shall be implemented for that purpose.

   • In the initial phase of the project, some indicators exhibited a slight decline,
   especially the facility level indicators. The Borrower attributed this largely to the
   improvement of the accuracy of data recording, which created an impression of
   deteriorating performance. This was particularly true for the RBF pilot.

(b) Cofinanciers

142. Not applicable

(c) Other partners and stakeholders

143. Overall NGOs endorsed the project’s development objectives and design. However, a
few concerns and comments were raised, which are worth mentioning in this report.

144. In the interviews with the implementing NGOs one of the top concerns raised was the
difficulty of recruiting medical personnel, especially the female health workers. This
became ever more difficult since 2008 when the security situation started to drastically
deteriorate. NGOs tried various strategies, including contracting staff from neighboring
countries. As the composition of the BPHS changed in 2010, an acute need emerged to
train more physiotherapists and lab technicians, which are the most hard-to-find health
professions in the country.

145. NGOs raised the issue of attrition of health care staff after training. In some provinces
only 60% of trained nurses go back to their communities after training. The rest remain in
the provincial centers where they are trained and continue working in the provincial level
health facilities or the private sector.




                                             26
146. NGOs also expressed need to invest more in physical infrastructure of health care
facilities. This is important for creating a more pleasant working environment for health
care workers but also for attracting patients to the health centers and clinics.

147. Due to reporting requirements set by the MOF, and sometimes self-imposed by the
MOPH, the flexibility of NGOs was rather limited. They could not take the full advantage
of a lump-sum contract as they still had to report on the use of inputs and expenditures.

148. NGOs confirmed that scaling up immunization coverage and skilled birth attendance
was difficult. The immunization program was seriously hampered by the lack of security in
remote areas, which often disrupted the outreach sessions and campaigns. The security
situation also affected the operating hours of the basic health centers, which would usually
close after 3 pm. This had most direct implications for pregnant women as deliveries often
occurred in the evening or night, when the facilities would be closed.

Annex 2. Outputs by Component


1. This annex discusses the project performance with regard to the intermediate outcomes
related to the specific components of the project. As discussed in the main body of the
report (Sections 2.3 and 3.2), in addition to seven PDO indicators, the project also used
another set of seven output indicators to measure: (a) sustaining and strengthening the
delivery of the BPHS; (b) expanding the delivery of the EPHS, (c) strengthening the
MOPH stewardship functions, and (d) piloting innovations.

Component 1 – Sustaining and strengthening the delivery of the BPHS

2. This intermediate outcome of Component 1 was measured by three indicators: score on
the balanced scorecard (BSC) related to the quality of care, number of consultations per
person per year, and the proportion of the lowest income quintile using the BPHS services.
According to the theory of change underlying the project design the improvement of the
quality of care, access to services, and equity would lead to better health outcomes across
the PDO indicators which have been already reviewed in Section 3.2 of this report.

Balanced Scorecard for the BPHS

3. The BSC for the PBH is comprised of six domains measuring the performance of
service provider from multiple angles. The self-explanatory diagram below describes the
BSC conceptual framework:




                                            29
4. The BSC methodology, including indicators, was substantially revised in 2011;
therefore the BSCs from 2011 forward are not comparable with the BSCs carried out from
2004 till 2009. During the project life-time three rounds of BSCs were carried out in 2009-
2010, 2011-12, and 2012-2013. The last two are comparable with each other but not with
2009-2010 BSC. The following table provides a summary of indicator values for these
three rounds of BSC:

5. Overall, the 2012-13 national BSC results, which also serve as end-of-project results,
demonstrated moderately good progress in provider performance with more than one-third
of indicators showing an increase of minimum five percentage points. There were no
declines in any of the indicators nationally. However, there were significant variations in
levels of performance and changes in performance across provinces and domains of the
scorecard. Nationally, the 2012-13 BSC results pointed to sustained good performance in
the domain of Client and Community Responsiveness, with continuing high levels for the
Client Satisfaction and Perceived Quality of Care Index (national median score 75), as
well as a high level of Community Involvement in Decision-making at BPHS facilities
(median score 86, an improvement from 80 in 2011-12). Physical Capacity at BPHS
facilities improved and demonstrated relatively high results overall. Although deficiencies
in health facility infrastructure remained, results were higher compared to the previous year
for three of the five indicators.

6. The Quality of Service Provision indicators showed large variation. While health
providers were following good practices in assessing patients (median score of 80 for the
Clinical Background and Physical Exam Index), the scores for the Client Counseling Index
(median score 33) and Time Spent with Clients (median score 12) were yet to improve.

7. The Human Resources domain showed large variation in performance as well. Whereas
the Health Worker Motivation Index remained high (median score 72), and there were


                                                   31
improvements in the timeliness of salary payments (from 65 in 2011-12 to 72 in 2012-13)
and Health Worker Knowledge Scores (raising from a median score of 64 in 2011- 12 to 70
in 2012-13), facilities were still struggling to meet the minimum staffing guidelines
(median score 24) and provide regular training opportunities for their staff (median score
showing 9% of health workers received training in the last year). Management systems
indicators showed visible improvement in HMIS Use Index (rising from a median score of
75 in 2011-12 to 83 in 2012-13), which is also among the indicators with high scores.
However, the results were very poor when it came to financial systems (median score 3).
The performance on this indicator was the lowest in the Scorecard. There were no changes
nationally in performance on the Overall Mission indicators which focus on equity.

8. Some selected indicators which are relatively more important than others are discussed
in a greater detail below:

Overall client satisfaction and perceived quality of care

9. The Overall Client Satisfaction and Perceived Quality of Care Index is a composite
indicator consisting of twelve items measuring overall client satisfaction and perception of
different aspects of the quality of care they received at a particular visit. The items include
various important aspects of care, including cleanliness of the health facility, waiting time,
privacy during the visit, respectfulness of the provider, and availability of prescribed
medicine. The national median score for the indicator was 75.3, compared to 77.2 in 2011-
12. There was no substantial change in the proportion of provinces meeting the lower
benchmark (81.8% and 73.5% in 2011-12 and 2012-2013, respectively). There was an
increase of 11 percentage points in proportion of provinces meeting the upper benchmark
in 2012-13 (29.4%) as compared to 2011-12 (18.2%). See the figure below:




Health care worker motivation index

10. Motivation was defined in terms of intent to act or engage in particular type of behavior.
Items in this index were aimed at measuring the degree to which health workers intended to
perform their duties as well as potential reasons for it, such as financial rewards or desire to


                                              32
serve their communities. Together these nineteen items measured the level of motivation
among the BPHS health workers of all types, including clinical as well as support staff. The
national median score for this indicator was 72.1, not very high compared to the previous
year’s national median (69.3). There was an increase in proportion of provinces meeting
the lower benchmark in 2012-13. In 2011-12, 81.8% of provinces met the lower benchmark
as compared to 94.1% in 2012-13. There was a substantial increase in proportion of
provinces meeting the upper benchmark, which increased from 18.2% in 2011-12 to 44.1%
in 2012-13. See the figure below:




Health care facilities meeting minimum staffing requirements

11. This indicator assesses whether BPHS health facilities meet the minimum staffing
requirements as determined by the BPHS guidelines. These requirements vary by health
facility type: (i) Sub-Health Centers (SHC), (ii) Basic Health Centers (BHC), and (iii)
Comprehensive Health Centers (CHC). To receive a high score on this indicator a
particular health facility must have the required number of health workers in each position
as it is determined by the BPHS Guidelines. For example, a SHC must have both, a nurse
and a midwife, either regular or community. If it is a BHC, it must have a nurse, a midwife
(either regular or community), a community health supervisor, a physician, and two
vaccinators. If it is a CHC, it must have two nurses, two midwives (regular or community),
two vaccinators, two physicians, a community health supervisor, a laboratory technician,
and a pharmacy technician. The national median for this indicator was estimated to be 24.4,
which was similar to the 2011-12 estimates (25.4). Proportion of provinces meeting the
lower benchmark declined from 81.8% last year to 70.6% this year. There was no change
in proportion of provinces meeting the upper benchmark (18.2% in 2011-2012 and 14.7%
in 2012-2013). See the figure below:




                                            33
Provider knowledge score

12. This indicator assesses the knowledge of health workers by questions about practical
knowledge concerning the management of common conditions covered by the BPHS.
These are common childhood illnesses and nutrition, maternal health, and infectious
disease such as tuberculosis, malaria and HIV/AIDS. It also covers key aspects of infection
control at facility level. The national median score for the indicator was 69.5 in 2012-13 as
compared to 64.4 in 2011-12. There was an increase in proportion of provinces meeting the
lower benchmark from 81.8% in 2011-12 to 97.1% in 2013. There was a substantial
increase in proportion of provinces meeting the upper benchmark, which increased from
18.2% to 61.8% between the two rounds. See the figure below:




                                             34
Equipment functionality index

13. This indicator is comprised of twenty-three items for Sub-health centers and Basic
Health Centers, and of twenty-six items for Comprehensive Health Centers. It assesses
presence and functioning of basic equipment that is required for different types of facilities
to provide services as required by the BPHS Guidelines. The national median score for the
indicator increased from 74.5 in the 2011-12 to 81.2 in 2012-13. There was an increase in
proportion of provinces meeting the lower benchmark from 81.8% in 2011-12 to 94.1% in
2012-13. There was a substantial increase in proportion of provinces meeting the upper
benchmark, which increased from 18.2% to 29.4% between the two rounds. See the figure
below:




14. Pharmaceuticals and Vaccines Availability Index assesses whether BPHS health
facilities possess thirty-one important pharmaceutical products and vaccines that are on the
Essential Drugs List. The national median score for the indicator was 78.6, compared to
76.6 in 2011-12. There was no change in proportion of provinces meeting the lower
benchmark (81.8% in 2011-12 and 85.3% in 2012-13). Also, there was no change in
proportion of provinces meeting the upper benchmark (18.2% in 2011-12 and 14.7% in
2012-13). See the figure below:




                                             35
Clinical guidelines availability index

15. The Clinical Guidelines Index assesses the presence of clinical guidelines in BPHS
health facilities for management of most common conditions and illnesses. These are the
following: (i) IMCI, (ii) TB, (iii) Malaria, (iv) Immunization, (v) Family planning, and (vi)
HIV counseling and testing. The latter applies only to CHCs as facilities below this level
are not expected to provide such services. The national median for this indicator was 78.9,
showing an increase of 8.6 percentage points compared to last year (Table 2). Proportion of
provinces meeting the lower benchmark increased from 81.8% to 91.2%, or slightly more
than 10%. Proportion of provinces meeting the upper benchmark increased substantially
from 18.2% to 35.3% between the two rounds. See the figure below:




                                             36
Client background and physical assessment index

16. This indicator assesses how well health workers follow the basic steps that are required
for all visits, regardless of the nature of a complaint. It consists of a set of seven items that
include whether a health worker greets the client, asks their age, registers the reason for
visit, asks for details such as the nature and duration of a complaint, asks about previous
interventions, performs a physical examination, and ensures privacy. The national median
for this indicator was 80.2 in 2012-13, observably higher than the score for 2011-12 (73.8).
There was an increase in proportion of provinces meeting the lower benchmark from
81.8% to 97.1% between the two rounds. There was a substantial increase in proportion of
provinces meeting the upper benchmark from 18.2% to 41.2% between the two rounds. See
the figure below:




Number of consultations per person per year

17. This is an output indicator, which tries to capture utilization of services by the
population in rather a crude manner. The indicator does not indicate whether services used
where needed or not, and whether the patient received the quality care. Dimensions of
quality have been already discussed above. It is hard to assess the appropriateness of
utilization (conditional on need) due to the data limitations. Therefore for the purposes of
this report it is assumed that the services were used based on need. Also it has to be noted
that the source of the data for this indicator is solely HMIS records, which are based on the
reports submitted by the health care providers.

18. The project baseline for this indicator was 0.9 outpatient consultations per capita per
year (based on 2007 data from HMIS). The project target was to achieve the ratio of 1.14
by 2013. The project data indicates that there was a steady increase in the health service
utilization. At the project mid-term the indicator estimate reached 1.2, and by the end of the
project the utilization rate of 1.6 was attained, thereby significantly exceeding the target.




                                               37
Proportion of the lowest income quintile using BPHS services when sick in the last month

19. The project made a good progress with regard to this particular dimension of
performance as well. The JHU’s final project survey of 2012 measured the population’s
health seeking behavior. Of the 14,188 individuals that reported illness in the two weeks
prior to the survey, 83 percent were reported to have sought treatment outside of the home.
There were no major differences by age, sex, and residence in the proportion of those
reporting illness seeking treatment. However, by wealth status, 87% (84% - 90%) of those
in the wealthiest quintile sought treatment, as opposed to 74% (71% - 78%) of those in the
poorest quintile. Three most common reasons for not seeking care in the lowest income
quintile were the following: (a) the belief that the illness would go away (36%); (b) high
cost of transportation; and (c) limited physical access to a health facility.

20. The project baseline was 32.3% of the lowest income quintile population using the
BPHS services when sick. The target was set at 40% for 2013. Thus the project fully met
its target and even significantly exceeded it (74% as indicated above, versus 40%).

21. The equity dimension of health service performance was also measured through the
BSC designed for the BPHS with two indicators constructed as concentration indices: (a)
outpatient visit concentration index, and (b) patient satisfaction concentration index. These
indices are very differently constructed than the indicator discussed above, therefore they
are not comparable. The indices measure the share of the poor among the patients visiting
the BPHS facilities, which are conceptually different from the intermediate result indicator
used in the project result framework (the proportion of the poor who seek care when sick).

22. Outpatient visit concentration index assesses equity in access to outpatient services by
measuring the wealth status of health facility clients at exit interviews. The wealth status
was measured through a series of questions on assets, sources of income, access to water,
electricity and other necessities. The national median for this indicator was estimated to be
43.8 in 2012-13, which is practically the same level as in 2011-12 level (44.5). There was
no change in proportion of provinces meeting the lower benchmark between the two rounds.
It was 29.4% in 2012-13 compared to 36.4% in 2011-12. There was also no change in
proportion of provinces meeting the upper benchmark between the two rounds (9.1% in
2011-12 and 5.9% in 2012-13).

23. Similar to outpatient visit concentration index, patient satisfaction concentration index
focuses on equity by measuring the wealth status of health facility clients at exit interviews.
However, unlike the previous indicator, it focuses on satisfaction among those who have
used the services. It measures whether the poor are satisfied with health services when
compared to non-poor groups. The national median was estimated to be 49.6 in 2012-13,
and it appeared that it had not changed much since 2009-10. There was a decline in
proportion of provinces meeting the lower benchmark from 72.7% in 2011-12 to 50% in
2012-13. There was also a decline in proportion of provinces meeting the upper benchmark
from 15.2% to 5.9% between the two rounds.




                                              38
Component 2 – Expanding the delivery of the EPHS

24. This intermediate outcome of Component 2 was measured by a score of the hospital
BSC capturing the following dimensions: (a) quality of care, (b) amount of services, (c)
equity and management processes in referral hospitals. The hospital BSC was also revised
in 2011 similar to the BSC for the BPHS, therefore only 2011-12 and 2012-13 rounds are
comparable.

25. The hospital BSC is structured around seven domains: (i) client and communities, (ii)
human resources, (iii) physical capacities, (iv) quality of service provision, (v) management
systems, (vi) functionality indicators, (vii) ethics and values.

26. In almost all domains of the BSC, the best performers were the regional hospitals
followed closely by the provincial hospitals. District hospitals and national hospitals
generally were the poorer performers. On the whole, hospital performance in the 2012/13
round was similar to the results from the 2011/12 round as the overall national mean score
rose modestly from 69% to 72%.

27. Client and Communities – Kabul Hospitals performed poorest under this domain
scoring below the domain median of 79% while the others performed at or above the
median (district hospitals: 79%, provincial hospitals: 84%, regional hospitals: 88% and
Kabul hospitals: 38%) in 2012-13 round. Clients expressed dissatisfaction with the cost of
treatment and the difficulty associated with getting prescribed medications. Clients also
expressed disaffection with the states of toilets in hospitals. About 93% of surveyed
hospitals did not charge any user fees. The involvement of communities in hospital
strategic planning was still a weak area. See the figure below 10:




28. Human resources - The general performance under this domain remained unchanged
from 2011/2012 (the domain median was 64% in both 2011/12 and 2012/13). Kabul
hospitals performed best under this domain, while district hospitals lagged behind (district
hospitals: 60%, provincial hospitals: 66%, regional hospitals: 72%, and Kabul hospitals:
74%). Understaffing continued to be reported for physician and nurse positions while
administrative positions continued to be well staffed. Even though male health workers
outnumbered female health workers by a 2-to-1 ratio satisfaction of the two sexes with

– regional hospitals, KH – Kabul hospitals.



                                                 39
their jobs and working conditions were essentially the same. Health workers expressed the
greatest dissatisfaction with their level of remuneration, which was not motivating. With
the failure of timely salary payment in many hospitals, and district hospitals in particular,
this could be termed as too little, too late. The perceived lack of opportunities for
promotion also created dissatisfaction. See the figure below:




29. Physical capacity – Regional hospitals performed best under this domain while the
Kabul Hospitals did poorest. The better supplied and equipped hospitals are generally
found outside Kabul (domain median: 79%, district hospitals: 77%, provincial hospitals:
87%, regional hospitals: 87%, and Kabul hospitals: 76%). Compared to 2011-12 round
some increases were noted in this domain for a number of hospitals; the domain median
also increased modestly from 76% in 2011-12 to 79% in 2012-13. Electricity supply to
hospitals was reported as reliable in 61% of surveyed hospitals. With a national median
score of 50% safety precautions were still not adequate. While laboratories and X-ray
departments were sufficiently equipped in most hospitals, the same could not be said for
the emergency departments and wards. Increments were seen in drugs stocks in most
hospitals, and, encouragingly, all hospitals had the capacity to perform all basic laboratory
tests at the time of survey. With cleanliness suboptimal in most hospitals, nosocomial
infections still remain a significant risk for inpatients. Substantial gains were made though
in making hospitals user friendly for female clients, providing sufficient privacy and
adequate number of toilets. See the figure below:




                                             40
30. Quality of service provision - This domain recorded improvements over the previous
round, with the domain median increasing from 68% in 2011-12 to 73% in 2012-13. Drug
stock monitoring systems were still not fully functional in about 15% of surveyed hospitals.
During the observation of the health worker-patient consultation, health workers generally
ensured patient privacy (national median: 100%). In history taking and during the physical
examination, most key activities were carried out, though health workers generally failed to
ask about previous treatments for their patients’ conditions. For most patient counseling
indicators, with the exception of explaining how to take the prescribed medications
(median: 90%), health providers did poorly. Little was said about the nature of the disease
(median: 8%), when to return to the clinic (median: 27%) or potential adverse events from
the medications (median: 0%). Disposable syringes for injections were generally used; and
disinfectants were widely used in hospital cleaning. Blood and blood products were
screened for HIV and Hepatitis B and C in about 90% of surveyed hospitals. Isolation of
infectious patients in wards and central supply area cleanliness are still problem areas as
they have been in previous years. See the figure below:




31. Management systems – Domain performance improved in 2012-13 round compared to
2011-12 as the median increased from 56% to 64%, though district hospitals performed
below the domain median score (domain mean: 64%, district hospitals: 58%, provincial
hospitals: 78%, regional hospitals: 68%, and Kabul hospitals: 75%). The lack of
management training for hospital leadership observed in the previous round remained in
the 2012-13 round. Performance under HMI and equipment management continued to
improve while hospitals underperformed under administrative and financial autonomy and
local financial management. Security in hospitals did not improve in 2012-13 when
compared with the previous round. See the figure below:




32. Functionality – The highest concentration of doctors is observed in Kabul. The highest
workload for doctors, both in inpatient and outpatient departments was in district hospitals.
Work load per doctor decreased at provincial hospitals and was less at regional hospitals


                                             41
and even less for Kabul hospitals. The surgery load was highest for surgeons in regional
hospitals. There were, on average six nurses and four doctors per district hospital, six
nurses and six doctors per provincial hospital, six nurses and eight doctors per regional
hospital, and five nurses and seven doctors per Kabul hospital. This represented a nurse-to-
patient ratio of 0.4 in district hospitals, 0.4 in provincial hospitals, 0.3 in regional hospitals
and 0.5 in Kabul hospitals. For doctors the ratio to patients was 0.2 in district hospitals, 0.2
in provincial hospitals, 0.2 in regional hospitals and 0.4 in Kabul hospitals. The delivery
load was highest for midwives in provincial hospitals and regional hospitals and least for
midwives in Kabul hospitals. Overall, 32% of health workers were women and 68% men,
which was essentially unchanged from 2011/2012. Bed occupancy rates greater than 100%
were recorded in seven hospitals. In some of these hospitals there were more actual beds
than the official number of beds while the others admitted patients in excess of their bed
capacities at times. See the figure below:




33. Ethics and values - Females generally utilized hospital services more than males (53%
versus 47%), even when adjusted for reproductive health admissions. Females were also
generally more satisfied with services rendered than males: females expressed greater


                                               42
satisfaction than males with services rendered in 56% of surveyed hospitals. See the figure
below:




Component 3 – Strengthening MOPH stewardship function

34. According to the project result framework this intermediate outcome was measured
through an output indicator capturing the amount of supervision of the BPHS and EPHS
facilities carried out by the MOPH officials and timely payment of contractors. There is no
readily available data about the number of supervision visits carried out by the MOPH
officials to evaluate the performance of NGOs in delivering the BPHS and EPHS services.
The project mostly relied on the third party evaluation through the BSC (discussed above).
As indicated in the main text of the report, according to the MOPH and provincial health
office staff interviewed during the ICR mission, they were not able to carry out supervision
missions as frequently as they desired due to the limited funds available for operational
expenses. The lack of security was another limiting factor.

35. The GCMU held annual workshops to coordinate the project activities between MOPH
and the provincial health offices. In addition to these annual workshops six BPHS/EPHS
coordination workshops were held. The workshops facilitated discussion on progress and
challenges of health service delivery in various provinces as well as on various policy
issues. During the workshops findings of the BSC would be reviewed and the
implementing NGOs would receive directions from the MOPH and the provincial health
offices with regard to the performance dimensions to be improved.

36. A more important dimension of strengthening stewardship, which is not captured in the
result framework, was supporting the MOPH in filling the capacity gaps in staffing,
training of the MOPH specialists in core functions of stewardship that were lacking, and
supporting institutionalization of critical functions such as health information management,
economic analysis and financial planning, procurement and financial management, etc. In
total, 133 specialists from the MOPH were trained through various short courses. In overall,
Component 3 supported more than 79 technical staff (working as consultants for the
MOPH) in different areas of stewardship.

37. The project did not envisage capacity building for provincial health offices. They were
only supported through computerization and internet connectivity. The subsequent SEHAT
project, which has a substantial component on strengthening stewardship, is filling this gap.

38. As it was already discussed in the earlier sections of this report, delayed payment to the
implementing NGOs was very frequent due to unnecessarily cumbersome fiduciary control
procedures adopted by the MOF. This explains the fact that the project did not fair very




                                             43
well with regard to timely payment for service providers. The below chart represents the
trends with regard to this indicator measured through the BSC for the BPHS:




39. After achieving a peak score of 90.7 in 2007, this indicator had been declining ever
since, reaching its lowest point in 2011-12 (64.5). In the 2012-13 round the indicator
increased (71.9) compared to the previous year, but it is yet to achieve the levels observed
in earlier years. There were no changes in proportion of provinces meeting the lower
(60.6% and 67.6% in 2011-12 and 2012-2013, respectively) or upper benchmarks (27.3%
and 23.5% in 2011-12 and 2012, respectively).

Component 4 – Piloting innovations

40. The RBF was implemented in 16 provinces, out of which 6 provinces were covered by
the SHARP project and the other 10 by USAID and EU. In total 376 BPHS outpatient
facilities, 18 district hospitals and 4 provincial hospitals participated in the RBF pilot. The
table below provides the summary of coverage of the RBF pilot:

41. According to the design the facilities participating in the pilot were divided into
treatment and control groups. In the treatment group the performance-based payments were
paid to health workers at BPHS facilities in addition to the regular contractual payments. In
the control group no additional payments were made and operational activities followed the
regular contractual arrangements. The intervention provinces were selected based on the
following criteria: a) secure enough to be accessible for regular monitoring; b) under a
single contract for health care delivery; and iii) not implementing the GAVI-HSS demand
side financing intervention. All the BPHS facilities within the selected provinces were
randomly assigned to one of the two intervention groups.

42. The RBF pilot used the following set of output indicators for performance-related
payments. The performance payments were not paid on a proportional increase in the
outputs, but rather on the increase in the number of service outputs for the relevant
indicator:

44. The RBF pilot used an independent verification of provider performance carried out by
the third party – Johns Hopkins University (JHU). Verification consisted of two parts:
checking the health facility records and validation of data with the registered health service
user in the community.

45. Improving accuracy of health care records in health facilities was a critical element and
byproduct of the RBF pilot. Therefore, in the initial phase of the implementation some



                                             46
indicator values actually went down in a few health care facilities as an effect of improving
the accuracy of reporting.

46. Initially the RBF pilot was planned in 10 provinces, but then it was scaled up to 16.
There is a strong feeling among the implementing NGOs, the provincial health leadership
and the MOPH that the RBF pilot was a successful initiative and there is a strong
commitment to scale it up at the national level.

47. In 2012 a formal evaluation of the pilot was carried out by the JHU complemented in
September 13 with more recent data analysis by the Bank team. The evaluation
demonstrated that the RBF was indeed a very effective tool for improving provider
performance. As the graphs below indicate there was a marked difference in the
performance between the treatment and control groups, which was more pronounced with a
longer duration of the intervention:

48. While the improved performance for the BPHS services was observed throughout all
facilities and indicators, the improvement in the hospital performance was more uneven.
For most hospitals involved in the RBF a significant improvement in performance was
confirmed. However in some hospitals the performance deteriorated, which is explained by
the implementing NGOs as an effect of improved accuracy of data recording:

49. As demonstrated through the above discussion, Component 4 fully met its
intermediate outcomes. The innovative RBF scheme piloted in the project proved to be a
very successful mechanism for motivating better performance of providers. Based on the
evidence about the effectiveness of RBF produced under SHARP a policy decision was
made to scale up the RBF at the national level and incorporate it in the service contracts
with NGOs.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

1. The scope of analysis for this report is limited to the commentary on cost-effectiveness
of the BPHS interventions supported by the project and fiscal space available for sustaining
funding of the BPHS.

2. According to the 2010 global burden of disease estimates from the Institute of Health
Metrics and Evaluation 11, the health conditions addressed by these interventions account
for about 59.5% of the disease burden in Afghanistan. The figure below represents 25 top
leading causes of diseases burden in the country in 2010 and the changes that have
occurred since 1990.




3. The BPHS design favors community based health services with an emphasis on health
services delivered by health posts, basic health centers, mobile health teams,
comprehensive health clinics and district hospitals. All of these service delivery modalities
are least costly, closer to the community, most accessible by the poor population groups
and capable of delivering the most cost-effective interventions to tackle Afghanistan’s
burden of disease. Community health workers, nurses, and midwives are the backbone of
the BPHS in terms of health care personnel, which makes it much less costly model of care
compared to ones where physicians are the main health care providers.

4. With regard to effectiveness and efficiency, the services included in the BPHS are
consistent with international best-practice based on the available global evidence. Most
interventions supported by the project under the BPHS fall under the cost-effectiveness
ratio of $100 per Disability Adjusted Life Year (DALY) averted which is considered a very
good value for money. The table below summarizes cost-effectiveness ratio estimates for
some of the key health interventions included in the BPHS 12:

5. The MOPH has carried out cost analysis of the BPHS in 2012. According to this study,
the per capita expenditure for the BPHS is, on average, US$2.57 and ranges from US$1.44
(district hospitals) to US$4.56 (health sub-center):

6. The difference in the per capita cost between the health centers could be due to
differences in population characteristics and case-mix. The estimated per-capita cost of the
BPHS is low compared to estimates of US$5-10 per capita annually required to provide a
package of services for health related MDGs.

7. It is interesting to compare the estimates of the per capita cost of delivery of the BPHS
from 2012 study with that from an earlier study by O. Ameli and W. Newbrander carried
out in 2006-2007. The latter study mostly focused on the provinces supported by USAID,
while the 2012 study mostly focused on the provinces supported by the Bank project. The
average per capita cost of the BPHS by the O. Ameli and W. Nwebrander study was
estimated at US$3.78, which indicates that the BPHS delivered through the WB supported
project was cheaper while producing the same outcomes (thus more cost-effective). One of
the reasons for this could be that under SHARP the NGO contracts were set at the province
level, which could be more efficient than contracts to support lower aggregates of
population (often the case in the USAID supported program).

8. In terms of the cost structure of the BPHS, according to 2012 cost analysis, wages and
salaries account for 40%, followed by drugs and disposables (21%), operational expenses
(21%), governance and monitoring (13%), and training and capital investments (5%). Such
a breakdown is comparable to expenditures in the rest of the developing world. For
example according to WHO estimates produced for the World Health Report 2006,
developing countries generally spend about 42.2% on wages and salaries of the health care
workforce 13. The share of the wages and salaries would have been even less than 40% had
the security situation been better. Because of highly insecurity the NGOs need to pay
higher salary to the contracted staff to attract them to the vacant positions.

9. Afghanistan’s fiscal space is significantly constrained and the country is unlikely to be
able to finance the BPHS from domestic resources alone in the medium-term horizon.
According to the most recent data, Afghanistan spends 9.6% of its GDP on health, which
translates to US$50.5 (in PPP terms) per capita. The share of government spending
allocated to health is only 3.3% percent, which is quite low compared to the average for
low income countries (9.3%). Many countries with comparable income levels allocate a
greater share of public resources to health: Benin – 10.5%, Burkina Faso – 12.8%, Mali –
12.2%, Haiti – 9.9%, Nepal – 9.6%, etc.) , it is far low from the average for the low income
countries (9.3%). In the total health expenditures (THE), government sources of funding

account for 15.6 %; donor sources for 16.4%; and private sources for 84%. The out-of-
pocket spending on health is 94% of the total private spending.

10. The following tables represents the breakdown of total health expenditures and
government health expenditures by functional categories, based on the 2009 NHA (more
recent data is not available). It is interesting to note that 22% of the government health
expenditures are spent on prevention, which is higher than in many countries of the
comparable group:

11. In the medium-term Afghanistan will need to depend significantly on donor assistance
in order to be able to sustain funding of its health sector, including the delivery of the
BPHS. Such external funding is most likely to continue, but gradually Afghanistan should
look for ways to increase domestic funding of health from public sources. Hopefully if the
security situation improves the government may shift a portion of the substantial funding
(more than 40% of the total government expenditures) that is currently spent on security
into health and other social sectors.

Annex 5. Beneficiary Survey Results

1. As discussed earlier in the main body of the report, in 2012 the JHU carried out a
household survey as the final end-of-project evaluation survey. The MOPH was not fully
satisfied with the survey as the sampling size was small and did not allow province level
analysis, and the survey was carried out too early thereby missing out 2013 performance of
the project. Nevertheless for most of the project indicators the survey produced satisfactory
estimates. A detailed analysis of the PDO related indicators is provided in Section 2.3 of
this report. In this annex executive summary of the JHU survey is quoted in its original
form:


   EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
2. The 2012 Afghanistan Household Survey (AHS) report presents the results of a
national household survey designed to provide information on maternal and child health,
family planning, child survival, health care utilization, and health-related expenditures in
Afghanistan. It is based on a multi-stage random sample of 12,137 households across all 34
provinces of Afghanistan, and includes 14,551 women aged 12-49 years and 14,589
children under age 5 years, and was conducted between July and December, 2013.

3. The MOPH identified a set of key health indicators for the survey, with national level
estimates shown below (Table 1). Provincial level estimates are also presented in the
report.




                                             55
TRENDS IN MATERNAL CHILD HEALTH INDICATORS

4. To compare trends in maternal child health coverage over time in Afghanistan, we
compare the rural population (92% in the AHS 2012 sample) to previous household survey
results in Afghanistan, although there remain some differences in definitions of indicators
across the surveys. Figure 1 demonstrates the trends in key maternal health indicators since
2003. Antenatal care coverage has been generally increasing since 2003, with the most
recent estimate for rural Afghanistan at 48.5%. Skilled birth attendance and institutional
deliveries are both rising, to 40.5% and 32.4% respectively. The percent of women
receiving two doses of tetanus toxoid during pregnancy is very different across surveys,
with only 31.7% of rural women who delivered in the last two years able to document two
doses in the AHS 2012. The level of contraceptive prevalence remains very low, with only
11.4% of rural women using modern contraception in 2012.

Figure 1. Trends in the Coverage of Maternal Health Indicators in Rural Afghanistan




5. Figure 2 shows the trends in childhood immunization coverage in rural Afghanistan
based on household surveys. The last household survey to show childhood vaccination
coverage across rural Afghanistan occurred in 2007. BCG coverage and DPT/Pentavalent 3
coverage have continued to increase, though still below desirable levels (80% for BCG and
45% for DPT/Pentavalent 3). Measles vaccine coverage increased since 2007, but at 59%
coverage, is still below coverage rates from the early 2000s. Similarly, OPV3 vaccine
coverage is declining, and now stands at 48%, whereas full childhood vaccination is still
very low at 29%.

Figure 2. Trends in Child Immunization Coverage in Rural Afghanistan




6. Figure 3 shows the trends in other child health indicators. Data on complementary
feeding shows that the proportion of children aged 6-9 months who had timely
complementary feeding continues to increase, with about 58% of children now getting
complementary feeding. The reported percent of children under five with diarrhea has gone
down from 30% in 2003 to 23% in 2013, but this can be due to seasonal differences as well
as differences in perception of illness over time. The proportion of children with acute
respiratory infection in the last two week is also similar to diarrhea prevalence in 2013.
Appropriate treatment of diarrhea increased from 53% in 2013 to 69% in 2013. The
proportion of children with ARI who seek treatment outside the home has doubled since
2003, and is now estimated at 59%.

ILLNESS AND INJURIES, CARE-SEEKING BEHAVIOR AND PERCEPTIONS

Illness and injuries in the past two weeks
7. Of 91,792 household members, 13,973 (15%) were reported to have been sick in the two weeks
prior to the survey. 31% of children under 5 years of age were reported to have experienced illness.
Diarrhea, fever, cough/difficulty breathing, and musculoskeletal problems were the most prevalent
primary complaints reported for all age groups, at 18%, 17%, 12%, and 9%, respectively. The most
prevalent primary complaints for the under-fives were diarrhea (45%), fever (25%),
cough/difficulty breathing (14%), and nausea/vomiting (5%).

Treatment seeking outside the home
8. Among all individuals that reported illness in the two weeks prior to the survey, 83 percent
were reported to have sought treatment outside of the home. Of the 2,444 individuals that were ill in
the last two weeks and who did not seek care outside of the home

9. 50% thought the illness would go away by itself; 34% reported that the transportation was too
expensive; and 29% reported that the health facilities were too far from their home. The three
commonest facility types from which people sought care were private clinic or hospital (40%),
BPHS clinic (28%), and EPHS Hospital (16%). The largest proportion (43%) of those over-five



                                                      59
sought care at a private clinic/hospital, while the most (34%) of the under-fives were taken to a
BPHS clinic.

Hospitalization in the past 12 months
10. Out of the 91,792 household members, about 2.2% reported having been hospitalized in the 12
months period prior to the survey. Out of the 2,008 household members that were hospitalized in
the 12 months prior to the survey, 56.5% was for medical illness, 24.8% for surgery, and 7.7% for
childhood illnesses. Overall, distribution between EPHS hospitals and private hospitals was fairly
equal (56.7% versus 43.3%, respectively).

Perception of community health workers
11. Of the 14,613 eligible women in the sample, nearly 80% were found to be unaware of
Community Health Workers or Health-Posts in their vicinity. This was consistent almost
throughout all age groups and wealth quintiles. Of the 8755 eligible women who fell sick in the last
two weeks and sought care, over three quarters (79.9%) were not aware of a CHW or Health-post in
their vicinity. Among women who were aware of CHWs or Health-posts in their vicinity over 80%
responded that they ‘Agreed’ or ‘Completely Agreed’ that CHWs provide useful services to the
community.

HEALTH EXPENDITURES

Out-of-pocket expenditures on health
12. Information was collected for each household member who sought care outside the home on
payments made for the care seeking episode. These payments include money spent on registration,
consultation, tests (including labs and x-rays), drugs and supplies, transportation, and food and
lodging. The median of the total amount spent per each care-seeking episode was 700 Afghanis.
Median amounts spent per care-seeking episode were fairly stable across the five wealth quintiles
with those in the poorest and wealthiest quintiles paying more than the other three groups. The
overall mean total expenditure was 3279 Afghanis. Mean expenditures appeared to be fairly
consistent across wealth quintiles for drugs and supplies, food, and transportation categories.

Out-of-pocket expenditures for hospitalization (last 12 months)
13. The median total expenditure spent on hospitalization was 5000 Afghanis. The median total
expenditure was highest for those in the poorest quintile, and decreased with increasing wealth
status. The mean total expenditure was 15,764 Afghanis. Respondents in the highest wealth quintile
also reported the highest mean total expenditure.

Distress financing on health
14. Distress financing is defined as households spending over and above their regular savings and
budget on health care. This includes borrowing money from friends and family, selling or
mortgaging household possessions and land. About 49% of those that were reported to have been
hospitalized in the last 12 months prior to the survey reported some form of distress financing.
Differences in proportions were found to be statistically significant when comparing the lowest
wealth quintile (66.0%) to three other wealth quintiles (second: 43.2%; middle: 39.0%; and highest:
39.6%).

Severe distress financing on health
15. Severe distress financing only included those who sold assets and not those who borrowed
money in order to pay for medical care. Of those who reported to have been hospitalized in the last
12 months prior to the survey, 14.6% reported some form of severe distress financing. The only



                                                60
statistically significant difference in proportions reporting severe distress financing occurred
between those in the lowest and highest quintiles of wealth status (22.5% versus 7.9%, respectively).

(Unedited original evaluation report submitted by the Borrower)

1. Introduction
Following the completion of the implementation of the SHARP project, a project completion report
needs to be submitted as a requirement to fulfill all the terms and conditions of the project. This is
the context within which this report is prepared as project completion report in its own right as well
as an input of implementing agency into the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) of the World
Bank.

2. Assessment of the SHARP project’s rationale, design and objective:
The Afghan health system has made considerable progress over the period 2003-2008, with sound
public health policies, innovative service delivery models and careful program monitoring and
evaluation, and donor funding support. Administrative data indicate that the number of
functioning primary health care facilities has increased from 496 in 2002 to 1,169 in 2007. The
health management information systems indicates a four-fold increase in the number of outpatient
visits from 0.23 visits per capita per year in 2004 to 0.94 in 2007. Comparing the results of
household surveys conducted between 2003 and 2006, there have been significant
improvements in the coverage of reproductive and child health services. At the outcome level, a
nation-wide survey conducted in late 2006 found an infant mortality rate of 129 per 1,000 live
births and an under five mortality rate of 191 per 1,000 live births, representing a 22% and 26%
decline, respectively, from the 2003 estimates.

Despite this progress, the under-five mortality rate in Afghanistan was still 67% higher than the
average for low income countries. Maternal mortality was the second highest in the world: with
a ratio of 1,600 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births, women’s survival remains a top
priority for the Afghan health sector. As the country is large, poorly linked and with a thinly
spread population, physical access remained an issue with more than 60% of the population living
more than one hour from a health facility.

To address these challenges, the government of Afghanistan developed the 2008-2013 Health
Nutrition Sector Strategy (HNSS). The HNSS represents a further step towards the
establishment of a comprehensive health policy, as it (a) defined the objectives for the sector; (b)
identified BPHS and EPHS as the priorities for service delivery; and (c) created a framework for
donor financing. The HNSS was an integral part of the Afghan National Development Strategy
(ANDS) and fits under the economic and social development pillar which includes improving
human development indicators and making significant progress towards the MDGs.

The SHARP project was designed to assist the MOPH of Afghanistan in the provision of health
services to the Afghan population with particular attention to basic health services for
women and children in underserved areas. The project was relevant to the country’s needs to
improve the quality of service delivery and strengthen the overall health system in disadvantaged
areas. The project was designed in line with the government’s 2009-2013 HNSS. The project
objective was to support the government in achieving the HNSS goal to “contribute to improving
the health and nutritional status of the people of Afghanistan, with a greater focus on women and
children and under-served areas of the country”. It was to be achieved through (a) financing of
provision of BPHS in selected provinces; (b) supporting the delivery of the Essential Package of
Hospital Services; (c) maintain the support to MOPH stewardship functions, particularly to
monitoring and evaluation; and (d) testing innovative results-based financing pilot schemes to
further increase utilization of services.



                                                 63
            The project was expected to improve the health status of the Afghan population by reducing
            morbidity and mortality, especially among children and women. It also contributes to the
            achievement of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), particularly of MDGs 4 and 5.
            With its focus on improving basic services for maternal and child health, control of communicable
            diseases, as well as maintaining the support to MOPH stewardship functions, the project directly
            supported Afghanistan’s efforts to attain the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).

            3. Project achievements and Implementation:

            3.1. Summary of achievements according to the project Results Framework Analysis
            Having implemented a wide range of activities, the SHARP project implementation has produced a
            number of significant outputs and outcomes. The results presented below reflect the Project’s
            achievements in meeting the objective of improving the health and nutrition status of the people of
            Afghanistan, with greater focus on women and children and under-served areas of the country.

               4.1. Component 1: Sustaining and strengthening the Basic Package of Health Services
                     (BPHS):
               This was the core component of the project, accounting for the bulk of financing and focused on the
               basic objective of expanding provision of basic health services. SHARP supported the delivery of
               BPHS services through the Performance-based Partnership Agreements (PPA) with
               nongovernmental organization (NGOs) and through the MOPH Strengthening Mechanism (MOPH-
               SM) approach. It supported the further expansion of basic health services, particularly through
               establishment of more sub health centers (SHC), training of additional Community Midwives
               (CMW).

The project has ensured continuity of BPHS implementation through performance-based
partnership agreement (PPAs) contracts in eight provinces with NGOs using a competitive selection
process. The NGOs were provided with a contract for the life of the project. The contracts were
managed by the grant and services contract management unit (GCMU) at central level and were
closely monitored by the provincial health directorates (PPHDs) at provincial level. , GCMU was
responsible for prompt payments to the NGOs based on satisfactory progress.

Despite worsening the security condition the provision and access of services has been enhanced
through 370 health facilities including establishing 40 new health facilities, mostly sub-health
centers. This is being supplemented by community based health care through 2,709 Community
Health Workers (CHWs). To address shortage of female staff, the project has financed the
community midwifery education program in eight provinces. Totally 300 community midwives
have been trained during this project. All facilities were functional with regular supply of medicines
and submitting Health Management Information System (HMIS) reports on monthly and quarterly
basis. The implementing partners submitted the quarterly technical and financial reports to the
relevant departments of MOPH. Provincial Public Health Coordination Meetings (PPHCC) have
been held on a regular basis at provincial public health directorates of provinces. In addition to the
Third Party annual evaluation, regular monitoring and supervision has been carried out at the health
facility level by implementing agencies and MoPH officials at provincial and central level.

BPHS implementation has also made good progress in provision and expansion of health services
to rural areas with total of 123 functional health facilities through MOPH-SM in three provinces.
Health outreach activities have been strengthened through establishment of 90 Integrated Maternal
and Child Health and Nutrition (IMCHN) sites since 2009. Training of CHWs continued and the
number of health posts increased gradually from 451 to 581 to enhance health education and
awareness for communities and referral system. Through the Community Health Nursing Education
(CHNE) program 60 female nurses have been graduated. In addition, 90 community midwives have
been graduated from Community Midwifery Education programs.

The project supported delivery of BPHS in the urban area of Kabul province. However, there have
been some delays in implementation of BPHS in the urban area which have been primarily due to
problems emerging during design of modules for urban settings and implementation mechanisms.
The implementation was undertaken in collaboration with Kabul Provincial Health Directorate
(KPHD) and MOPH-SM. The project co-financed the delivery of health services in 44 health
facilities through the supply of medicine, training of health facility staff, procurement of medical
equipment and ambulances and provision of technical assistance to Kabul PPHD. The key activities
such as rationalization and readjustment of health facilities in terms of services, staffing and
equipment in accordance to delivery module, and relocation of health facilities have been done.

This component also supported the Polio Eradication Initiative. Afghanistan made good progress in
reducing transmission of new polio cases as compared to 2009. As part of the polio eradication
program, the project contributed to the procurement of OPV to address the financial gaps for
implementation of supplementary immunization activities during the polio outbreak in the country.

4.2. Component 2: Strengthening the delivery of the Essential Package of Hospital Services
      (EPHS)
As part of SHARP project, the implementation of EPHS was initiated in three MOPH-SM
provinces and later on in 3 PPA provinces (Wardak, Nimroz and Farah) through amendment of the
original BPHS contracts. . The scope of intervention included upgrading and expanding the level of
service delivery to improve access, utilization and quality of hospital services. This intervention


                                                 66
also focused on strengthening functionality and implementation of the EPHS package, improving
quality of services in terms of provision of additional beds, staff, equipment, pharmaceuticals,
diagnostic services, improving management and motivation of human resources in targeted
provinces.

EPHS delivery in both PPA and SM provinces has made key progress since its implementation. In
PPA provinces, the three restructured hospitals continued to operate satisfactory and were providing
quality healthcare. The EPHS implementation in two years period enabled the hospitals to
overcome resource shortages and allowed implementing NGOs to utilize the resources under the
contracted out mechanism (PPAs) to complete the innovative and important work.

The implementation of the EPHS in three MOPH-SM provinces also made progress in three district
hospitals. The number of active beds has been increased, equipment’s procured, drug supply has
been strengthened , services standards have been introduced and additional technical staff hired.
The baseline for key performance indicators has been identified and targets set to monitor the
hospital performance.

The EPHS implementation has produced a significant result as summarized in the tables below.

The project also supported an evaluation of the impact and lessons from several alternative
approaches that have been adopted for supporting EPHS implementation in the past years: the
MOPH’s Hospital Reform Project and contracting NGO to manage EPHS in selected provinces
(supported by USAID and EU). The result of this evaluation provided valuable findings and
recommendations that would have major contribution in future expansion of the EPHS.

4.3. Component 3: Strengthening MOPH stewardship functions:

This component supported management and public health functions of MOPH including: (a)
support for Provincial Health Offices (PHO) functions through semi-annual National Health
Coordination Workshops, improvement of communication between provincial and central MOPH
through computerizing the PHOs and ensuring internet connection and supporting regular
Provincial Health Coordination Meetings; (b)     strengthening information, education and
communication (IEC)/behavioral change communication (BCC) activities; (c) TA for the MOPH,


                                                67
and (d) monitoring and evaluation to strengthen evidence-based decision making in the health
sector. Overall the component has made significant contribution to strengthening the MOPH
stewardship functions by supporting the provision of critical staff in different areas (about 79
technical staff). This further improved the management and technical capacity of the Ministry and
facilitated development of various policy and strategy documents. At provincial level, Provincial
Health Offices have been strengthened through computerization and reactivation of provincial
health coordination meetings. This component contributed to the organization of semi-annual
national health coordination workshops. Capacity of staff at central and provincial levels has been
enhanced through participation in training activities as well as relevant national and international
conferences and workshops. During the project life, GCMU has taken measures to improve the
performance of the BPHS implementers. Those measures included; conducting performance review
workshops (PRW), issuing notifications and warnings to poorly performing NGOs and termination
of one subcontract. Performances review workshops have been conducted for PPA provinces at
MoPH to review and discuss the performance of BPHS implementation in PPA provinces in the
light of findings from various sources such as health facility assessment, technical quarterly reports,
monitoring missions, and HMIS analysis. Holding the PRW leaded to developing of action plans to
improve the BPHS delivery in project areas. This component also supported monitoring and
evaluation of BPHS and EPHS through the contracting of The Third Party evaluator to conduct
health facility assessments and household surveys. During the project, three rounds of health
facility assessments for BPHS and EPHS, and one round of household survey have been carried out.
The results of BPHS and EPHS health facility assessment have been produced in form of Balanced-
Scorecards (BSC). Since the health sector had evolved since 2004, and there were new priorities,
actors, information needs, and circumstances to take into account. Therefore to meet the evolving
needs of the MOPH and its partners, BPHS and EPHS BSC has been revised. Over the last five
years, the BSC has proved to be very useful tool for monitoring and managing the delivery
of the Basic Package of Health Services.
In addition, to ensure effective contract management, the monitoring team of GCMU/MoPH carried
out regular monitoring visits from intervention areas of the project. The monitoring findings were
shared with related BPHS implementing NGOs and relevant PPHD. Action plans were developed
and progress of the action plans was followed up accordingly. Despite progress on monitoring visits,
some provinces have been monitored only a few times due to declining the security.

To maintain and strengthen coordination among stakeholders, regular BPHS/EPHS coordination
workshops were conducted. The BPHS/EPHS workshops have been organized on quarterly basis.
In each workshop the BPHS project managers and other stockholders from provinces and
headquarters, donors and representatives of technical department of the MOPH were participated.

4.4.     Component 4: Piloting Innovations:
One of the possible means to improve performance of the health system is to motivate front-line
health workers by providing them with performance payments above their salaries that are linked
directly to the amount and quality of the services they provide. This method of linking health
outputs to payments is called Results-Based Financing (RBF). This direct link between payment
and results is expected to lead to improved health system performance at modest cost. The Ministry
of Public Health implemented an RBF intervention with the support of the SHARP project. The
general objective of the RBF intervention was to improve millennium development goals (MDG) 4
(to reduce child mortality) and MDG 5 (to reduce maternal mortality) by implementing
interventions that provide performance payments for health workers in order to: i) Increase key
maternal and child health outputs, ii) Further improve the quality of health care services, iii) Ensure
that patients and communities are increasingly involved and satisfied with the publicly financed
health services they receive. An impact evaluation has been conducted through a qualified research
organization to assess and document the effects of the pilots.


                                                  68
Following single source contract with BPHS and EPHS implementing NGOs, the RBF piloted in 11
provinces. The NGOs have been provided with a contract amendment in line with their BPHS and
EPHS contracts. The contracts have been managed by the Health Economic and Financing
directorate of the MOPH in closed collaboration with GCMU. Randomly out of 393 health facilities
209 health facilities selected as an intervention arm and 184 health facilities under control arm ..
The verification and evaluation of RBF component was also carried out by The Third Party, Johns
Hopkins University. Regular quarterly verification of the HMIS data reported to MOPH by NGOs
has been carried out by JHU. Baseline and mid round household surveys in the catchment areas
were done.

The pilot has also been implemented through contracting in (MOPH strengthening mechanism) in
three provinces (Panjshir, and Parwan and only Kapisa provincial hospital). Randomly out of 80
health facilities 43 health facilities were selected as a treatment and 37 under control. To provide
technical support to implementing NGO and ensure effective and timely project implementation,
RBF team conducted regular field visits to intervention areas of the project. For better coordination
with implementers and understanding from ground level of RBF implementation regular meetings
were organized on quarterly basis. The meetings focused on achievements, challenges, lessons
learned and recommendations for future successful implementation. The initial results of the RBF
pilot are very promising and show increasing coverage and improvement of quality of key maternal
and child health services. Payment installments under this project were not made on a lump sum
basis, but rather on a performance basis..

5. Lessons Learned and Recommendation:
1. While BPHS implementation was generally successful, some targets remained underachieved:
   only 40% DPT3 coverage was achieved, against the target of 60%; around 19% of
   Contraceptive Prevalence Rate (target 20%) was achieved and only 1% point improvement on
   score of quality of care. Several factors contributed to this, such as extremely difficult security
   conditions that limited the access of community and target beneficiaries to the health services
   and inability of implementing NGOs in the use of flexibility room in the execution of contract
   due to auditors and other judiciary entities observations. Even though the focus of contract
   management was on outputs in terms of improved service delivery, payments were not
   completely linked to such outputs. This factor posed significant challenges that should be
   considered, and strategies addressing this need to be developed in future projects to ensure that
   terms and conditions of performance based contracts are met. The structure of contracts with
   focus on both the results and inputs would be a crucial factor for the performance and
   accountability of the NGOs.

2. A poor culture of data use and focus on results; many shortcomings have been noticed in terms
   of quality of data and its usage by NGOs and PPHDs, for decision making. Low capacity to
   provide regular feedback and carry out quality check of data by management levels of
   implementing partners. Major mistakes were observed following review of quarterly reports
   submitted by NGOs. It indicated that the data had not been reviewed by senior managers of
   implementing NGOs. In addition, inconsistency and inaccuracy of data has also identified
   through JHU data verification assessments carried out for RBF. Unclear BPHS coverage
   population figures in the provinces which leads to confusion for target setting; it caused
   difficulties to track the coverage of services through routine data captured through HMIS.
   RBF’s Third Party verification of results is a powerful tool to improve performance and



                                                 69
    accountability in the health sector and should be mainstreamed under structure of PPA contract
    of NGOs in the future.

3. Unavailability of proper space and infrastructures for health facilities caused the project to
   establish and maintain health centers in privately-owned, rented buildings which could affect
   the quality of care and patient perceptions. Additional funds should be allocated for building of
   health facilities infrastructure in designing of projects in future.

4. Influence of local politicians and local government officials including parliamentarian for
   establishment and upgrading of health facilities, hiring of health workers, subjective complaint
   for performance of NGOs were hindrance factors in reducing the technical efficacy of the
   health service delivery.

5. The shortage of professional staff particularly female due to increased insecurity conditions was
   remarkable while the training of community midwife was considered a key contributing factor
   in operationalizing the use of maternal and child health services by the project. A similar
   approach needs to be considered in order to strengthen the country public health workforce in
   the future projects.

6. Association and partnership negatively affected the performance due to internal conflict
   between parties; partnership reduces the positive competition toward the improvement of health
   services and project implementation. Under such circumstances, contract should explore
   particular requirement to prevent such negative consequences during the delivery of services.

7. Similar to the Bank’s previous financed project, delays in payment of installments to NGOs
   continued due to lengthy payment procedures within the MoPH, the World Bank and MoF.
   There is need to review the lengthy payment procedure in the MoPH and WB to make it shorter,
   as much as possible.

8. Challenges were encountered in the contract execution for the third party monitoring &
   evaluation due to limited experience in the designing of contract structure at early stage by the
   World Bank and MoPH. One round of health facility assessment of both BPHS / EPHS and
   household survey was not carried out by third party as per work schedule. In order to ensure
   successful contract execution, considerable focus should be paid on structure of similar
   complex and multi assignments contract with exploring of particular requirements.

9. Timely procurement of NGOs, contingency and appropriate transition plans are key factors in
   successful implementation and performance. These procurements are complex and have
   entailed a lengthy procurement process, particularly in the post conflict countries with lengthy
   administrative structures. Challenges were also noted with regards to the procurement of the
   NGOs under SHARP project. The time taken for contracting varied across provinces but in two
   provinces the procurement process took more than 18 months.

10. The NGO contracts included in-service training of health workers as part of the program to
    improve delivery of the BPHS. Health facility assessment data on "Staff Received Training"
    indicated that assigning responsibility to the NGOs for necessary in-service training of health
    worker did not make significant progress.
