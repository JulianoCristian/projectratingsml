{"cdata!": "Ratings for the Strengthening Health\n            Activities for the Rural Poor Project for Afghanistan were\n            as follows: outcomes were satisfactory, risk to development\n            outcome was moderate, Bank performance was satisfactory, and\n            Borrower performance was moderately satisfactory. Some\n            lessons learned included: public-private partnerships can be\n            an effective mechanism for scaling up service delivery.\n            Output-based lump-sum contracts, if supported by strong\n            performance management, in general can be an appropriate\n            tool for engaging non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in\n            service provision. An important lesson for the Bank was\n            drawn with regard to the procurement arrangements for\n            contracting the service provider NGOs. Performance-based\n            financing is a potentially effective mechanism to\n            incentivize performance, and therefore NGO contracts should\n            take advantage of it to a greater extent. Strong monitoring\n            and evaluation is critical for achieving results. Strong\n            institutional capacity is a key for sustainability."}, "docdt": "2014-02-21T00:00:00Z"}
