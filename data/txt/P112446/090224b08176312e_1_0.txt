                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Overall project performance and progress toward the project development objectives (PDO) is rated as satisfactory, with the PDO level indicators estimated to be well on target.
                         Implementation performance is rated as moderately satisfactory. The service delivery performance of implementing partners and Ministry of Public Health-Strengthening Mechanism
                         (MOPH-SM) provinces show improvements in most of the service delivery indicators in the majority of provinces, although in some provinces, a few indicators show negative trends.

                         The program implementation continues to be closely monitored with continuing dialog between MOPH and implementing partners. The implementation of Essential Package of
                         Hospital Services (EPHS) is making satisfactory progress. There are three critical areas for the MOPH which need attention: a) address slow progress in improving immunization
                         coverage; b) complete contracts amendments with implementing partners to initiate implementation of revised BPHS including interventions related to Mental Health and Nutrition;
                         and c) speed up implementation of urban BPHS.
