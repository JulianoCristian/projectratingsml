                         review of the project indicates that the overall access and coverage to basic services has increased with almost 85 percent of the population now living in districts which now have

                         coverage of antenatal care has declined.

                         Implementation performance since the MTR is now rated satisfactory. Service delivery performance of implementing partner NGOs and SM provinces had declined in terms of

                         quality of care and coverage of services. However, as a result of actions taken, service delivery performance of PPA NGOs and SM provinces is showing reversing trends and
                         improvements in key performance indicators except for antenatal care and contraceptive use. The improvement has been a result of a detailed review of performance by the Ministry
                         of Public Health and Grant and Contract Management Unit with implementing partners (Non-Government Organizations, Ministry of Public Health-Strengthening Mechanism Unit and
                         Provincial Health Directors). The resulting province specific action plans are being implemented with enhanced monitoring. Continuing dialogue between MOPH and implementing
                         partners is stimulating the improving trends in performance. In addition, after initial delays, implementation of EPHS in PPA and SM provinces and Urban BPHS are have started to
                         make good progress. However, slow progress is being made in integrating Mental Health and Nutrition in the revised BPHS.

                         The 2012 Health Sector Strategic Planning Retreat was organized by the MOPH in January 2012 which has defined and laid out priorities for implementation of the Ministry's
                         Strategic Plan (2011-2015). The team has initiated dialogue with the Ministry and European Union for the next phase of support for the health sector to be approved in 2013.
