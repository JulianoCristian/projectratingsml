Lessons reinforce the notion that\n            institutional reform is a long-term, and difficult process,\n            that requires difficult policy decisions. In this case,\n            reforms meant that the Ministry of Rural Development was to\n            reduce its control over the Institute of Rural Economy\n            (IER), and the National Agricultural Research Council\n            (CNRA), while ownership of vast plots of productive land\n            would be transferred from the Ministry of Finance to IER -\n            in a country where land pressures are increasing - and,\n            various ministries would loose control on IER as a large\n            employer. In such an environment, time to implement\n            institutional changes needs to be carefully evaluated;\n            regrettably, the project was overly optimistic, and,\n            covenants and conditions of disbursements, are not efficient\n            mechanisms to prod profound changes. Instead, a detailed\n            road map, stipulating precise steps, and expected results\n            should have been in place, to ease complex supervision.\n            Moreover, regardless of the appropriately selected project\n            indicators, these were never used to monitor progress, and\n            impacts; neither was the farm level impact of new\n            technologies followed, to prioritize research efforts, thus\n            resulting in a technology, based on proxy indicators, with\n            little knowledge of the actual constraints of such\n            technologies. This highlights the fact that a demand-driven\n            national system for technology generation, transfer, and\n            training, needs to unite all interested parties, taking into\n            account related activities, and strengthening producer\n            organizations, nongovernmental organizations, and private\n            sector service providers."}, "docdt": "2002-06-28T00:00:00Z"}
