     1.        Program Context, Development Objectives and Design

     1.1       Context at Appraisal

     Mongolia was one of the East Asian economies hardest hit by the global downturn. The
     global crisis was transmitted to Mongolia through the channel of mineral prices, especially copper,
     which collapsed during the second half of 2008. Mongolia's budget relied heavily on mining
     revenues (30 percent of revenues in 2008) and, with the Central Bank pursuing a de facto peg of
     the local currency to the dollar, there was a direct transmission of the falling international copper
     price to revenue losses. While the government did save part of its mining windfall during the
     "boom" years, it had also funded large increases in untargeted social expenditures, wages and
     salaries, and poorly-screened investment projects. When the "boom" turned into "bust", the
     modest fiscal surplus quickly turned into a large deficit (see Table 1) which the fiscal savings of
     the previous years proved insufficient to fund. At the same time, the current account also swung
     into a large deficit, and the financial sector, which had been overheating during the boom period,
     ran into serious problems, with a major bank having to be put under conservatorship. As a result
     of the crisis, at the time of preparation of the DPC Mongolia faced a major slowdown in expected
     growth to an estimated 2.7 percent in 2009 from 8.9 percent in 2008 (Table 1).

     Faced with major budget and balance of payments deficits, the government requested the
     assistance of the IMF, the ADB and the World Bank in October of 2008. In parallel, the
     government also requested financial support from several of its neighbors in exchange for long-
     term mining export contracts. However, in late 2008, the crisis deepened--with the most visible
     sign being a fast depreciating currency. Then, by early 2009, as it became increasingly clear to
     the authorities that the solution lay in agreeing to a program supported by the international
     financial institutions (IFIs), rather than in mortgaging future mining revenues through bilateral
     contracts, the government's resolve to take the required policy actions strengthened. As a result,
     the policy dialogue with the IFIs increasingly gained momentum, and in February a development
     partners' meeting was convened by the Ministry of Finance and the World Bank to secure
     commitments for budget support based on a possible IMF program.

     The firm commitments of the ADB, Japan and the World Bank made at the donor
     conference to fill the fiscal financing gap for 2009 and 2010 paved the way for the IMF to go
     to its Board on April 1 2009, resulting in the approval of an 18-month Stand-By
     Arrangement (SBA) of US$229 million to provide balance of payments support. The
     exceptional access under the program, at 300 percent of quota, reflected the significant impact of



                                                               1
the external shock and strong policy actions taken by the government, in particular relating to
fiscal adjustment, monetary and exchange rate policy, and on measures to address confidence in
the banking sector.

As part of the donor agreement, the Bank pledged financing for two single-tranche DPC
operations (US$40 million and US$20 million for 2009 and 2010, respectively) to help fill an
estimated fiscal financing gap of US$151 million for 2009 and US$67 million in 2010. The
rationale for the Bank's DPCs derived from this joint commitment by Mongolia's development
partners to support a strong policy package which would manage the downturn of the economy
and set the stage for recovery. The policies included a set of fiscal, monetary, exchange rate and
financial sector measures (as supported by the IMF and the World Bank) and social welfare
reforms supported by Japan, ADB and the World Bank, along with improvements in mining
sector policy (supported by the World Bank). In the absence of this budget support package, the
fiscal adjustment to the crisis would have had to be even more severe since the scope for
alternative non-concessional external financing was limited. Such financing could potentially
have led to adverse implications for debt servicing obligations and debt sustainability. The World
Bank's single tranche approach was adopted given the considerable economic and political
uncertainties at the time of the operation, including the absence of a medium-term policy
framework. The operation was processed under the International Development Association (IDA)
Financial Crisis Response Fast-Track Facility (FTF) to help the government meet these urgent
financing needs, expediting the operational process.

In parallel, the Bank also adjusted its Country Assistance Strategy. The Bank deferred the
approval of a nearly completed new Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) and instead adopted an
18-month interim strategy. The two DPCs provided the cornerstone of this strategy which shifted
funds from investment projects to these budget support operations (which account for around
two-third of the envisaged SDR 60 million notional IDA envelope for FY 2010 and FY 2011).
Furthermore, several ongoing TA operations were reoriented so as to best support the DPC policy
areas. Under the second Private Sector Development Credit (PSDC2) US$1 million was
reallocated to enable the Bank of Mongolia (BoM) to conduct audits by internationally reputable
auditors and for crisis-related advisory services. In addition, US$1.3 million was reallocated
under the Economic Capacity Technical assistance credit project to support the Ministry of
Finance (MoF) with the fiscal reforms to be implemented under the IMF Stand-By Arrangement
and the DPC and for technical assistance to strengthen public investment planning.

1.2        Original Program Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

The DPC was designed to support the government's policy agenda in four key areas (see the
original policy matrix in Annex A):

      i)   Fiscal Policy - Improve capital budget planning and execution, and protect the
           maintenance of basic infrastructure. The first prior action was to reduce the number of
           projects without feasibility studies in the March 2009 revision of the 2009 budget by 30
           projects (valued at MNT 19.8 billion). This expenditure reduction was equivalent to
           roughly 10 percent of the fiscal expenditures adjustment required to contain the deficit at
           5.8 percent of GDP for 2009. This adjustment was relative to the original budget, which
           specified a 6.1 percent of GDP deficit but, if not amended, could have resulted in a deficit
           of around 12 percent of GDP due to the decline in revenues. It was hoped that projects
           without feasibility studies would then also be removed (without conditionality) in the
           preparations for the 2010 budget. The second outcome indicator, on maintenance, was for
           the 2009 budget outturn expenditures on repairs and maintenance of basic infrastructure


                                                    2
    to be kept at the level of MNT 12.4 billion in line with the prior action on the budgeted
    amount. The expectation was that the 2010 budget would further strengthen the
    protection of maintenance expenditures.

ii) Social Protection - Protect the poor during the downturn by retargeting social policies
    toward the poor. The prior action was that, as a first step, the Ministry of Social Welfare
    and Labor (MSWL) prepare a time-bound plan to clean up the roster of beneficiaries of
    the CMP. This aimed to initiate the process of moving from untargeted, universal social
    transfers to a system which is targeted toward the poor. The targeting would be based on
    a methodology using proxy-means testing (PMT). This new system required major legal
    reforms and the development of new implementation systems, including the
    establishment of new household databases, based on the PMT methodology. With respect
    to the specified outcome indicator, the goal was for the government to have implemented
    at least 75 percent of the surveys to collect household-level data for a national beneficiary
    database, based on the PMT formula. While no fixed deadline was specified in the
    Program Document, it was envisioned that the government would achieve this outcome
    by the end of the first year following the DPC's approval by the World Bank Board.

iii) Financial Sector - Strengthening confidence in the financial sector. In conjunction
     with the financial sector measures in the IMF SBA, the expected DPC outcomes aimed to
     strengthen confidence in banks and in the regulatory and supervisory structure. The first
     prior action was the preparation of an action plan to deal with the Anod Bank, which was
     under conservatorship with the Bank of Mongolia, based on an audit by international
     auditors. The expected outcome was that this restructuring/resolution plan be
     implemented. The second prior action was to improve immediately the daily monitoring
     of banks' liquidity and asset quality. The third was to establish a crisis management and
     systemic risk monitoring task force with requisite legal and regulatory powers with the
     expectation that this task force would provide the BoM, FSC and other relevant agencies
     with regular reports and initiate quick and decisive action in case of possible bank
     failures. It was anticipated that the successful and speedy resolution of Anod Bank,
     together with more intense supervision and increased preparedness, including a
     contingency planning framework for resolution of failed banks, would restore confidence
     in the banking system. The aim looking forward was for these measures to help prevent
     any future systemic bank failures and to resolve any bank failures in a quick and decisive
     manner.

iv) Mining Sector - Clarifying the mining policy framework. Under the first mining prior
    action, the DPC supported the clarification of existing mining policies, in particular with
    respect to taxation and state ownership, by using the experience gained during the then
    on-going negotiations of a major mining investment project (Oyu Tolgoi) to develop and
    adopt new model investment agreements. Instability in the policy framework was a major
    issue at the time of the design of the DPC. The outcome indicator was that subsequent
    future investments would then utilize the new model investment agreements developed
    and adopted by the Ministry of Mineral Resources and Energy. Other expected outcome
    indicators concerned further improvements to existing mining policies including the
    adoption and implementation of new Cadastre regulations and the following, and
    monitoring, of responsible mining practices through enhanced regulatory capacity. Under
    the second prior action, budget funding would be provided to undertake an independent
    evaluation of Mongolia's Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) program
    with the expectation that Mongolia would be able to meet the March 31, 2010, deadline
    for EITI validation.

1.3    Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
Reasons/Justification

The PDO or key indicators were not revised during implementation.

1.4     Original Policy Areas Supported by the Program (as approved)

This DPC supported reforms in the policy areas most affected by the economic downturn:
(i) fiscal policy and management, given the budget's strong dependence on mining revenues; (ii)
social protection, due to the impact of the economic downturn on the poor; (iii) the financial
sector, which was overheating when the global crisis hit, and which experienced a major bank
failure in late 2008; and (iv) the mining sector, because of the sector's importance in driving the
recovery.

Although the DPC was a crisis-response operation, with the time frame limiting the range of
feasible prior actions, it was anticipated that these prior actions would lay the groundwork
for a better medium-term policy framework in the four policy areas (see Section 3.1). On
fiscal policy, measures to improve fiscal management and planning should also be seen in the
context of moves towards an improved budgeting process, including a more demanding public
investment planning and budgeting process, but also management of mining revenues in a more
efficient and counter-cyclical manner. On social protection, the plan to "clean" the existing roster
of social security beneficiaries was envisioned as part of a broader social welfare reform focused
on consolidating and targeting social transfers, to ensure better protection of the poor and fiscal
sustainability of the system. On the banking sector, the prior actions were, along with
complementary measures supported by the IMF program, steps towards the medium-term
objectives of an improved framework for banking sector resolution and enhanced supervisory
arrangements. Finally, on mining, it was hoped that the model investment agreements would be a
catalyst for key legal and policy reforms to bring stability to the investment environment, helping
to attract more mining investments. Similarly, ensuring the funding of the EITI validation by an
external expert should lead to Mongolia completing the EITI compliancy process and achieving
improved transparency.

 List of conditions from Program Document                                               Status
 Capital budget planning and screening is improved, as demonstrated by the             Fulfilled
 exclusion of 30 projects without feasibility studies from the 2009 budget, as
 amended in March.
 Capital expenditures for the maintenance of basic infrastructure in the transport,    Fulfilled
 education and health sectors is protected, as evidenced by: (i) the increase in the
 ratio of capital repairs to new investments from 2.5 percent (in the original
 approved budget for 2009) to 3.4 percent (in the amended budget for 2009); and
 (ii) the allocation of MNT 12.4 billion for that purpose.
 The Ministry of Social Welfare and Labor has prepared a time-bound action plan        Fulfilled
 to clean its roster of beneficiaries of the Child Money Program, in order to
 reduce leakage to the non-poor and improve its targeting on the poor.
 The BoM has prepared an action plan for the restructuring/resolving of the Bank       Fulfilled
 currently under the conservatorship, on the basis of the Bank's portfolio
 diagnostic and audit carried out by an internationally reputable auditor.
 The BoM has issued a decree requiring that all banks report on a daily basis on       Fulfilled
 key indicators regarding their liquidity and asset quality.
 The BoM has established a crisis management and systemic risk monitoring task         Fulfilled
 force with adequate functions and powers, qualified staff and sufficient
 resources to carry out its mandate.
 The Ministry of Mineral Resources and Energy has developed and adopted                Fulfilled
 model investment agreements for the mining sector, clarifying Mongolia's
 mining policy, including taxation and the state's capital participation in new
 ventures, and incorporating responsible mining practices consistent with the
 Equator Principles.
 Sufficient resources have been transferred to the Mongolia EITI Secretariat in        Fulfilled
 order to finance an independent validation of its national EITI Program,
 scheduled to be completed by March 31, 2010.

2.2     Major Factors Affecting Implementation:

The operation was strongly selective. It focused on the priority policy areas in which the Bank
had comparative advantage (as demonstrated by past and on-going ESW and lending operations)
and included only 8 prior actions (compared with an average of around 10 prior actions or tranche
release conditions for IDA DPCs in FY 2007). The individual elements of the policy matrix were
identified from, and supported by, previous analytical work, lending operations and technical
assistance work. For example, in the banking sector this included results from a recent FSAP and
diagnostic work commissioned in late 2008. Existing technical assistance operations in the fiscal
sector were restructured to support the policy measures in the matrix. Of the four main policy
areas the capacity to provide this support was most limited in the social protection area as there
was no operation available to provide TA immediately, although there was earlier analytical work
on the main issues (used in the operational work of the ADB).

The design and implementation of the DPC recognized the parallel, and coordinated,
programs of other development partners. This was the case both in terms of the respective
policy matrices and in the supporting analytical and technical assistance. The IMF took the lead
on overall fiscal issues, including the fiscal deficit target. The Bank actions on investment
projects and maintenance focused on improving the efficiency of expenditures within this limit.
In the banking sector, the IMF program and DPC policy actions were tightly interlinked. For
example, the IMF prior actions for a revision and clarification of the blanket deposit guarantee
and for the appointment of a reputable external auditor to assess the failed Anod Bank were



                                                     5
supplemented by the DPC prior action to prepare a resolution/restructuring action plan based on a
completed such audit. In social protection, the IMF required the passage of new social welfare
reform legislation by Parliament, whereas the ADB conditionality focused on the adoption of a
plan to reform the social welfare system (1st tranche) and for this plan to be reflected in the 2010
budget (2nd tranche). The Bank's prior action focused on the preparatory work needed to establish
the PMT methodology and database on which the new targeted system would be based.

The government was committed in pushing forward the reform agenda in the relevant
sectors and was fully engaged with the operation. During the preparation of the operation
Mongolia was at an extremely unstable stage in terms of its macroeconomic environment due to
the global financial crisis and economic slowdown. Without the financing assistance provided by
the IFIs, Mongolia's economic situation would have deteriorated further. The urgency of the
situation led not only to the strong partnership among donor partners but also to more effective
and efficient interactions with the government agencies.

The policy actions which needed to be taken implied a major effort to correct for past policy
mistakes and re-orient economic strategy on a more sustainable path. Hence, this effort
needed to be built on strong bi-partisan political support, both within the coalition government, as
well as in Parliament. Consequently, intensive efforts at consensus-building between these key
stakeholders characterized the design of the support package of the IFIs. Moreover, the Bank's
Quarterly, and then, from April 2009, Monthly, Economic Updates provided an important role in
dissemination of the rationale for, and progress on, reform measures along with updates on the
impact of the crisis on the macroeconomic, financial and corporate sectors. These updates were
disseminated widely and received strong local press coverage. In addition, the annual Economic
Policy Conferences jointly organized by the World Bank and the government proved important
for a further discussion of the policy challenges amongst a wide audience including the media,
civil society, domestic policy makers, and donors.

The single-tranche operation was processed under the IDA FTF in parallel with the rapid
preparation of IMF support for the country. This expedited the DPC process by shortening the
internal approval steps. As a result, management approval was obtained to combine the Concept
Note Review meeting and the Decision Meeting into one and then to proceed straight to
Negotiations. This was processed in approximately 24 business days ­ compared to 50-60
business days through the regular process. It then moved from Board Submission to Approval in
approximately 10 business days ­ compared to about 18 business days through the regular
process ­ with funds being disbursed on July 23, 2009.

Four risks to implementation were identified in the DPC PD. The first, a further adverse
external mineral price shock, has not materialized to date, with prices continuing their 2009
revival. The risk of additional bank failures in the financial sector has been realized (and is
discussed in Section 3.2, including the mitigation performance of the policy measures supported
by the DPC). The third identified risk was the potential for political developments or improved
mineral prices to derail support for the reforms. The outreach operations of the Bank and other
IFIs mentioned above appeared to have played a role in mitigating this risk to date. The final,
moderate, risk that was highlighted was that the government might agree sub-optimal mineral
export contracts or other non-concessional financing which could affect fiscal sustainability. IFI
and bilateral fiscal financing support has helped reduce the need for such financing and the IMF
program's performance criteria placed a ceiling on new non-concessional medium- and long-term
external debt. So far the government has stayed within the agreed US$200 million limit.




                                                 6
2.3     Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization:

The monitoring and evaluation framework involved the dialogue of the Bank with the
government, along with development partners, combined with ongoing monitoring of data
indicators of performance. The increase in the frequency of the Economic Updates from
quarterly to monthly from April 2009 was useful in allowing policymakers and the public to
follow the crisis in more depth and enhanced awareness of the country's macroeconomic
environment.

The macro and fiscal data provided by the authorities is relatively wide-ranging and timely,
and allows for monthly monitoring of key macro and fiscal variables. However, it is difficult
to measure the social and economic impacts of the downturn and the policy reforms,
because there is a lack of timely household- and community-level data. This is crucial, for
instance, to assess progress in the social protection policy area, along with the potential impact of
the fiscal response to the crisis on household income levels. However, as a timely proxy measure
the Bank undertook surveys in April and September 2009 on the unskilled wage rate in informal
labor markets in Ulaanbaatar. The surveys allowed the Bank to demonstrate the highly negative
shock to the incomes of this category of poor workers at the height of the crisis, but also to
document the subsequent turnaround.

2.4     Expected Next Phase/Follow-up Operation (if any):

As envisaged at the time of the DPC operation, a follow-up budget support operation is
currently under preparation. In late February 2010 the DPC2 operation received authorization
to move to appraisal and negotiations. The operation has a planned Board date in Q4 of FY10, as
envisaged during the negotiations that led to the Stand-By Arrangement. The key focus of the
operation is to continue and deepen the reforms in the policy areas of the first DPC: Fiscal,
banking, social protection, and mining. At the time of the writing of this ICR, these are not
different than the ones envisaged in the first DPC. At the same time, there has been a
considerable effort to mobilize appropriate technical assistance and support for the authorities to
implement their crisis response and medium-term reform agenda. For example, in parallel to the
DPC2 operation, an IDA-financed Multi-Sectoral Technical Assistance Project of US$15 million
is under preparation covering fiscal policy, social protection and banking.

3.      Assessment of Outcomes

3.1      Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation (to current country and global
priorities, and Bank assistance strategy)

Rating: Highly Satisfactory

The Highly Satisfactory rating reflects an assessment that the objectives, design and
implementation of the operation were highly relevant to Mongolia's near- and medium-
term priorities, and that the operation formed an integral component of the Bank's
assistance strategy to the country. At the time of the operation the Mongolian government was
facing a sizeable fiscal financing gap. In the absence of donor support, and in the face of
declining revenues and, as discussed in the PD, adverse financing conditions for an external bond,
filling this gap would have most likely required additional fiscal spending cuts, substantial
domestic financing which would have crowded out the private sector, or external financing at
unattractive terms. IFIs had financed around half of the cumulative general budget deficit in the


                                                 7
year to September 2009 (around MNT 164.2 billion out of MNT 332.5 billion) with the World
Bank DPC providing around MNT 57 billion of budget support. As detailed above, the prior
actions were also designed to promote medium-term reforms to enhance the economic recovery.

The DPC operation and the proposed follow-up DPC2 are key pillars of the interim strategy
note setting out the Bank's engagement in Mongolia in the near-term. Shifting resources
towards these budget support operations entailed a trade-off between the desire to support the
policy reforms needed to contain the crisis and create a better medium-term policy framework, on
the one hand, and project-based investments, on the other. The two proposed DPC operations
represent around two-thirds of the notional IDA envelope for 2009-2010.

3.2     Achievement of Program Development Objectives (including brief discussion of causal
linkages between policy actions supported by operations and outcomes)

Overall achievement of PDOs

Rating: Satisfactory

The rating of Satisfactory for the overall achievement of PDOs is based on an equal
weighting of the ratings across the four policy areas of the program.1 Progress in terms of
outcomes to date has been relatively limited in the banking sector, and social protection, as
opposed to earlier progress on the outcomes in the fiscal area and the mining sector. These
assessments are subject to the caveat of the limited time frame between Board approval of the
operation in June 2009 and the ICR assessment (conducted during October and November 2009).
Indeed, even in the area of social protection important advances have been made in the overall
design of the reform, although much work still needs to be done to ensure its successful
implementation.

The broad context to the assessment of the achievement of the development objectives is the
substantial stabilization of the macroeconomic situation in the period since the operation
(see Table 2). The exchange rate and banking sector deposits have stabilized, inflation has fallen
and the trade deficit narrowed. Although the fiscal deficit widened during the middle of 2009, it
came in at 5.4 percent for the year as a whole, below the June budget amendment target of 5.8
percent of GDP. Finally, the government was able to conclude a major mining investment
agreement. As a result of the signing of this agreement, positive sentiment has returned to the
mining sector, and GDP growth for 2010 is projected to rebound to 8 percent of GDP, up from
around 0 percent in 2009 (which is below the 2.9 percent growth projection at the time of DPC
preparation). Although higher than expected copper prices played a fortuitous role, the strong
policy actions undertaken by the government, supported by policy conditionality and donor
financing of the balance of payments and the budget, were clearly instrumental in stabilizing the
economic situation faster than expected. Assessing the exact causal linkages of these
developments to the DPC operation, however, is made difficult by the multiple influences on
outcomes during this crisis period in Mongolia.

Fiscal Policy and Management

Rating: Satisfactory

The Satisfactory rating for the fiscal policy and management policy area is based on the progress
that has been made towards the outcome indicators specified in the program policy matrix, and
also the role of the prior actions as steps towards broader reforms in the areas of public
investment and improving the management of mineral fiscal revenues.

On the planning and screening of public investment projects, the prior action was the
removal in the March 2009 budget revision of 30 projects which had been included in the
original 2009 budget without feasibility studies. The outcome indicator was that 30 projects
valued at MNT 19.8 billion without feasibility studies were removed from the budget. This was
equivalent to saving 4 percent of planned new investment expenditures. In total, the original
budget included 36 public investment projects without feasibility studies, valued at MNT 50.3
billion. The March budget revision excluded 34 of these projects, valued at MNT 22.3 billion, i.e.
went beyond the prior action and outcome indicator. In the July budget revision 3 additional such
projects (totaling MNT 6 billion) were added, leaving 5 projects valued at MNT 34 billion
without feasibility studies in the budget. In the 2010 public investment plan (PIP) submitted to
Parliament there were only 4 projects without feasibility studies, amounting to less than MNT 8
billion out of a total of MNT 452 billion. The PIP approved by Parliament included an additional
439 projects of which 310, amounting to MNT 77 billion, were without feasibility studies.
However, these additions, plus the shifting of the financing from the budget to construction
companies for a large portfolio of projects, have raised considerable concerns (prompting, for
example, a presidential veto of the budget, which was rejected by Parliament, and an audit of the
public investment planning process by the National Audit Office). As a result there is substantial
pressure for a further amendment of the budget to rectify these measures (which is a proposed
prior action in DPC2).

On maintenance, the budgeted level of capital repairs was maintained in the July revision of
the 2009 budget, but the outturn ratio of capital repairs relative to investments has
continued to decline over 2009. Under the prior action, MNT 12.4 billion was to be allocated to
capital repairs in the March revision of the 2009 budget, implying an increase to 3.4 percent of
budgeted investment expenditures, up from 2.5 percent in the original budget. The outcome



                                                         9
indicator was that the MNT 12.4 billion budgeted value of capital repairs be realized in the 2009
budget outturn. The full-year capital repair expenditures were just below this figure at MNT 11.6
billion. The 2010 budget approved by Parliament allocated MNT 19.4 billion for capital repairs,
or 4.4 percent of investments, not including MNT 8.8 billion allocated to the Road Fund.

Given the close linkage between the prior actions and outcome indicators listed in the policy
matrix in the fiscal area, it would also have been useful to provide additional quantitative
outcome indicators over specific time-frames. However, as emphasized in the DPC PD,
improving the measurement of repair expenditures, for example, is an ongoing challenge, with
limited progress to date. The budget line on capital repairs does not include maintenance capital
expenditures funded directly by donor funding, or, as mentioned above, by the Road Fund.
Unfortunately, high frequency measurable outcome-based indicators of the state of the public
capital infrastructure were also not available for this review.

While focusing on specific areas, the prior actions were steps moving forward the fiscal
reform agenda on public investment and, more generally, in improving the management of
mineral fiscal revenues. The prior actions were initial measures to prevent a further deterioration
in the performance of investment expenditures and to emphasize the importance of prioritizing
capital maintenance. The government's ongoing efforts to reform the legal framework for
budgeting have the potential for significant improvements in this area. The draft integrated budget
law includes proposals to limit the ability of Parliament to include projects in the budget which do
not have feasibility studies, and requires that there be a central mechanism for evaluating and
selecting proposed projects based on whether or not a proposed project meets a strategic need,
and is backed up by the appropriate technical and economic analysis. Continued Bank analytical
work and technical assistance is focusing on achieving the goal of a more comprehensive and
strategic approach to the planning of public investment projects, for establishing more robust
criteria for evaluating and selecting projects in the public investment, plan, and for calculating the
recurrent cost obligations of capital projects. The World Bank has also been extremely active,
along with the IMF, in arguing the case for a move to a structural balance rule for fiscal revenues,
as adopted by Chile for example, in order to remove the procyclical effects of future mineral
revenue windfalls. This has included the funding of technical assistance executed by the IMF
along with a range of outreach exercises, including conferences, a highly effective study visit of
MPs to Chile and the dissemination of the regular economic update. These activities appear to
have been effective in building domestic political appreciation of the merits of such rules and
enhancing the likelihood that the Ministry of Finance's fiscal responsibility law incorporating
such measures, which has been submitted to Parliament, might be adopted (with its submission by
end-2009 a structural benchmark in the IMF program).

Social Protection

Rating: Satisfactory

The Satisfactory rating for the achievement of program development objectives in the social
protection policy area weighs the advances made by the government on social welfare reform
since early 2009 against the slower-than-expected implementation of the specific outcome
indicator selected during the preparation of the DPC.

The outcome indicator for social protection ­ to collect at least 75 percent of the household-
level data needed to establish a national beneficiary database, based on the PMT formula ­
is unlikely to be met by December 31, 2010, although this should not impede
implementation of the social welfare reform. Data collection to build a beneficiary database


                                                 10
will begin in March 2010 and is expected to extend well into the second half of 2010, however. It
is not envisioned that this will interfere with the timely implementation of the poverty-targeted
benefit, however. Indeed, the social welfare reform law, currently in front of the Parliament, calls
for the new poverty-targeted benefit to be introduced at the start of 2011.

Nevertheless, noteworthy progress has been achieved on social welfare reform in Mongolia
between January 2009 and January 2010. The key accomplishments include:

1. A social welfare reform law was drafted by the Ministry of Social Welfare and Labor
(MSWL) with World Bank technical assistance, cleared by the Cabinet, and submitted to
Parliament for approval. The social welfare law is founded on the principles of consolidating and
rationalizing the current social welfare system, targeting benefits to Mongolia's poor, and
improving the social welfare system's fiscal sustainability.

2. The MSWL, with World Bank and ADB technical assistance, developed a proxy means testing
(PMT) methodology to target a new transfer program to the poor. This included development of
a proxy means formula, development of a proxy means questionnaire, and implementation of
pilot testing of the PMT. Data collection is beginning in March 2010.

3. The proxy means formula was submitted to the National Statistical Office in February 2010
for approval as the official poverty targeting mechanism for Mongolia. Formal approval is
expected in March 2010.

4. In what may be considered the first phase of the consolidation of the Mongolian social welfare
system, the universal Child Money Program (CMP), the Newlywed Benefit, and the Newborn
Benefit were cancelled by the government in November 2009, effective January 2010.

5. To separate the political parties' political commitments regarding redistribution of Mongolia's
mineral wealth from the country's social welfare system, the government created the Human
Development Fund (HDF) in November 2009 as the vehicle for distributing the country's mineral
wealth.2

6. The MSWL has begun work on the design of a new flagship poverty-targeted benefit program
with technical assistance from the World Bank team.

The developments noted above could not have been foreseen at the time of preparation of
the DPC, and were thus not reflected in the milestones. The prior action for social protection
in the DPC ­ elaboration of time-bound plan to clean the roster of beneficiaries of the Child
Money Program (CMP) ­ was fulfilled, but is no longer relevant because the CMP was
eliminated in November 2009 as part of the 2010 budget process.

In addition, while progress towards achieving the outcome indicator has been slower than
originally expected, the time since approval of the DPC has been important for building a
stronger understanding among key stakeholders regarding the rationale for social welfare


2
 The HDF will finance transfers of up to MNT 1.5 million per Mongolian citizen over time, including
roughly MNT 100,000 in 2010. While not part of Mongolia's social welfare system, if implemented
effectively, HDF transfers will more than cover households losses associated with the CMP and other
cancelled benefit, thus effectively serving as a transition mechanism in 2010.



                                                  11
reform and for putting the appropriate building blocks in place to execute the reform.
Indeed, in their commitment to respond quickly and forcefully to the crisis, the government and
the donor community underestimated the challenges associated with designing a comprehensive
social welfare reform, including the development of a new poverty targeting system, the design of
a new poverty-targeted benefit program, the process of national consensus-building, and so on.
Given its focus on universal transfers, such as the CMP, Mongolia does not have a strong history
of poverty targeting and lacked the technical and institutional capacity to develop and implement
a proxy means formula and national beneficiary database quickly on its own. Significant time,
resources, and technical and institutional capacity have thus been required to develop the building
blocks for the new system.

In this context, despite considerable progress, implementation of the social welfare reform
(including the new poverty-targeted benefit) will likely face a number of technical
challenges. To address these, the World Bank, together with the ADB, is providing technical
assistance. Technical support for the roll-out of the PMT is currently being provided by the ADB
under its Food Stamps support program, and this technical support is proposed to be extended
under the separate World Bank technical assistance operation currently under preparation.
Details of the design of a poverty-targeted program, and institutional strengthening required to
implement the new program are currently being elaborated by the MSWL with the technical
assistance of the World Bank. Efforts are focusing as well on the national roll-out of the PMT and
on the development of the needed beneficiary database, so that implementation of the new
poverty-targeted benefit program can be started in early 2011 (as proposed in the draft reform
law).

It is also worth noting that the DPC engagement has played an important role in the
development of a concrete social welfare reform proposal and has served to strengthen the
Bank's policy dialogue with the government in this area. Given the challenges associated with
the reform, the World Bank has coordinated closely with ADB in putting together technical
assistance and financial resources to support the design and early implementation of the reform.
The World Bank had produced a body of analytical work on social protection prior to the DPC,
which helped make the case for social welfare reform. In addition, the Bank used administrative
(AAA) budget to support the government in developing the main parameters of social welfare
reform proposal during the second half of 2009. Because the need for technical assistance in
implementing the social welfare reform is considerable, a new World Bank technical assistance
operation is currently under preparation, which is being designed to accompany a second
Mongolia DPC.

Financial Sector

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

The Moderately Satisfactory rating for the achievement of PDOs in the financial sector reform
area reflects some weaknesses in performance against the specified outcome indicators, although
this is set against the progress made on the broad objective of improving confidence in the sector.

The prior actions in the financial sector area aimed to support the resolution of immediate
banking sector issues but, performance relative to the outcome indicators has been weak,
particularly in terms of action on resolution:

        The outcome indicator related to the prior action on the preparation of an action plan for
        the restructuring/ resolution of Anod Bank was that this plan be implemented. There is a


                                                12
         legal requirement that the bank could not remain in the conservatorship of the BoM for
         more than twelve months, i.e. until early December 2009. The bank was finally put into
         receivership just ahead of this deadline. The BoM's position is that the resolution was
         delayed due to the requirement to perform due diligence on an offer for the bank, which
         was eventually rejected.

         The second prior action concerned the issuance of a decree requiring banks to report daily
         to the BoM key indicators on liquidity and asset quality. Daily reporting of deposit and
         loan balances is in place and disseminated. Information on asset quality may not change
         much on daily basis and, given the stage of development of the banking system, is also
         difficult to compile by banks (particularly those lending in rural areas). The monitoring
         system definitely requires further strengthening, particularly in relation to more detailed
         information on asset quality. However, the system was effective enough to alert the
         authorities to the deteriorating situation of a bank which reported negative capital. Based
         on the monitoring, the BoM did issue calls for certain actions to be taken by the bank in
         question. However, these interventions were not backed up by strong enough sanctions to
         arrest and correct the deteriorating trend. At the end of November 2009 the bank, Zoos
         Bank, was taken into receivership.

         The third prior action related to the setting up of a crisis management and systemic risk
         task force with adequate resources and powers and was met in late May 2009 by Joint
         Decree No 285/123/62 of the BoM Governor, the Minister of Finance and the Chairman
         of the Financial Regulatory Commission. The outcome indicator was that this task force
         be operational. However, in practice, it appears that staff and resources were not adequate
         for undertaking such a role. There is frequent interaction between the supervision
         department, the Board of the BoM and the Ministry of Finance on bank restructuring and
         other important financial sector related issues. In terms of legal powers the BoM has
         submitted legislative proposals to address some of the issues mentioned in the DPC, for
         example the lack of legal protection of supervisors. In terms of the outcome indicator of
         having in place a contingency planning framework for failed-bank resolution, the BoM
         indicated that so far there is no formal documentation of these procedures with the
         resolution process moving on a case-by-case basis, i.e. the specific outcome indicator has
         yet to be achieved.

Nevertheless, the stabilization in deposits during 2009 suggests that the immediate objective
of strengthening confidence in the banking sector was achieved. By mid-2009 aggregate
deposit outflows from the banking system, which had been particularly high in 2008 Q4 and 2009
Q1, had abated (Table 3). As detailed in the July 2009 World Bank Financial Sector Assessment3
the authorities had taken a number of policy actions aimed at restoring confidence, for example
liquidity support to banks and the introduction of the Deposit Guarantee Law in November 2008.
However, concern over the fate of deposits held with the failed Anod Bank, the fourth largest
bank by assets, remained, hence the first DPC prior action. As mentioned in Section 2.2, the DPC
prior actions in this area, and their contribution to the stabilization of deposits, should be
considered in the context of the overall package of measures by development partners, including
the IMF and USAID for example, aimed at supporting financial sector confidence.

  This assessment of Mongolia's financial system is based on the joint International Monetary Fund and World Bank
Financial Sector Assessment Program which was primarily conducted in 2007.




                                                        13
As the banking situation moved into a solvency crisis so action on banking restructuring
became increasingly important, the principles of which were supported by the DPC prior
actions and whose implementation is currently being assisted through ongoing World Bank
activities. The overall financial sector situation evolved from a liquidity crisis through to a
second phase of a solvency crisis for some banks, with evidence of a third credit crunch phase.
Asset quality has deteriorated ­ NPLs including loans with their principal in arrears were 22.8
percent of all loans at end-December 2009 (15.2 percent excluding the failed Anod and Zoos
banks), up from 17.3 percent in June 2009. Write-downs of loans have hit bank capital. For
example, the aggregate level of capital declined by around 12 percent from August to September
2009, although within the commercial banks there is a large differentiation in balance sheet
strength. The solvency concerns over Zoos Bank, and its move into receivership, do not seem to
have had an adverse impact on overall confidence levels. As the relative riskiness of loans
increased, the real interest rates on loans remained high and banks were concerned over finding
new capital. The extension of credit contracted, sharply, with loans declining year-on-year in
nominal terms from August 2009. Addressing bank asset quality and strengthening capital
positions are crucial to promote a revival of credit availability which can support investment and
the economic recovery.

Mining

Rating: Highly Satisfactory

In the mining sector, the Highly Satisfactory rating reflects the considerable progress that the
signing of the major Oyu Tolgoi agreement represents, along with progress on outcome indicators
in other areas such as Cadastre regulations and in following responsible mining practices. It is,
however, important to note that major challenges remain in order to improve further the
investment environment in Mongolia's mining sector.

In the mining sector, the key development has been the signing of the major Oyu Tolgoi
(OT) project investment agreement on 6 October 2009, utilizing a new agreement format
which now forms the basis for future investment project deals. This meets the DPC outcome
indicator of using the draft model investment agreement in new investment agreements (the
development and adoption of the original version of this agreement was a prior action). The OT
agreement required parliamentary approval of the cancellation of the windfall profits tax (WPT),


                                                        14
revision of corporate income tax to extend the loss carried-forward provision from 2 years to 8
years, and amendments to two pieces of legislation to provide permission for private sector
construction and management of roads and water supply facilities. These legal changes
demonstrated stronger policy reform actions than the DPC envisaged at the time of its design.
This agreement is to be the model agreement for future mining projects, such as Tavan Tolgoi,
subject to investment-specific modifications. The World Bank is currently assisting the
government in moving towards a model agreement which can be adapted to small- as well as
large-scale investment projects. It is expected that this will be developed in advance of the Tavan
Tolgoi deal, which the government hopes to reach agreement on in early 2010. The next step is
then to put the model agreement into regulations.

There has also been notable progress towards the outcome indicator of adoption and
implementation of new Cadastre regulations. The revision of the regulations has been assisted
by World Bank technical assistance. The Ministry of Mineral Resources and Energy has
completed the draft Regulations and forwarded them to the Ministry of Justice for review and
when approved they will be formally adopted. This reform should help to move the process of
mineral license approval away from the previous opaque system of internal ministerial
instructions. This was open to discretionary changes and reversals, facilitating corruption and
discouraging applications.

There has been ongoing work towards the outcome indicator of following responsible
mining practices and enhancing the regulatory capacity to monitor them. This includes the
above mentioned technical assistance to the Cadastre office, along with support for new
regulations on Occupational Health and Safety. Technical assistance is also going to provide
support for the development of Income Tax Act provisions for mining, a crucial area given the
current and future scale of Mongolia's mineral fiscal revenues. The independent validation of
Mongolia's national EITI program, part of another DPC outcome indicator, has been completed
ahead of the deadline of March 10, 2010, with the validation report noting that Mongolia has
made good progress against the work plan and has completed all core activities. The report has
been adopted by the government and submitted to the EITI Secretariat.

Despite this recent progress, major challenges remain, and, the general perception of
investors on Mongolia's mining investment environment is yet to be improved. While the
recent OT deal is significant ­requiring around US$ 5 billion of construction costs­ a key concern
is the propensity of parliament to make ad hoc legislative changes to the investment environment.
For example, the imposition of the WPT in June 2006 was associated with a sizeable subsequent
reduction in applications for mining licenses. The move to complete the OT deal involved the
removal of this tax from January 1, 2011. However, from the perspective of investors, this
positive step was offset by a recent change to the VAT laws, meaning that exporters of minerals
will be unable to claim back their VAT payments on inputs. This move, contrary to the objectives
of value added tax, could add around 5-8 percent to mine operating costs and discourage new
investment. Such recent changes to the tax environment have confirmed investor perceptions that
Mongolia's fiscal regime is unstable. This instability remains a disincentive to exploration and
mineral development and reinforces investor calls for stabilized tax environments under
investment agreements. This remains an area of focus for future Technical Assistance activities
of the Bank.

3.3     Justification of Overall Outcome Rating (combining relevance, achievement of PDOs)

Rating: Satisfactory

The overall outcome rating of Satisfactory combines the Highly Satisfactory rating on the
relevance of the DPC's objectives, design and implementation together with the Satisfactory
rating for the achievement of PDOs over the limited time frame since completion of the
operation. The program design and implementation were well-focused and timely in the crisis
situation. Even though the policy actions supported by the operation were focused on managing
the downturn and urgently taking corrective action, the DPC and related World Bank work have
been used as an opportunity to support the government's moves towards putting in place a better
medium-term framework moving forward. However, the crisis situation, and related political and
capacity issues, has also meant that on some of the development objectives there has been limited
progress on outcomes over the period of assessment. Given the crisis nature of the operation, the
achievement rating has been given more weight (two-thirds versus one-third for relevance) in
determining the overall outcome rating.

3.4     Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts (if any, where not previously covered
or to amplify discussion above)

(a)     Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

While the policy area of social protection is most directly concerned with addressing
poverty in the near-term, the other policy areas are also expected to have a medium-term
impact. Recent work by the World Bank team suggests that, using a consistent poverty line over
time, the poverty rate in Mongolia did fall substantially in the recent years of high economic
growth (i.e., 2002/3 to 2007/8). However, there remain substantial vulnerable populations,
particularly those in rural areas or in urban ger areas. In addition, the financial crisis may have
adversely affected some of the recent poverty-related gains nationwide. Improved targeting of the
social protection systems will facilitate channeling gains associated with economic growth more
efficiently toward assisting poor and vulnerable groups. Simulation analysis suggests that
interventions to make social safety nets in Mongolia better targeted and fiscally sustainable will
help to protect the poor against future shocks as well as to reduce poverty. Appropriate
management of future mining revenues to ensure it is shared in an equitable manner across the
population, and avoiding boom-bust cycles through fiscal reforms and improved banking sector
stability, are also important to the welfare of the poor going forward. Environmental concerns, as
discussed in the original PD, only directly relate to the mining sector and were addressed by the
prior action supporting the introduction of environmentally and socially responsible mining
practices following the Equator principles, which complement technical assistance work
supporting the development of environmental regulations governing the mining sector.

(b)     Institutional Change/Strengthening
(particularly with reference to impacts on longer-term capacity and institutional development)

Many of the policy actions in the DPC, along with the associated technical assistance,
analytical work or related projects, are concerned with strengthening the institutions of
Mongolia. In particular, the main objective is to support the development of institutions which
can channel the future revenues from Mongolia's substantial mineral wealth into providing stable,
sustainable and equitable growth and poverty reduction. As part of this broad objective, each
policy area also targeted the development of specific institutions, either directly through the prior


                                                 16
actions or as medium-term outcomes (see discussion in Sections 1.2 and 3.2). For example,
financial sector prior actions addressed the institutional arrangements surrounding the monitoring
of banks and crisis prevention and resolution. In mining the prior actions and outcome indicators
related to the institutional framework for investment agreements and the mining licensing regime.
Eliminating investment projects without feasibility studies from the budget was a step towards
improving the institutional framework for the planning of public investment projects, which is
receiving continued assistance from the Bank. Ongoing efforts to reform the social welfare
system include critical support to strengthen the institutions of social protection, including
targeting and management information systems, and government implementation capacity.

Not applicable.

4.      Assessment of Risk to Development Outcomes

Rating: Moderate

The rating of Moderate for the risks to development outcomes balances two sets of factors. On
the one hand, there are sizeable downside risks across the various sectors of the operation, both in
terms of impact and probability of realization. On the other hand, there are upside risks from
mineral revenues going forward as major investment projects come on-stream and there is also
the potential mitigating factor of a strong domestic policy response when adverse shocks
materialize, as was observed in the recent crisis.

There are sizeable risks to the development outcomes of the DPC program, although they
may be mitigated by a strong domestic policy response as shown by the authorities during
the 2009 crisis. There is a general risk that the political appetite for reform diminishes with
further improvements in mineral prices and as the prospect of increased mineral revenue inflows
draws closer. The likelihood of political factors playing a major role may increase in the run-up to
the elections in 2012. However, there are a number of important mitigating factors. First, the
objective of signing major mining agreements has served as a unifying force for the current
governing coalition and would be undermined by political and economic instability. This was a
motivating factor in the speed and commitment to policy adjustment in response to the crisis.
Second, the ongoing programs of IFIs in Mongolia can serve as important anchors supporting the
policy reform agenda.

The proper management of Mongolia's future mining revenues can provide immense
support to development outcomes in the long-run, although there are near-term fiscal risks.
Export and government revenues flowing from the OT project alone could peak at around 55
percent and 20 percent of GDP respectively in 2019. However, avoidance of further boom-bust
cycles associated with such flows requires concerted efforts towards adoption of a counter-
cyclical and sustainable fiscal regime. Moves to implement a structural balance rule are supported
by the Ministry of Finance and development partners but, although the draft law has been
submitted to Parliament, it remains to be seen whether, and in what form, such a rule will enter
into national legislation. The fiscal deficit, which remains high, could be exacerbated by recent
proposals for additional expenditures on a universal cash transfer of OT prepayment funds or on


                                                17
housing subsidies. The impact of going off-track on the macro policy front could be significant,
with the poor likely to be particularly affected. An absence of fiscal consolidation combined with
the reduced levels of donor budget support in 2011 and 2012 would limit the financing options
for the deficit. Increased domestic finance could further crowd out the private sector or there may
be the risk of inflationary financing. A sharp fiscal adjustment would lower service provision and
investment levels.

On social protection, both political considerations and institutional/technical capacity
constraints present risks to further progress on the social welfare reform. Social protection
reform remains a sensitive political issue. While policy makers and parliamentarians from both
main political parties have voiced support for social welfare reform, as in other countries there
remains political pressure to provide universal, non-targeted, benefits, illustrated by recent
proposals to use loan pre-payments from the OT deal for such transfers. These pressures could
potentially hinder passage of the social welfare reform law which has been submitted to
Parliament. There are also lingering concerns about the government's institutional capacity to
implement the proposed reforms. These concerns will need to be addressed (e.g., via the technical
assistance operation under preparation) to ensure the effective implementation of the proposed
poverty-targeted benefit.

In the banking sector, a key risk is the failure to deal with those banks who report
insufficient capital levels in an expedient and proper manner, potentially leading to adverse
spillovers for depositor confidence. There is a need to put in place clear resolution mechanisms
for any banks which are moving towards insolvency and to act upon them swiftly when required.
Political involvement in the resolution process also raises concerns over whether future bank
problems will be addressed in such a rapid and effective manner. Delayed, and inappropriate,
action on resolving failed banks could increase the risk of asset stripping and exacerbate the
potential fiscal costs of any required recapitalizations. It could also lead to a fall in the confidence
of depositors in individual banks with potentially systemic implications, prompting widescale
deposit flight.

The most significant risks in relation to mining are the potential for a return to policy
uncertainty and the failure to address the significant infrastructure needs associated with
future large-scale mining projects. The recent OT deal is a positive development but another
mineral price boom could, as previously, lead to a revival of political interference in the sector,
affecting the incentives of the exploration sector to invest in Mongolia. Increasing private sector
profits as prices rise could motivate politicians to adjust the tax environment, as in the case of the
2006 imposition of the windfall tax, or the access to land. The infrastructure needs of large-scale
mining projects, for example in terms of transportation and power, are considerable. There is a
risk that the government may not have sufficient capacity or finance to meet these needs or that
the institutional and legal framework is not in place to facilitate sufficient private sector
participation. The realization of these two risks would constrain the extent to which Mongolia's
resource activities are developed relative to their potential.

5.      Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1     Bank Performance

(a)    Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry (i.e., performance through lending
phase)

Rating: Satisfactory

The rating of Satisfactory reflects an assessment of the Bank's performance as timely, well-
focused, using an appropriate instrument and based on strong coordination with development
partners.

The proposed single-tranche DPC was supported from the initial stage of the project as an
appropriate instrument: It assisted the government's response to the crisis while continuing the
policy dialogue with the authorities as they revised their medium-term policy framework.
Because there was no robust medium-term plan of the government and given the urgency of the
situation, this choice of instrument appears appropriate and timely.

The design of the operation strongly reflected the need for a timely, effective response to the
impact of the crisis. While the major objective was short-term policy reform, the operation did
agree with the government on the general framework of a new medium-term policy framework,
which was contained in the document and the Letter of Development Policy.

In response to the financial crisis, the Bank moved quickly with a short-term response,
while also developing a clear view on what can be achieved over the next years. Due to the
direness of the situation and in order to help the government meet urgent financing needs, the
proposed DPC was processed under the IDA FTF. Also, instead of completing a four-year CAS,
the Bank showed flexibility in revising projects in the Interim Strategy Note for 2009-10.

Overall collaboration among partners was highly successful, given the urgency of the
situation and the short time span. The operational design was closely synchronized with those
of other development partners. In particular, the partnership between the IMF and the Bank was
very strong, as detailed in the illustrative joint IMF/WB policy matrix in the program document
and in the participation of Bank staff in each of the IMF preparation missions leading up to the
SBA Board approval. A joint IMF/Bank mission was also undertaken to Japan which ensured
proper coordination with the authorities there. Collaboration with the ADB has also been strong,
in particular in the area of social protection, although there have been some issues regarding the
division of labor in the beginning of the operation. Nonetheless, there was a general consensus on
the priority actions and objectives.

(b)     Quality of Supervision (including M&E arrangements)

Rating: Satisfactory

While the prior actions were completed before the loan went to the Board, the monitoring
and evaluation of the reform progress has been continuous through dialogue and ongoing
technical assistance and analytical work. This is the rationale for the Satisfactory rating on the
quality of supervision. In preparation for the proposed second DPC operation, continuous
monitoring of the economic situation (which is published in the Monthly Updates), dialogues


                                                19
with the government and follow-ups on the prior actions served as a de facto form of supervision.
Dialogue was also supported through on-going technical assistance and project lending across the
four policy areas of the DPC.

(c)     Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

The Bank worked closely with the government and development partners to develop a
relevant reform agenda that strategically addressed several core constraints in the country
while delivering the program on time. The Satisfactory rating for overall bank performance is
based on the Satisfactory ratings for both the quality at entry and quality of supervision
dimensions. The design of the operation was appropriate although there could have been an
improvement in the technical assistance area. Without adequate TA, it is difficult to move along
the agenda in certain areas within a given timeframe. Also, the Bank's decision to respond in a
more timely manner through using the IDA FTF was appropriate.

5.2     Borrower Performance

(a)     Government Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

The government, and domestic policy-makers, showed a high level of commitment from the
outset of the operation and were cooperative in trying to pass all the prior actions in time,
although, as the intensity of the economic crisis was viewed to dissipate, there appeared to
be some weakening in commitment to moving forward reforms. This was especially
noticeable in the banking sector. The interaction with authorities was generally satisfactory but
rushed. At the same time, this may have played a positive role in speeding up the operation's
process.

(b)     Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

See section (a) on government performance.

(c)     Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

The overall borrower performance of Satisfactory reflects the fact that the government was
responsive to, and proactive with, the DPC operation and committed their resources and
personnel to facilitate the operation process. As a result, the program was delivered on a timely
basis and helped stabilizing the country's macroeconomic environment.

6.      Lessons Learned

The operation emphasized the crucial importance of understanding the political economy
context for policy reforms. The financial crisis highlighted the need for Mongolia to improve its
overall policy framework in order to prevent future boom-and-bust cycles, and provided a key
window of opportunity for engagement by the World Bank and other partners. There was concern
that the 2009 presidential election would interfere with addressing the crisis but, perhaps due to


                                               20
the seriousness of the economic situation and the strength of the bi-partisan government coalition,
it played a negligible role in affecting the outcomes of the program. However, as the copper price
revived and the perceived threat of imminent crisis receded, calls for the distribution of the gains
from mineral revenues towards rural areas and the urban poor are again on the increase. In
particular, the active nature of Mongolia's Parliament, combined with the prospect of large
increases in future mineral revenues, is testing the government's commitment to move forward on
medium-term policy reforms.

Prior strong TA and analytical work, and the ability and resources to scale up such work
quickly, are essential for a successful and timely outcome in crisis-response operations. For
example, the fiscal policy sector and the mining sectors were better able to achieve their
objectives, because a lot of sectoral work was already in place. In the banking sector, the
substantial analytical work under the FSAP, which was mainly undertaken in 2007, highlighted
risks which were realized in 2008 and 2009, such as the fall in copper prices and exchange rate
volatility. However, the speed of the deterioration in the health of the sector which eventually
took place was not predicted. Once the crisis hit, after the failure of Anod Bank, substantial
analytical work was undertaken to inform the design of the DPC. Significant analytical work on
social protection and program targeting in Mongolia also positioned the World Bank well to
respond quickly to the government's need to reform the social welfare sector in response to the
crisis. Moreover, World Bank technical assistance has been important to the development of the
new proxy means test that will form the basis for targeting the new poverty benefit to the poor.
The experience from the DPC highlights, however, that sound analytical work and technical
support may not be sufficient to implement quickly the range of institutional improvements
required to reform a system of social transfers in a low-capacity environment such as Mongolia's.
The sorts of institutional capacity-building required to implement a comprehensive social welfare
reform take more time than might be optimal during a crisis-period.

Success of a program requires a flexible mindset of, and close coordination amongst,
development partners. The general coordination among the donors was highly commendable.
There was a good division of labor on fiscal and banking issues in particular between the IMF
and the Bank, including the allocation of TA works. On social protection Bank analytical work
fed into the operational work of the ADB and the Bank. Indeed, another lesson is that while a
selective and focused operational design is commendable, often donors and development partners
may rely on World Bank diagnostics and analysis in other areas. This requires the Bank to stretch
its resources to be responsive to such needs. Finally, bilateral partners provided valued support to
the overall program in a relatively short timeframe. Coordination with the borrower was also
highly satisfactory. The urgency of the situation might have played a big role in bringing all
relevant players to reach a consensus in a short given period of time. Indeed, this operation is a
reminder of the opportunities that crisis situations can present for concerted, and coordinated,
action by the government with development partner assistance in moving forward reforms that in
"normal" times would likely be subject to greater obstacles. Such situations require the Bank to
take a proactive approach, be prepared to change its strategy of assistance as appropriate and to
work in coordination, and be in ongoing dialogue, with the government, politicians and other
domestic stakeholders, and with development partners such as the IMF.

It is important to gauge from the beginning of an operation the capacity, both technical and
political, of the borrower or the implementing agency to implement the proposed reforms.
As illustrated in the design of this operation, this assessment has important implications for
determining the priorities and sequencing of reforms. The capacity of the borrower was sufficient
enough to take strong and painful policy actions when this was required. However, the more
complicated reforms that are needed on social protection will require developing more capacity,


                                                21
on the one hand, and, on the other hand, the design of simple implementation systems to make
optimal use of the existing capacity. Indeed, the MSWL in comments to this draft noted that the
need for a substantial reform may bring risks in implementation and in cooperation.

In crisis operations it is important to anticipate any potential delays in the internal
institutional process which could slow disbursement. Despite using the FTF, and the strong
support from the Regional Operations Committee to speed up the review process, the Bank's
internal procedures still posed some challenges to the task team in terms of the speed of
processing of the operation. In this case, the immediate fiscal pressure was somewhat alleviated
due to the revival in the copper price, and the seasonality of financing needs. However, it could
have been the case that delays in disbursement could have had more serious implications if fiscal
financing needs had become acute.
