                        This is the first of two single tranche Development Policy Credits
                        supporting government reforms to manage the economic downturn
Main Policy Areas       This Development Policy Credit (DPC) is designed to assist the
                        government manage the current downturn, which was triggered by
                        the collapse of the copper price. The DPC supports reforms in the
                        policy areas most affected: (i) fiscal policy and management, given
                        the budget's strong dependence on mining revenues; (ii) social
                        protection, given the impact of the economic downturn on the poor;
                        (iii) the financial sector, which was overheating when the global
                        crisis hit, and which experienced a major bank failure in late 2008;
                        and (iv) the mining sector, given the sector's importance in driving
                        the recovery.
Key Outcome Indicators  Improve capital budget planning and execution, and protect the
                        maintenance of basic infrastructure:

                          national EITI program. The centerpieces of the Interim Strategy
                          Note (ISN) are two single-tranche DPCs (FY10 and FY11). The
                          World Bank Group assistance under the ISN and the DPCs are fully
                          synchronized.
Risks and risk mitigation Significant risks include:
                              ·   Another fall in mineral prices, leading to further budget and
                                  external balance shocks. This risk is mitigated by the
                                  introduction of a more flexible exchange rate, more prudent
                                  fiscal management and removing uncertainties in the
                                  mining investment regime to promote foreign direct
                                  investment.
                              ·   More bank failures, mitigated by improved monetary and
                                  exchange     rate  policies,  enhanced      monitoring    and
                                  supervision of the banking sector and the establishment of a
                                  crisis management task force in the Bank of Mongolia.
                          Moderate risks include:
                              ·   Populist political pressures and/or a substantial rebound of
                                  the copper price could derail or reverse the fiscal, monetary
                                  and exchange-rate policy reforms needed to manage the
                                  downturn, mitigated by intensified outreach (through
                                  dialogue, workshops/conferences and regular economic
                                  updates) to policymakers, Parliament, academia, and the
                                  media with the objective to help build strong commitment
                                  to reforms.
                              ·   Government agrees to sub-optimal mineral export contracts
                                  or other non-concessional financing that negatively impacts
                                  debt sustainability. This is mitigated by development
                                  partners'   joint  support   for   the   appropriate   policy
                                  adjustments, backed by the necessary financial support,
                                  including this DPC.

                                            TO MONGOLIA



                                       I.       INTRODUCTION


1.       The global downturn has hit Mongolia hard. This downturn has been most immediately
felt through the collapse of mineral prices, in particular that of copper. Given Mongolia's reliance
on copper revenues in the budget (more than one-third of the budget relies on mineral revenues),
the fiscal shock has been very large (from a 2.9 percent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP)
surplus in 2007 to a 5.0 percent of GDP deficit in 2008). Export proceeds are expected to fall by
one third (about US$800 million) this year. Inflation, fueled by domestic consumption (driven by
large increases in wages and salaries and untargeted social transfers) and loose monetary policies,
peaked at 34 percent in August 2008--the highest in the region. Economic growth is projected to
slow down sharply--it would fall from 8.9 percent in 2008 to a projected 2.7 percent in 2009.

2.       The proposed operation is processed under the International Development Association
(IDA) Financial Crisis Response Fast-Track Facility to help the government meet urgent
financing needs. The sudden downturn exposed the overreliance of the budget on mineral
revenues, causing the fiscal situation to become precarious. The downturn also exposed
weaknesses in an overheated banking sector, leading to a large systemically important bank being
placed under conservatorship and a loss of confidence, as demonstrated by declining deposits.
And foreign direct investment (FDI) in the mining sector, which was growing rapidly from a
small base, stagnated.

3.       Managing the downturn is now the over-riding government priority. The size of the
adjustments needed is such that multilateral and bilateral balance of payments support and budget
support is urgently needed. In response, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) agreed on April 1
to an 18-month Stand-By Arrangement (SBA) of US$229 million 1 to provide balance of
payments support. The SBA gives Mongolia exceptional access to IMF resources based on the
extraordinary nature of the external shock and the strong policy actions taken by the government.
Based on this agreement and the commitment of the government to undertake the necessary
reforms to adjust to the crisis, key development partners (the Asian Development Bank (ADB),
Japan and the World Bank) have indicated their willingness to provide the budget support needed
to co-finance the fiscal deficits under the IMF program. These deficits would have been difficult
to finance otherwise, given the lack of liquidity in the domestic banking sector and the
unattractiveness and unavailability of commercial external financing.

4.       The World Bank's proposed Development Policy Credit is a single-tranche operation of
US$40 million.2 The proposed instrument is a single-tranche operation, because of the existing


1The amount requested is fixed at SDR 153.3 million, which is equivalent to US$229 million on April 9,
2009.
2Mongolia's indicative IDA envelope for FY09-11 is assumed to be about SDR 60 million ($90 million at
current exchange rate), with actual allocations determined on an annual basis according to specific criteria.
Estimates of the IDA envelope for FY09-11 are indicative only and can change. Actual allocations in these
years will depend on: (i) total IDA resources available; (ii) the country's performance rating; (iii) the
performance and assistance terms of other IDA borrowers; (iv) the terms of IDA's assistance to Mongolia
(grants or credits); and (v) the number of IDA-eligible countries. IDA allocations are made in SDRs based
on performance, and the US$ equivalent is dependent upon the prevailing exchange rate. Since Mongolia is


                                                     1

uncertainties and risks, and the absence of a coherent and detailed medium-term policy
framework.3 However, because of the magnitude of the shock, it is clear that the adjustment effort
will take place over the next several years, and the government has started to outline a medium-
term agenda. Hence, a successor DPC of US$20 million is envisaged in FY2011.

5.       The policy actions to be supported by this operation are sharply targeted to the key crisis
areas--fiscal policy and management, social protection, and the financial sector--and the sector
that can lead the recovery--the mining sector. The cross-cutting theme is a familiar one: crisis
brings opportunity. The government is fully aware that the crisis has exposed a number of
mistakes and weaknesses in the policy regime, which it now wants to address with a sense of
urgency. There is a bi-partisan consensus around this recognition, which is demonstrated by the
strong policy actions taken in the last months. And the government also recognizes that the crisis
presents the opportunity to use these corrective actions to put an improved policy framework in
place going forward. For instance, the necessity of agreeing to a set of binding rules to the budget
approval process, which will help Mongolia manage the boom-and-bust cycle of its mining
revenues, is felt more clearly now, during the bust, than previously, during the boom. Re-
targeting the now universal social transfers not only helps restore sustainability to the budget, but
also holds the promise of creating a far more effective social protection program. Similarly,
addressing the current problems of the financial sector in a decisive and transparent manner can
pave the way for a much stronger financial sector in the years to come. Finally, removing the
instability and uncertainty, which had crept into the mining policy framework during the boom
years, sets the stage for a resumption of private sector investment needed to lead the economy out
of the bust.

6.       The support of Mongolia's multilateral and bilateral development partners comes at a
critical time and can have a high impact. This joint support will assist Mongolia to manage the
current downturn and set the stage for economic recovery, allowing the country to continue on the
path taken since 1990. The risks emanating from the external environment are significant, while
domestically, populism could undermine the adjustment efforts and cause social instability.
However, the actions so far taken by the current coalition government and approved by both
parties in Parliament have demonstrated a clear bi-partisan resolve to correct past mistakes and
set the stage for improved economic and fiscal policies. This DPC helps to support this resolve.



                                    II.       COUNTRY CONTEXT


7.       Mongolia has made tremendous political and economic progress since the transition that
started in the 1990s. Five parliamentary elections were held in the period since, and all were
deemed free and fair by international observers. Democratic laws and institutions were put in
place, an active media developed, and a small, but vocal civil society increasingly engages on the
political front. Similarly, in the past 18 years, Mongolia saw considerable success in moving from
a centrally-planned to a market-based economy.

8.       While Mongolia's political environment is dynamic and open, this has also brought its
own challenges to the process of governing, with three governments holding office in the last few
years A new bi-partisan coalition government was formed in the fall of 2008 following some
short-lived disturbances after the June 2008 parliamentary elections. Presidential elections were


at a low risk of debt distress, it will receive all its allocations in the form of credits unless its debt
sustainability position changes. Bank lending to Mongolia, currently on IDA-only terms, represents about
18 percent of the country's overall official development assistance flows (in 2008).

held in May 2009, and the outcome could put strains on the bi-partisan coalition. However,
several observers estimate that the elections are unlikely to have an impact on the currently
existing bi-partisan consensus on, and commitment to, the reform efforts needed to deal with the
economic crisis.

9.       Major mineral deposits, including prospects in the Gobi region, when developed, have
the potential to significantly increase incomes and government revenues. But the risks of a
mineral-dependent economy have also been underscored by deficiencies in Mongolia's
management of the recent boom­which made it more difficult to adjust to the impact of the global
downturn. And as in most mineral-rich economies, managing the resource revenues consistently
and sustainably puts a high premium on governance reforms. The adjustments needed will take
place over the medium term, and include reforms that protect the poor, maintain critical
infrastructure, improve public investment decisions, restructure the banking sector, and resolve
key obstacles for mining and infrastructure development.


         III.      ECONOMIC CONTEXT AND MACROECONOMIC OUTLOOK


10.      Exacerbated by the slump in mineral prices, Mongolia has been one of the East Asian
economies hardest hit by the global downturn. While the government did save part of its mining
windfall during the "boom" years it also funded large increases in untargeted social expenditures,
wages and salaries, and poorly screened investment projects. When the "boom" turned into
"bust", the modest fiscal surplus quickly turned into a large deficit. At the same time, the current
account switched into deficit, and the financial sector, which had been overheating during the
boom period, ran into serious problems, with a major bank having to be put under
conservatorship. However, in response to the crisis, the government took a number of strong
policy actions, which led to an agreement with the IMF on a Stand-By Arrangement (SBA) and
laid the basis for this operation.

    A. Recent Economic Developments


11.      The global economic downturn was transmitted to the Mongolian economy
predominantly through the slump in mineral prices which returned the prices of Mongolia's main
exports back to their 2004 levels (Figure 1). In particular the price of copper fell 60 percent to
US$3500/tonne in March from US$8700/tonne in April 2008.

     12.       The external shock aggravated pre-existing balance of payments pressures. Driven by
     large social transfers and consumption, domestic demand had outstripped GDP growth in the
     previous three years, leading to a deteriorating trade and current account balance. However, the
     added impact of lower commodity prices shifted the current account from a 6.7 percent of GDP
     surplus in 2007 to a 9.6 percent of GDP deficit in 2008 (Figure 2 and Table 1).

     13.       Mongolia is also facing a major slowdown in growth to an estimated 2.7 percent in 2009
     from 8.9 percent in 2008 (Table 1). This reflects developments in key sectors which have driven
     growth in recent years: agriculture, due to falling prices of cashmere and meat; transportation,
     storage and communication, due to weakening in the mining sector; and other services sectors
     (including retail and banking), which had been driven by large public expenditure increases on
     social transfers, and wages and salaries (Figure 3). Contributions to growth from the mining
     sector steadily declined since 2004. Recent monthly data show that while the contraction in
     mining output has stabilized, manufacturing output is still contracting sharply (Figure 4). In
     addition, formal unemployment has been rising since December 2008 while there is anecdotal
     evidence that real wages for unskilled informal labor have fallen sharply, based on recent
     informal market surveys. Furthermore, the prospects for a quick recovery are limited, with
     Mongolia's major export markets facing a prolonged slowdown.

Fiscal policy

14.    During the "boom" years (2003-07), the government ran modest fiscal surpluses, but
these were insufficient to absorb the fiscal shock caused by the collapse of the mineral prices.
Moreover, the fiscal shock was exacerbated because, during the boom years, the government




                                                       5

shifted the fiscal burden away from the non-mining sector,4 leaving the budget increasingly
dependent on revenues from mining (see Table 2). At their peak, mining-related revenues, i.e.
corporate income tax and dividends from mining companies, the Windfall Profits Tax, and
royalties, contributed nearly 40 percent to total revenues.

15.      While before the boom years, social transfers had by and large been targeted to the poor,
thanks to buoyant revenues, these transfers proliferated and became universalized. Equally
problematic, the most important social transfer program, the Child Money Program, was largely
dependent on mining revenues: it received three quarters of its financing from the Mongolian
Development Fund (MDF), which in turn was financed by mineral revenue savings. Moreover,
wages and salaries as a share of GDP increased sharply from 2006 to 2008. And while capital
expenditure was increased, projects frequently lacked feasibility studies and insufficient resources
were set aside for the proper maintenance of existing infrastructure. As a result, the non-mining
fiscal deficit increased dramatically from a 7.3 percent deficit in 2006 to a 15.3 percent of GDP
deficit in 2008 (see Table 2).

16.      In the absence of sufficient fiscal surpluses from previous years, the government's fiscal
position became difficult once fiscal revenues declined as a result of the sharply lower
commodity prices. To keep the fiscal deficit within financeable limits, the government could cut
spending or raise revenues, or both. Since raising revenues is inherently difficult during an
economic downturn, the government had little choice but to cut spending drastically in its 2009
budget.

        17.      Even so, the original 2009 budget needed to be revised soon after it was adopted, due to
        overly optimistic revenue projections. The original 2009 budget was approved in November
        2008, but when the final 2008 budget outturn and the January and February 2009 figures came in,
        it became clear that the expected revenue estimate for the full year was unlikely to be realized
        (Figures 5a-c). Without additional measures, the 2009 budget deficit was heading for 12 percent

        Financial sector

        18.      The global downturn aggravated problems in a financial sector which had been
        overheating during the boom years. During the boom, very high domestic inflation and loose
        monetary policies led to negative real interest rates on local currency deposits, leading to a flight
        of local currency savings into US dollar deposits. This was further aggravated by the BoM
        mopping up local currency as it sold off its international reserves in an attempt to hold on to a de
        facto currency peg to the USD. When a major bank failed in October 2008, and major shortages
        of foreign currency emerged--leading to a substantial deviation between the official Bank of
        Mongolia (BoM) exchange rate and the parallel market rate (Figure 6)5--the public started to lose
        confidence, leading to a flight of MNT, as well as USD deposits.

19.     The financial sector had gone through three distinct phases, starting in 2004 when the
commodity price boom began, and leading up to the recent stress in the financial sector. These
phases can be labeled as follows: sustainable growth, overheating, and loss of confidence.

20.     The first phase, from 2004 to mid-2007, was a period of sustainable growth of loans and
deposits. Commodity prices were beginning to rise. Narrow money and loans grew in line with
nominal GDP growth, non-performing loans (NPLs) were falling (as a share of total loans),
inflation was in single digits and the loans-to-deposits ratio was below 100 percent and stable.
From about 2006, the BoM started to peg the exchange rate to the USD, initially to avoid a strong
appreciation.

21.     Although new banks had been established in the years before, the banking sector was
relatively concentrated as a small number of large banks accounted for the majority of loans and
deposits. However, as a sign of trouble to come, a proliferation of unregulated and financially
weak savings and credit cooperatives led to the failure of 32 of them in 2006, affecting half of all
assets held at these institutions. The resolution of these failures took a long time, which led to
simmering popular distrust in the financial system. By 2007, there were 16 registered banks,
which accounted for 95 percent of total assets in the financial system. Ten were foreign owned.

22.     The second phase, from mid-2007 to mid-2008, exhibited the tell-tale signs of
overheating. Economic growth continued to be high, buoyed by still increasing commodity prices
(approaching their peak) and strong remittances inflows. Narrow money and loan growth started
to exceed nominal GDP growth and deposit growth. Increasingly, loans were directed to real
estate, construction and mortgage lending, leading to a feed-back cycle of rapidly growing
housing prices and more housing-related lending. Although NPLs started to increase, this was
masked by the strong loan growth. As the currency was effectively pegged, the pressure on the
balance of payments amplified due to high imports. Inflation accelerated to double digits. At its
peak it was the highest in the East Asian region and was accompanied by the emergence of
negative real interest rates on MNT deposits (Figure 7).

23.     The third phase started in mid-2008 with the collapse of commodity prices and would
lead to a loss of confidence. Growth had started to slow down, including in those countries
important for remittances to Mongolia. These remittances had traditionally supported real estate
investments, but now, their decrease led a housing price bust. Livestock-related prices such as
cashmere also dropped. A major bank failed, with exposure to other banks. The combined effect
was an increase in NPLs and loans with principal in arrears.



                                                   9

24.      Meanwhile, the pressure on the exchange rate kept growing due to a sudden drop in
export revenues, while imports kept rising. But whereas other major commodity exporters let
their currencies depreciate, Mongolia held on to its peg, leading to loss of US$500 million of
international reserves between July 2008 and February 2009. Despite this support, the currency
depreciated by about 38 percent between the end of October and the middle of March. The public
began to see the exchange rate movements as a one-way bet against the MNT, as pressure on the
exchange rate mounted. And as interest rates on US$ savings were as high as 12 to 18 percent in
some banks, while the real interest rate on MNT deposits was negative, MNT deposits were
converted into FX deposits (Figure 8), further fueling the depreciation of the MNT (Figure 9).
Finally, when the fourth largest bank failed, a general loss of confidence in the financial sector
occurred, leading to a general deposit flight.

Mining sector

25.      Finally, the collapse of mineral prices further depressed sentiment in an already downbeat
mining sector. A major shift in mining policy in 2006 had left Mongolia much less attractive for
mining investment. Parliament had adopted a Windfall Profits Tax (WPT) and introduced the
                                                                                     6

possibility of significant government equity participation of strategic deposits.7 Furthermore,
Parliament had held up approval over two mining project of global importance: the Oyu Tolgoi
(OT, copper and gold) and Tavan Tolgoi (TT, coal) agreements.

26.      Before this policy shift, Mongolia's 1997 Minerals Law was frequently credited with
helping to expand foreign investment in the mining sector and was regarded as among the best
mining laws in Asia and around the world. It established a legal framework for the mining sector

US$500/ounce gold, which would be deposited in the MDF to finance social programs and infrastructure.

other strategic deposits.

that sought to promote private sector participation and FDI. Provisions included first-come, first-
served license application and granting procedures, security of tenure for licensees, regulatory
guidance for environmental protection and obligations for licensees, and provisions for the
assignment and transfer of mineral licenses. When mineral prices started to rise, FDI took off
sharply (Figure 10a). As soon as prices came down, investment started to level off, illustrating the
volatility and instability in the sector created by the policy instability (Figure 10b).

27.      In conclusion, Mongolia was hit hard by the crisis, because the global downturn
accentuated inherent weaknesses in several key areas: fiscal policy and management, social
protection, and the financial sector. In addition, the mineral price shock accentuated the
uncertainty, which had been created earlier in the key sector to lead the recovery--the mining
sector.

    B. Macroeconomic Outlook and Debt Sustainability


28.      With the sharp drop in the global economy and in the economies of Mongolia's trading
partners, the medium-term outlook has deteriorated markedly and become uncertain. With
forecasts trending toward an increasingly deep and prolonged global recession, Mongolia's small,
export-oriented economy is particularly vulnerable to further external shocks. Real GDP growth
is forecast to drop to 2-3 percent in 2009, down from an average of over 9 percent from 2004-08,
as global export demand (in particular from China), private consumption and FDI inflows are
projected to fall.

29.      Faced with the reality of the global downturn and its impact on Mongolia, the
government initially considered a variety of possible responses, including signing long-term
mineral export contracts in exchange for large up-front payments, and implementing a wide-
ranging stimulus package to be funded by a US$1.2 billion sovereign bond. However, as adverse
conditions continued to worsen, a bi-partisan consensus began to emerge around a more
comprehensive policy response, which could be supported by the IMF and other development
partners. These policy changes included strong actions on fiscal, monetary, financial and
exchange rate policies. In March 2009, based on this demonstrated commitment to policy reform,


                                                   11

IMF staff successfully concluded negotiations on a program--the first of its kind in East Asia
since the 1997/98 financial crisis.

30.      Government's commitment was demonstrated by the strength of the corrective actions
taken during the first quarter of 2009. On the fiscal side, Parliament approved, with bi-partisan
support, an amended budget which brought the runaway fiscal deficit back to 5.4 percent of GDP,
consistent with a reduction of the non-mining deficit by 5 percent of GDP in 2009 compared to
2008 outturn. On monetary and exchange rate policies, the BoM raised its policy rate from 9.75
to 14 percent, and started auctioning foreign exchange. And on the financial sector side, an
international auditor was appointed to assess the financial situation of the failed bank.

31.      On April 1, 2009, the IMF Board approved an 18-month SBA of US$229 million. The
choice of the non-concessional, shorter term instrument (repayment in four years with two years
grace) of an SBA over the concessional Poverty Reduction Grant Facility (PGRF) or the
Exogenous Shock Facility (ESF) was justified by the IMF's assessment of a severe, but short
term, balance of payments problem.8 In the case of Mongolia, the extraordinary external shock
coming from the collapse of copper prices created a balance of payments deficit too large to be
financed under either the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) or the ESF. Under the
SBA, however, Mongolia benefits from exceptional access to IMF resources (300 percent of
quota). Mongolia qualified for such access, based on four criteria: (i) exceptional balance of
payments pressures; (ii) high probability that debt remains sustainable; (iii) good prospects for
regaining access to private markets; and (iv) a policy program which provides a reasonably strong
prospect of success.

32.      The main objective of the SBA is to help Mongolia adjust to the shock coming from the
global financial crisis by stabilizing the macroeconomic situation. The center piece is a
substantial fiscal adjustment to deal with the fall in mineral revenues of 10 percent of GDP. Even
after this adjustment, fiscal deficits of 6 and 4 percent of GDP, in 2009 and 2010, respectively,
have been built into the program, amounting to a total financing gap of US$205 million over
2009 and 2010 (Tables 3 and 4). The other building blocks of the SBA are (i) a combination of
monetary and exchange rate policies which would lower inflation and maintain a flexible
exchange rate; (ii) a rebuilding of confidence in the banking sector; and (iii) the protection of the
most vulnerable from the downturn and the adjustments.

33.      Bank staff participated in the IMF missions that prepared the program. The shared
assessment was that the cost of not having a program would be more severe than the risk
involved. The outflow of local currency deposits would likely continue and fiscal pressures would
lead to cash flow problems, resulting in wage and pension debts. Without a solid program, the
government would be forced to monetize the deficit leading to high inflation, while creating
distortions through parallel exchange rates and rationing of foreign currency in order to protect
reserves. The social consequences of such an economic unwinding would be severe.




8Under the PRGF, a country that has a comprehensive country-owned Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper
may borrow up to 140 percent of its IMF quota under a three-year arrangement (185 percent under
exceptional circumstances), see http://www.imf.org/external/np/exr/facts/prgf.htm. The ESF is an
additional facility for PGRF-eligible countries; however access is limited to 75 percent of its quota. See
http://www.imf.org/external/np/exr/facts/esf.htm.

34.      The IMF program was approved under the assumption that the financing gap would be
met by other development partners. To fill the gap, the ADB, Japan and the World Bank made
firm pledges amounting to US$170 million. Several other donors have indicated that they are
preparing to meet the residual financing need for 2009 and 2010. Potential co-financing from
Australia amounting to AUD 5 million (US$3.5 million) and provision of TA by Korea are
expected to support this program. This operation will help crowd in these resources, and ensure a
fully financed program. To mitigate any risk of a financing gap, IMF staff will assess the
availability of financing by the time of the first review in June 2009 and adjust program targets
accordingly if needed. Although the program leaves room for a US$200 million non-concessional
loan, the IMF notes that this will be very difficult under current market conditions. In addition,
such borrowing would have to be consistent with debt sustainability and non-concessional
borrowing limits under the program, and the proceeds should go towards further building
international reserves.9


9As an aside, Mongolia is not subject to IDA's Non-concessional Borrowing Policy, because it has not
benefitted from the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative, nor is it eligible for IDA grants, due its low risk of
debt distress.


                                                      13

35.      Jointly, the IMF and the World Bank also updated the debt sustainability analysis
(DSA).10 It showed that Mongolia was at low risk of external debt distress.11 While the debt ratios
would rise significantly over the next two years, because the government would receive front-
loaded foreign financing to recover from major terms of trade shock, the debt outlook would
recover and improve over the medium term. Key medium-term risks involve large debt service in
2012-15 associated with the repayments to the IMF under the SBA.

36.      The baseline macroeconomic framework takes into consideration the impact of the
substantial fiscal adjustment for 2009-10, but assumes that the economy would return to
sustained growth over the medium term, underpinned by a major mining project. The fiscal
deficit is projected to be 6 percent of GDP in deficit in 2009, as budgeted expenditure has been
adjusted downward to 36.8 percent of GDP in line with the expected reduction in revenue to 30.8
percent of GDP (mainly due to the drop in mining revenues). The deficit is projected to narrow to
4 percent of GDP in 2010, as revenue is expected to pick up, due to growth recovering slightly,
while expenditure is cut further. Assuming the mining development is well-managed and comes
on stream in 2013, both the current account and the fiscal balance are expected to receive a boost
and jump into a prolonged surplus.

37.      The medium-term baseline projection is based on the following assumptions. After a
slowdown in 2009, growth will gradually recover and rebound to 11 percent supported by the
development of the major copper mining project, which will start exports in 2013 and also boost
fiscal revenues. The current account deficit is expected to amount to 6.5 percent of GDP in 2009,
and will remain in deficit until 2012 due to large imports of mining-related investment goods.
After that point, the current account should jump to a substantial surplus in 2013 as mining
exports increase. Inflation is projected to slow to about 5 percent over the medium term.
Expenditures are expected to decline steadily as a share of GDP. Finally, it is assumed that
Mongolia would become eligible for non-concessional borrowing from both the International
Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) and the ADB in 2013, as the mining projects
come on stream. Capital inflows, private external debt and portfolio investment, (which have all
been negligible so far), in addition to FDI, are expected to increase, in line with developments of
mining projects, and substantially help to sustain growth and build international reserves.

38.      Under this scenario, Mongolia's external debt dynamics are at low risk of debt distress,
even though the country's risk has increased considerably (compared to the 2008 DSA) due to a
sharp deterioration in the macroeconomic outlook. Borrowing under the SBA and other donor
financing would increase debt ratios only during the next three years, and would be offset by
Mongolia's substantial mineral wealth potential. Even in a scenario of a significant depreciation
of the currency, external debt rises initially, but is brought steadily downward over time. If a
prudent policy stance is maintained, and a significant portion of the mineral-related flows is
saved, Mongolia would end up as a net external creditor by 2029. If Mongolia manages its
existing debt well and contracts new debt prudently, it should be able to ride out the effects of the
adverse commodity shock and move to a new medium-term development path underpinned by
the commodity sector (see Table 5). This scenario would improve even further if negotiations on
a coal mine12 are concluded as well, which will lead to larger projected FDI inflows in the short
term and export receipts in the medium term.

39.      In the longer run, Mongolia will need to focus on the diversification of its economy, and
remove the binding constraints on growth. Even though Mongolia's mining sector will remain a

dominant source of its economic growth for some time to come, the economic strategy should
create the conditions for economic diversification. Given the typical strength of the currency of a
minerals-based economy, a strategy based on labor-intensive exports is unlikely to be successful.
Instead, maximizing the chances of success across a wide range of potential economic growth
opportunities by investing in general infrastructure and education seems a more promising
approach. In this regard, removing the currently binding constraints associated with infrastructure
bottlenecks, distortionary taxes, lack of trade and logistics coordination internally and
internationally, growing corruption, inadequate contract enforcement, and the high cost of capital
are the most urgent.13 Investing in physical and human capital, while alleviating these binding
constraints, will yield expected outcomes in terms of improving returns to private sector
activities, give firms the opportunity to "innovate" into new products and markets, and into
higher-value-added products. Together with improving governance (often a key challenge for
mineral-rich economies), such a strategy holds the promise of achieving high and sustained
broad-based economic growth over the long term.

40.      However, there are also considerable downside risks, both in the short as well as the long
run. An increasingly deep and prolonged global recession, a prolonged slump of copper prices, or
a significant delay in the development of major mining projects will lead to reduced mineral
revenues and negatively impact growth, the current account and the fiscal balance. In particular,
the impact of the copper price staying 20 percent below the already conservative baseline

scenario of a slow recovery, would increase Mongolia's debt stock indicator above the debt
threshold. This shows that Mongolia remains vulnerable to changes in commodity prices, despite
the substantial increase in export volumes that are expected from the development of the OT
(Oyu Tolgoi) mineral project. Part of this risk will be mitigated if the TT negotiations would also
be concluded successfully in a timely fashion.

41.      Populist pressures could lead to sub-optimal policy actions. Populist pressures could
derail the fiscal, monetary and exchange-rate policy reforms needed to contain the crisis, leading
to a further worsening of the economic situation. And pressures to spend its way out of the crisis
could lead Mongolia to agree to sub-optimal mineral export contracts or non-concessional
financing that negatively impacts debt sustainability. Finally, another risk is that the commitment
to structural reforms could wane if the copper price rebounds substantially, and leave Mongolia
as vulnerable to the next commodity price downturn as it was now.

42.      In conclusion, the macroeconomic policy framework currently in place is adequate and
sustainable for the purposes of the proposed DPC, with important downside risks, but
considerable risks exist. If the country is able to manage the downturn and uses this opportunity
to strengthen economic management, Mongolia could emerge out of the crisis with a stronger
economic and fiscal policy framework than the one with which it entered the crisis. Under the
program supported by the multilateral institutions, fiscal policies would become more sustainable
with the adoption of fiscal rules to limit expenditures and public debt, while enforcing savings
during boom years; social transfers would become considerably more efficient in reducing
poverty; the financial sector would benefit from consolidation and better supervision; and the
mining     sector   would      benefit   from     a   more     competitive     policy    framework.

   IV.      THE GOVERNMENT'S PROGRAM AND PARTICIPATORY PROCESSES


43.      Since the beginning of 2009, the government has taken strong actions on fiscal, monetary
and exchange rate policies to address the crisis.14 On fiscal policy, Parliament approved an
amended 2009 budget projecting a 5.4 percent of GDP deficit in March 2009, mainly by cutting
expenditures. On the exchange rate and monetary policy, the BoM raised the policy rate to allow
a more flexible exchange rate (initially through an auction), while avoiding overshooting and
preserving its foreign exchange reserves (see Table 6).

44.      The main amendments to the 2009 budget included substantial expenditure cuts relative
to the approved 2009 budget (Table 7). First, public investment was cut by MNT 127 billion.
Low-priority new investments, projects for which bidding had not started, and projects for which
no feasibility studies had been conducted were excluded. Second, expenditure on wages and
salaries of public servants was cut by MNT 12 billion and a hiring freeze imposed. Third,
projected interest payments on foreign loans were reduced and are now estimated at MNT 51
billion. This would allow Mongolia only to borrow up to US$50 million on commercial terms
under current market conditions.




14Previously existing government programs, such as the 2008-12 Government Action Plan and the
National Development Strategy, were largely overtaken by events. Even an Anti-Crisis Action Plan
approved in late 2008 is now being reviewed and modified to ensure its appropriateness for the rapidly
changing economic and financial context.

45.      Whereas the amended 2009 budget makes substantial real cuts in total expenditures (of
about 16 percent, compared to 2008), it allows for a significant overall real increase in transfers
(of nearly 10 percent). This category includes intergovernmental transfers (to finance local
government deficits), pensions and social transfers. Wages and salaries see a small reduction in
real terms. The bulk of the reduction in expenditures comes from domestic public investment, and
purchases of goods and services (Table 8).

46.      The Child Money Program saw an important change in its financing. Three quarters of its
financing will come from the savings in the MDF, financed by mining revenues. This allowed a
budget reduction of the universal social transfers by 33 percent (MNT 47 billion out of MNT 142
billion). However, there was no attempt, in this amendment at least, to target these transfers to the
poor. This makes the program very much dependent on the mineral revenues, which is not
optimal, in particular not during the current downturn. The introduction of targeting is urgently
needed, so that the poor can be better protected from the downturn. In June, Parliament is
expected to discuss new amendments to the 2009 budget, which would include steps to
consolidate the various welfare programs, make them easier to administer, make them more
predictable for the Mongolian households, and avoid overlap of payments.

47.      To restore confidence in the tugrug, the BoM raised its key policy rate to 14 percent from
9.75 percent on March 11. This move signals the BoM's intention to bring the tugrug real interest
rates back to positive levels.15 The extent of the move was aimed to change the public's
expectations, in particular the one-way bet against the domestic currency. Changing these
expectations will prevent the exchange rate from overshooting and preserves international
reserves, as the BoM allows the exchange rate to adjust more flexibly, initially through an auction
system. Hence, since March 31, the BoM has started to buy and sell FX reserves via an auction
and published the results on its website. Compared to the administrative rationing in place before,
this has also greatly improved transparency.

48.      In addition to the raising of the policy rate and the introduction of a foreign exchange
auction, the BoM took several other steps to restore confidence. First, the BoM appointed an
international reputable auditor to undertake a portfolio audit and develop a restructuring plan for
the failed bank. This also will help to set new standards in dealing with future bank failures, if
any. Second, the BoM increased the capital adequacy requirements for commercial banks from 10
to 12 percent by the end of 2009. This is a check on the commitment of owners of the banks and
the resource mobilization capacity of each bank. It also strengthens the capital base of those
banks who are able to meet the higher requirements, and encourages the banks to address their
portfolio quality issues and reduce the weight of the riskier assets in their portfolio. Third, the
BoM revised and clarified the deposit guarantee law to cover current accounts, savings accounts,
time deposits and interbank deposits. To prevent abuse and unnecessary fiscal costs, deposits of
"related parties" and those of holders of subordinated debt were excluded. The deposit guarantee
law was instated in November 2008 to stop the deposit flight, but it had left many customers in
uncertainty about which deposits were included.

49.      Building on the momentum created by these corrective measures, the government has
also begun to outline the main policy actions of an indicative medium-term economic strategy.
This emerging framework takes off from the government's short-term plan of action for the next
18 months, which is consistent with the IMF agreement and the on-going dialogue with the key
development partners who are planning to provide budget support. At the external development
partners' conference held on March 14, 2009, the minister of finance presented the most recent
medium-term thinking within government in the following areas: (i) fiscal sustainability; (ii)
social protection; (iii) restoring confidence in the financial sector; and (iv) mining development.

50.      To avoid a repeat of the "boom-and-bust" spending pattern that Mongolia has just
experienced, the government plans to submit to Parliament a draft law on Fiscal Responsibility in
2009. This law will ensure that mining revenues are better managed in the future. Another
objective will be to improve the planning and budgeting for public investments. Similarly, the
budget amendment's exclusion of non-priority projects and projects without feasibility studies


15As inflation fell to 12 percent year on year in April, the policy rate is now just positive in real terms.


                                                     19

will set the tone for a considerable strengthening of the procedures to select and develop
investment projects to be financed by the state budget. Finally, it will prioritize the protection of
infrastructure maintenance--critical during the downturn.

51.      The medium­term goal of the envisaged reforms with respect to social transfers is to
better protect the poor by targeting the currently untargeted grants (in particular, the Child Money
Program). During 2009, the government will propose to Parliament legislation which will
consolidate several existing social transfer programs into one social protection program and
reintroduce targeting. Work will also start on establishing an improved proxy-means test (PMT)
and a national beneficiary database. To better track the impact of the new social protection
program, the Bank will assist the government to design and implement an impact evaluation. The
goal will be to gradually improve the PMT-based targeting, so that by December 2010, the
beneficiary database has been completed at the national level.

52.      In the financial sector, the objective is to ensure its continued stability by intensifying
supervision and taking decisive action in case of bank failures in order to retain confidence in the
financial sector. In addition, a restructuring of the banking sector is envisaged, supported by a
well-sequenced increase of paid-in capital of commercial banks.

53.      Indicative medium-term reforms in the mining sector have as their objective to improve
the legal environment, sector policies, and increase the number of skilled Mongolians in the
workforce. Based on the recent experience gained during the negotiations of a major investment
agreement, the government will develop and adopt draft model investment agreements, which
future negotiations can use as their starting point. New regulations will also be issued to improve
the functioning of the mining cadastre by the Cabinet. By 2011, the goal is to have mining
projects follow responsible mining practices. Adherence to this regulatory framework will be
monitored strictly, using enhanced regulatory capacity. In order to increase the employment for
the Mongolian workforce in mining, the government will substantially increase the number of
Mongolians to be trained in the relevant mining skills.

54.      In conclusion, the government's short-term plan of action for the next 18 months is clear.
It is based on the agreement with the IMF and dialogue with key development partners planning
to provide budget support. Using the short-term corrective measures already taken and envisaged
as stepping stones, the government has started to outline a longer-term agenda for economic
policy focused on restoring the goal of fostering sustainable, shared growth.




             V.      BANK SUPPORT TO THE GOVERNMENT'S PROGRAM


     A. Link to the proposed Interim Strategy Note (ISN)

55.      Given the economic crisis, far-advanced preparations for a new Country Partnership
Strategy (CPS) were deferred in early 2009 in favor of a recently approved Interim Strategy to
provide a bridging framework for an 18-month period until economic conditions stabilize. The
Interim Strategy positions the Bank to support the government in addressing urgent crisis needs
and easing the fiscal adjustment, but also to support renewed efforts to make reforms that will
reduce the impact of future shocks. As conditions stabilize and there is a clearer planning horizon,
a four-year CPS will be prepared, supporting Mongolia's medium-term agenda.

56.      Under the Interim Strategy, the majority of new IDA resources will be shifted from
previously planned investment projects to DPCs. Two single-tranche DPCs (US$40 million in


                                                 20

FY10 and US$20 million in FY11), totaling SDR 40 million and representing two-thirds of the
notional IDA 15 envelope of SDR 60 million,16 are envisaged. They will support key policy
reforms to improve macro and fiscal sustainability in a mineral-based economy, protect the poor
and vulnerable, restore confidence in the financial sector, and encourage transparent and prudent
mining investments and a more competitive and stable medium-term business investment climate.
Active projects and analytical work are also being realigned, as appropriate, to support these
policy reforms (see Section D below). The Interim Strategy envisaged the current, first DPC of
US$40 million equivalent to target the key crisis areas (fiscal policy and management, social
protection, and the financial sector) and the mining sector, which will be important for medium-
term recovery.

    B. Consultations held in preparation for the proposed operation

57.     The policy measures supported in this proposed operation are informed by an intensive
consultation process involving key stakeholders. The main activities included:

    ·   Mongolia: Mining and Infrastructure Conference, Apr 13 - 14, 2009. The event
        brought parliament members, government officials, private sector representatives, civil
        society organizations, and external partners together to exchange ideas about how best to
        develop the mining sector in a sustainable manner, and to deliver the infrastructure
        needed to support mining activities. International experts included Mr. Eduardo Anina
        (former Finance Minister of Chile), who shared his country's experience in prudently
        managing mining revenues.

    ·   Government of Mongolia-External Partners Meeting, Apr 7, 2009. At this meeting,
        attended by the prime minister, cabinet ministers, parliamentarians and the full economic
        team, the minister of finance and the governor of the BoM presented the government's
        response to the crisis, and outlined elements of a medium-term agenda.

    ·   Public Expenditure and Financial Management Review dissemination, Feb 3-5, 2009.
        The report was launched at the Academy of Management. The findings of the PEFMR
        were presented and discussed in a series of four policy debates--fiscal and public
        financial management, social protection, health, and education--with the participation of
        key stakeholders, including the deputy minister for finance, the minister of social welfare
        and labor, the deputy minister of health, and the minister of education, culture and
        science. The meetings were used as platforms for discussing immediate policy actions
        necessary in the context of the current economic downturn. Main discussion topics
        pertained to the severe economic downturn faced by Mongolia, what to do about it, and
        how expenditures should be prioritized. Selected media were invited to attend these
        policy debates.

    ·   Mongolia Economic Policy Conference, Oct 28, 2008. The objectives of the conference
        were to discuss the opportunities and challenges of mineral-rich economies. The
        conference was organized by the government and the World Bank Group, and attended
        by a wide range of senior policy makers and experts, including the president, the prime
        minister and the minister of finance. Justin Yifu Lin, Chief Economist of the World
        Bank; Yegor Gaidar, former Prime Minister of Russia; and Professor Richard Pomfret
        delivered key note speeches.

    ·   Economic Updates. In response to public demand, the Bank increased the frequency of
        the Economic Updates from quarterly to monthly. The October 2008 Quarterly stressed
        the negative impact of the global slowdown on the fiscal and current deficits. The


16About US$60 million and about US$90 million respectively at the present exchange rate.


                                                21

        February 2009 Quarterly honed in on the policy options available to the government. The
        April monthly focused on the actions taken by the government. These updates received
        widespread attention and appreciation, by the press and key policy makers.

    ·   Policy dialogue with government and Parliament. At every stage during the
        preparation of this operation, the Bank team has had intensive dialogue with senior policy
        makers and key members of parliament on the government's evolving action plan in light
        of the deteriorating economic situation. This iterative process resulted in strong
        ownership and full transparency on the contents of the proposed DPC.

    C. Collaboration with the IMF and Other Donors


58.     The partnership between the IMF and the Bank in the preparation of the SBA has been
very strong and complementary. Bank staff participated in all IMF missions, leading up to the
SBA Board approval. A joint IMF/Bank mission was also undertaken to Japan to ensure proper
coordination with the authorities there (see Annex 4 for the draft indicative IMF/World Bank
policy matrix).

59.     Collaboration with the ADB has been equally strong, in particular in the area of social
protection. A joint team of the ADB and the World Bank is currently assisting the government
with key reforms in its social welfare system in order to better protect the poor during the
downturn. The IMF and the World Bank, with ADB participation, also conducted an updated debt
sustainability analysis.

60.     The Mongolian government's Letter of Intent to the IMF recognizes the joint assistance
of the IMF, the ADB and the World Bank in support of the following key policy reforms:

    1. Strengthening the institutional framework for fiscal policy to prevent the repeat of the
        boom and bust cycles of recent years and ensure the long-term sustainability of its
        policies by submitting a Fiscal Responsibility Law to Parliament (supported by IMF and
        World Bank assistance).

    2. Overhauling its social transfer programs, improving targeting and raising the level of
        social support to the very poor (supported by IMF, ADB and World Bank assistance).

    3. Further strengthening of the banking system by improving the current framework for
        deposit guarantees and enhancing bank supervision (with IMF and World Bank
        assistance).

    D. Relationship to other Bank operations


61.     Under the World Bank Group's Interim Strategy, the existing loan portfolio is being
redirected and disbursements accelerated to address short-term crisis needs. The portfolio is
strongly focused on improving the livelihoods of the poor, both in the rural as well as in the urban
areas.

62.     The Sustainable Livelihoods Project II and International Finance Corporation (IFC)
investments will continue to expand rural access to microcredit and other financial services, in
coordination with commercial banks, NBFIs,17 and other external partners. Additional finance is
being sought to ensure sustainability and expand geographic coverage of the ongoing Index-
Based Livestock Insurance Project, an innovative pilot project that is introducing market-based


17Non-bank financial institution.


                                                22

insurance products to herders that provide coverage in the event of catastrophic weather events.
Additional finance would allow livestock insurance to be introduced in more provinces, build the
necessary institutional framework to sustain the insurance, and pre-finance an important potential
government liability that insures herders against major natural disasters. An amendment to the
insurance law which would allow banks to become insurance agents and provide an integrated
package of credit and insurance to herders, could be supported in a second DPC.

63.       To help vulnerable populations in Ulaanbaatar, with an emphasis on peri-urban ger18 area
residents, activities include additional financing of an ongoing Energy Project to support urgent
maintenance of Ulaanbaatar's antiquated electricity distribution infrastructure -- a priority also
supported under the DPC's focus on ensuring budget allocations to the maintenance of key
infrastructure.

64.       The ambitious policy reform agenda envisaged under the ISN and its DPCs will also
require considerable capacity-building, together with targeted, just-in-time technical assistance,
and stepped-up efforts at public outreach and dialogue. The ISN supports these activities as
follows:
    ·     Current technical assistance projects (GAP, ECTAC, Mining TA) are being adjusted to
          link with the policy reform agenda supported by the DPC, drawing on findings under the
          recently completed Public Expenditure and Financial Management Review (World Bank,
          2009b) and other studies. In addition, a new technical assistance (TA) support program is
          being developed to support the policy reforms on social protection. The Bank will also
          step up support to government's efforts to increase budget transparency, including in
          implementing the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI).19

    ·     The Mining TA and Governance Partnership Facility (GPF) will strengthen government
          and independent capacity for mining and related economic policy analysis. The ongoing
          Mining TA will also support development of governance, financial and fiduciary
          arrangements for the Erdenes state holding company consistent with corporate
          governance principles.

    ·     A statistical capacity building project, under preparation in parallel to this DPC, can
          improve the quality of key statistical systems and strengthen targeting of development
          resources, critical to the enhanced economic statistics needed to manage the current
          downturn.

    ·     The GPF grant will support the policy reform agenda through financing independent
          analysis, public outreach on select policy issues, and introduction of demand-side tools to
          foster transparency and accountability.

    ·     Finally, the Bank Group will also support enhanced capacity in the BoM, Ministry of
          Finance (MoF), Prime Minister's Office, and the newly formed National Development
          and Innovation Committee to help strengthen implementation of the government's reform
          program.

    ·     Potential co-financing from Australia amounting to AUD 5 million (US$3.5 million) and
          provision of TA by Korea are expected to support this program.


18A ger is the traditional dwelling tent of the Mongolian people.
19The EITI program is meant to strengthen governance by improving transparency and accountability in
the extractives sector through the publication of private companies' payments and the disclosure of
government's receipts of oil, gas and mining. Mongolia is about to complete its second reconciliation report
since it joined EITI in 2006. It has been identified as one of four countries in line to be declared as "EITI
compliant" following an independent validation.


                                                     23

65.     The IFC addresses the current weaknesses in the financial markets and real sectors
through investment and advisory service programs. This work includes: (i) providing technical
assistance to BoM and banks on strategies and methods of dealing with the financial crisis,
including NPL management and increasing liquidity; (ii) collaborating with other international
financial institutions to address specific capital requirements of the banking system; (iii)
developing the non-bank financial sector including leasing; (iv) addressing liquidity needs of
investment clients; (v) identifying opportunities to invest in import substitution industries, in
particular aiming at food security and quality; (vi) improving inspection regimes and corporate
governance to increase efficiency and improve market practice; and (vii) creating opportunities
for Mongolia to participate in IFC's crisis response facilities, including bank capitalization, trade
finance, and microfinance liquidity. IFC investments in the real sector will help diversify
Mongolia's economic base.

66.     The Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) will also continue to supplement
the work of the Bank and the IFC by offering its guarantee product in support of private
investment into the country.

     E. Performance & Key Lessons Learned


67.     Mongolia has had limited experience with policy-based lending. Two operations
(Economic Transition Support Credit 20 and the Banking and Enterprise Sector Adjustment
Credit21) were approved in the early/mid 1990s and the Financial Sector Adjustment Credit22 was
approved in 2000. A planned series of single-tranche programmatic Structural Adjustment Loans,
envisaged in the April 2004 Country Assistance Strategy never materialized. In June 2004, the
first Poverty Reduction Support Credit (PRSC) under this series was withdrawn after negotiations
and prior to Board consideration because of concerns, shared by the IMF, which let its PRGF
lapse in parallel, about the non-transparent nature of decisions taken on rescheduling of Russian
debt to Mongolia. A Quality Assurance Group Learning Review later concluded that this was a
highly appropriate decision. The dialogue on a possible PRSC was pursued until September 2005,
when it was replaced by a TA operation (the Governance Assistance Project).

68.     Although these operations were implemented under greatly differing situations, a number
of lessons remain valid and this operation's design has benefitted from them:

     ·  Continuing commitment, support and ownership from the senior leadership in the
        government are needed during project preparation and implementation, in particular
        when there are changes in the administration. Consequently, during the preparation of
        this operation, dialogue was continuously and systematically pursued with senior
        policymakers of both coalition parties.

     ·  The weak capacity and lack of information sharing among government agencies requires
        more awareness-raising seminars and workshops for senior and mid-level officials for
        policy changes to increase ownership. Section V.B above lists the various activities used
        to raise such awareness during the preparation of this DPC.

     ·  Technical assistance operations and capacity building programs are necessary to both
        prepare the ground for and support implementation of adjustment operations. Three
        existing operations have been restructured to focus directly on the policy areas covered in
        the DPC. A new TA support program on social protection is being developed.

                                                24

    ·   Timing is important for the institutional-building components, especially in countries
        with weak civil service such as Mongolia. The time needed to introduce fundamental
        changes, as well as build improved institutions, require careful programming and
        sequencing. The combination and sequencing of policy-lending and TA projects under
        the Interim Strategy, followed by a medium-term assistance strategy to build and deepen
        the reforms, attempts to operationalize this particular lesson.

    ·   Donor coordination is essential to ensure the rehabilitation of key sectors, especially
        where individual donor resources are limited. Close cooperation between donors in
        Mongolia clearly enhances synergy. During preparation, the government and the
        multilateral and bilateral development partners have worked closely and jointly to
        coordinate their support to the policy reform agenda.

    F. Analytical Underpinnings


69.     The proposed DPC can fortunately draw on a wealth of recently conducted analytical
work on fiscal policy and management (including reform and infrastructure), social protection,
the financial sector, the mining sector and governance.23

    ·   The fiscal policy and management agenda is underpinned by the 2009 World Bank Public
        Expenditure and Financial Management Review, the 2008 World Bank Governance
        Assessment Report, a series of studies on improving medium-term program budgeting
        undertaken under an existing TA project (the ECTAC project), the 2008 IMF report on
        "Budget Preparation: A Roadmap for Institutional Strengthening", and the 2007 World
        Bank report "Foundation for Sustainable Development: Rethinking the Delivery of
        Infrastructure Services in Mongolia". These studies highlight the weaknesses in the
        budget formulation and public investment planning processes in Mongolia, including the
        political preference for funding new investments over maintaining the existing capital
        stock, leading to the chronic underfunding of maintenance; the significant discretion of
        Parliament to add new projects to the public investment plan without any the need for a
        formal appraisal process, including a feasibility study; and the institutional weaknesses
        and poor procedures along the length of the project cycle.

    ·   Reforms in social protection are buttressed by the following studies, the 2009 World
        Bank Public Expenditure and Financial Management Review and "Assessment of the
        Child Money Program and properties of its targeting methodology," (Araujo, 2006).

    ·   Financial sector reforms can draw on the 2008 World Bank-IMF Financial Sector
        Assessment Report, and more recent World Bank reviews and assessments of the banking
        sector and recent developments (undertaken in 2008 and 2009).

    ·   In the mining sector, as a background study for this DPC, a mining revenue management
        options study, "Copper revenues and sustainable fiscal policy in Mongolia" (Budina, Van
        Wijnbergen and Li, 2009), was commissioned, which is currently under review.

    ·   In the area of governance, the DPC program is also informed by the governance
        challenges identified in the 2008 Governance Assessment Report associated with the
        mining taxation regime, the cadastre and licensing system, and the transparency of, and
        accountability for, mining revenues.




23Annex 3 links the prior actions in each of the policy areas directly to the relevant analytical work.

               VI.    THE PROPOSED LOAN: OPERATION DESCRIPTION


70.      The World Bank's proposed DPC is a single-tranche operation of US$40 million. While
it is acknowledged that, because of the magnitude of the shock, the adjustment effort will take
place over the next several years, the proposed instrument is a one-off single-tranche operation,
because of the many uncertainties and risks and the absence of a coherent and detailed medium-
term policy framework. This DPC is designed to assist the government in managing the
downturn, triggered by the collapse of the copper price, by supporting government efforts in the
policy areas most affected: (i) fiscal policy and management, given the budget's strong
dependence on mining revenues; (ii) social protection, given the impact of the economic
downturn on the poor; (iii) the financial sector, which was overheating when the global crisis hit,
and which experienced a major bank failure in late 2008; and (iv) the mining sector, given the
sector's importance in driving the recovery.

71.      A one-off operation, rather than a series, is judged to be a more appropriate instrument in
the current environment. The government is currently revising its medium-term plan, and seeking
to build consensus in Parliament. For that reason, defining specific prior actions for a DPC series
would be premature. However, the authorities have prepared an initial three-year policy matrix to
facilitate consensus-building around the reform agenda among the stakeholders. This framework
also provides an indication of the policy areas where the Bank and other development partners are
likely to engage with the government over the next few years. It is expected that a medium-term
reform agenda will be adopted later in the year.

72.      Although the policy actions to be supported by this operation are focused on managing
the downturn and urgently taking corrective action, this crisis also presents the government with
the opportunity to work towards putting in place a better medium-term framework going forward.
The necessity of agreeing to a set of binding rules to the budget approval process, which will help
Mongolia manage the boom and bust cycle of its mining revenues, may be felt more clearly now,
during the bust, than previously, during the boom. Re-introducing the targeting of social transfers
will not only save money, but will create a far more efficient poverty reduction program.
Similarly, addressing the current problems of the banking sector in a decisive and transparent way
can pave the way for a much stronger banking sector in the years to come. Finally, removing the
instability on mining policies sets the stage for increased, sustainable private sector investment to
lead the recovery.

                            Box 1. Good Practice Principles for Conditionality

Principle 1: Reinforce Ownership

The sudden onset of the economic crisis required the recently elected coalition government to make major
shifts in fiscal, monetary and exchange rate policies. This has not been easy, but the strong policy actions
taken in recent months demonstrate growing government ownership of the reform package needed.
Program design has benefited from systematic dialogue with key government officials and representatives
of both political parties, and has included consultations on individual policy reforms with the Prime
Minister and the Speaker of Parliament. In addition, a series of outreach and dissemination events of topical
analytical work and regular economic updates further helped raise awareness and ownership during
program design (Section V.B). However, risks remain, as indicated by the earlier experience with policy-
based lending (Section V.E). And a resurgence of the price of copper could undermine the current bi-
partisan commitment to reform (see the risk section, VIII.F).

Principle 2: Agree up front with the government and other financial partners on a coordinated
accountability framework

Government and the key development partners (viz. the IMF, the ADB, Japan and the World Bank) have
worked closely together in the design of the overall reform package. Joint work in several areas is being
undertaken, and a clear division of labor, which avoids overlapping or contradictory conditionality, has
been established. A special meeting to coordinate the support of the development partners was held, and a
joint policy matrix is currently being established by the government as the various support packages are
finalized.

Principle 3: Customize the accountability framework and modalities of Bank support to country
circumstances

The modalities and timing of the operation have been designed to support policy reforms in the key areas
most affected by the downturn and to meet the government's urgent need for financing of its budget gap.
The DPC will be processed under the IDA Financial Crisis Response Fast-Track Facility to accelerate the
disbursement. The short-term policy responses supported provide clear signals of the government's policy
directions for the medium term. However, a robust medium-term strategy still needs to be fully fleshed out.
Sensitive reforms such as the targeting of social transfers and the adoption of fiscal rules for the
management of mining revenues are in the process of being backed by analytical work done by the
development partners. This work will outline policy options for broader consultation.

Principle 4: Choose only actions critical for achieving results as conditions for disbursement

Only eight prior actions have been chosen in four key sectors. These actions were focused on achieving
concrete results for managing the downturn and laying the basis for an improved policy framework going
forward. All but two of the prior actions focus on implementation rather than action plans.

Principle 5: Conduct transparent progress reviews conducive to predictable and performance-based
financial support

It is a single-tranche DPC so there are only prior actions. The timing of the disbursement is in line with the
budget cycle in the sense that is helping to fill a financing gap. Preparation of a second DPC will start
immediately and will involve monitoring the evolving policy reform agenda and supporting the next set of
policy actions.




                                                     27

73.      The prior actions supported by the DPC are the following:

    ·    Fiscal policy and management

              o Capital budget planning and screening is improved, as demonstrated by the
                   exclusion of 30 projects without feasibility studies from the 2009 budget, as
                   amended in March.

              o Capital expenditures for the maintenance of basic infrastructure in the transport,
                   education and health sectors is protected, as evidenced by: (i) the increase in the
                   ratio of capital repairs to new investments from 2.5 percent (in the original
                   approved budget for 2009) to 3.4 percent (in the amended budget for 2009); and
                   (ii) the allocation of MNT 12.4 billion for that purpose.

    ·    Social protection

              o The Ministry of Social Welfare and Labor has prepared a time-bound action plan
                   to clean its roster of beneficiaries of the CMP, in order to reduce leakage to the
                   non-poor and improve its targeting on the poor.

    ·    Financial sector

              o The BoM has prepared an action plan for the restructuring/resolving of the bank
                   currently under the conservatorship, on the basis of the bank's portfolio
                   diagnostic and audit carried out by an internationally reputable auditor.

              o The BoM has issued a decree requiring that all banks report on a daily basis on
                   key indicators regarding their liquidity and asset quality.

              o The BoM has established a crisis management and systemic risk monitoring task
                   force with adequate functions and powers, qualified staff and sufficient resources
                   to carry out its mandate.

    ·    Mining

              o The Ministry of Mineral Resources and Energy has developed and adopted
                   model investment agreements for the mining sector, clarifying Mongolia's
                   mining policy, including taxation and the state's capital participation, and
                   incorporating responsible mining practices consistent with the Equator
                   Principles.24

              o Sufficient resources have been transferred to the Mongolia EITI Secretariat in
                   order to finance an independent validation of its national EITI Program,
                   scheduled to be completed by March 31, 2010.




24The Equator Principles are the set of principles and financial industry benchmarks developed by private
financial institutions for determining assessing and managing social and environmental risks in project
financing. They were established in June 2003 and revised in July 2006, and modeled after the
environmental standards adopted by the World Bank and social policies promoted by the International
Financial Corporation.

74.       The collapse of the mineral prices, in particular copper, resulted in a huge fiscal shock,
but also revealed a lack of proper management of mining revenues. Even though Mongolia did
save part of the mining windfall during the "boom" years, these were not enough to withstand a
commodity price shock of this magnitude. However, domestic policies also contributed. First,
during the "boom" years, the budget had become more and more dependent on the mining
revenues (see Table 2). Second, the non-mining deficit, i.e., expenditures relative to non-mining
revenues, rose dramatically, and, as has now become clear, unsustainably.

75.       The windfall was used mostly for capital expenditure, across the board wage increases
and untargeted social transfers. Capital expenditure more than tripled between 2006 and 2008 and
was not subject to feasibility studies whereas maintenance of existing infrastructure was
neglected (see next paragraphs). This provides the rationale why the 2009 budget amendment
focuses on canceling expenditure on projects without such feasibility studies. The additional
revenues were also used to make previously targeted social transfers universal, and to increase
wages and salaries (Figure 11).

76.       Capital budget planning and execution is hindered as Parliament has a substantial role in
funding the public investment program. One important aspect of budget management in Mongolia
is that the budget proposal made by the Minister of Finance to Parliament can be amended in
many ways. As a result, overall fiscal targets can be overridden and key assumptions changed
(about mineral prices for instance). Additional capital projects can be included even in instances
in which these have not been subject to feasibility studies as required by the Public Sector and
Management of Finance Law (PSMFL). In this way, Parliamentary action increased the public

investment program budget by 52 percent in 2007 (1.9 percent of GDP) and by 21 percent in
2008 (1.6 percent of GDP), see Figure 12. More generally, the legal framework for budget
formulation, governed primarily by the PSMFL is silent on any limits on legislative changes.
Hence, the pro-cyclical pattern of fiscal policy was amplified by a powerful Parliament over-
riding the government's budget proposals.

                            Figure 12. Parliament has a substantial
                         influence over the public investment program

                         Note: This includes both the state budget and the
                              Mongolian Development Fund

77.      At the same time, insufficient resources were set aside for the proper maintenance of
existing infrastructure. Repairs and maintenance expenditures have not kept pace with the rapid
increases in capital expenditures -- declining from a ratio of 10.5 percent in 2004 to 5.8 percent
in 2008 -- compromising the sustainability of these projects and creating liabilities for the future
(Figure 11).

78.      However, the amended budget approved by Parliament in March 2009 demonstrates
Parliament's commitment to taking corrective action. First, it keeps the deficit to below 6 percent
of GDP deficit in 2009. If this amendment had not been made, the deficit would have spiraled to
over 12 percent of GDP. The size of the corrective action is a demonstration of the seriousness
and understanding of Parliament in dealing with this crisis. Second, the 2009 budget shows a
decreased dependence of mining-related revenues, partly as a result of increasing non-mining
revenues. The non-mining deficit is projected to narrow to 10.4 percent of GDP in 2009 from
15.3 percent of GDP in 2008. And third, Parliament has initiated a more prudent screening of
investment projects by postponing until the next budget all projects in the current for which no
feasibility studies had been conducted. Parliament also postponed all new projects for which
tenders have not been announced or construction contracts not finalized.

79.      These are steps in the right direction. The DPC's objective regarding ensuring fiscal
sustainability is to make sure that the current fiscal adjustments do not undermine future growth
prospects, but lay the basis for strengthening the capital budgeting process and improving fiscal
management in a mining-based economy.

    b) Key measures to be supported by the DPC

80.     The DPC will support government's efforts to maintain capital maintenance expenditures
in the budget for existing basic infrastructure (viz. roads, schools, hospitals) and the removal of
projects without feasibility studies. The budget for capital repairs (MNT 12.4 billion) will be
protected, and the ratio of capital repairs to new investments increased from 2.5 percent in the
original, approved budget to 3.4 percent in the amended budget for 2009. These actions set the
stage for increasing capital maintenance in the future and a better prioritization of capital
spending over the medium term. The DPC will assist the government to ensure that the necessary
fiscal adjustment reflected in the 2009 amended budget adheres to clear criteria for prioritizing
capital expenditures so as to minimize the impact on long-term growth. The reduction in capital
expenditures will be guided by the following principles: high priority projects will be maintained,
but all on-going projects that have entered implementation stage will be funded to ensure
completion, and all new projects without feasibility studies will be removed.

81.     For the medium term, it is necessary that during 2009 the economic classification of
maintenance is improved, so that all maintenance and repair expenditures are adequately recorded
and budgeted. The category of "capital repairs" in the budget underestimates total maintenance
expenditures as a fraction of the "Road Fund" and "domestic investment" categories is used for
maintenance and repairs. Based on this improved classification, the government can then set
targets for adequate maintenance expenditures as a share of new investment for the 2010 and
2011 budgets.

82.     Recognizing the urgent need for an agency at the center of government to manage and
coordinate the national planning system, the government has recently established the National
Development and Innovation Committee under the Prime Minister's office. The Committee's
mandate includes the preparation of a medium-term development plan, screening of the
investment projects of line ministries to ensure that they conform to national priorities, and
establishing arrangements for public-private partnerships in infrastructure. The Bank will provide
technical assistance to the Committee to help it realize these key objectives, including developing
and implementing robust criteria for project selection and appraisal to ensure that only those
projects enter the budget that fit into national strategic priorities and their operation and
maintenance is adequately funded.

83.     These measures will be complemented with continuous capacity building and technical
assistance. The Bank is providing on-going support in the Governance Assistance Project (GAP)
and the Economic Capacity and Technical Assistance Project (ECTAC). The ECTAC project
funds are being reallocated to be better synchronized with the DPC actions, and with the
requirements imposed by the economic crisis. The Bank has been effectively coordinating
technical assistance with the Fiscal Affairs Department of the IMF and looks forward to a
continued partnership.

84.     Government is planning to improve fiscal management going forward by setting binding
expenditure limits for government and Parliament. In Mongolia, the PSFML requires a medium-
term fiscal framework (MTFF) to be in place, but is largely silent on its content, the institutional
responsibilities for its development, and does not require Parliament to approve budgets that
conform to its fiscal targets. The law requires the submission to Parliament, by May 1, of a Fiscal
Framework Statement (FFS) that contains the MTFF outlining the government's medium term
objectives and fiscal targets. The MoF, specifically the Economic Policy Department and the
Fiscal Policy and Coordination Department, are responsible for the preparation of the MTFF. The
current MTFF targets a deficit of 3 percentage of GDP, which has resulted in a pro-cyclical fiscal
policy. The government is committed to adopt a more appropriate fiscal rule to anchor the FFS.


                                                 31

85.      Where fiscal rules have been used to govern budgetary use of volatile natural resource
income in other countries, they have essentially been of three types: (a) the permanent income
rule (PI), whereby transfers from the resource fund are set at their "permanent income
equivalent", i.e., at a level that can be maintained forever given expectations about future
extraction and prices; (b) the bird-in-the-hand rule (Norway), whereby expenditure from the fund
is restricted to its (real) interest income; and (c) the reference price rule, whereby transfers are set
at the revenue level that would have accrued if a particular reference price would have prevailed.
Considerable care needs to be taken to adopt the appropriate fiscal rule tailored to Mongolia's
circumstances and the Fiscal Responsibility Law (FRL) should be based on a discussion of
different options that are thoroughly debated in Parliament.

86.      The Ministry of Finance, with technical assistance from the IMF and the World Bank, is
drafting a new FRL that would institutionalize such a fiscal rule. The World Bank is currently
undertaking analytical work to assist with the formulation of these options. The draft law will
anchor fiscal policy in an appropriate fiscal rule that reduces the impact of the volatility of
mineral prices on the budget, and requires that the MTFF, budgets, and budget amendments be
within the constraints of the fiscal rule limits. Submission to Parliament of the FRL by December
31, 2009 is a Structural Benchmark of the IMF program.

87.      As part of the emerging medium-term agenda, the government intends to make
complementary amendments to some of the provisions in the existing Law on Parliamentary
Procedures that govern the budget discussions in Parliament to complement the FRL and to avoid
any potential loopholes regarding the restrictions imposed in Parliament in the FRL.

88.      As mentioned, Mongolia's legal framework gives unusual powers to the Parliament to
engage in budget planning. Parliament has the authority to amend the budget without regard to
the fiscal targets set in the MTFF, such as increasing total appropriations. The PSMFL gives
inadequate attention to capital budgeting, does not enforce a comprehensive budget, especially
with regards to the treatment of extra-budgetary funds and quasi-government entities, and
provides little guidance to structuring medium-term fiscal and budgetary processes.25 Some
features of the legal framework, in particular the provisions for performance management and full
accrual accounting, may also not be suitable for Mongolia at its current stage of institutional
development.

89.      The submission of a draft new Integrated Budget Law (IBL) to Parliament is a key
element of the government's medium-term reform program. With technical assistance from the
IMF and the World Bank, the government is preparing the draft new IBL for submission to
Parliament in the fall 2009 session. The draft law will address the identified pitfalls of the current
legal framework as described above.

90.      While improvements in the legal framework and in capital budgeting are the top priorities
for the government, it is also important to sustain the momentum in second-generation reforms to
introduce medium-term program budgeting. With technical assistance from the ECTAC project,
the Ministry of Finance has been making gradual but steady progress in this area and in 2009, and
following a government resolution of June 2008, portfolio ministries for the first time submitted
program-based budgets for 2009-11. These budgets at present are only documents and
considerable work is required to modify institutional processes to make them operational. Both
the IMF and the World Bank are providing technical assistance for the preparation and
implementation of an implementation action plan for the phased introduction of medium term
program budgeting.

91.     DPC prior actions

    ·   Capital budget planning and screening is improved, as demonstrated by the exclusion of
        30 projects without feasibility studies from the 2009 budget, as amended in March.
    ·   Capital expenditures for the maintenance of basic infrastructure in the transport,
        education and health sectors is protected, as evidenced by: (i) the increase in the ratio of
        capital repairs to new investments from 2.5 percent (in the original approved budget for
        2009) to 3.4 percent (in the amended budget for 2009); and (ii) the allocation of MNT
        12.4 billion for that purpose.

    c) Expected results

92.     The emerging medium-term strategy would build on the above short-term measures as
follows. As part of IMF conditionality, a draft Fiscal Responsibility Law would be submitted to
Parliament by the end of 2009. This Law would include a framework for better managing of the
mining revenues. A new IBL would then follow, and lay out more rigorous procedures for project
selection and appraisal, including improved cost estimation and sustainable funding for
maintenance and repair. The expected results would be a more sustainable fiscal framework to
manage the volatile mining revenues and a better planned and executed public investment
program.


    B. Social Protection

    a) Challenges

93.     In its transition to a market economy, Mongolia adopted a social assistance system to
address the needs of people who lost their traditional safety net--jobs and pensions--and were
not covered by social insurance. The public safety net system included two main types of
programs: social insurance (retirement, unemployment, or sickness); social assistance (specific
benefits to protect vulnerable groups, including the disabled and child allowances). And there are
active labor market programs (ALMPs): job mediation services, entrepreneurship services, job
training, public works and wage subsidies. Social insurance is only available to workers
contributing to the social security system (40 percent of workers in 2006)26. Up until the 2006
amendments to the Labor Law, ALMPs have been limited to the unemployed who are registered
at the Labor and Social Welfare Assistance Divisions (54 percent of the total unemployed, or
about 30,000 people)27. The main legal framework for social assistance benefits was provided by
the 1995 Social Welfare Law and the 2001 Employment Promotion Law.

94.     The 2003 Social Security Sector Master Plan (SSMP) had the right ideas but no clear
implementation strategy for consolidating and rationalizing the system to achieve a coherent
social assistance strategy. The SSMP aimed to consolidate and rationalize the system and
improve cost-efficiency (mainly through improved targeting). In particular, the main areas of
reform of social assistance identified in the master plan were: (a) to rationalize the number and
type of benefits; (b) to clarify the eligibility criteria of the different benefits to improve quality
and accessibility of the sector's services; (c) to decentralize the management of social assistance
services; (d) to professionalize the social welfare officers in charge of implementing social
assistance; and (e) to promote community participation in specific care-provider institutions.

95.     The introduction of the Child Money Program (CMP) in January 2005 responded in part
to the strategy laid out in the SSMP, in particular the need to consolidate programs and improve
targeting. The CMP was originally designed as a conditional cash transfer program (CCT)
targeted to poor households with children aged 0-18. It introduced two important innovations in
the social assistance system: it conditioned the benefit receipt to specific behaviors on the part of
the households; and it introduced a proxy-means test (PMT) for the identification of the poor.
Cash transfers were conditioned on following mandatory immunizations, living with parents, not
being engaged in intolerable forms of child labor and, for children between the ages of 8 and 18,
being enrolled in school.

96.     The 2005 targeted CMP introduced the principle of beneficiaries being selected on the
basis of need through an objective set of indicators, replacing the old system of subjective
assessment of poverty by local authorities. Although the objectives were not clearly spelled out,
the basic design of the CMP mimics that of successful CCTs elsewhere, which have the dual goal
of reducing current poverty (by providing monetary transfers to poor families) and reducing
future poverty through improved human capital (by conditioning benefits on human capital
investments).

97.     However, the amendments to the Social Welfare Law of July 2006 universalized the
CMP and introduced other large allowances--all facilitated by large revenues from mining. The
CMP was universalized to all families with children in July 2006 and the benefit was increased in
January 2007 from MNT 36,000 per child a year (MNT 3,000 per month) to MNT 136,000. The
CMP was largely moved out of the budget into the newly established Mongolian Development
Fund (MDF), with the objective of managing the fiscal revenue from the Windfall Profits Tax on
copper and gold production. Also, two large one-off allowances were introduced--MNT 500,000
for newlyweds and MNT 100,000 for new-born children. The July 2006 amendments also
consolidated all other child-related allowances (other than the CMP) into a single CCT of MNT
20,000 per month.

98.     Social assistance expenditures have been increasing continuously since 1997, but they
skyrocketed after introduction of the CMP in 2005 and the subsequent changes, resulting in large
increases in the share of social assistance in the total budget and GDP. Between 1997 and 2004,
social assistance increased by 127 percent in real terms. The introduction of the CMP in 2005
increased expenditures by 61 percent, and further increased by 54 percent with universalization of
CMP in 2006. The January 2007 benefit raise has increased projected expenditures by 173
percent. Over that period, the share of social assistance in the budget and GDP went from 2.2
percent and 0.7 percent in 1997, respectively, to a projected 11.9 percent and 5.2 percent in 2007,
respectively.

99.     Soon after its introduction in January 2005, the CMP quickly became the largest social
assistance program, accounting for 67 percent of beneficiaries and 40 percent of the budget in
2005. By April-June of 2006 (right before the universalization of the program), 68 percent of
families with children were benefiting from the program, which covered 29 percent of all children
aged 0-18 in the country. In fact, in 2006 the CMP represented the main source of welfare
payments to households together with the traditional main source of welfare payments (pensions).
It accounted for 44 percent of welfare payments to an average household--62 percent among
households receiving CMP benefit--and 8 percent of their income.

100.    Several recent empirical studies present evidence on the efficiency of the targeted CMP,
as well as of the impacts on poverty and child schooling of both the targeted and universal




                                                 34

versions of the CMP.28 The evidence shows considerable leakage of targeted CMP program
benefits to the non-poor while it excluded a portion of the poor. The technical dimensions of the
CMP targeting formula had a lot of room for improvement but, more importantly, it was poorly
applied. This resulted in large leakage of the program to the non-poor. Using the population-
weighted average of the Minimum Subsistence Level (MSL) in 2006 (MNT 25,620) as the
national poverty line, 19 percent of the poor were excluded from the program and 61 percent of
the non-poor were included. Disaggregating by quintile of household per capita consumption
(Figure 13), 19 percent of the households in the poorest two quintiles were excluded from the
program, while 55 percent of those in the richest two quintiles received benefits. And the poorest
two quintiles only account for 50 percent of total beneficiary households. So a lot of benefits
went to household that did not need them, resulting in large cost-inefficiencies. This was a result
both of the technical properties of the targeting formula that was applied and, more importantly,
of its poor implementation.

101.    Nonetheless, the targeted CMP was found to have a positive impact on high-school
enrollment in Mongolia ­ specifically among the poor. After controlling for differences between
CMP beneficiaries and non-beneficiaries, the program is associated with a 16 percentage point
increase in the probability of being enrolled in upper secondary school among 16-18 year olds
who have completed lower secondary. Analysis by quintile of household per capita consumption
shows a large and statistically significant effect among the poor ­ 35 percentage points among
those in the poorest quintile ­ but no significant effect among the non-poor (e.g., the richest two
quintiles), see Figure 14.

102.    The targeted CMP--with a smaller monetary transfer to households--had a significant,
but relatively small, impact on poverty. The analysis of household per capita consumption with
and without CMP income shows that the program appears to be associated with small changes in
poverty--a 4 percent reduction in the overall poverty rate and a 1.6 percent reduction in extreme
poverty.29 Note that the benefit of the program was only one-eighth of the poverty line in 2002-
03. After the CMP was universalized, the size of the benefit was also substantially increased.

103.    The universalized CMP­which also involved a huge increase in the size of the benefit
(from 36,000 to 136,000 MNT per child per year)­was found to have a larger impact on poverty
than the earlier targeted CMP. The comparison of simulated household consumption expenditures
with universal CMP benefits at MNT 136,000 a year per child and expenditures without CMP
income show a 15 percentage point reduction in the overall poverty rate and a 5 percentage point
reduction in extreme poverty.

104.    While the universal CMP benefit appears to have a larger impact on poverty than the
targeted CMP benefit, it does so at a much higher fiscal cost. Moreover, the universal CMP is
much more cost inefficient than the targeted version. There is no evidence to date on how much
additional benefit the universal CMP transfer provides the poor in terms of school enrollments.
There is the potential risk the higher universal CMP transfer may create disincentives to work
among the poor,30 given the large size of the transfer relative to household consumption among
the poor (30 percent among the poorest quintile). Moreover, it is clear that the fiscal burden and
cost inefficiency from granting benefits to all non-poor households is far higher under the
universal program than under the targeted version, which makes the universal program fiscally
unsustainable.

    b) Key measures to be supported by the DPC

          i) Reintroducing targeting of the CMP

105.     There are clear gains--in terms of efficiency and fiscal sustainability of the safety net--
to moving to a targeted version of the CMP. The important social benefits of the CMP--increased
school enrollment, poverty reduction--are concentrated among the poor and extreme poor.
Untargeted, universal benefits only add to the fiscal burden of the program, while serving as a
consumption subsidy to the non-poor.

106.     The DPC and potential future DPCs will thus support re-targeting of the CMP program to
focus scarce government resources where they can have an impact: on poverty reduction and
human capital promotion. To promote fiscal sustainability of the program in the short term, the
DPC will support a process of conversion of the current universal program to a targeted program
based on a proxy-means targeting formula developed using the most recent household survey data
(2007/08). The implementation of this formula would avoid the problems that were encountered
in 2005 and that were to a large extent the cause of the poor performance of the prior targeting
experience. In transitioning to the targeted CMP and in order to respond to the urgency of the
current fiscal crisis, the CMP would begin by cleaning its roster and eliminating households that
are clearly non-poor (e.g. formal sector workers, civil servants, and others). A plan to carry out
this revision of the roster would constitute a prior action under the DPC.

107.     Following a rapid reduction in the size of the universal CMP through a cleaning of the
rosters, a second DPC, supported by a new TA program for social protection, would support the
government in progressively improving the implementation of the updated program targeting to
achieve a program that is focused on a more narrow definition of the poor, based on an updated
targeting formula using the national poverty line. The movement to more narrow poverty
targeting of the program would be undertaken in a phased way over a multi-year period, to enable
the development of the technical and institutional mechanisms required to effectively implement
a mechanism to target the poor. It is proposed that potential future DPCs support this transition.
Progress in the implementation of the new targeting formula would constitute prior actions for
potential further DPCs.

          ii) Reducing number of social transfers

108.     Potential future DPCs, supported by a TA program, would also support the government
in improving the efficiency and fiscal sustainability of the country's system of social transfers
through the consolidation and rationalization of its system of social transfers. Recent analysis of
social protection in Mongolia31 noted that the country's safety net programs would benefit from
consolidation of its multiplicity of programs, for reasons related to efficiency and sustainability as
well as rationality and impact of the system.

          iii)Adjusting the size of the social transfer

109.     The DPC will also support the adjustment of the size of the targeted CMP transfer in a
way that ensures both fiscal responsibility and adequacy in terms of impact on the poor. At
present the CMP comprises a monthly payment (MNT 3,000 per child per month or MNT 36,000
per child per year), and a quarterly payment (MNT 25,000 per child per month or MNT 100,000
per child per year). Newlyweds receive a one-time payment (MNT 300,000)32, and households
receive a one-time payment per new-born child (MNT 100,000). As part of the rationalization of

social transfers, potential future DPCs would support the revision of the monetary amount of
these transfers, consistent with the objectives of the programs (investment in children's education,
poverty reduction, and others). The technical assistance being provided as part of the DPC as well
as ongoing analytical work on poverty will inform this reform.

         iv) Strengthening the government's capacity to implement effective targeted transfers

110.    To successfully move from a universal social transfer to a well-targeted, modern safety
net program, Mongolia will require technical assistance both at the central and local government
levels. A recent World Bank study of social protection in Mongolia33 highlights several key areas
where institutional strengthening is needed, including:

    ·   Improving the PMT for progressively better poverty targeting.
    ·   Training/technical assistance to relevant Ministry of Social Welfare and Labor and local
        government staff to ensure adequate execution of the targeted CMP program.
    ·   Development of a national beneficiary database to ensure clear and transparent
        monitoring of program eligibility and payments.
    ·   Establishment of a complaint mechanism to address a range of household concerns about
        the program.
    ·   Establishment of a direct-deposit mechanism for CMP program payment, along the lines
        of the mechanism currently used for pensions.
    ·   Implementation of an impact evaluation program for the targeted CMP to ensure the
        program is meeting its objectives and to permit adjustments to program design and
        implementation to enhance the CMP's impact on poverty and human capital promotion
        among the poor.

111.    These measures are part of the implementation of the reformed CMP. They will be part of
possible future DPCs and a planned social protection TA program.

112.    DPC prior actions

    ·   The Ministry of Social Welfare and Labor has prepared a time-bound action plan to clean
        its roster of beneficiaries of the CMP, in order to reduce leakage to the non-poor and
        improve its targeting on the poor.

    c) Expected results

113.    The emerging medium-term strategy would build on the above short-term measures as
follows. The medium­term goal of the envisaged reforms with respect to social transfers is to
better protect the poor by targeting the currently untargeted grants (in particular, the CMP).
During 2009, the government will propose to Parliament legislation which will consolidate
several existing social transfer programs into one social protection program and reintroduce
targeting. Work will also start on establishing an improved PMT and a national beneficiary
database. Subsequently, a strategy for monitoring and evaluating of the reformed social transfer
program will be put in place, and a complaint mechanism for the consolidated program
established. Later on, a monitoring and evaluation program for the consolidated social transfer
program and a direct-deposit mechanism for the consolidated social transfer program will be
needed. The goal will be to gradually implement the PMT-based targeting, so that by December
2010, the national beneficiary database has been completed at the national level.

     C. Financial Sector

     a) Challenges

114.     The government faces the challenge of dealing with the resolution of the recently failed
fourth largest bank and preparing for further possible bank failures due to the downturn. To
restore confidence in the system, the government introduced a four-year deposit guarantee34 and
took the failed bank under conservatorship. However, significant system weaknesses and
important risks remain. For instance, there is limited financial system oversight capacity. And
most financial institutions have inadequate risk management capacity, weak corporate
governance and internal control mechanisms. Weak liquidity management and the absence of
depositor insurance also limit the ability of the system to absorb shocks without government
support. Consequently, as the economy slows down, some of the other weaker banks may also
fail. Non-performing loans (NPLs), which had been below 3 percent for the banking system until
the mid-2008, more than doubled by early 2009.

     b) Key measures to be supported by the DPC

115.     Immediate response and contingency measures are needed to address bank failures,
restore confidence in the banking system and strengthen banking supervision.

116.     The government recognizes that the immediate task at hand comprises conducting a
special portfolio diagnostic and audit of the failed bank to determine the extent and nature of both
the problem and the viable assets held. To this end the BoM has already hired an auditing firm of
international standard which is in the process of finalizing its assessment. The government
intends to use the result of this special audit mentioned above to serve as the basis for the design
of a strategy and procedures for an expedient least-cost resolution of the bank promptly. The
authorities recognize that in the prevailing global market situation any additional bank failure
beyond the failed bank, however small or insignificant one, will be viewed as a test to the
capacity of the authorities to handle the situation. To that extent, successful resolution of the
failed bank would allow the authorities to demonstrate their commitment and capability to the
general public, and thus serve to calm the markets.

117.     Given the seriousness of the economic downturn, the strain it causes on the banking
system, and the inherent weaknesses in the banking system, the BoM has enhanced its day-to-day
monitoring of the banks, as well as prepared a contingency plan which encompasses a range of
scenarios. The focus of the enhanced oversight will be on the presently most pertinent challenges,
namely: (i) liquidity situation; (ii) asset quality; and (iii) the impact of foreign currency
fluctuations on the aforementioned. The enhanced monitoring of the banks' liquidity position and
prospects is both timely and forward-looking. To that extent, besides the measures already in
use,35 the supervisor also intends to put in place an enhanced liquidity-monitoring regime, both
for domestic and important foreign currencies, that entails routine stress testing placed on cash
flow projections. The banks will then be requested to prepare and submit to the supervisor on
daily basis detailed rolling cash flow projections, at minimum, for the next five working days.




34The government has subsequently clarified the deposit guarantee to cover current accounts, savings
accounts, time deposits and interbank deposits. However, in order to prevent abuse and unnecessary fiscal
costs, deposits of related persons--as defined in the banking law--and deposits of holders of subordinated
debts will be excluded from this guarantee.

35BoM has recently instituted a requirement that each bank report its deposit levels on a daily basis.


                                                    39

118.      Further actions to which the authorities are committed include also monitoring large
deposit concentrations and prompt reporting by banks of any pending expiries of large deposit
concentrations or significant deposit withdrawals. The BoM intends to closely follow deposit
rates offered by the banks, as excessive rates tend to signal possible liquidity problems. Given
also that some Mongolian banks report relatively sizable "due from banks" assets, the authorities
will seek to reassure themselves on the quality and liquidity of such placements with foreign
banks.

119.      Similarly, an enhanced monitoring regime of the asset quality will be put in place,
particularly for both systemically important, and potentially weak and problem banks. This will
entail augmented monitoring of the banks' compliance with loan classification and provisioning
requirements. For early detection of potentially weak banks, the authorities will seek to identify
the techniques most commonly used by banks to hide the problems through use of "cosmetic"
restructurings with insolvent debtors, and evaluate the extent to which such techniques are
applied by each bank. Furthermore, to the extent possible under the presently available
supervisory powers,36 the authorities will pay close attention to the banks' compliance with
single-borrower restrictions and connected-party lending.

120.      The foreign currency risk exposure inherent from unhedged currency loans will be
monitored and regularly assessed using stress-testing techniques. This is due to the relatively high
level of dollarization in the economy, and the concerns over tugrug weakness. Both banks and
authorities will benefit from early consideration on how to convert existing unhedged dollar
exposures to tugrug-denominated loans.

121.      The BoM is also paying close attention to the quality of off-balance sheet transactions
and contingent liabilities. In autumn 2008 the Mongolian banking system was plagued by
reported and/or rumored problems with Letters of Credit at different banks. To that extent, and
given that some of the banks allegedly engage in commodity derivatives trading, the quality of
off-balance sheet transactions and contingent liabilities deserved attention. Another undertaking
was to clarify the precise coverage of the blanket deposit guarantee, at minimum excluding the
related parties (shareholders, ultimate beneficial owners and related companies). In this regard,
Parliament recently approved an amendment to this guarantee to Parliament which clarifies the
scope of the guarantee and excludes certain types of depositors, such as connected parties, as
requested by the IMF.

122.      The BoM recognizes that the number of staff will need to be increased and the
supervisory staff will need to be reorganized to accommodate for the specific needs of resolution
and contingency planning processes while maintaining robust bank supervision of particularly
systemically important and potentially weak and problem banks. The true quality of banks'
liquidity position and asset quality can only be observed through frequent onsite supervision.
However, BoM bank supervisory staff are already stretched extremely thin, having to deal with
both the conservatorship of the failed bank and planning for its resolution as well as developing a
contingency planning framework for possible further banking sector disturbance, alongside their
regular duties. These three undertakings--failed-bank resolution, contingency planning, and
routine bank supervision--each represent very different and challenging tasks, with sometimes
conflicting demands on the staff, the management and their time. To that extent, to remove these
binding constraints and inherent conflicts, there is an urgent need not only to increase the number
of staff, but also to reorganize the supervisory staff to accommodate for the specific needs of


36Absent full transparency of the ownership structure of the banks, effective supervision for compliance
with a number of prudential regulations, including restrictions on related party lending and large exposures
is, at best, challenging.


                                                    40

resolution and contingency planning processes while maintaining robust bank supervision of
particularly systemically important and potentially weak and problem banks.

123.    The BoM is in the process of establishing a separate, adequately resourced crisis
management task force/designate body with requisite legal/regulatory powers and direct
communication lines to BoM top management, the Financial Stability Council (FSC),37 and other
relevant agencies. The efficacy of the enhanced supervision effort as well as possible crisis
management tasks would greatly be aided through added focus and specialization. Expedience
becomes of essence, both in early detection of any problems, in communication between relevant
authorities, and in response design and decisions. The crisis management task force should be
tasked with dealing with efforts related to immediate banking sector distress, such as (i)
functioning as the focal point on the government side to ensure a seamless information flow
between key authorities (including the day-to-day and enhanced bank supervision); (ii)
conducting the ongoing planning and oversight for failed-bank resolution processes (for example,
the conservator of the failed bank); (iii) doing the preparatory work for requisite policy decisions
by the FSC, BoM and other relevant authorities; and (iv) proactively monitoring and regularly
reporting systemic risk concerns and issues to BoM senior management and the FSC as needed.
Concurrently, the Central Bank Law would need to be amended to strengthen BoM independence
and to provide appropriate legal protection for BoM, the crisis management task force and
individual supervisors for actions taken in good faith in the course of performing supervisory
duties.

124.    Given that Mongolia underwent a systemic banking crisis only relatively recently, the
authorities want to early-on revisit the actions taken and the lessons learned from the late-1990s
crisis. Based on these lessons, as well as drawing from the international experiences from
comparable situations, the authorities will then seek to review of the existing bank resolution
framework to ensure that it is sufficiently robust and provides for effective and efficient bank
resolution process in a systemic distress situation. To that extent, at minimum, the Banking Law,
Central Bank Law, Corporate Law and Civil Code will be reviewed for what amendments may be
needed to provide the BoM--and thus also the crisis management task force--with adequate
powers and flexibility for use of a wide range of bank resolution techniques. Appropriate
amendments to the laws on foreclosure and collateral will also be considered and presented to the
Parliament to ensure that borrowers are not overly protected impeding loan recovery. In parallel,
the tax rules will also be assessed against different resolution techniques, including mergers and
acquisitions, to facilitate prompt action, and allow asset transfers and other transactions in a bank
resolution, without distorting or offsetting the corrective nature of such measures. Further, a
review and amendments, as needed, of the foreclosure legislation and procedures will be
beneficial to the pertinent needs of the present situation.

125.    One key task for the crisis management task force would be to develop an overall
contingency planning framework, and to draft a contingency plan of action for different
scenarios, ranging from payment system disturbance, the collapse of a small, relatively
unimportant bank, to a possible collapse of one or even several large systemically important
banks. To avoid unnecessary confusion and inconsistent ad hoc responses, the contingency plan
will spell out clearly, to begin with, the decision-making procedures and powers related to dealing
with systemic banking sector distress:



37The Financial Stability Council (FCS) is a body comprising the BoM, the MoF and the Financial
Regulatory Commission (FRC) and is responsible for financial-sector-related policy issues, and
coordination and cooperation between these three agencies, see also
http://www.mongolbank.mn/c/journal_articles/view_article_content?articleId=A-COUNCIL&version=1.0.



                                                  41

    ·    What are the requisite measures for early detection of any problems (as discussed
         above)?

    ·    At what point does a bank move from normal supervisory oversight to more intensive
         day-to-day supervision?

    ·    Who has the authority to determine that intervention is needed in a weak, or potentially
         failed, bank and on what basis?

    ·    What are the arrangements for:

         o conducting an in-depth assessment of a failing bank's condition, including the use of
              independent experts if necessary;
         o reporting the assessment's findings to the relevant authorities for decision-making?

    ·    What are the appropriate and effective bank resolution techniques in the Mongolian
         context?

    ·    What are the responsibilities for deciding on the requisite intervention actions, such as:

         o taking physical control of the banking facilities, and transferring or repaying
              deposits;
         o interagency communication and coordination of resolution actions;
         o communicating to other relevant parties, including the general public;
         o determining potential conflicts with the objectives of government or other relevant
              agencies, and how these might be resolved; and
         o monitoring the results from intervention, and adjusting the actions as necessary?

126.     The authorities recognize that the shock and the consequent slowdown in economic
activity provide an opportunity to consolidate the banking system to strengthen it. Should
intervention in a number of banks be needed, meaning any additional banks beyond the failed
bank, the credibility of the authorities' actions can only be maintained, if there is a clear,
consistent, and principled strategy in place, and no ad hoc and inconsistent decisions are made.
Any use of public support requires certain safeguard provisions to be in place, such as making
certain that the support is conditional on proper repercussions, and that the tax payers share in the
upside from the intervention. Authorities therefore recognize that any bank receiving public
support should meet the following preconditions:

    ·    fully transparent ownership structure;

    ·    fit and proper owners and managers;

    ·    willingness of the owners to put a sufficient amount of their own capital at risk;

    ·    recognition of the full extent of losses and appropriate loan-loss provisioning;

    ·    commitment to requisite operational restructuring to ascertain the future feasibility of the
         bank; and

    ·    a realistic business plan to return the bank to full viability, including meeting all
         prudential requirements.




                                                  42

127.    DPC prior actions

    ·   The BoM has prepared an action plan for the restructuring/resolving of the bank currently
        under the conservatorship, on the basis of the bank's portfolio diagnostic and audit
        carried out by an internationally reputable auditor.

    ·   The BoM has issued a decree requiring that all banks report on a daily basis on key
        indicators regarding their liquidity and asset quality.

    ·   The BoM has established a crisis management and systemic risk monitoring task force
        with adequate functions and powers, qualified staff and sufficient resources to carry out
        its mandate.

    c) Expected results

128.    The emerging medium-term strategy would build on the above short-term measures by
continuing to strengthen bank supervision, while swiftly and resolutely dealing with possible
future bank failures. The government is expected to mandate a well-sequenced increase of paid-in
capital over the next few years to provide incentives for bank restructuring in the sector. The idea
would be that mainly the stronger banks would be able to attract the necessary capital. The
expected results would be a better supervised banking sector without any more failures of major,
systemic banks. The sector would be characterized by more stable and balanced growth in
deposits and loans.


    D. Mining Sector Reform

    a) Challenges

129.    Mongolia has bright prospects for both fuel and non-fuel minerals and the mining sector
has the potential to be the main driver of economic growth over the medium to long term. This
potential will only be fully realized in an environment, where both the regulatory framework and
the institutions that manage that framework are effective and efficient. Mineral revenues from
taxes, royalties and dividends rose dramatically through the 2005-08 commodity price boom,
accounting for 39 percent of government revenue in 2007, and reaching 62 percent of total
exports.

130.    Since 2006, however, the mineral sector has been characterized by uncertainties. These
uncertainties stem from both the law itself, as well as the arbitrary and less-than-transparent
application of existing regulations. Investors perceive there is a lack of transparency and
accountability of government actions, but there is also poor monitoring and accountability on the
part of the private-sector operators. In particular, the management of mineral licensing has
repeatedly been raised by the mining industry as a disincentive to mineral exploration and has led
to allegations of corrupt practice in license allocation. Licenses are currently processed following
a series of internal instructions which can be changed at will by the Ministry of Mineral
Resources and Energy, potentially placing companies in breach of conditions that did not exist on
the grant of their license. Lack of adequate regulations passed by either Cabinet or Parliament that
define due process and provide certainly and accountability for both investor and the government
is undermining investor confidence.

131.    Mining sector uncertainty has been compounded by increasing economic nationalism
with Parliament passing legislation requiring state equity participation in all major mining
projects. The Minerals Law was amended in 2006 to require a 34 percent state equity holding in



                                                  43

all projects discovered with private sector exploration and a 50 percent share in projects originally
discovered using state funded exploration (during the socialist era). The government is not in a
position to fund this equity and is seeking arrangements where the stake is funded and carried by
the developer and paid for out of future dividends. This adds to investor risk and creates
uncertainty over the level of equity which the state may claim. Definitions in the law are vague
and "discovered with State Funds" is otherwise undefined. Revision and clarification of the
Minerals Law to provide for regulations and improvement of terms and definitions is required.

132.     Coupled with the disincentive effects of this weak regulatory setting has been instability
in the fiscal framework and the application of a discriminatory Windfall Profits Tax (WPT) on
gold and copper producers. This tax has distorted both exploration and development expenditures
and resulted in the deferral of new gold mines and was a contributor to the delay in completing an
investment agreement for OT.        38The WPT has been levied using arbitrary commodity price
thresholds which for a time were inconsistent with the concept of a windfall and were in fact set
at levels below the operating costs of some mines. Thus all profits from copper and gold mining
were being taxed at a rate of 68 percent.

133.     Mining sector tax legislation is poorly defined. The Income Tax Law has no specific
division or sections dealing with mining taxation and the sector is treated the same as any other
industrial operation. This results in significant areas of ambiguity and results in frequent court
challenges by mining companies to tax assessments by the General Department of National
Taxation. The mining sector has many aspects including depreciation arrangements, treatment of
social, infrastructure, environmental and rehabilitation costs which are unique to the sector.
Development and enactment of a division in the Income Tax Act dealing with mining sector
related issues is urgently required.

134.     Investment agreements are provided for in the Minerals Law to provide stability and
certainty for mining developments, such as stabilization of fiscal terms, and to define issues such
as the arrangements for the acquisition by the state of any equity position. These agreements are
currently developed by the state responding to draft agreements proposed by the investors and, as
a result, place the state in a position of reacting to proposals rather than setting the agenda for the
agreement. The state urgently needs a draft model investment agreement that spells out the basic
terms of any investment agreement and forms the basis of negotiations with the private sector.
Completion of such an agreement will require the state to clarify and solidify its policy position
on many aspects related to mining project development.

135.     Mongolia has a large informal mining sector characterized by illegal artisanal and small-
scale mining by individuals and groups, also called "ninja miners".39 It is estimated that there are
currently in the order of 60,000 such miners extracting a range of commodities from gold to coal
and fluorspar with and annual value estimated at US$140 million. A significant number illegally
use mercury, cyanide and explosives under often hazardous conditions. Education and
development of the sector has been impossible due to the absence of appropriate legislation and
the fact that the activity is illegal. The inability to formalize and regularize the sector has
perpetuated environmental damage and leaves a significant sector outside the formal and taxable
economy. The government recently passed a temporary regulation as a first step towards


38The Oyu Tolgoi deal has now been submitted to Parliament in March 2009 and has been discussed
during the Parliament's Spring Session.

39The miners are so named because the green bowls they use for panning, when carried on their backs, are
said to resemble the shells of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, a popular early-1990s TV series featuring
four mutant ninja-practising turtles who live in the New York sewage system while fighting crime and who
are named after famous Italian renaissance artists.


                                                     44

formalization of the sector and this needs to be followed by the passage of a Small-Scale Mining
Law.

136.    Mongolia has an urgent need for appropriate trade skills development and advanced
technical and vocational education. Mongolia does not yet have a workforce that is well trained in
modern technical skills. This skills shortage is evident even in quite basic-level jobs in
construction where many non-Mongolian workers are currently engaged. Unless there is a
concerted effort to improve technical and vocational education and training, it is likely that
foreign workers will dominate the construction and operations of the major mining projects, and
the process of converting the work force to Mongolian citizens will prove to be challenging.
Expatriate workers are expected to dominate the senior levels of mining operations management
until such time as a cadre of Mongolians develops the technical and management skills required
to replace them. The larger mining companies have recognized this skills shortage dilemma and
are already providing scholarships for advanced engineering and geological studies, and some are
proposing to build staff training centers at their mines. With respect to trade training, there
remains an urgent need to expand the scope and quality of apprenticeship training for basic trade
skills to an international standard. Technical vocational skills (certificate and diploma level
technical skills) for fields such as heavy equipment maintenance, welding, and construction
management are also required. The quality of engineering and geology degree programs currently
offered in Mongolia requires improvement to meet international standards, and high-quality
management (e.g. MBA) degree programs also need to be introduced. Initially the focus of these
programs should be to service the manpower needs of the mining sector, but progressively these
programs should become targeted more generically at skills for broad-based economic
development.

137.    Despite the challenges associated with and unstable fiscal setting and incomplete fiscal
regime for mining, Mongolia has also made significant progress in the implementation of the
EITI Mongolia has prepared and disseminated its first reconciliation report for the 2006 fiscal
year and is currently preparing the second report for 2007. Mongolia's next step is to seek
validation of its processes and actions in order for the country to be deemed an "EITI-compliant"
country by the International EITI Board. This requires an independent assessment by March 31,
2010 of Mongolia's EITI-related activities, and certifies that the process includes a truly multi-
stakeholder process that includes civil society in monitoring the transparency of payments
between mining companies and the various levels of government.

    b) Key measures to be supported by the DPC

138.    The government is committed to position Mongolia to benefit from and effectively
manage any upturn in exploration and development interest associated with commodity price
increases in the future. Its highest priority items are to:

    ·   Review and revise the minerals policy and law to clarify the law and its application in
        key areas such as state equity participation and clarify issues related to the operations of
        the mineral licensing cadastre office.

    ·   Adopt Cadastre (Licensing) regulations that are compatible with international best
        practice, that are either passed by Cabinet or endorsed by Parliament, and that clearly
        define due process with respect to the grant, management, transfer, surrender and
        cancellation of mineral licenses.

    ·   Review the underlying policy setting for the fiscal regime for mining and the
        development of an appropriate legislative framework for the application and management
        of mining taxation that addresses the specific technical aspects unique to the sector.


                                                  45

     ·    Develop draft model mining investment agreements to form the basis of future
          negotiations for new large-scale mineral developments. These would clarify mining
          policy, including taxation and state ownership, and incorporate responsible mining
          practices.40

139.      Other actions the government is considering to effectively develop the minerals sector
include the development of:

     ·    regulations for management of mining operations including reporting obligations,
          occupational health and safety and environmental performance;

     ·    mine closure and rehabilitation regulations and guidelines to address biophysical,
          economic and social aspects of mine closure as well as the development of fiscal
          arrangements relating to closure financial surety;41

     ·    legislation and supporting regulation to formalize and regulate the small scale mining
          sector in order to create a legal and regulatory framework for the conversion of ninja
          miners into legitimate, regulated and environmentally sound operations;

     ·    a regulatory framework for the mining, processing and marketing of uranium from
          private sector managed uranium mines in Mongolia. Such regulations should also include
          the development of specific environmental conditions and standards for any discharges of
          water and dust from the sites and the management of occupational standards to maintain
          human health;

     ·    completion of the EITI validation process for Mongolia to become recognized as an
          EITI-compliant country by the International EITI Board by March 31, 2010.

140.      DPC prior actions

     ·    The Ministry of Mineral Resources and Energy has developed and adopted model
          investment agreements for the mining sector, clarifying Mongolia's mining policy,
          including taxation and the state's capital participation, and incorporating responsible
          mining practices consistent with the Equator Principles.42
     ·    Sufficient resources have been transferred to the Mongolia EITI Secretariat in order to
          finance an independent validation of its national EITI Program, scheduled to be
          completed by March 31, 2010.

     c) Expected results

141.      The emerging medium-term strategy would build on the above short-term measures as
follows. The overall objective would be to work towards adopting a new mining law and policy,
and ensure, through close monitoring and prudent regulation, that responsible mining practices


40Responsible mining refers to mining activity that does not degrade the environment where mining takes
place, does not exploit miners, and helps enhance social relations.

41In this context, a financial surety is a bond or guarantee that can be exercised if the company defaults on
its legal obligations to restore or rehabilitate the mine site.

42The Equator principles are the set of principles and financial industry benchmarks developed by private
financial institutions for determining assessing and managing social and environmental risks in project
financing. They were established in June 2003 and revised in July 2006, and modeled after the
environmental standards adopted by the World Bank and social policies promoted by the International
Financial Corporation.

are followed in both large and small-scale mining. New mining projects would utilize the draft
model investment agreement. A more efficient and transparent mining cadastre would be in
operation, which would be regulated according to the revised regulatory framework. A new and
relevant division of the Income Tax Law would be adopted to improve industry compliance with
modern taxation practice and to reduce tax disputes. Mongolia will continue to implement and
develop EITI and become recognized as an EITI-compliant country. The number of Mongolians
trained in relevant mining skills would significantly increase.



                            VII.       PROGRAM IMPLEMENTATION


     A. Poverty and Social Impact


142.    Recently released poverty numbers are very worrisome and justify the proposed DPC's
explicit focus on protecting the most vulnerable, in addition to managing the downturn. The
latest poverty profile of Mongolia that was published by the government43 shows that even during
the recent years of high economic growth, poverty was not reduced substantially. The poverty
headcount declined little to 35.5 percent in the 2007/08 survey, down from 36.1 percent in the
2002/03 survey, with large regional differences between the Ulaanbaatar and the rural
populations.44 As average incomes rose, this means that inequality has increased significantly.
The Bank is currently working on a series of policy notes using the new data. These notes will
provide further policy analysis to underpin possible future DPCs and work on social protection.
In addition, various consultations have been held in preparation for the proposed operation, in
which these issues have been raised (Section V.B).

143.    Furthermore, the downward revision of growth in 2009 implies that fewer people will be
lifted out of poverty. Economic growth in 2009 has been revised downward from 8 to 2.7 percent.
Based purely on a Bank staff estimate of the historic correlation between economic growth and
poverty this implies that between 20,000 and 40,000 thousands fewer Mongolians (0.7 percent
and 1.4 percent of the population respectively) would be lifted out of poverty in 2009.

144.    However, this is a conservative estimate as the likely impact may be far higher due to the
following factors:

     ·  High inflation hurts the poor the most, since they generally do not own assets, which
        would provide crucial hedges against inflation. High inflation is also rapidly eroding the
        real value of the universal social transfers.

     ·  If the fiscal crisis causes ad-hoc, across-the-board adjustments to the amounts per
        household of these transfers, the outlook for the poor looks grim.

     ·  The recent decline in commodity prices has negatively affected agricultural profitability.
        Since livestock herding accounts for around 35 percent of employment, herding
        households and real rural wages will suffer. And remittances from urban areas, which
        could have compensated for this loss of income, are also declining.

     ·  Ulaanbaatar's large and growing peri-urban (ger) area houses another major vulnerable
        group. The urban poor living in Ulaanbaatar and provincial and county capitals had

43NSO (2009).
44A caveat to these estimates is that they are based on consumption. The estimates factor in the food and
commodity price inflation in 2008 on the consumption side, but may have missed the parallel increase in
incomes and asset values of rural inhabitants during the same period.


                                                     47

         already been hard hit by rapid food price inflation in 2008, but are now further affected
         by job losses.

Fiscal policy and management

145.     The impact of the prior action that stipulates that the 2009 budget, as amended in March,
excludes a significant number of projects without feasibility studies is not likely to negatively
affect poverty reduction. A more rigorous selection mechanism, expected to be implemented as
part of a government medium-term strategy, should in principle also lead to selection of projects
with a positive impact on poverty reduction and distribution.

146.     The prior action that protects capital expenditures for the maintenance of basic
infrastructure in the transport, education and health sectors is pro-poor. The absence of this prior
action would have probably led to a neglect of maintenance, which would have disproportionally
affected the poor who are likely to live in more distant areas, typically more dependent than the
non-poor on public services, and who spend a higher share of their income on transportation.

Social protection

147.     The prior action that pertains to social protection--the Ministry of Social Welfare and
Labor has prepared a time-bound action plan to clean its roster of beneficiaries of the CMP, in
order to reduce leakage to the non-poor and improve its targeting on the poor--protects the poor
in the short and medium term. The guidelines for this cleaning of the roster would eliminate
categories of individuals that are not likely to be poor (e.g. civil servants, formal sector workers,
etc). In the medium term, reforms to consolidate the various programs and establish an effective
targeting mechanism through proxy-means testing are currently being worked on by government
in collaboration with the ADB and the World Bank.

Financial sector

148.     The prior actions that focus on strengthening confidence in the financial sector are not
likely to negatively affect poverty reduction. Restoring confidence in the financial sector is key to
reversing deposit flight out of the banking system, encouraging lending growth and continued
deepening and development of the financial sector. Financial sector stability and development
augment the beneficial effects of growth on the poor and help reduce inequality.45 A stable
financial system will help restore, and facilitate expansion of reliable, safe and affordable
financial services (saving, micro- and SME lending, insurance, etc.) to poor households and
remote areas.

Mining sector

149.     The prior action pertaining to the mining sector--the Ministry of Mineral Resources and
Energy has developed and adopted model investment agreements for the mining sector, clarifying
Mongolia's mining policy, including taxation and the state's capital participation, and
incorporating responsible mining practices consistent with the Equator Principles--is likely to
have direct and indirect positive impacts on poverty reduction. Adopting responsible mining
practices will have long-term positive impacts on those employed in mining and those living near
mines. Moreover, increased investment in the mining sector will lead to higher government



45For example, Beck at al. (2004) found that in countries with higher financial sector depth and
development the income of the poorest 20 percent of the population grows faster than average GDP per
capita and income inequality falls at a higher rate.


                                                    48

revenues, which, in principle, could support higher levels of sustainable and pro-poor public
expenditures.

    B. Environmental Aspects


150.    The proposed DPC is not likely to have significant negative effects on the environment.
Out of the four focus areas (fiscal policy and management, social protection, the financial sector
and the mining sector), the mining sector is most directly confronted by the challenge of
sustainable environmental management. Consequently, the prior action on mining to be endorsed
by the DPC explicitly supports the introduction of environmentally and socially responsible
mining practices following the Equator principles.

151.    The Mining Sector Technical Assistance Project (running parallel to the DPC over the
period 2009-13) contains specific project components supporting the development of
environmental regulations governing the mining sector. These regulations focus on the
management of environmental and social impacts, mine reclamation and closure conditionality.
The project will assist with the development of environmental and occupational health and safety
regulations appropriate for effective sector management. Occupational health and safety rules
specific to both open-pit and underground mining conditions will also be formulated and made
effective. The mining TA project also includes aspects dealing with financial surety for closure
costs in the event of premature closure or mining company bankruptcy. The regulations will be
consistent with World Bank environmental and social safeguard policies and the Equator
Principles. The project also supports a review of the Minerals Law to include provisions related to
community consultation, and engagement of impacted communities in decision-making
processes. The TA project will also assist with defining the discharge and reclamation standards.
Finally, the project will build capacity within government agencies to effectively implement the
new regulations.

    C. Fiduciary Aspects


152.    There are moderate risks with respect to public financial management. Mongolia scores
above many other developing countries on a range of governance indicators and has made
significant progress in key areas (i.e., improved public financial management, new anti-
corruption legislation, published asset and income disclosures for top officials and endorsement
of EITI principles). However, surveys and perception-based governance indicators suggest that
corruption and governance deterioration are growing concerns. For instance, firms single out
corruption as the single most severe investment-climate obstacle.

153.    In 2008 under the Governance and Anti-Corruption framework, the Bank undertook an
assessment of impediments in the mining value chain, and identified the following ones: (i)
sudden and rapidly expanding revenues and pressure to spend; (ii) lack of horizontal and vertical
accountability and transparency in policy making and use of mining revenues, and to keep
patronage networks in check; and (iii) political uncertainty; and (iv) limited awareness among
policy makers and the general public of global good practices in managing mineral resources and
revenues. The DPC, and its possible successors, are therefore appropriately focused on improving
the governance and management of mining revenues.

    D. Implementation, Monitoring, and Evaluation


154.    The Ministry of Finance will be the main implementing agency. Existing Bank TA
projects are being restructured to improve its economic monitoring system in order to be able to
obtain more timely feedback on policy performance. In parallel to the DPC, the Bank is


                                                49

processing a project to strengthen the statistical capacity of the government. The project will
prioritize strengthening the statistical capacity to assess developments in the key areas relevant to
the crisis.

155.     A three-year US$2 million grant for Mongolia under the Bank-administered GPF was
recently approved. This initiative will directly focus on strengthening public accountability by
broadening engagement (e.g., parliamentarians) and encouraging more transparent policy analysis
and civil society monitoring. A major focus of the facility will be to support the policy reform
agenda outlined in this document through stimulating policy debate and ensuring independent
monitoring and evaluation of the progress made.

    E. Disbursement and Auditing


156.     The proposed credit will follow the Bank's disbursement procedures for development
policy credits. The untied finances will be disbursed against satisfactory implementation of the
development policy program and not tied to any specific purchases. Once the credit is approved
by the Board and becomes effective, the proceeds of the credit will be deposited by IDA in an
account designated by the Borrower and acceptable to the Bank at the BoM at the request of the
Borrower. The Borrower shall ensure that upon the deposit of the credit into said account, an
equivalent amount is credited in the Borrower's budget management system, in a manner
acceptable to the Bank. The Borrower will report to the Bank on the amounts deposited in the
foreign currency account and equivalent amount in local currency will be credited to the budget
management system. If the proceeds of the credit are used for ineligible purposes as defined in
the Financing Agreement, IDA will require the Borrower to, promptly upon notice from IDA,
refund an amount equal to the amount of said payment to IDA. Amounts refunded to the Bank
upon such request shall be cancelled. The administration of this credit will be the responsibility of
the Ministry of Finance.

    F. Risks and Risk Mitigation


157.     The DPC faces significant risks, but these are outweighed by the expected benefits. A
significant external risk would be a further fall in mineral prices, leading to further mining
revenue shocks. However, the government's existing agreement with the IMF supports the
introduction of a more flexible exchange rate regime as a first line of defense to lessen the
budgetary and external balance impacts and function as a stimulus for recovery. In addition, the
DPC supports more prudent fiscal management to absorb revenue shocks and removes
uncertainties in the mining investment regime to ensure continued investment in Mongolia's
world-class mining assets.

158.     More bank failures are another significant risk, leading to a further loss of confidence in
the financial sector and necessitating further bailouts at high fiscal costs. The DPC supports
enhanced monitoring of the banking sector and the establishment of a crisis management and
systemic risk monitoring task force in the BoM.

159.     There is also a significant risk that populist political pressures or a resurgence of copper
revenues could derail or reverse the fiscal, monetary and exchange-rate policy reforms needed to
contain the crisis. However, in a direct response to the crisis, the Bank team has launched an
intensive outreach, ranging from the president, the prime minister and key ministers in Cabinet,
via the key Members of Parliament of both coalition partners, to the media and the wider public.
The objective of this outreach was to sensitize stakeholders to the magnitude of the crisis, better
understand the political economy, and share policy-relevant analysis and suggested policy
measures. This helped build a broad consensus on the causes of the crisis and the appropriate


                                                   50

policy responses. The Bank's Quarterly Economic Updates explained the assessment in a
language understandable to policymakers and public alike. The Bank has now increased the
frequency of the Quarterly to a Monthly publication to even further intensify these efforts at
fostering understanding and sustained commitment to policy reform.

160.    There is a moderate risk that the crisis could lead Mongolia to agree to sub-optimal
mineral export contracts or non-concessional financing that negatively impacts debt
sustainability. The concerted effort of Mongolia's development partners to assist the government
in making the necessary policy adjustments, backed by the necessary financial support, is an
important mitigation against this risk. This DPC represents the Bank's contribution to that
mitigation.

The staff's debt sustainability analysis shows that Mongolia is at low risk of external debt distress.
Although the debt ratios will rise significantly over the next two years as the government receives
front-loaded foreign financing to recover from a major terms of trade shock, the debt outlook is
expected to recover and improve over the medium term. Key medium-term risks involve large debt
service in 2012-15 associated with the repayments to the International Monetary Fund (under the
proposed SBA). Mongolia hardly has any domestic debt. If Mongolia manages its existing debt well
and contracts new debt prudently, it should be able to ride out the effects of the adverse commodity
shock and move to a new medium-term development path underpinned by the commodity sector.

I.       BACKGROUND

1.       This update reflects the macroeconomic framework underlying the new Stand-By
Arrangement and staff projections through 2029. It assumes that the implementation of prudent
macroeconomic and structural policies, including the establishment of a fiscal framework to avoid
procyclical policies over the commodity price cycle will help Mongolia recover from the current
downturn and resume sustainable growth.47 In particular, by 2012-13 the development of the
country's mineral resources is expected to spur economic growth and boost exports well into the
medium term.




46The DSA has been produced jointly by the staffs of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, in
consultation with the Asian Development Bank and the Mongolian authorities (Ministry of Finance, Debt
Management Division). The fiscal year for Mongolia is January-December 2009.

47The DSAs presented in this document are based on the common standard LIC DSA framework. Under the
Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA) Mongolia is rated as a medium performer, and the debt
sustainability analysis uses the indicative threshold indicators for countries in this category. See "Debt
Sustainability in Low-Income Countries: Proposal for an Operational Framework and Policy Implications"
(http://www.imf.org/external/np/pdr/sustain/2004/020304.htm and IDA/SECM2004/0035, 2/3/04) and "Debt
Sustainability in Low-Income Countries: Further Considerations on an Operational Framework, Policy
Implications"    (http://www.imf.org/external/np/pdr/sustain/2004/091004.htm    and   IDA/SECM2004/0629,

bilateral creditors.

3.        Several years of strong growth and prudent debt management policies have helped
reduce Mongolia's external PPG debt burden. During the last five years, the PPG external debt has
fallen to 33 percent of GDP in 2008 from 87 percent of GDP in 2003. The ratio of debt service to
exports has fallen to 4 percent in 2008 from 23 percent in 2000. During the last three years, the
composition of debt has shifted away slightly from multilateral to bilateral creditors resulting in a
lower degree of concessionality.48 The latest Debt Management Performance Assessment (DeMPA)
concluded that Mongolia scores relatively high on indicators such as strategy development,
coordination with macroeconomic policies, recording and reporting, which is important considering
the baseline with large upfront borrowing.49

II.       DEVELOPMENTS IN 2009

4.        The near-term debt outlook will be adversely affected by the severe exogenous shock
Mongolia is now facing. Mongolia has been hit hard by the global financial crisis through a sudden
drop in the price of copper; export proceeds are expected to fall by more than US$800 million this
year. The severe terms of trade shock has exacerbated the balance of payments and fiscal imbalances
as evidenced by the 16 percent of GDP swing in the current account. As a result, the recent gains in
lowering debt ratios now look set to be reversed as the government resorts to extraordinary external
financing to address the balance of payments pressure. Part of the balance of payments gap is
expected to be financed with the proposed US$224 million (SDR 153.3 million) Exceptional Access
Stand-By Arrangement from the Fund, and additional support from other international financial
institutions (IFIs), mainly IDA and the Asian Development Bank (AsDB). The authorities have
approached donors to request additional support to cover unidentified financing during the course of
the Fund arrangement.

III.     MEDIUM-TERM MACRO AND DSA ASSUMPTIONS

5.       Compared to the 2008 DSA conducted at the time of the 2008 Article IV the global
environment has significantly worsened Mongolia's macroeconomic situation.50 Even under
stress testing the previous DSA could not have foreseen the sharp downturn. Specifically, copper
prices, Mongolia's main source of foreign exchange earnings have been halved since mid-2008. A
fall in global demand--particularly China which absorbs the bulk of Mongolia's exports--has
increased the country's vulnerabilities. As a result, the average real growth rate for 2009-10 has
fallen by more than 4 percentage points as compared to the previous DSA and the current account has
swung from a surplus of 7 percent of GDP in 2007 to a deficit of 10 percent of GDP in 2008.
Government revenues and grants are on average 8 percent of GDP lower due to lower copper prices.

6.       The baseline macroeconomic framework takes into consideration the impact of the
substantial fiscal adjustment for 2009-10, but assumes that the economy will return to
sustained growth over the medium term, underpinned by the OT mining project.51

    ·    Growth is expected to remain low at close to 3 percent in 2009 due to the fall in copper
         exports and a decline in domestic demand driven by slowing credit growth and moderation in
         public sector wage increases as opposed to developments in recent years. Growth will
         rebound to 11 percent in 2012 supported by the development of the OT mine, which will start
         production in 2013. As Mongolia progresses toward a higher income level, the long run real
         GDP growth is expected to be 4½ percent.

    ·    After a rebound in 2010-13, export growth is expected to average more than 18 percent over
         2013-18, reflecting copper exports from the OT mine.52 Similarly, the current account deficit
         is expected to amount to 6½ percent of GDP in 2009, and will remain in deficit until 2012
         due to large imports of mining-related investment goods. After that point, the current account
         should gradually narrow before jumping to a substantial surplus in 2013 as the OT project
         comes on stream. Presuming the authorities choose to save a reasonable fraction of the
         mineral revenues from this project the current account is expected to converge to a steady
         state surplus of 5 percent of GDP by 2029.

    ·    Given the up-front fiscal adjustment under the Fund-supported program, and a tightening of
         monetary policy, inflation is projected to slow to about 5 percent over the medium term.

    ·    Fiscal revenues will be boosted by the OT project and are expected to reach 47 percent of
         GDP by 2019, gradually converging to 39 percent over the medium term. Expenditures are

51Oyu Tolgoi is a copper and gold mine. In addition, the Tavan Tolgoi (TT) deposit, close to the border with
China, if developed, would transform Mongolia into a major world coal producer. The TT project has not been
incorporated in the underlying baseline macroeconomic framework due to the uncertainties about its size and
time frame for development. Once TT materializes, it is projected to have an important short-term impact via
increased equipment imports, FDI and loan inflows, and a medium to long-term beneficial impact on the current
account, similar to OT.

52WEO projections are used for copper prices through 2014 and then assumed at US$4,500/tonne through
2029.

         expected to decline steadily reaching 33 percent of GDP by 2029 by the end of the projection
         period consistent with the medium term fiscal framework to be put into place under the
         program.

    ·    A stronger institutional framework will ensure that a greater proportion of windfall future
         mineral revenues are saved. By end-2009 the Government will submit to Parliament fiscal
         responsibility legislation that will include a structural fiscal rule with a reference to a
         conservative assumption on the medium-term level of copper prices and at a level that
         guarantees medium-term fiscal sustainability. As a result, the overall balance would be in
         substantial surplus in 2015-20 and would then gradually decline to reach a 1 percent surplus
         by 2029.

7.       Borrowing assumptions reflect Mongolia's move to middle-income status by 2013.

    ·    As the mining projects come on stream, Mongolia would become eligible for
         nonconcessional borrowing from both the IBRD and the AsDB in 2013. After that point
         concessional borrowing is projected to decline from 52 percent in 2014 to 27 percent by
         2029.53 Interest rates reflect IDA-blend terms and AsDB terms for concessional borrowing
         and market conditions for commercial loans with borrowing rates at about 14 percent.

    ·    Capital inflows, private external debt and portfolio investment, (which have all been
         negligible so far), in addition to FDI, are expected to increase, in line with developments of
         mining projects, and substantially help to sustain growth and build international reserves.

IV.      DEBT SUSTAINABILITY

8.       Mongolia's external public debt ratios will remain low despite the need to resort to
increased foreign financing in 2009 and 2010 to fill the large balance of payments and fiscal
needs.54 The baseline public debt indicators move with the external debt indicators, since public debt
consists largely of external debt.

    ·    Substantial one-off borrowing is required to smooth adjustment to the large terms of trade
         shock. This will, however, lead to a temporary but significant increase in the level of external
         public debt. The development of the country's mineral resources should provide a
         comfortable level of financial resources to meet Mongolia's flow financing needs, which are
         most pressing in 2012-14 (see below). As a result, external public debt is forecast to fall from
         48 percent in 2010 to 9 percent at the end of the simulation period, with the net present value
         falling from 37 percent in 2010 to 8 percent of GDP at the end of the simulation period.

    ·    Total public debt consists largely of external debt and this is expected to remain in the
         medium term, given the relatively small domestic market and the large investments needed



53Mongolia has already reached middle-income status according to IDA definition.

54The debt burden thresholds for medium policy performer are 150, 40, and 250 for the PV of debt in percent of
exports, GDP, and revenue, respectively. Under the same medium policy classification, thresholds for debt
service are 20 percent and 30 percent of exports and revenue, respectively.

         for mining infrastructure. The baseline public DSA results are very similar to the external
         DSA findings and present no concerns under the baseline case.

9.       Mongolia's risk of debt distress remains low.55 Stress testing shows that a one-time
30 percent exchange rate depreciation relative to the baseline in 2010 would breach the threshold over
the 2010-12 period. However, when the OT project comes online in 2013, the adverse effects of the
depreciation would be gradually unwound. In line with the OT project, government deposits are
expected to rapidly increase providing a comfortable fiscal reserve cushion.                  56 Therefore, the
development of the resource sector reflects a fundamental, permanent structural shift in the country's
economy. This renders the historical scenario irrelevant as it systematically underestimates future
growth prospects arising from the positive impact of significant investment in the mining project and
exports growth. Although the debt service-to-exports and debt service-to-revenues ratios will peak in
2011-12, they will stay far below the thresholds. The exceptional access under the SBA and the
broad program framework (including fiscal adjustment and monetary restraint), are intended to
bolster reserves and restore confidence in the currency and should therefore make the probability of a
real depreciation of this magnitude relatively low.

10.      The risk of public debt distress remains low. As explained in the previous paragraph, the
historical scenario is not applicable to Mongolia as the country is undergoing a structural shift. For
similar reasons, fixing the primary balance permanently at the projected exceptional 2009 fiscal
deficit of 6 percent of GDP cannot be considered a realistic worst-case scenario for Mongolia. We
think the permanent growth shock scenario is unrealistic given Mongolia's mining prospects,
although we did check that a prolonged growth shock would not endanger the PV of debt-to-GDP
ratio. Although new exogenous shocks can never be ruled out, the Government's intention to instate a
fiscal responsibility law will make Mongolia more robust.

11.      The maturity structure of debt contracted in 2009 could present some repayment
clustering in 2012-2014. The external public debt service should remain manageable, with the debt
service-to-revenue ratios falling throughout the DSA horizon. However purchases under the SBA are
expected to fall due in 2012-15 putting some pressure on the balance of payments. Reflecting these
repayments, the external public debt service-to-exports ratio is expected to peak at 4 percent in 2012
before falling back to 2 percent over the long term.

V.       ALTERNATIVE SCENARIOS

Scenario 1: Sovereign Borrowing


12.      Under the Fund-supported program the Government is allowed to raise US$200 million
of nonconcessional debt. This scenario assumes that Mongolia will issue a US$200 million bond in
2009 with a five-year maturity. Given current market conditions, particularly for first-time issuers, the


55The Staff Guidance Note on the Application of the Joint Fund-Bank Debt Sustainability Framework for
Low-Income Countries defines a "low risk of debt distress" when: "All debt indicators are well below relevant
country-specific debt-burden thresholds. Stress testing and country-specific alternative scenarios do not result in
indicators significantly breaching thresholds. In case where only one indicator is above its benchmark, judgment
is needed to determine whether there is a debt sustainability problem or some other issues, for example, a data
problem.

56The DSA is conservatively undertaken on a gross rather than on a net basis.



                                                       65

spread could be very high (1,500 bps over U.S. Treasury bonds)             57 (Box 1). However, a partial
guarantee by an institution with a high credit rating could help reduce the spread by several
percentage points. There is no impact on overall demand as proceeds can not be used for additional
spending beyond the program fiscal targets and will be used to cover bank any recapitalization costs
that would be reflected in the 2010 budget financing.

13.     Under this sovereign borrowing scenario, external debt burden indicators would be
slightly over the indicative policy thresholds. The PV of public debt would rise to 42 percent of
GDP, above the 40 percent of GDP threshold, before returning below 40 percent in 2011.

Scenario 2: Shock to Copper Price Scenario

14.     Copper is the main source of Mongolia's export earnings. It accounted for 33 percent of
2008 merchandise exports. This scenario, assumes that the global recession will last longer than
expected and copper prices will be on average 20 percent lower than in the baseline scenario
(US$4,500/tonne) during 2010-15.

15.     Under this low copper price scenario external debt burden indicators breach the
indicative policy thresholds. The PV of debt-to-GDP ratio would increase significantly higher and
breach the 40 percent threshold between 2011 and 2014. Overall, the external DSA in the low copper
price scenario shows an economy that remains vulnerable to changes in commodity prices, despite the
substantial increase in export volumes that are expected with the development of the OT mineral
project.

VI.     CONCLUSIONS

16.     The external DSA indicates that Mongolia's external debt dynamics are subject to low risk of
debt distress even though the country's risk has increased compared to the 2008 DSA due to a sharp
deterioration in the macroeconomic outlook. This is a result of both a sharp deterioration in the terms
of trade combined with loose domestic policies in the recent past. However, borrowing under the
Stand-By Arrangement and other donor financing will increase debt ratios only during the next three
years, and will be offset by Mongolia's substantial mineral wealth potential. Even in a scenario of a
significant depreciation of the currency, external debt rises initially, but is brought steadily downward
over time. Indeed, it is the staff's expectation, presuming prudent policies are brought to bear and a
significant portion of the mineral-related flows are saved, that Mongolia could end up as a net
external creditor by 2029.

                  Box 1. Prospects for a Sovereign Bond Issue by Mongolia

A simple ratings model amongst a sample of 44 rated emerging markets based on
macroeconomic indicators such as CPI inflation, FX debt relative to FX reserves and trade
openness suggests that Mongolia deserves a B rating with downward risks (speculative grade),
which is similar to Fitch's recent assessment (Fitch, 2009). This puts it in the same league as
Pakistan, Argentina, Lebanon, Ecuador and Ukraine.

In a recent Credit Suisse (2009) report, strategists found that emerging market sovereign
spreads can be explained quite well with the sovereign rating and the loans-to-deposits ratio,
which reflects current investor concerns that the largest contingent liability for governments is
a potential recapitalization of the banking sector. Applying this relationship to Mongolia's data,
we estimate that Mongolia's sovereign spread would be about 1500bps under mid-February
2009 market conditions. This shows that the market conditions are very difficult for low-rated
sovereigns (see also the table below). Moreover, a first-time issuer in financial difficulties may
find it even more difficult to enter the market at this stage.

      1/ Variables include real GDP growth, growth of GDP deflator (in U.S. dollar terms), non-interest current account in percent of GDP, and non-debt creating flows.
      2/ Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline., while grace and maturity periods are the same as in the baseline.
      3/ Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level after the shock (implicitly assuming
      an offsetting adjustment in import levels).
      4/ Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
      5/ Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.
      6/ Applies to all stress scenarios except for A2 (less favorable financing) in which the terms on all new financing are as specified in footnote 2.
