Some lessons learned include the crucial\n            importance of understanding the political economy context\n            for policy reforms and the flexible mindset of, and close\n            coordination amongst, development partners In addition,\n            prior strong TA and analytical work, and the ability and\n            resources to scale up such work quickly, are essential for a\n            successful and timely outcome in crisis-response operations.\n            It is also important to gauge from the beginning of an\n            operation the capacity, both technical and political, of the\n            borrower or the implementing agency to implement the\n            proposed reforms.
