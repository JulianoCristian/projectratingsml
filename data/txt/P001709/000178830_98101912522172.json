The project will consist of: (i) a\n            water supply component consisting of distribution system\n            works; (ii) construction of facilities, supply of vehicles,\n            and equipment for EDM operations; and (iii) a power\n            component, including construction of a 2MW biomass power\n            plant and distribution system works. To provide support for\n            institutional rehabilitation, the project will also include\n            financing of 65 work-years of consultant services for\n            technical assistance to EDM management and for carrying out\n            operational and sector policy studies. In addition,\n            technical studies and preliminary designs will be carried\n            out pursuant to the second stage of the program."}, "docdt": "1982-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
