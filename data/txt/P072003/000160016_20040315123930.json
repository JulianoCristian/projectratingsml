strengthens the Government's capacity to design and\n            carry out its development and poverty reduction programs.\n            analyses potential environmental and social impacts. Key\n            safeguard issues are mainly related to the drilling of wells\n            for the rural water supply, and medical waste generation and\n            handling. Such impacts are expected to be modest and\n            reversible through mitigation measures. Activities related\n            to forests and adjacent lands management are part of broader\n            programs spanning a five-year period, although those\n            activities planned for this project do not appear to\n            generate any adverse environmental impacts. Hence the\n            environmental and social management plan for PRSC-2 will\n            include appropriate guidance aimed at mitigating expected\n            negative impacts. Sector-specific measures aimed at\n            mitigating negative impacts forPRSC-1 include the following:\n            To protect the water supply, complete a mandatory impact\n            assessment for the dam; avoid unsanitary sites (cemeteries,\n            cattle pens, etc); control wastewater and mud around wells;\n            sensitize users about hygiene; and impose restrictions on\n            the distance between well and latrines. To manage medical\n            wastes, train personnel, acquire health care equipment and\n            use incinerators. To reduce impacts surrounding urban\n            sanitation, help update the 1998 master sanitation plan by\n            selecting high priority low-income areas where urgent\n            improvement of sanitation services is needed in order to\n            reduce the burden of environment-related diseases. However\n            investments in earthworks and dam construction will not\n            start until 2005."}, "docdt": "2004-02-27T00:00:00Z"}
