The\n            following are findings and implications for subsequent\n            operations: 1) The work under a prior operation in\n            developing government experience in results-budgeting was\n            highly instrumental in successfully implementing the\n            project. Nevertheless, monitoring and evaluation capacity in\n            most ministries was still fragile and limited. Team dialogue\n            with Government should devote greater attention to the\n            result-framework and indicators, and to related capacity\n            building activities. The main stakeholders'\n            understanding of the Poverty Reduction Support Credit (PRSC)\n            process and requirements was fragile and required\n            improvements over time. Greater team efforts to expand\n            stakeholder understanding and ownership would have improved\n            the environment for subsequent operations. Donor\n            coordination mechanisms needed to be enhanced so as to lay\n            the ground for greater harmonization of procedures. Such\n            harmonization was essential both to simplify messages for\n            Government but also to enhance the efficiency of reform\n            programs and of donor support. Starting with three sectors\n            was an ambitious beginning, and for the included themes the\n            policy matrix was quite long and detailed. It would be\n            better for the team and Government to work to simplify the matrix."}, "docdt": "2005-12-27T00:00:00Z"}
