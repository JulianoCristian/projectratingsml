F. Results Framework Analysis

Program Development Objectives (from Program Document)
The overarching objective is to support implementation of Benin's PRSP by supporting
policies to:

  (i) create the basis for private-sector-led economic growth by supporting the
Government's macroeconomic program and improving the investment climate (Pillar I of
the PRSP);
  (ii) support the Government's reform agenda and help finance its expenditure program
in key sectors focusing on the delivery of quality basic services tailored to the needs of
the poor (Pillar II or the PRSP); and
  (iii) support the Government's governance and public sector management reform
program, with the view to increasing the poverty impact of public expenditures along
with strengthening public finance management and institutional capacity (Pillar III of the
PRSP).

1. Program Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

     When the Bank began the preparation of the first series of PRSCs in 2003, the
Government of Benin had been successful in sustaining steady economic growth while
building a pluralist democracy over the past decade. Compared to most African countries
and to its starting point of economic collapse and political crisis in 1989, Benin had
achieved remarkable progress in sustaining robust growth which continued for many
years after the CFA devaluation in 1994. Growth generally exceeded other economies in
the region and productivity gains allowed per capita incomes to rise. The Government's
structural adjustment program had been successful in establishing fiscal discipline,
opening up the economy, privatizing most public enterprises, and strengthening private
sector incentives.    Most social indicators improved steadily throughout the 1990s,
particularly for education and health.

     Real GDP growth exceeded 5 percent per year on average during 2000-03 and per
capita GNP growth increased from 2.3 percent on average over 1996-99 to 2.8 percent
during 2000-03. Despite the increases in the international prices of oil and in customs
tariffs in 2000 following the introduction of the WAEMU Common External Tariff,
inflation remained at about 3 percent on average over the 2000-03 period. Benin's
performance in tax collection improved with fiscal revenue to GDP ratio increasing from
15.2 on average in 1996-99 to 16.7 in 2000-03 (17 percent in 2003). The overall budget
deficit, on a payment order basis and including grants, widened from 1.8 percent of GDP
in 2000 to 2.1 percent in 2003 due to the implementation of social and development
expenditures, mostly financed under HIPC assistance.

     Progress over this period in structural and sectoral reforms was mixed. Key reforms
were implemented in the public expenditure management and cotton sector. However,
progress was much slower in other areas, including in particular, the implementation of
the divestiture program for public utilities and SONAPRA and the reform of the civil
service.

     It is in that context that the Government, together with its main development
partners, decided to pursue and sustain a more poverty focused growth strategy. The
PRSP prepared in 2003 outlined and prioritized the Government's poverty reduction
strategy based on four pillars: (i) bolstering the medium-term macroeconomic
framework; (ii) strengthening human development and environmental management,
including improving the access of the poor to quality basic services (basic education,
primary health care, water and sanitation, food security and nutrition, adequate habitat,
and rural roads); (iii)     improving governance and institutional reforms, such as
decentralization, public administration reform, and the strengthening of the legal and
judicial system; and (iv) improving employment or income-generating opportunities for
the poor and strengthening their capacity to participate in decision making and
production. Consistent with the PRSP, the Government developed program budgets for
key sectors (rural water, education, health, environment and urban sanitation, agriculture,


                                            1

and transportation) which became inputs for the Medium-Term Expenditure Framework
implemented under the PRSCs.

     The WB-IMF joint-staff assessment note on the Benin's PRSP was discussed and
endorsed by the Bank and Fund Boards in March 2003.                 It concluded that the
Government's poverty strategy was broadly appropriate to the country's circumstances.
In particular, the Government's strategy focused on increasing public expenditures to
priority social sectors along with necessary improvements in the quality of service
delivery. At the same time, reforms aimed at reducing the costs of transport, energy, and
telecommunications through the divestiture of public utilities and private sector
involvement in the management of the Port of Cotonou were to be accelerated.
Liberalization of the cotton sector were to be actively pursued through the privatization
of SONAPRA's ginning mills, in order to enhance competition and allow a larger share
of the world price to be passed through to farmers. The PRSP explicitly called for donors
to move progressively to programmatic lending and budget support.

     The CAS discussed by the Board on July 3, 2003 aligned itself with the PRSP and
built on the progress made under the Interim CAS (January 2001) in moving towards
programmatic lending. It envisaged a progressive shift to consolidated programmatic
support through PRSCs, although the Bank would continue traditional self-standing
operations where the benefits of separate implementation and financial arrangements
appeared to outweigh the advantages of a more integrated approach to public financial
resource transfers. The Bank's CAS supported Benin's economic growth and poverty
reduction strategy as spelled out in the PRSP pillars listed above.

In cooperation with other key development partners, and consistent with the long-term
assistance strategy laid out in the CAS, the Bank decided to move to consolidated
programmatic lending through a series of Poverty Reduction Support Credits (PRSCs).
Consolidated programmatic lending was to focus on policy reforms to strengthen
government management of public resources as well as its institutional capacity to carry
out its own development and poverty reduction programs.

1.2 Original Program Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

     The PRSC series of credits was intended to support Benin's PRSP implementation
with concessional financing through the national budget processes. These credits would
not provide support to all the policy measures in the PRSP but focus on key policy and
institutional reforms in priority areas. Also, given the comprehensiveness of the PRSP
and the high cost of its implementation, PRSCs would be designed to assist the
Government in establishing priorities and implementing a rolling core reform program.

     More specifically, the overall program development objective of the PRSCs during
the 2004-06 period was to support the Government of Benin in its efforts to reduce
poverty through policies designed to: (i) create the basis for private-sector-led economic
growth by supporting the Government's macroeconomic program and improving the
investment climate (Pillar I of the PRSP); (ii) support the Government's reform agenda
and help finance its expenditure program in key sectors focusing on the delivery of



                                           2

quality basic services tailored to the needs of the poor (Pillar II of the PRSP); and (iii)
support the Government's governance and public sector management reform program,
with the view to increasing the poverty impact of public expenditures along with
strengthening public finance management and institutional capacity (Pillar III of the
PRSP).

    The series of PRSCs was intended to cover one PRSP cycle and be synchronized
with the Government's budget cycle. It would contain policy measures and outcome
indicators for each of the PRSCs. The PRSCs would provide an anchor for the Bank's
overall support to Benin's policy and institutional reform and public expenditure
priorities. Each individual PRSC would be put in place and disbursed on the basis of the
up-front completion of a set of prior actions that demonstrated satisfactory progress of the
country's social and structural reform agenda in support of its poverty reduction strategy.

    The PRSC program built on progress made in transitioning towards consolidated
programmatic lending under the Interim CAS. As planned under the 2001 Interim CAS,
sector projects were closed in education, health, rural water and sanitation, environment,
and agriculture with the view to mainstream key activities in consolidated programmatic
support.    A gradual transition toward a consolidated programmatic approach was
launched at both Government-wide and sectoral levels. At the Government-wide level,
the PERAC supported the Government's public expenditure management reforms. At the
same time, a substantial, focused program of analytical and advisory activities helped the
Government formulate the country's poverty reduction strategy and a related medium-
term expenditure framework, including strategic analysis of budget programs at the sector
level as well as reinforcing institutional processes and capacity in key cross-cutting
themes linked to improved public financial management.

While taking into account the PERAC experience, which focused on five sectors at the
onset (health, education, rural development, public works and transportation, and
environment and urban sanitation) and covered eight sectors at completion, the selection
of sectors to be included in the PRSCs over the period 2004-06 was determined by three
major and weighted considerations: (i) the Bank's comparative advantage and the
potential for coordination and synergy with other donors; (ii) the consistency and
continuity with the 2001 Interim CAS and the 2003 CAS under which the Bank
supported the Government's strategy to move toward programmatic lending and sector
projects to be folded in programmatic support; and (iii) the readiness of the sector, that is
whether conditions for ensuring effective participation of the sector in programmatic
financing were considered acceptable, judged notably by the quality of the sector strategy,
the reform agenda for increasing expenditure efficiency, and the capacity to prepare and
implement program budgets.

     In addition to the initial three core sectors (rural water, health, and basic education),
the PRSC would support the implementation of environment and urban sanitation and the
forest management programs -- two sub-sector programs that had achieved impressive
results under the PERAC and where no substantial policy issues were expected. Other
sectors/sub-sectors would be progressively included in subsequent PRSCs to support the
Government's reform agenda on the basis of an assessment of their readiness that
included results of the sectoral dialogue as well as agreements on an acceptable
framework for performance-based programs.

     In line with the CAS base case lending and grant program, the first three-year PRSC
series was to be disbursed over the coming years with a progressively increased annual
PRSC. The annual amounts planned were US$20 million equivalent in FY04, US$30
million equivalent in FY05, and US$35 million equivalent in FY06, respectively. The
initial PDO of each PRSC were as follows:




                                             4

PRSC-1: The first component of PRSC-1 focused on enhancing the macro-framework
and conditions for economic growth.

It should be noted that actions supporting privatizing the public cotton ginneries, the
electricity utility, SBEE, the telecommunications branch of the telecommunications and
post office (OPT), and the Port of Cotonou were not covered by PRSC-1. Related
reforms were included in PRSCs 2 and 3 in parallel with the technical and financial
support provided by parallel investment credits.

    The second component of PRSC-1 aimed at improving service delivery in basic
education, health, and rural water, sectors critical to assist the Government advance its
poverty reduction agenda by improving access of the population to basic services of
acceptable quality while increasing expenditure efficiency in these sectors. In addition to
the above three core sectors, the PRSC would support the implementation of environment
and urban sanitation and the forest management programs -- two sub-sector programs that
had achieved impressive results under the PERAC.

    The third component of PRSC-1 incorporated actions designed to improve
governance and public sector management by pursuing the move towards result-based
budgeting; strengthening budget execution; reforming and strengthening public
procurement; improving government financial management; and streamlining and
modernizing internal control and audit.

PRSC-2: Reforms supported by PRSC-2 built on the measures implemented with the
support of PRSC-1, with the following focus:

    In the first component of PRSC-2 more emphasis was put on (i) cotton sector
reform, through reform of the regulatory framework and adopting new cotton inputs and
marketing arrangements; and (ii) enhancing the rural transport sector in order to increase
access of rural communities to basic social services and production areas.

    The second component of PRSC-2 aimed at improving service delivery in basic
education, health, and rural water, with special focus on: (i) further increasing access to
rural water services, and the reliability, affordability, and sustainability of water
provision; (ii) improving overall health sector management and increasing equitable
access to basic quality services; and (iii) increasing enrollment and the completion of
basic education programs of reasonably good quality, while empowering communities in
school management.

    The third component of PRSC-2 focused on improving governance and public
sector management. In addition to the actions engaged under PRSC-1, PRSC-2 put
additional emphasis on improving government accounting and enhancing external
oversight. PRSC-2 also included components on civil service reform, decentralization
and strengthening the legal and judiciary framework.

PRSC-3: Policies supported by PRSC-3 built on reforms implemented under PRSC-2.
The first component of PRSC-3 focused on actions aimed at accelerating sustainable
economic growth. Measures focused on (i) adopting strategies for private participation in


                                           5

infrastructure and the introduction of regulatory codes that enable that participation; (ii)
implementing a private sector development strategy including reforms in land market,
customs, and business taxes; (iii) supporting the reforms in the agricultural and forestry
sectors; (iv) continuing reforms in the cotton sector; and (v) implementing the rural
transport strategy (PRSC-3 triggers show the greater relative importance of points ii and
iv.)

    The second component incorporated measures aimed at improving service delivery
in rural water, health, basic education, and environmental areas.        The measures to
improve service delivery in rural water focused on further increasing access to safe water
in rural and semi-urban areas. Measures to improve the delivery of health services
centered on encouraging deployment of health personnel to remote and underserved areas
and implementing mechanisms to allow increased financial access of the poor to quality
health services. Measures to improve access to quality education focused on increasing
enrollment and completion in basic education, empowering communities in school
management, improving teacher recruitment and redeployment and improving
accountability and governance. Finally, PRSC-3 was to support increased investments in
environmental enforcement and compliance.

    The third component of PRSC-3 incorporated measures designed to ensure good
governance and further enhance public sector management. These actions included
moving forward with reforms to improve budget execution, accounting and procurement,
strengthen the legal and judicial sector, deconcentration and decentralization, improve
public administration, strengthen the capacity to monitor and evaluate poverty reduction,
and promote transparency and anti-corruption.

    The anticipated results that were to be achieved in each of these policy areas are
summarized below:

Create the basis for private-sector-led economic growth. By the en of PRSC-1-3, it
was expected that Benin would have achieved the following:
    · Macroeconomic stability would be maintained and the macro framework
        strengthened
    · The agriculture sector contribution to poverty reduction would be increased
    · Private investment would rise as a share of GDP

Improve basic service delivery. By the end of PRSC-1-3, it was expected that progress
would be made towards:
    · Improved access of rural populations to safe drinking water
    · Improved access, quality and use of health services
    · Increased access, completion and quality in basic education




                                          6

Improve governance and public sector management. By the end of PRSC-1-3, it was
expected that the following would be achieved:
    · Public expenditure programs in key sectors are financed and executed
    · Fiduciary standards are improved
    · Civil service, justice and anti-corruption agendas support better governance

Key Indicators

     When the PRSC series was launched, the `results framework' standard for outcomes
monitoring and reporting had not yet been developed at the Bank, so the team established
what it thought the most relevant framework. In order to match the credit focus on
service delivery, the selected monitoring indicators related to the three core service
delivery sectors, safe water, health and basic education. These indicators were retained
throughout the series and were largely met or exceeded. (See Annex 1)

     Over the course of the series, the Bank team worked to retro-fit the PRSCs with
indicators to suit Pillars I and III. For example, targets on cotton output were instituted
when low world prices and poor enforcement of the regulatory framework combined in
2005 to generate a sudden drop in output below the national capacity of 350K tons. The
share of private investment in GDP was selected as an indicator when PSD was
introduced as a sector in PRSC-3.        This exercise was conducted in the context of
government PRSP monitoring, and extensive coordination among budget support donors
(see Annex 1)

     Donor coordination had a strong impact on the selection of indicators for public
expenditure management, a domain in common to all budget support programs. In Benin,
the program for non-Bank budget support (ABC) donors had conditions for disbursement
based entirely on indicators rather than measures. As part of an agreement to try to
integrate the elements of the Bank and ABC program in a single matrix, many of the
ABC indicators were written in the `Results' column of the policy matrix.              The
Government requested that, in the interest of reducing monitoring burdens, government,
Bank and donors agree on a few public expenditure indicators that would be reported
regularly by government in the PRSP Annual Progress Reports. These include: the
budget share of core sectors, procurement delays, payment delays, and the share of off-
procedure spending in total expenditures. This agreement was reflected in the results
framework for PRSC-4.

1.3 Revised PDO

     Program objectives remained unchanged over the program period.                During
PRSC-2, it was expected that the public cotton ginneries owned by SONAPRA would be
privatized under PRSC-3. During PRSC-3 which straddled the 2006 political transition,
this expectation was revised and a dialogue was launched with the new Government to
develop a new strategy for the management of SONAPRA ginneries. In addition, the
number of indicators was increased from 36 in PRSC-1 to 37 in PRSCs-2 and 39 in
PRSC-3 in order to better cover public expenditures and sectors added after PRSC-1.

1.4 Original Policy Areas Supported by the Program (as approved):

    The policy areas supported by PRSC-1 correspond to the three components outlined
above, namely:

         (i)   Enhancing the macro-framework and conditions for private sector-led
       growth.

        (ii)   Improving service delivery (access to safe water in rural areas, access to
       quality health services, access to quality basic education, environment and
       forestry).

       (iii)   Improving governance and public sector management (moving
       towards results-based budgeting, improving delegation of spending authority to
       line ministries, strengthening public procurement, improving public financial
       management, and streamlining internal controls and audits).

The policy areas supported by PRSC-2 are (new issues are in italics):

         (i)   Accelerating sustainable economic growth (addressing the issues of the
       macro framework, cotton sector reform, agricultural development and rural
       transport).

        (ii)   Improving service delivery (access to safe water in rural areas, access to
       quality health services, access to quality basic education, environment and
       forestry).

       (iii)   Improving governance and transparency (moving toward results-based
       budgeting, strengthening public procurement and financial management,
       streamlining internal controls and audit, civil service reform, decentralization and
       strengthening the legal and judiciary framework).

The policy areas supported by PRSC-3 are (new issues are in italics):

         (i)   Accelerating sustainable economic growth (addressing policy issues of
       private participation in infrastructure, private sector development strategy,
       agriculture and forestry, rural transport).

        (ii)   Improving basic services and environment protection (access to safe
       water in rural areas, access to quality health services, access to quality basic
       education, environment and forestry).

Ensure good governance (moving toward results-based budgeting, strengthening public
procurement and financial management, streamlining internal controls and audit, civil
service reform, decentralization, strengthening the legal and judicial sector and
strengthening the monitoring and evaluation of poverty reduction efforts).

1.5 Revised Policy Areas

     There was broad continuity between each of the PRSC operations, although an
increase in the number of sectors covered by PRSCs was planned from the beginning (see
chart 1). The objective was initially to support well-developed national sector programs
with a reasonably clear and realistic results framework. PRSC-1 therefore started with
basic education, health and access to rural safe water as core/focus sector programs and
environment and forestry as "maintenance" programs--in addition to actions to improve
governance and public sector management. Other sectors/themes to be included in
subsequent operations were identified based either on the basis of progress in developing
a result-based program (for instance for agriculture and justice there was already an
agreed sector reform/development strategy available) and/or a critical cross-sector
bottleneck for improving public service delivery such as decentralization and civil
service/administrative reforms. Another rationale for their addition was developing the
basic framework to foster private-sector-led growth and agricultural development, hence
the inclusion of agriculture and rural transport in PRSC2 and Private Sector Development
in PRSC3. The inclusion of these sectors was also supported by extensive analytical
work that indicated their importance for improving the conditions for economic growth.
Beginning with PRSC-3, there was also an increased emphasis on governance and
strengthening the monitoring and evaluation of poverty reduction.

1.6 Other significant changes

     There were originally 10 triggers identified under PRSC-1 for PRSC-2. These were
increased to 12 prior actions in order to accommodate three new sectors while others
were revised either slightly to make the triggers more precise or more substantially to
adjust to shifting circumstances. In the latter case, the original measures were retained
and completed under PRSC-3. A trigger was also dropped and completed under PRSC-3.
The 13 triggers identified in PRSC-2 for PRSC-3 were reduced to 12 prior actions as two
measures were dropped and later completed under PRSC-4 and one was added.

     There was also a reduction of the amount of PRSC-3 from the initially planned
US$35 million to US$30 million, consistent at that time with the overall IDA financing
available. The reduction was due to a miscalculation in the case of another credit on the
total IDA availability, with the impact imposed on PRSC-3, and did not represent any
issue of performance in the context of PRSC-3.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Program Performance

     Beyond the progress achieved (see below) in the three areas of focus, the PRSC
series provided value added and demonstrated its quality of successful instrument in (1)
aligning the Bank's support with the Government's strategy and institutions for poverty
reduction; (2) promoting ownership and a better functioning of client's institutions; (3)
maintaining policy dialogue between the Government and the Bank in areas identified



                                            9

earlier as key challenges for economic development; and (4) providing a framework for
coordination with development partners, particularly with the IMF through its Poverty
Reduction Growth Facility (PRGF) and other budget support donors.

     However, in assessing program performance, it may be arbitrary to fully attribute
results to one specific PRSC or another, rather than to the program as a whole. Also, it is
difficult to demonstrate that the results achieved in the implementation of the reforms
targeted and highlighted in the PRSP can be attributed to the PRSCs because of the
absence of a counterfactual and the fact that some of these reforms were also supported
by other complementary Bank instruments and other donors. Nonetheless, it can be
considered that the overall PRSC program contributed significantly to pushing the
Government's efforts to achieve results in PRSP implementation through the three
main areas supported by the series. Benin made important progress in achieving
outcomes in enhancing the macroeconomic framework and conditions for economic
growth, improving governance and public sector management, and increasing access to
basic service, although program performance in the areas of quality of basic services was
weaker. These achievements are described below and shown in Table 1 (Anticipated and
Actual Outcomes) and Annexes.

Overall Outcomes of PRSC 1-3:

Accelerate sustainable economic growth

    One of the achievements under the first series of PRSCs has been the maintenance of
macroeconomic stability (see table 2 below). Despite unfavorable economic shocks
(Nigerian trade restrictions and a drop in international cotton prices), the fiscal deficit, tax
revenues, and inflation have all been maintained within targets set under the IMF-
supported PRGF program. Real economic growth, affected by negative external shocks
and presidential elections, slowed to 3 percent in 2004 and 2005, but recovered to 3.8
percent in 2006 and 4.6 percent in 2007. Private investment as a share of GDP increased
from 12.7 percent in 2003 to 13.7 percent in 2007. Inflation has been maintained within
UEMOA guidelines, with the exception of 2005 when food prices were affected by
draught and famine in neighboring Niger. Fiscal consolidation was achieved through the
2000s. Between 2004 and 2006, fiscal revenue was maintained at about 16.5 percent of
GDP. Over the same period, total government expenditures increased from 20.6 percent
of GDP to 19.5 percent of GDP due to the increase in poverty-reducing outlays in line
with the implementation of the Poverty Reduction Strategy. Despite these developments,
fiscal discipline was broadly maintained with an overall budget deficit (on a payment
order basis and excluding grants) contained to about 3.5 percent of GDP in 2004-2006.
This was primarily achieved by cutting domestically financed capital expenditures and
non-priority current expenditures. In 2007, fiscal revenues rose to 19 percent of GDP,
expenditures to 23 percent and the fiscal deficit fell to 3.7 percent. In the balance of
payments area, the overall balance has been evolving favorably, with reserves
accumulating from 11 months of imports in 2003 to 14.7 months in 2006 and 15.2 in
2007. The ratio of debt service to exports decreased steadily from 12.5 percent in 2003 to
5.7 percent in 2006 and 4.9 percent in 2007. Cotton exports decreased as a percentage of
exports from 69 percent in 2003 to 38.9 percent in 2006 and 40.5 percent in 2007,
signaling a move towards diversification.

    The period during which the first cycle of PRSCs took place coincided with an
historic election that would, due to constitutional age restrictions for candidates, end the
regime of a team that had towered over the political scene for thirty years. Also, a drop
in world cotton prices and new trade restrictions from Nigeria made for a difficult
international environment.     Despite these disruptions and negative shocks, Benin
experienced positive economic growth and a modest increase in real GDP per capita,
albeit below targets set by government. Program budgets continued to be implemented as
was the agenda to improve budget systems. Against this background, PRSC proved to be
an instrument relevant to the country's circumstances and helped the country recover
from these shocks.

    The pace of implementing cotton sector reforms to accelerate economic growth has
been gradual. Important strategic decisions were taken on the nature of government
involvement in the cotton sector, on its regulatory framework, and on how to enforce this
framework within the agreed protocol for private operation of the sector. The result has
been a more productive organization of cotton input supplies and output production.
Regulatory frameworks for the cotton sector are likely to need revision every few years.


                                           14

Current proposals call for a new framework with moderate revisions to the one adopted in
2004. Many stakeholders in the cotton sector reform believed that the reforms would be
reinforced, and the management of the sector by the inter-profession strengthened, if the
public ginneries owned by SONAPRA were privatized. A plan to privatize SONAPRA
was launched by Government in 2004, suspended in 2006 just before presidential
elections, re-launched under a different approach by the new government in 2006 and
reintroduced under a new and longer timetable in 2008. The current assessment of sector
experts is that privatization of SONAPRA ginning assets is still preferable, but that the
current management of the mixed public/private market by the inter-profession is still
viable.

     Progress in the energy sector had long been stalled due to a lack of critical strategic
decisions on management of the electricity company. In 2007 a strategy was chosen and
a program to improve the company's financial and technical efficiency, as well as to
reduce black-outs, has been put in place.       Legal statutes creating and authorizing
regulatory structures will serve the utility sector, even though progress toward private
participation moves slowly. The implementation of Government's strategy to open port
management to the private sector also did not progress significantly. Even so, the
Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) has supported substantial new investments in
the port to be managed by a private concession.

     Progress in improving the business climate for the private sector has been slow. The
initial baseline was quite low, as was first documented in the 2005 ICA. Although
business regulations in Benin are broadly at par with SSA averages according to
international assessments (including the 2005 ICA and Doing Business reports), the
business climate continued to be marked by poor regulations and governance which
resulted in very high administrative costs (Benin ranked 151 out of the 178 countries in
the 2008 Doing Business Report). For example, it still takes 7 procedures and 31 days
and costs twice the average annual income to register a business in Benin while it takes
49 procedures and 720 days on average to enforce contracts. Other obstacles reported by
businesses included: harassment by fiscal authorities (according to the 2007 Doing
Business report, total tax rate represents 68.5 percent of profits while the number of tax
payments averaged 72 in 2006); poor and expensive utility services and difficult access to
land. High corruption and poor contract enforcement by the judiciary system constitute
other main concerns to investors.

     The first PRSC measure to address these problems (the adoption of a revised strategy
for private sector development and preparation of a private sector letter of development
policy) was included in PRSC-3 and adopted in September 2006. As such, it is still early
for outcomes to become visible from this reform, and clearly there is still much left to do.
However, tax, customs and land tenure reforms have progressed; the dialogue has started,
and institutions like the President's Investor Council (PIC) and private sector advisor
groups that meet with government on tax and customs reforms are expected to lead to
further improvements in outcomes.

     The development of the rural road strategy represents an important institutional
reform where rural stakeholders played an active role in determining the medium-term


                                           15

investment plan. Thus, rural roads investments were designed to meet users' needs. The
set-up of the institutional framework to implement the new strategy was delayed, and
thus the pace of new investments fell behind the original schedule, but was ahead of plans
for 2007. The transport sector was also in need of substantial capacity building in order
to handle the transition from donor investments to managing a program budget in the
domestic budget system.

      In agriculture, the Government has identified and extended a number of agriculture
services that have contributed to agricultural diversification. Forestry reform programs
have increased the number of forest service agents, allowing an increased number of
forests to be placed under participatory forest management plans. Environment programs
have reinforced sectoral environment cells in key ministries who are now submitting
environmental assessments of their planned investments. Environment programs have
also contributed to improving urban sanitation.

Improve service delivery

      In the area of delivering priority basic services to the population, the government
program focused on rural water, health and basic education. Altogether the outcomes
have been positive during the period (see Annex 1). Access has clearly increased, though
quality has mostly been maintained rather than increased.        Even so, a majority of
indicators have reached their 2006 target as set in PRSC 1-3. Performance is detailed as
follows for the three main sectors:



                                           16

     The Government has made significant progress in increasing access to safe water to
the rural population from 36 percent in 2003 to 44 percent in 2006 (against a target of
45 percent). Since 2001, the sector execution capacity has more than doubled. For the
first time ever, Benin constructed in 2004 about 1,200 water points against a target of 700
and an average of 550 over the last twenty years, and 1,160 and 1,200 in 2005 and 2006,
respectively, both above the annual targets. Water facilities functionality rate has also
improved from 75 percent in 2003 to 86 percent in 2006 (against a target of 90 percent).

     Progress was made in implementing other core policy measures and actions.
Concerning the development of local public/private partnership for water system
management in secondary towns, the Ministry in charge of Water started implementing
an action plan which will lead to the realization of PPP management contracts with
private operators. Sector monitoring and evaluation improved through a better reporting
system and successful annual sector reviews which provide all stakeholders with detailed
information on physical and financial aspects of the program.

     As a result, Benin is on track to reach the MDG for rural water supply, i.e. providing
67.5 percent of the population in 2015. This means that 6.3 million Beninese living in a
rural or semi-urban environment would gain access to potable water by 2015, against 2.5
million people in 2004. That new prospect regarding the MDG is the result of the
successful programmatic approach implemented in partnership with the Bank and other
donors.

     The Government made progress in terms of outcomes in the health sector.
Geographical access to health services is high (86 percent), and availability of essential
drugs was maintained at close to 90 percent over the past decade due to the good
performance of the central pharmaceutical procurement agency. The utilization rate of
basic health services by the population increased from 36 percent in 2003 to 44 percent in
2006. The proportion of attended deliveries increased from 73 percent in 2003 to 82
percent in 2006. The immunization coverage (DTCP3 to children at their first birthday)
reached 87 percent in 2004 and 94 percent in 2005 (92 percent in 2006). These outcomes
met or exceeded original targets. The development of the sector has, however, been
hampered by the persistent inefficiency of the public health system and the poor quality
of services provided in public health facilities. The policy dialogue continued in strategic
budgeting and planning, and the development and implementation of a results-oriented
MTEF. The Minister has indicated that hygiene and sanitation, critical to reaping the full
health benefits of improved water supplies, will be accorded its own sub-program in the
next program budget.        A comprehensive health service package has also been
disseminated countrywide.

     The mechanism aimed at promoting the financial access of the poor to good health
services was adopted through a joint administrative decree and has started to be
implemented. However, health service provision and financing remain inequitable as
there is a large gap between the rich and the poor in terms of access to quality health
services. Slow progress was made in strengthening the partnership between public and
private sectors. Also, implementation of three reform measures is still pending. These are
(i) the adoption of the legal framework governing contracts in the health sector; (ii) the


                                           17

delay in the implementation of the Human Resource related reform, especially the
establishment of an incentive mechanism for personnel serving in remote areas; and (iii)
the execution of the program of construction in the remote areas.

     The Government sustained its efforts to increase access to education at all levels,
with a priority to basic education. Gross enrollment rate in primary education increased
from 94.5 percent in 2002/03 to 95.6 percent in 2005/06 while the completion rate rose
from 49 percent to 59 percent during the same period. The gross access ratio to the first
grade decreased between 2002/2003 and 2004/2005 (from 104 percent to 94 percent), but
increased to 109 percent in 2005/2006. The internal efficiency greatly improved (the
repetition rate fell from 24 percent in 2002/2003 to 8 percent in 2004/2005, exceeding
targets). However, progress in reducing geographic disparity as well as in improving
learning achievements was modest and remains a key challenge. The collection of
comparable data on learning achievement was disrupted by lengthy teacher strikes in
2004/5, and Benin remains below the West Africa average on learning achievement.
However, textbook availability has increased from 0.5 per student in 2002/2003 to 0.8 in
2005/2006.

     The Government continued to implement the action plan adopted in 2003 to improve
the implementation of educational reforms as well as schooling retention. This includes
progress on in-service training to teachers and principals and on streamlining the
curriculum along with the teacher guides in grades 1 to 4. Implementation of core
activities to reduce school discontinuity has been slow due partly to difficulties
experienced with the budget execution procedures. The construction of twenty targeted
blocks of three classrooms was completed, and the implementation of the pilot-program
for multi-grade teaching was fairly well implemented during the 2005/06 school year.
Implementation of programs out-sourced to NGOs to promote girl's education in targeted
nineteen sub-districts has improved over time, although there is a need to enhance the
selection of the NGOs as well as the monitoring activities. The Government has agreed
that a preliminary evaluation of this pilot-program will be carried out with the view to
provide recommendations for strengthening its implementation and possible expansion.

     To promote access to education, in October 2006 the Government announced the full
gratuity in primary education. The teacher training policy was finalized and is being
implemented. 1,018 contractual teachers were recruited by October 2006 and 982
positions were filled by December 2006. These teachers were redeployed throughout the
districts. Nevertheless, the percentage of schools with student teacher ratios lower than
forty or higher than seventy increased in every district between 2003-2005, suggesting
that the redeployment policy is insufficient to reduce disparities. Two teachers training
institutions (ENI) have been renovated and a first promotion of 600 teachers graduated
from these ENI. Also, the National Girls Education and Training policy has been adopted
and the targeted programs are being implemented. The action plan to improve students'
achievement is being implemented with the sub-cycle approach at level CE1 and CE2.
Thirty schools are experimenting with multi-grade teaching and 948 teachers, 29
inspectors and 27 advisers have been trained for this purpose. Unfortunately, and as
indicated above, a series of teacher strikes interrupted attempts to measure learning
achievement over time. The participatory management of schools is in place in 26


                                          18

municipalities but the regulatory framework still needs to be finalized to scale up the
initiative.

     One of the objectives of the PRSCs was to support the Government's poverty
reduction strategy by financing its expenditure program in key sectors. Thus, the PRSCs
targeted a constant or increasing budget share for the sectors listed in Table 4, which was
achieved.

Improving Governance and Public Sector Management

     In 2001, Benin embarked on a number of reforms to improve public expenditure
management. The objectives were to raise the efficiency and transparency of public
spending. The reforms included developing a medium term expenditure framework
defining sectoral program budgets with specific monitorable objectives. The reforms also
intended to shift spending authority and responsibility from central to line ministries, and
gradually to decentralized levels of government while maintaining strong fiduciary
standards.

     Benin made significant progress in this area under PRSC-1, 2 and 3 and continues to
implement these reforms. Program budgets are now produced for 17 sectors, and details
are integrated into the annual budget submitted to Parliament. Like many countries in
transition to performance-based budgeting, Benin continues to produce a line-item budget
and program budgets in parallel. However, ministry staff manage and monitor the
programs in the program budgets, and report on these in their annual performance
reports. Performance-based contracts between the Minister of Finance and the ministers
responsible for designated sub-programs have been signed. The 2006 and 2007 budgets
were prepared in terms of program authorizations and payment appropriations, which is
an encouraging step to follow-up multi-year contracts. Sectoral performance reports are



                                           19

produced regularly, although the quality of monitoring indicators needs to be improved
over time, and the management tools for responding to monitoring outcomes need to be
established through a variety of civil service reforms and capacity building. Government
adopted a performance-based public expenditure management reform plan based on the
2005 CFAA and ETARB's performance evaluation. Progress was also made in budget
execution reporting and transparency, and in reducing fiduciary risk, although there are
some weaknesses, as noted below.

    SIGFIP, the budget execution software, has now been extended to all ministries.
ASTER, the related accounting software has also been installed and the interface between
the two software programs has been implemented. The budget execution system has
been extended to the department level with the installation of SIGFP in all departments.
The SIGFIP budget system has also been adapted to allow comprehensive coverage of
donor-financed expenditure. The Government is now trying to ensure that it collects
information on external resources in a systematic way.

    In early 2005, the Government adopted a series of decrees and measures to reduce
the amount of spending executed under special procedures (OPs). As of September 2005,
these efforts appeared to have succeeded in reducing the amount of OPs for budgeted
expenditures to CFA 16 billion from a total of 57 billion in 2003 and OPs fell from 27 to
16 percent of total expenditures over the same period. However, from October 2005 to
March 2006 OPs for budgeted as well as unbudgeted spending increased significantly in
the context of presidential elections. The OP procedure poses high risks of overrunning
budget authorization ceilings and lacks the appropriate control over the use of public
funds. The new Government has taken very seriously the issue of OP and has committed
to drastically reduce the use of exceptional measures, demonstrably with a good degree of
success thus far ­ to about 5 percent of total expenditures in 2006 and less than 5 percent
in 2007. In addition, payment lags were reduced in 2003 and 2004, increased in 2005,
but by 2006 the delay fell back to below the level in 2003. (See annex 1)

    Steady progress was made on the internal control system. A steering committee was
set up to direct the reform, and, after consultation with stakeholders, decrees have been
passed both for creating internal control units within the line ministries and for defining
professional norms and standards. The General Inspectorate for Finance notes that the
operation of SIGFIP has significantly aided the progress of internal control.

    The processing of external audits experienced lengthy delays due to lack of capacity
and resources at the Chamber of Accounts but steady progress has been made under the
PRSC series.     The audits for the 2000, 2001, 2002 and 2003 final accounts were
completed. The performance report audits for 2001, 2002 and 2003 were completed,
although, by agreement with Government, the final accounts audits will need to take
priority over performance reports until the former are brought up to date. Final accounts
for 2004 and 2005 were completed for review by the Chamber of Accounts. The
Chamber of Accounts has prepared a strategic recruitment plan to expand its human
resources in order to recover from these processing delays, and the Supreme Court has
endorsed this plan.




                                           20

     While there are no indicators measuring budget management performance over time,
PEFA indicators confirm the CPIA rating of 3.5 in budgetary management, greater than
Guinea but less than Burkina Faso. The PEFA indicators refer to 2006 data which were
affected by election year anomalies.

     One important indication of improvement is the flexibility the Government has
gained in adapting to fundamental structural reforms in budget systems. When new
financial management procedures were introduced, there was a short term surge in OPs
(off-procedure transactions). Government then attacked the OPs and brought the number
down. When payment lags accumulated and execution then slowed down, Government
took a number of actions to revive performance on both fronts.            Similarly, when
procurement reforms were introduced, procurement delays rose at first; then the
Government addressed this issue rapidly and these delays fell.

     Since the new procurement law was passed in 2004, the Government worked to set
up the institutional mechanisms for implementing the law. The National Regulatory
Agency for Procurement (CNRMP) and the National Executing Agency for Public
Procurement (DNMP) were established, the Permanent Secretary for the CNRMP was
hired, and the agencies are now functioning. A dispute settlement process was set up and
begun handling procurement complaints. A numeric evaluation of the current system is
underway and should identify the biggest points of delay in the procurement process.
With the recent introduction of new procedures, the average period required for public
supply acquisitions rose to 123 days in 2004, above the target level of 57 days, but
declined to 105 days in 2005 and 81 days in 2006. Further training and experience with
the new procedures and the full functioning of new institutions is expected to bring
further down the number of days required.

     Actions on justice reform were not included in PRSC-1 and appeared only in PRSC-
2. The Ministry of Justice is implementing a ten year reform program started in 2001 and
aiming at modernizing the judicial system to help improve service delivery, including
services to the private sector such as dispute resolution. Effective implementation and
improvement of the performance of the justice sector has been slow. The weak internal
capacity, lack of leadership and coordination and chronic insufficiency of funds seem to
be the main bottlenecks.       In particular, delays have accumulated over the yearly
requirement of hiring the requisite number of new judges and clerks. Even so, the 30
new judges and clerks recruited during PRSC-2 have now completed training and will
help replenish the depleted judicial cadres; the 40 recruited during PRSC-3 continue
training while the concour to recruit the next class has been launched. Progress has been
made to define and to monitor the core performance indicators for the justice sector,
including the monitoring of the proportion of cases disposed out of the cases in stock,
thereby permitting the Ministry to better identify the needs and progresses of the justice
sector.

     Civil service reform stalled for several years due to strong opposition from trade
unions and the Parliament. However, the government formed after the 2006 elections
started discussions with the trade unions on a new civil service reform strategy that would
include a revised merit-based promotion and remuneration system and the adoption of a


                                          21

single statute for government employees covering both civil servants and contractual
employees. Key human resources management responsibilities have been delegated to
the education ministry as a pilot experiment and the positive evaluation of this process
will constitute the basis for planning further deconcentration to more line ministries (with
necessary capacity building in parallel, since the evaluation highlighted this as a
weakness of the previous process). Currently, the Health and Agriculture ministries are
being evaluated for the extension of this program. Remarkable progress has been made
in establishing a profile of job descriptions and recruitments conditions for high level
technical positions that will allow to process future recruitments on a strong technical
basis. More recently, the institutional framework for the integration, coordination and
monitoring of the administrative reforms (CNRA) was implemented, and all cells within
line ministries have now been put in place.

     The regulatory framework for the decentralization reform has been established with
10 new decrees adopted by the cabinet, and a further decree establishing communal
development funds was discussed jointly with donors. Notwithstanding progress made in
the regulatory framework, the timing of implementation of the decentralization process
has been affected by the postponements of the local elections, the lack of operational
modalities for the mandated transfers and an unclear institutional framework for
implementation. However, the experience of budgetary deconcentration in water supply,
health and education has been promising and could lead the way to further progress in
that field. Also, the recent municipal elections should provide renewed momentum for
the decentralization reform.

     The Government has recognized the negative impact of poor governance and
corruption on economic growth and development in the country. Activities related to the
preparation and implementation of a multi-sector governance and anticorruption strategy
(GAC) have been on target. The World Bank Institute has provided technical assistance
to the government for the preparation and implementation of a Governance Diagnostic
Survey to provide the government with qualitative and quantitative data on the state of
governance and corruption in Benin. A Steering Committee headed by the Inspector
General of Finance and comprised of civil society and government agencies
representatives has been leading the diagnostic survey process. The diagnostic survey
has been carried out at three levels, household, private sector and public officials. A
report on the findings of the Survey has been prepared and was nationally disseminated
through participatory workshops led by the IGF/MRAI with the objective of obtaining
recommendations from key stakeholders that will be used by the government to prepare
the GAC strategy.

2.2 Major Factors Affecting Implementation:

     A number of factors contributed to the broadly successful implementation and
outcome of the PRSC program. These include the alignment of instruments, Government
ownership, effectiveness of donor coordination and a sound analytical basis. A number
of factors also negatively affected implementation, including political change and
exogenous factors. Each of these factors is discussed below.

     Alignment of instruments. There was strong consistency and continuity between the
various instruments related to poverty reduction and economic and social development in
Benin for the 2004-2006 period. First, the PRSCs' components were articulated along
the PRSP's pillars, while the PRSP M&E framework was used for the PRSCs. The
PRSCs were also closely aligned with the CAS. In turn, the CAS aligned itself with the
PRSP and built on the progress made under the Interim CAS (January 2001) in moving
towards programmatic lending. Finally the budget reform program, moving toward
results-based budgeting, was well adapted to programmatic budget support, in the sense
that it incorporates into budget management the very objectives and results framework
which are at the core of the PRSP and the PRSCs.

     Government ownership.       The Government had full ownership of the program
supported by the PRSC 1-3 because these operations (i) were fully aligned with the PRSP
-- for which the preparation was led by the Government -- and were consequently highly
responsive to the borrower's circumstances and development priorities; and (ii) important
reform measures were adopted as prior actions for each operation. The PSRC program
design drew upon the lessons learned in the PERAC: the need to ensure Government
ownership of the reform process, and the need for realism and selectivity in defining the
reform agenda. The PRSP and PRSC processes are coordinated by government through
their permanent Secretariat. Progressively government has taken the lead of annual
reviews of the program. It has also taken charge of the PRSP evaluation report and the
yearly progress report. The fact that the sectoral results/strategies of the PRSC coincide
with those of the program budgets reinforces government ownership.

     Effectiveness of donor coordination. The PERAC which was the precursor to the
PRSC series laid out the foundation for improved donor coordination. Intensive policy
dialogue was carried out with key development partners during the preparation of the
PERAC, including the EU and the AfDB which provided assistance to the PERAC-
supported budget reform program. The PRSP process and the move to a programmatic
approach fostered these efforts. Indeed, the preparation of the first PRSP and PRSC-1 led
to a close collaboration between the Bank and the other development partners which were
also preparing budget support operations (the EU, the Netherlands, Denmark and
Switzerland) and a strong coordination with the AfDB with which the Bank coordinated
its conditionalities. The main objectives of this coordination are to: (a) support the
implementation of Benin's PRSP through the Government budget cycle, while moving
toward a common assessment framework; (b) reduce transaction costs; (c) enhance the
predictability of resource flows; and (d) conduct joint reviews at both the macro and
sectoral levels. Close coordination with donors providing budget support to Benin has



                                          29

helped improve alignment of support to Benin's PRSP/MTEF. This close donor
coordination also reduced transaction costs for the Government by reducing the number
of visiting missions and reporting requirements, thereby freeing Government officials to
focus more on program implementation.

     During the preparation of PRSC-2, the Bank and these donors carried out a first joint
appraisal mission in September 2004 and agreed with the Government to use a unique
policy matrix to monitor the implementation of the main structural and sectoral reforms
program. In addition, joint Government/donor sector reviews were completed in the three
PRSC core sectors (rural water, health, and education) in June 2004. Since then, joint
missions of the main donors providing budget support for PRSP implementation have
taken place each year in September and joint aide-memoires have been prepared while
joint Government-donors reviews have been regularly carried out in the PRSC core
sectors. Also, the development partners meet regularly in 12 sectoral or thematic working
groups, including on budget support, decentralization and monitoring and evaluation.
Finally, some of the background analysis for the budget support operations was jointly
carried by the Bank and the other key development partners. For instance, the 2004
Public Expenditure Review (PER) was prepared by the Bank and Denmark while the
2005 Country Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA) was conducted jointly by
Denmark, the Netherlands, the European Commission and the Bank. The PRSC-
supported programs were also closely coordinated with the IMF's PRGF program with
the PRSC covering structural and social issues while the PRGF covered macroeconomic
issues.

     In October 2006, a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) was discussed between
the Government and the development partners providing budget support to consolidate
this cooperation. This MOU translates the desire of the Government and development
partners to ensure that budget support becomes the key instrument of their cooperation in
the implementation of the PRSP and related sectoral strategies and policies, and to ensure
a good coordination of the various donor interventions.       The MOU was signed in
November 2007.

     Soundness of the analytical basis. The analytical basis for the PRSCs was sound,
drawing on recently completed work on poverty and social analysis, as well as from
country economic and fiduciary work.       The initial analytical work centered on the
methodology of the PERAC, the CAS, and the PRSP. This was followed by sector PERs,
to enrich the knowledge and strategic thinking of key sectors such as water, health and
education. Finally, supporting the extension of PRSC-3 into new topics, the scope of
ESW was extended to those domains (see box 1 below).




                                         30

Box 1: PRSCs 1-3 Analytical Basis

The specific analytical work that informed each operation included:


PRSC-1: The 1999 CPAR, the 2001 CFAA, the 2001 Social and Structural Policy Review, the 2003 Poverty
Assessment, the preparatory diagnosis work for the 2001 PERAC, together with a 2001 country status report on
education, and a 2003 health sector PER.


PRSC-2: The 2003 household survey, the 2004 country health status report, the 2004 public expenditure review in
health, education and rural water, the 2004 poverty and social impact analysis (PSIA) of cotton sector reform, and the
financial sector review.

PRSC-3: The Growth and Competitiveness Study, the Diagnostic Trade Integration Study, the FIAS Land Market
study, the Governance and Anti-Corruption Survey, the Rural Transport Strategy Study, as well as a series of reports
underpinning civil service reform and decentralization.



     Political change. The historic, regime-changing presidential elections that took place
in 2006 affected the implementation of the PRSC series. First, it had negative effects on
the pace of implementation of the reform agenda in that year, since the government
focused its attention on the elections.                  As a result, several reform actions lagged,
especially policy reforms in infrastructure and cotton, and certain public sector reforms.
After the elections, on the other hand, the new government showed a clear commitment
to accelerate the program.

     External factors.           Program performance under PRSC 1-3 was also negatively
affected by external factors. In 2004, economic growth was affected by the imposition by
Nigeria of new restrictions on re-exports from Benin. At the same time, the world price
of cotton fell while the value of the dollar, in which international cotton sales are
denominated, fell against the CFA franc. The real appreciation of Benin's currency,
linked to the Euro, was also a factor affecting the overall competitiveness of the Beninese
economy.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization:

     M&E Design: From the initial preparation of PRSC-1, it was agreed that the
monitoring and evaluation of the PRSCs would be based on the M&E system developed
for the PRSP although this needed strengthening as the M&E capacities were weak. The
PRSP monitoring and evaluation system was to be based on four key components: (i) a
system for gathering and analyzing aggregate indicators, so as to inform decision makers
on the linkages between the macroeconomic framework, the budget allocations and
poverty reduction options; (ii) a household survey system to monitor and analyze changes
in household living conditions, the dynamics of poverty, and its causes, in both rural and
urban areas; (iii) an execution monitoring system so as to build the capacity to link
budget allocations for specific programs (particularly those aimed at the poorest) with
outcome and performance indicators; and (iv) an impact evaluation system to measure the
effectiveness and impact of the programs and policies implemented in the context of the
national poverty reduction strategy.




                                                       31

     However, as noted in the JSA of the first PRSP and various JSAN of its related
APRs, the M&E framework was characterized at its beginning by an unclear institutional
mechanism and weak statistical capacity both at the central and sectoral levels. In
particular, the M&E readiness assessment of ministries showed that only three
ministries/institutions, namely Health, Environment and OCS (the central agency for
monitoring PRSP indicators), met the criteria of readiness and that they had a high
capacity to carry out M&E work. Education and Transport ministries had medium
capacity while the other ministries had a low capacity. It was then agreed that these
ministries with low capacity would require support through adequate training and
staffing. The PRSP proposed an ambitious and comprehensive plan to address these
weaknesses and establish a sound and fully operational PRSP M&E system. The plan
focused on clarifying the institutional framework and preparing a three-year activity
program to build national M&E capacity and improve data availability.

     M&E Implementation:           M&E implementation improved over time as the
Government, in liaison with the donors, took significant actions to strengthen the
institutional framework and national statistical capacity. Clear mechanisms that
progressively led to better coordination and synergy between the stakeholders involved in
the monitoring and evaluation of the PRS were established and the three-year work
program implemented with donor assistance. The PRSC focused on strengthening
performance monitoring capacity in key sector ministries as well as the strengthening of
statistical production by the National Statistical Institute. As a result, monitoring and
evaluation units established in line ministries began to play progressively their role while
the PRSP progress reports and the MDGs reports were regularly completed with their
quality gradually improving over time. However, while the evaluation culture is
increasing along with the PRSP implementation, the disparity in level and depth of
existing capacity remains high. Not all sectoral units are functional yet and much remains
to be done to improve the availability and quality of data needed to monitor the results.
The fact that monitoring and evaluation of outcomes is part of the budget system itself is
however a token of sustainability of the M&E arrangements.

     M&E Utilization: Given the weakness of M&E at the outset, the degree of
utilization has been limited but gradually increasing. The yearly joint reviews have
increasingly permitted to take outcomes into account in the design of the next phase of
the program. The 2005 and 2006 PRSP Annual Progress Report have fed directly into
the PRSC series and PRSP II and now the most advanced ministries can take into account
their performance report (for year n-1) for the preparation of the budget (for year n+1).

2.4 Expected Next Phase/Follow-up Operation (if any):

     PRSCs 1-3 are being followed by a second series of three Poverty Reduction Support
Credits (PRSCs 4-6), designed to support implementation of the Government's Second
Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP II), discussed by the Board in June 2007. The
second series will deepen the focus on improving the policy environment for private
investment, including supporting completion of the reforms in the cotton sector and
infrastructure. The series will also continue to support Government's measures to pursue

efficiency of public expenditures for human capital formation, and to promote better
governance through financial management, civil service and justice reforms. The reform
policies supported by this new series are embedded in and aligned with the PRSP II.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

     The PRSC 1, 2 and 3 objectives, design and implementation were highly relevant to
country circumstances and development priorities and were highly consistent with Bank
strategies and goals. All the three PRSCs were aligned with the 2003 CAS. The CAS
vision was to "progressively channel IDA assistance through consolidated programmatic
lending to support growth and poverty-reduction policies, in the context of well-designed,
multi-year budgets. Such financial support would be provided through Benin's own
budget management system, consistent with the country's efforts to develop medium
term expenditure frameworks and unify the current and capital budgets. This support was
to take the form of annual PRSCs providing quick-disbursing financing to support the
Government's budget. Such an approach, as tested under the PERAC, would facilitate
donor coordination". The CAS also included the strategic orientations of strengthening
analytical and advisory activities, and enhancing capacity mostly through the learning-
by-doing approach experimented under the PERAC. The CAS itself was properly driven
by the PRSP and was developed through extensive consultations with Government,
stakeholders, and civil society. As a result, it was closely aligned with the PRSP program
and focus. As purported in the CAS, the PRSCs focused on the first three pillars of the
PRSP. The principle of strong consistency between the PRSP, the CAS, and the PRSCs,
and coordination with other donors, was maintained throughout the implementation of the
program.

     Under the PRSCs, disbursements took place at project effectiveness based on the
Government's satisfactory implementation of Board prior actions. This design ensured
that essential reforms needed to support the goals of each phase of the PRSC program
would be enacted up-front, giving this programmatic lending mechanism advantages over
structural adjustment multi-tranche credits used previously. By channeling resources
through the budget, instead of through projects, the PRSC also fostered better decision-
making by the Government, and sounder financial management.

     The program document for each PRSC identified a number of risks to each
operation, as well as mitigating factors offsetting those risks, as shown in Box 2 below.
These risks were common to all three operations, but were in fact intrinsically addressed
by the very nature of the actions implemented under the programmatic series.

                                           strengthening national capacity. Significant TA offered in
                                           areas supported by the PRSCs by Bank and other donors

      The PRSC-1 program was voluntarily selective, focusing on continuation of the
reforms under PERAC and increasing availability of basic services to the poor. The
coverage was broadened in PRSC-2 and PRSC-3 to include private sector development,
agriculture, rural transport, judicial reform, improving the administration and civil
service, accelerating the deconcentration and decentralization process, and governance.
The first four of these were considered vital to economic growth and poverty reduction;
the last three areas were essential to service delivery and furthering budget system
reforms, such as those backing the water sector common fund and other CDD-based
projects. This strategy intended to expand the coverage of the PRSC program gradually,



                                                34

taking into account the implementation capacity to focus on key components, and later
using the learning curve to extend action to the other components.

    During PRSCs preparation, there was close coordination with budget support donors.
This cooperation ensured complementarities between the PRSCs and these other donor-
supported operations; sent a clear message to the authorities regarding donor priorities;
and enabled joint monitoring of PRSP implementation.

3.2 Achievement of Program Development Objectives

    The key policy achievements under the PRSC operations are discussed below;
additional details can be found in Table 8 which contains a list of selected reform
measures undertaken.

Outcomes by Operation:

    PRSC-1: Overall, progress in achieving the targeted objectives has been satisfactory
during PRSC-1. Implementation has shown broad areas of strength, such as public
expenditure management and service delivery. Achievements under the three pillars are
presented in the paragraphs below.

Enhance the Macro Framework and Conditions for Economic Growth

    The Government has been successful in maintaining macroeconomic stability, and
demonstrated new flexibility in taking the necessary steps to mitigate the effects of lower
fiscal revenues on public expenditure management, as well as on program objectives.
Spending on priority sectors and investments to enhance the efficiency of service delivery
was maintained while non-priority spending absorbed the impact of the lower fiscal
revenues.    Furthermore, tax and customs administration were strengthened, thus
strengthening the macroeconomic framework and contributing to stability in future years.
However, due to severe negative external shocks (Nigeria trade restrictions and collapse
of world cotton prices), real GDP growth only kept pace with population growth in 2004
while it recovered afterwards.

Improve Service Delivery

    Significant progress was made in implementing sector reforms, as well as in
expanding basic service delivery in all the main PRSC sectors, with gradual
improvements in most outcome and output indicators. The programs identified as best
promoting access to quality services were included in the program budgets of the social
service sectors, and the PRSC supported the design, financing and implementation of
these program budgets.      The PRSC also supported the institution of performance
monitoring reports which promoted a vital focus on results.

    Water. The Government made significant progress, increasing access to potable
water for the rural population. It is estimated that some 1,200 new water points were built
in 2004, substantially beyond the target, increasing rural population access to safe water
from 36 to 39 percent and putting Benin back on track to meet the MDG in water.


                                            35

However, the limited capacity in the Directorate of Rural Water became more apparent
under its increased work program.

    Health.    The Government made progress in terms of health outcomes. Health
programs focused on serving disadvantaged areas and on improving service at
decentralized levels, and the percent of new visits increased.

    Education. The education sector remained a key priority of the Government, as
evidenced by the increased access to education at all levels. The education program
adopted measures to reduce repetition, schooling discontinuity and drop outs, all means
of increasing the efficiency of education spending. The outcomes show that repetition,
discontinuity and drop-outs all declined, though not always as much as was targeted.
Measures to increase gender equality also demonstrated some success.

    Environment and Forestry. Significant progress was recorded with respect to
environment and forestry management. These include the following actions and
measures: the Government launched studies on taxation of fuel wood, timber pricing, and
an export ban on unprocessed teak wood; preparatory studies for privatization of the
timber parastatal, ONAB, were completed; and a sensitization campaign was launched at
the national level to increase awareness of the benefits of participatory management of
forest resources. The PRSC supported program budgets and results monitoring in both
sectors.




                                          36

Improving Governance and Public Sector Management

     Public Expenditure Management Reforms. Implementation of the reforms initiated
under PERAC stayed on track, despite their broad scope. Results-based budgeting was
progressively put in place in line ministries, along with efforts to improve their
monitoring and evaluation capacity.

     Budget execution and accounting.         The Government continued its efforts to
decentralize the computerized expenditure management system (SIGFIP) to line
ministries, with a view to reducing budget execution delays.

     External auditing. The Chamber of Accounts has regularly produced reports on
budget execution, as well as performance audits for selected ministries, although it was
trying to catch-up with delays in producing both.

     Public procurement. A new law was adopted by the National Assembly in 2004,
amending the institutional framework of the Procurement Code, and creating and
defining the attribute of new agencies in charge of implementing the code.

     PRSC-2:      Benin's progress in achieving PRSC-2 objectives was moderately
satisfactory. Implementation continued to be strong in public expenditure management
and improving access to basic services while a new focus and coordination were brought
to policies for accelerating economic growth.        However, progress on cotton sector
reform, improving quality of basic services, and reducing geographical disparity in basic
services deliver was mixed. Also, delays were encountered in developing a
comprehensive civil service reform. Achievements under the three pillars are presented in
the sections below.

Accelerate Sustainable Economic Growth

     Macro Framework:        Macro stability continued to be maintained despite the
unfavorable external environment including the low world cotton price. Real GDP
growth remains at 3 percent in 2005. Total exports were sustained as exports of other
commodities replaced a decline in cotton exports, indicating greater diversity. As the low
economic growth limited fiscal revenues, priority poverty spending was maintained.

     Utilities and Investment Climate. New regulatory texts were drafted for electricity
and telecoms, but the respective regulatory bodies have not yet been set up.          The
government has taken the initiative on land market; some key operations in the port have
been subcontracted to the private sector with positive outcomes in terms of service levels
to end users.

     Agriculture and Forestry. Regarding cotton sector reforms, one key measure was
implemented: the adoption of a presidential decree establishing a new regulatory
framework for the sub-sector which defined the mechanism for the import and
distribution of inputs and established a single seed cotton marketing arrangement.
However, implementation of the framework exposed weaknesses in enforcement. Forest
management enforcement was reinforced with the hiring of new staff.


                                          37

     Rural Transport.       The Government continued to pragmatically improve its
interventions in the rural transport sector. The new full Rural Transport Strategy (RTS),
identifying geographical areas for priority feeder road investments, was adopted by the
Council of Ministers in April 2006. The development of the strategy established a
participatory mechanism for broad consultations in establishing investment priorities and
focused the investments in rural roads on the needs of the rural economy.

Improving Service Delivery

     Water. The Government has continued to make significant progress in increasing
access to potable water to the rural population from 39 percent in 2004 to 41 percent in
2005. Progress was made in implementing other core policy measures and actions,
including notably the development of local public/private partnership for water system
management in secondary towns.

     Health Sector. Benin made progress in improving health indicators even though the
performance of the sector was mixed in terms of quality improvements.            Program
measures were oriented toward setting up mechanisms that would improve the equity
focus of the sector and expand services in priority districts. The mechanism aimed at
promoting the financial access of the poor to good health services was adopted by the
Ministries in charge of Finance and Health and began to be implemented at the health
district level.

     Education sector. The Government sustained its efforts in increasing access to basic
education, promoting girls education, and increasing completion rates. The enrollment
and retention rates improved, gender equity improved, and repetition rates declined. The
Government has continued to implement the action plan for educational reforms as well
as schooling retention. A significant number of teachers (1,018 positions) were recruited,
targeted in-service training provided to 10,500 teachers and the implementation of the
pilot-program for multi-grade teaching was fairly well implemented. Significant progress
was made by the Government in putting together the integrated sectoral strategy and the
ten-year sector plan. However, progress in reducing geographic disparity as well as
improving learning achievements was modest and remains a challenge.

Improving Governance and Public Sector Management

     Public Expenditure Management Reforms. Benin continued to implement public
expenditure reforms, developing the latest MTEF for 2006-2008. The 2006 budget law
adopted by Parliament was in line with MTEF ceilings and PRSP priorities. Program
budgets were produced for 17 sectors, and details from 7 integrated into the annual
budget submitted to Parliament. Sectoral performance reports were produced regularly,
although the quality of monitoring indicators needed to be improved over time. The
MTEF became the center of planning for all ministry staff. This new understanding of
how best to use program budgets helped the Government to develop its budget reform
plan -- gestion budgétaire axé aux résultats (GBAR) -- which put together the
combination of financial management, civil service and decentralization measures needed
to make progress toward PRSP objectives. This plan continues to be implemented and



                                           38

monitored by the Government. Computerization has aided progress in budget execution
reporting and transparency, and in reducing fiduciary risk, although there remained some
weaknesses.     Extensions of SIGFIP to the department-level governments has made
decentralized programs, such as the rural water program, function more efficiently at less
fiduciary risk.

     Justice and Corruption. Regarding the implementation of the MOJ plan, some
delays arose with respect to the yearly requirement of hiring the requisite number of new
judges and clerks, however the trigger was met. As a result, the hollowing out of judicial
cadres was halted and reversed. The dialogue launched on judicial services provided a
basis for private sector targets on improving contract enforcement and rule-based market
regulation. On corruption, after successfully completing the diagnostic survey at the
household level, the schedule for continuation of the survey at the firm-level became
mired in the election-year calendar and could not be completed.

     Civil Service and Decentralization. Background documentations to prepare the new
civil service statute were prepared by three working groups, including Unions
representative.    Remarkable progress was made in establishing a directory of job
descriptions and recruitments conditions for high level technical positions.          The
regulatory framework for the decentralization reform was established with 10 new
decrees adopted by the cabinet. However, the development of a comprehensive civil
service reform was slower than anticipated.

     PRSC-3: Progress under PRSC-3 was moderately satisfactory. Renewed attention
on economic growth helped to cultivate a new dialogue on private sector development
and brought new focus on investment climate issues. The PRSC continued to support
sector reforms through program budgets and performance monitoring. In addition, PRSC-
sponsored initiatives to extend budget control software to decentralized areas helped to
support local management of decentralized services. However, progress in improving the
investment climate has been slow, further delays were encountered in the privatization of
the remaining SOPANPRA industrial assets, and the quality of basic services was mostly
maintained rather that increased. The outcomes of PRSC-3 are discussed here by program
component.

Accelerate sustainable economic growth

     The real economic growth rate revived to 3.8 percent in 2006 and 4.5 percent in 2007
as improved functioning of the cotton market led to 20 percent increases in output in the
2006/2007 and the 2007/2008 campaigns. Even so, economic diversification continued
as other exports increased to more than half the total, nearly doubling from 52 to 97
billion CFA between 2003 and 2007.

     The program in this component centered on implementing the private sector
development strategy and strengthening the interprofession of the cotton sector and the
enforcement of the regulatory framework. Progress has been made on the first theme; in
particular, the government has undertaken actions on land market reform and some key
operations in the port have been subcontracted to the private sector. The government



                                          39

launched the Presidential Investors Council (PIC) in February 2007 and the dialogue
continued in a follow-up meeting in November 2007. Total investment rose to 13.6
percent of GDP in 2006 while access to electricity rose to 24 percent. Customs clearance
times and the time and cost to register a business were all reduced. Some bottlenecks
remained, however, in judiciary reform, tax reform, and the overhauling of the customs
system.

     Progress in cotton reform has been steady, although further delay has been registered
in the privatization of the remaining SONAPRA industrial assets. In March 2006, the
government terminated the original privatization process, a step deemed necessary given
the arrival of a new government the following month. The new government adopted a
new privatization roadmap and started implementing it. The government made efforts to
resume the functioning of the cotton sector as well as to encourage producers and other
interests at stake to work towards its development and renewed competitiveness. Several
communications were issued by the Council of Ministers to rule against the main
dysfunctions in the sector, such as excessive arrears borne by producers, non timely
provision of quality inputs, non payment of seed cotton, and parallel marketing. As a
result, the arrears were cleared and parallel marketing was shut down. Progress has also
been noted in ensuring proper marketing of the 2006-2007 campaign, in line with the
framework agreement, and contracts have been awarded to ensure the timely availability
of inputs for the 2007-2008 campaign. New Presidential decrees also strengthened the
role of the cotton inter-profession, considered the main agent for establishing disciplined
competition in the sector. Cotton production rose from 190 tons in 2005/6 to 240 tons in
2006/7 and 268 tons in 2007/8. The Ministry of Agriculture has also drafted a results-
based M&E framework, established a new M&E unit, developed a strategy for
agricultural advisory services and hired 320 extension agents for advisory services.

     However, the privatization of SONAPRA has been planned, initiated, but then
postponed in the face of political pressure from unions and the government's desire to
retain an important lever in the cotton sector. The SONAPRA retains control of 10 of the
18 ginneries. The government changed the previous plan for splitting the SONAPRA into
three lots and on July 14, 2007, announced a new scheme consisting of a single new
mixed public-private entity, with a private strategic partner holding 45 per cent of the
capital, the government retaining 35 per cent and the remaining 20 per cent distributed
among various stakeholders. On August 27, 2007 the call for bids was announced. On
October 6, 2007, the government announced the selection of the Société Commune de
Participation, the largest private investor.     However, on November 1, 2007, the
government abruptly annulled the privatization on grounds of irregularities in the bidding
process. Since then, Government has adopted a new strategic vision for the cotton sector
which continues to plan for the near-term creation of a successor company to SONAPRA
that would have joint public and private ownership.

     The reforms in the cotton sector have created an elaborate and carefully-considered
alternative to the state marketing board, SONAPRA. The reforms were phased in
gradually, with an effort to maintain the coordination role of the SONAPRA while
allowing private-sector participation. Prices and market shares remain administered, with
the goal of eventually transitioning to a greater role for market forces. The reforms have


                                           40

succeeded in spurring the entry and development of domestic entrepreneurs. However, at
times the government has intervened in support of special interests and the drop in
international cotton prices affected the sector. Consequently, the sector has been under
stress, and partly as a result, output dropped dramatically in 2005/06. A recovery
occurred in 2006/07 and 2007/08, following Government's efforts to restore order in the
sector (including through payment of arrears to farmers and hiring of 2,000 additional
extension agents) while encouraging private sector reorganizations. Nevertheless, the
problems in recent years also suggest that further advances in the reforms are necessary.
The present structure does not optimize the tradeoff between competition and
coordination. By moving towards a more concentrated but market-driven system, the
system could become more self-enforcing, obviating the need for the elaborate
institutional structure created by the reforms. With some consolidation occurring among
private ginners, Benin is already naturally transitioning towards greater concentration.
The delayed privatization of the SONAPRA is the crucial next step.

     Finally, progress was made in the implementation of the rural transport strategy.
Under the strategy, the Government rehabilitated 320 km of rural roads in 2006 (as
compared to the 200 km planned for that year) but postponed the maintenance of 300 km
to 2007 because of the budget shortage. In addition, the new institutional framework for
the management of supply roads and the related regulations were approved by the inter-
ministerial Council in March 2007.

Improve basic services

     Water. The Government has continued to make progress in increasing access to
potable water to the rural population from 41 percent in 2005 to 44 percent in 2006.
Progress has been made in delegating the budget to regional offices of the directorate of
Water.    Over 90 percent of the contracts for technical studies, social mobilization
activities and civil works were procured at departmental level. Procurement delays at
departmental level were satisfactory with an average process time of about 77 days
against at least 300 days at the central level.

     Health Sector.      The development of the sector has been hampered by the
inefficiency of the public health system and the poor quality of services provided in
public health facilities, which the government has tried to improve by implementing a
decentralization policy. As part of the decentralization policy, the MOH has improved
the resource allocation method based on poverty, health determinants and performance
criteria. The MOH has signed decentralized management contracts with three health
districts. This process is part of a result-based management approach that the Ministry
has adopted to make health services and facilities more responsible and accountable for
their performance. Health indicators continued to improve. In particular, new visits for
basic health services and attended deliveries both increased. The inventory of the private
health facilities, which has been underway since 2003, has been completed and the legal
framework governing the provision of health services by the private sector has been
disseminated. In December 2006, the Government granted free access to health care for
children under five. To make health services more affordable to people, the MOH has
streamlined the financing mechanism of health service delivery to the poor.


                                            41

     Education sector. Educational outcome indicators improved in 2006. Enrollment
and completion rates and gender equity continued to rise.         To promote access to
education, in October 2006 the Government announced the full gratuity in primary
education. The teacher training policy was finalized and was being implemented. 1,018
contractual teachers were recruited by October 2006 and 982 positions were filled by
December 2006. These teachers have been redeployed throughout the districts
contributing to reducing disparities. The National Girls Education and Training policy
was adopted and the targeted programs are being implemented. The action plan to
improve students' achievement is being implemented with the sub-cycle approach at
level CE1 and CE2. The participatory management of schools was in place in 26
municipalities but the regulatory framework still needed to be finalized to scale up the
initiative. However, Benin remains below the West Africa average on learning
achievement.

Ensure good governance

     Progress on this component was made on several fronts. The Government largely
succeeded in meeting the objectives of the 2006 program budgets for priority sectors. It
submitted a 2007 budget in line with PRSP objectives. The comprehensiveness of the
budget has been increased to include most donor grants. Progress was also made in
producing and reviewing sectoral budget performance reports. However, the government
has recognized disparities in the mastery of tools for budget planning, budget execution,
and for monitoring and evaluation, with the need to build capacity in certain sectors and
especially at decentralized levels.       The Integrated System of Public Financial
Management (SIGFIP) became fully operational and ensures greater transparency in the
management of public resources. The reliability of financial reports has improved since
2006 with the interface between SIGFIP and ASTER, the accounting software. However,
the credibility of the accounting system is weakened by long delays in the production of
financial reports. With the adoption in 2006 of a decree regulating internal control, the
Financial Inspection Department (IGF) was strengthened and professionalized. Payment
delays and off-procedure spending were both reduced.          However, the Chamber of
Accounts still incurs delays in the preparation of the annual budget audit report. In 2007,
the delay from budget year to final audit was reduced from 5 years to 4 years, and in
2008 government is on track to reduce it to 3 years

     A draft procurement code, complying with the WAEMU's Directives on public
procurement and delegation of public services, was prepared during the supervision of
PRSC3. In December 2006, the President issued a new directive which defines response
times for each actor who intervenes in procurement transactions to reduce the time of the
procurement process. Procurement delays were reduced as a result. In the justice sector,
newly recruited judges completed training and an extensive M&E system was developed
for the sector. There was progress regarding deconcentration: deconcentration of some
key human resources management processes to the education ministry is effective, and its
positive evaluation is the basis for planning further deconcentration to more line
ministries. The directory of job descriptions and recruitments conditions for high level
technical positions was finalized and validated.        Finally, activities related to the
preparation and implementation of a multi-sector governance and anticorruption strategy

(GAC) have been on target. The diagnostic survey report, completed in August 2007,
provides the government with qualitative and quantitative data on the state of governance
and corruption in Benin. A Steering Committee headed by the Inspector General of
Finance and comprised by civil society and government agencies representatives has
been leading the diagnostic survey process. The diagnostic survey will be used by the
government to update the GAC strategy.

3.3 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

                            Rating:

                            PRSC-1   Satisfactory
                            PRSC-2   Moderately Satisfactory
                            PRSC-3   Moderately Satisfactory

     All three of these operations are rated satisfactory. For each of them, the operation's
development objectives were satisfactorily achieved and, as discussed above, the PRSCs'
objectives, design, implementation, and outcomes were highly relevant to country
circumstances and development priorities and were consistent with Bank strategies and
goals.

     PRSC- 1: The design of the operation was relevant to the country circumstances in
that it followed up the PERAC on public expenditure reforms as the core component
while adding appropriate programs in service delivery. Given the country's limited
absorptive capacity, the decision to support the social sectors through budget support
components that focused on designing, implementing and monitoring program budgets
and building public sector capacity was appropriate.

     The outcomes for PRSC-1 were satisfactory. Pillar I: In the course of the first year
of implementation, a number of identified risks were realized in that world cotton prices
fell and Nigeria imposed tightened trade restrictions. These shocks slowed economic
growth and led to an unexpected drop in fiscal revenue.            Nevertheless, the well-
established dialogue on budget and the macroeconomic framework enabled social sector
spending to protected and non-priority spending to be cut in order to maintain
macroeconomic stability while preserving implementation of the PRSP.

     Pillar II: The water program in the PRSC-1 led to a dramatic increase in the number
of new water points constructed and reversed the likelihood of meeting the water MDG
from unlikely to likely.      The health and education ministries both improved their
capacities in program budgeting, performance reporting and contribution to PRSP
monitoring and reporting. The health sector developed plans for targeting underserved
areas and the education ministry launched plans to reduce gender disparity in school
enrollment. Progress in meeting sector indicators was satisfactory as recorded in Table 3
on PRSC Monitoring Indicators.

     Pillar III: Reforms undertaken under the PERAC were extended and consolidated.
A protocol was signed with the Government to codify how results-based budget
management would be implemented concerning performance monitoring, reporting, and


                                           43

auditing. An action plan to strengthen linkages between the actors of internal control was
successfully implemented. A new code was adopted by the Parliament, amending the
institutional framework of the Procurement Code, and creating and defining the attribute
of new agencies in charge of implementing the code.

     PRSC-2: As was originally planned in the design for the series, PRSC-2 took on
three new sectors in transition mode, meaning that they were in the process of developing
the kind of monitoring and evaluation framework needed for a performance-based
program and the PRSC could foster and help such a transition. In particular, budget
support provided the means to support institutional reforms needed for increasing
government capacity in developing and implementing programs in 3 sectors while these
same sectors could be supported by cross-sector reforms in budget systems. Within
agriculture, the cotton sector was critical to economic growth and the incomes of the
poor, and thus the PRSC supported policy actions identified in the context of the IDA
cotton sector reform project. The design also responded to the approach taken in the CAS
to make the PRSC the main instrument for supporting PRSP implementation.

     The outcomes for PRSC-2 were moderately satisfactory.              Pillar I:     The
macroeconomic context continued to be affected by negative external shocks while the
investment climate was clouded by the impending presidential elections. Economic
growth remained slow, but kept pace with population growth, while macroeconomic
stability was maintained.     A new regulatory framework for the cotton sector was
approved, although weaknesses arose in enforcement, and several new studies were
completed to inform the ongoing cotton and agriculture sector reform programs.

     Pillar II: The water, health and basic education programs maintained their focus on
increasing services in disadvantaged areas and supported decentralized management of
programs in the poorest regions. The education sector continued to meet its targets for
improving school enrollment and retention; however education quality remained low due
to strikes by teachers lowering total class hours. All three sectors made progress toward
MDG targets.      However, progress in improving quality and reducing geographical
disparities was mixed.

     Pillar III: The PRSC program contributed to raising fiduciary standards by
instituting new programs in procurement and financial management.            Software to
automate budget and accounting procedures was installed, greatly aiding systems for
internal control. The extension of these software systems to all regional departments (D-
SIGFIP) greatly aided the decentralization of service delivery while maintaining fiduciary
standards at the local level. The medium term expenditure framework was extended to
include several new sectors as the program budget format became the generalized
practice throughout the Government.           Early steps to deconcentrate personnel
management helped to support program budgets in the ministries. However, progress in
developing a comprehensive civil service reform was slower than expected.

     PRSC-3: The design of PRSC-3 also followed the original plan for the series and
added a component on private sector development. This addition helped to address the
circumstances of two years of slow economic growth while also dealing with the lack of



                                           44

an obvious ministerial home for private sector-related initiatives. PRSC-3 targeted the
development of a PSD strategy that could then be implemented through actions in several
different ministries. The cotton sector agenda responded to observed weaknesses in
regulatory enforcement and the need to strengthen the cotton sector inter-profession.
Social sector programs continued to focus on service delivery and capacity building,
while budget system reforms continued to improve the budget as an instrument for
implementing the PRSP while continuing to improve budget efficiency and fiduciary
standards.

    The outcomes for PRSC-3 were moderately satisfactory. It should be note that the
outcomes of PRSC-3 were sustained through the development and implementation of the
subsequent operation (PRSC-4). Pillar I: Economic growth revived for the two years
during preparation and supervision of PRSC-3. Cotton sector regulatory enforcement
was strengthened and input markets functioned in a more orderly fashion. The previous
drop in cotton output due to poor weather and poor input distribution was reversed, and
output has increased by more than 20 percent in each of the last two campaigns.
However, further delays were encountered in the privatization of the remaining
SONAPRA industrial assets. The rural road strategy, defining the investment plan for
extending roads and market access to poor farmers, was adopted and launched, although
with a delay from the original calendar. The agriculture and justice sectors completed
their monitoring and evaluation frameworks. The PSD strategy made use of a series of
new studies and provided a forward agenda that also informed the design of the new
PRSP. An UNDP study confirmed that the land reform program included in the strategy
has helped reduce land disputes and increase investments in farm land quality. Business
groups now advise government on reforms in taxes and customs. However, progress in
improving the investment climate has been slow.

    Pillar II: In water, the Government continued to make progress in increasing access
to potable water to the rural population from 41 percent in 2005 to 44 percent in 2006.
The decentralization of most of the contracts resulted in a shortening of the procurement
delays. In the health sector, the decentralization policy also helped improve the access
and use of health services. Measures were implemented to grant free access to health
care for the poor and young children in general. Educational sector indicators improved
in 2006. The human resource policy was implemented, resulting in the recruitment of
more than 1,000 contractual teachers, redeployed in the districts, contributing to reducing
disparities. These, however, remained an important challenge and quality of services was
mostly maintained rather than increased.

    Pillar III: One notable thing about the implementation of PRSC-3 is that it spanned
a major, regime-changing presidential election. Yet, despite a guaranteed turn-over of all
ministers, work on the reform of the budget system continued throughout the election
campaign and leadership transition. Because of the PRSP and its representation in
program budgets, technical staffs were able to continue implement agreed programs,
increase the comprehensiveness of the budget, implement new regulations on financial
management, and develop a new procurement code. Established principles of fiduciary
standards were used to quickly reverse a temporary surge in off-procedure spending that
emerged in the final months of the outgoing administration, and the recent improvements


                                         45

in financial management ensured that these expenses were duly recorded, audited and
regularized. Furthermore, the civil service administration was able to make use of
analytical work conducted with the Bank and other donors in order to develop a critical
action plan to build capacity and efficiency and to support reforms in the other sectors.

3.4 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty and Inequality

     Over the period, non-monetary poverty declined from 43 percent in 2002 to 41
percent in 20061. However, the phenomenon appears to have worsened in urban areas.
Subjective poverty seems to have remained fairly constant according to the perceptions of
poverty survey.        Analysis of household consumption expenditures indicates that
inequalities were reduced between 2002 and 2006. The Gini index declined from 0.44 in
2002 to 0.40 in 2006. The drop was more pronounced in urban households than in rural
households, although inequalities remain higher in urban areas.

     The incidence of monetary poverty was reported at 39 percent in 2002 according to
the World Bank's Quid survey. The government, however, reported a figure of 28.5
percent in its Annual Progress Reports on PRSP implementation. Government then
reported an increase of poverty from 28.5 percent in 2002 to 37.4 percent in 2006 in its
PRSP II.     The JSAN of that PRSP pointed out the inconsistencies of government
reporting an increase in GDP per capita, a decrease in inequality, and an increase in
poverty, and stated that the Bank and Fund staffs found the non-monetary poverty data,
showing a decline in poverty during the period 2002-2006 to be more reliable.

     The low income growth in 2004-2005 before the recovery in 2006-2007 led to
modest results on poverty, and rural areas continue to show the greatest incidence of
poverty. On the positive side, the policies supported by the PRSCs to improve access by
the poor to basic services are estimated to have had a positive impact on the reduction of
non-monetary poverty.

(b) Status of MDGs

     Progress made to date will probably not make it possible to achieve all the MDG
targets set for 2015, as indicated in table 11 below. However, as indicated in the text
above, many of the policy actions and measures supported by the PRSC series improved
the likelihood of meeting some MDG targets.




1The 2002 figures are from the third general population and housing census (RGPH3); those for 2006
come from the Demographic and Health Survey.

   (c) Institutional Change/Strengthening

        The institutional development impact of the reform measures implemented under
   PRSC 1-3 was substantial.              The transition to direct budget support required new
   approaches to capacity building, including demand-driven technical assistance.
   Consequently, a bulk of the capacity building and technical assistance program was to be
   based on Government needs and financed under the national budget. Despite some
   weaknesses that limited the implementation of the capacity building program, the
   institutional development impact was substantial. A number of important technical
   assistance activities were carried out during the first series of PRSCs, and as a result the
   capacity of Benin's institutions to manage wide ranging reforms has been increased. In
   particular, the National Committee for Development and Poverty Reduction (CNDLP)
   and its Permanent Secretariat have increased their capacity to design the PRS, to
   coordinate government agencies and donors, and to monitor the implementation and
   outcomes.

        A comprehensive capacity building program for M&E activities was prepared and
   implemented with donor support. The creation of the President's Investor Council was


                                                    47

also a significant step for improving the business climate, and the institutional
arrangement for implementing the rural roads strategy is critical for increasing market
access for the rural poor. Reforms of governance and public sector management with the
implementation of major new administrative procedures in MTEF as well as sector
program budgets and tailored training activities for key technical staff in these new
procedures have resulted in the strengthening of institutions that enhance the
government's capacity to improve public sector management.                 Budget systems
management has improved as a result, and the Finance Ministry now meets regularly with
line ministry staff to address budget execution issues. Relevant new institutions have
been created to raise fiduciary standards. It is the case of the National Regulatory
Agency for Procurement (CNRMP) and the National Directorate for Public Procurement
(DNMP), regarding procurement reform. Audit reform resulted in the strengthening of
the Chamber of Accounts for external auditing, and the General Inspection of Finance for
internal auditing. Finally, the creation of a Ministry for Administrative and Institutional
Reform responded to the need to better coordinate civil service reform and
decentralization. Reinforcing judicial institutions and the Ministry of Justice were also
outcomes of the PRSCs. The components on basic services, by supporting efforts of
ministries to move toward performance management, contributed to institutional changes
in those ministries, in particular by decentralizing decisions and operations.

    The preparation of PRSCs 2 and 3 were aided by PHRD grants which were managed
by the recipient. The studies and activities funded under the grant contributed to local
capacity building, including through hiring local consultants, and the management of the
grant also had significant institutional impact. Through its management of the grant,
government gained capacity in the design of contracts, publication of terms of reference,
and implementation of formal procurement procedures.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

                             Rating:

                             PRSC-1     Moderate
                             PRSC-2     Moderate
                             PRSC-3     Moderate

    Several considerations weigh positively on the assessment of risk to the development
outcomes of PRSCs 1-3. First, sustainability is supported by the fact that macroeconomic
policies remain sound. There was a rebound in growth in 2006 and 2007, reflecting a
recovery in cotton output. The fiscal management continues to be sound with noted
efforts by government to increase revenues and reign in treasury payment orders and
extra-budgetary expenditure.        The debt-service ratios are sound and confirm the
sustainability of the macro framework.

    Second, the institutional creation and strengthening that occurred under the PRSCs
will also aid sustainability. Many of the measures implemented under PRSC 1-3 have
created structures that will not easily be dismantled; for example the program
coordination units and the units for regulating procurement. In addition, improvements in



                                           48

processes such as results-based budget management, external auditing and evaluation, are
self-reinforcing and contribute to good outcomes.

     Third, sustainability is supported by the Government's development of PRSP-II.
This indicates the Government's commitment to moving forward with its poverty
reduction agenda and facilitates the alignment of future DP support with national
strategies and the budget. In addition, the strong involvement of civil society and other
groups in the development of PRSP-II, and the growing use of participatory M&E, makes
sustained national commitment to the program more likely. Fourth, implementation of
successor programmatic operations (PRSC 4-6), and continuation of the joint donor
framework in support of PRSP II, will help maintain and deepen the development
outcomes achieved under PRSC 1-3 by providing continued budget support.

     Notwithstanding these favorable elements, some factors remain that could jeopardize
the sustainability of development outcomes.         First, Benin remains vulnerable to
commodity price (cotton, oil and food) and real exchange fluctuations. High oil prices
drain international reserves and increase petrochemical, electricity and transportation
costs with adverse impact on the overall economy. Lower international cotton prices hurt
the country's economic and fiscal performance, and negatively affect cotton producers in
rural areas, where most of the poor live.        High food prices would have important
macroeconomic and distributional impacts and may undermine recent gains in poverty
alleviation. The continued appreciation of the franc CFA against the dollar would put
additional pressure on the country's competitiveness, notably for cotton exports. The
Government is implementing measures to address its vulnerability to external shocks,
including in the energy sector and by promoting economic diversification, but these are
likely to have a medium to long term impact. Second, the recent slowdown in the pace of
reforms, mainly as a result of two rounds of elections, shows that reforms may be delayed
and risk reversals. The example of the cotton sector, where the pace of reforms slowed
down in 2007-2008, and has now recently revamped also indicates how "reform fatigue"
may affect the speed and content of the next reform phases in complex sectors.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry


                           Rating:

                           PRSC-1     Satisfactory
                           PRSC-2     Satisfactory
                           PRSC-3     Satisfactory

     PRSC- 1:      Bank performance was satisfactory during credit preparation and
appraisal. The preparation of the PRSC was based on relevant analytical work and
drawing on lessons from the previous PERAC. The PRSC was a central element of the
CAS, itself well aligned on the government's development agenda and objectives, as set
out in the PRSP. During preparation, the Bank maintained a close cooperation with the


                                          49

IMF and budget support donors. Government ownership was central to the design of the
operation, while reform programs have been backed by ample consultations of
stakeholders in both the PRSP and the CAS preparation processes. The decision to put in
place a task co-leadership of the operation ensured that sectoral concerns would be at the
forefront of the operation, together with macroeconomic and public sector management
objectives.

    PRSC-2:       Bank performance was satisfactory during credit preparation and
appraisal. The team pursued actions started under PRSC-1, maintaining the development
objectives, and enlarging gradually the program at the request of the government, while
maintaining objectives aligned on the PRSP agenda. The credit was prepared in close
coordination with the IMF's PRGF. The Bank intensified its lead in coordinating donors
involved in (programmatic) budget support, in particular the AfDB, the EC and bilaterals.
Joint-Government-donors reviews were carried out in rural water, health and education.
The pre-appraisal mission was carried out in the context of a joint mission of the main
donors providing budget support.

    PRSC-3:       Bank performance was satisfactory during credit preparation and
appraisal. Harmonization with donors was further intensified as joint review missions
were made systematic, as well as the use of a common matrix and a common set of
outcome indicators. The team had to cope with inaction from government on some
fronts, in the wake of impending presidential elections, but managed to maintain the
momentum and the implementation of most planned actions, including triggers. The
Bank also incorporated in the preparation the results from a number of new ESW
products.

(b) Quality of Supervision

                            Rating

                           PRSC-1      Satisfactory
                           PRSC-2      Satisfactory
                           PRSC-3      Satisfactory

    Supervision of PRSC-1, PRSC-2 and PRSC-3 took place in the context of joint
Government/donors missions to monitor the implementation of the PRSP. For PRSC-1,
2 and 3, during those missions all aspects of the program were reviewed in detail, with
donors' cooperation providing sufficient resource to work in-depth on all components. In
particular, performance reports and the implementation of program budgets of past and
ongoing years were reviewed in detail. These reviews were complemented by technical
missions who dealt with issues specific to the PRSCs, including the triggers. Supervision
of each PRSC has merged into preparation of the next, using experience from
implementation as a major input for improvement of the credit framework. Supervision
missions were supplemented by regular government/donors meetings in Cotonou which
reviewed developments closely and were able to alert early on possible problems or
issues with the implementation of the program.

                              Rating

                             PRSC-1      Satisfactory
                             PRSC-2      Satisfactory
                             PRSC-3      Satisfactory

     Bank performance is rated satisfactory for PRSC-1, 2, and 3 in accordance with the
following criteria: Strategic relevance and approach were strong and adapted to changing
circumstances in the country; the analytical foundations were strong; policy and
institutional aspects were relevant to the country context, and focus on poverty and social
development aspects were maintained both at entry and during supervision. Program
supervision focused on development impact and was coordinated extensively with other
donors. Performance reporting was also conducted jointly with other donors.

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance

     Government performance was satisfactory for PRSC-1, and moderately satisfactory
for PRSC-2 and 3. The Government was in the driver seat for the preparation of the
PRSP and for the implementation of the three components of the PRSCs. It put in place
the proper institutions to coordinate and monitor the implementation of the PRSCs
supported program. The objectives were relayed to and shared by the main sector
ministries through their work program and performance budgets and indicators. There
was a temporary stall of ownership during the preparation of the presidential elections.
However, the new government put in place afterwards reaffirmed its commitment to
reform and acted accordingly.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

     The Ministry of Economy and Finance was fully responsible for implementing the
PRSCs programs.        Through the National Committee for Development and Poverty
Reduction (CNDLP), based in the Ministry of Economy and Finance, the Ministry was
able to effectively coordinate the reforms with the other ministries, to organize the
preparation and review missions, and to coordinate joint-donor programs for budget
support.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance


                             Rating:

                             PRSC-1     Satisfactory
                             PRSC-2     Moderately Satisfactory
                             PRSC-3     Moderately Satisfactory

     Borrower performance is rated satisfactory for PRSC 1, and moderately satisfactory
for 2 and 3 in accordance with the following criteria (as identified in the ICRR



                                             51

guidelines): Government ownership and commitment to achieving the development
objectives was strong; stakeholders and civil society were consulted at the beginning of
the PRSP; fiduciary requirements were met satisfactorily; and the relationships and
coordination with the Bank and other donors were excellent throughout. In addition,
M&E capacity improved over the course of the operations. Finally, the PRSP II built on
the lessons learned during the implementation of PRSP I and provides a comprehensive
framework for growth and poverty reduction and transition to the next series of
operations (PRSC 4-6). However, it should be noted that for PRSC-2 and PRSC-3 delays
were encountered in the implementation of cotton sector reforms; also, the pace of reform
of the investment climate has not yet resulted in significant improvements to support
private sector growth.

6. Lessons Learned

    There are a number of lessons to be learned from the PRSC1-3. They relate to the
design of programmatic development policy operations, their management, and poverty
reduction. These include:

   1. Selectivity and simplicity of the design are essential to the success of the
       operation. Obstacles due to administrative resistance to change, as well as due to
       lack of capacity cannot be underestimated. It is better to start with a very
       selective matrix and enlarge progressively, building on success in some
       components. There is also a need to be realistic about the scope and pace of
       reform.

   2. It is important to properly align the PRSC with budget management, so that the
       priority components of the PRSC and the performance budgets of those ministries
       are supportive of each other. It is also important that budget support be phased
       with the budget cycle, in order to properly impact on budget composition, and to
       provide budget support in a timely manner.

   3. The effectiveness of the PRSCs in supporting sector reforms can be highly
       increased by using a sector wide approach, as was successfully experienced in
       rural water supply. The approach federated donors around the government's
       objectives and allowed a mix of central government programs, decentralized
       programs, budget support and projects to combine efficiently.

   4. Attention should be paid to the quality of outcome indicators at the outset, making
       sure that these indicators are relevant to the objectives, and that they can be
       measured at every step of the operation. It is crucial to align closely performance
       indicators for the PRSCs with those for the PRSP, the CAS, and the program
       budgets of key ministries. It is also important that the various donors involved in
       budget support use the same set of indicators.

   5. While the PRSP/PRSC framework simplifies a government's interactions with
       donors, the process can be demanding because partners do not have the same
       instruments, sometimes not the same objectives or outcome measures. It is
       important to make all efforts to harmonize the approach by the donors involved in
       order to diminish the transaction costs to government.

   6. PRSCs 1-3 rightly focused on the critical areas of governance and basic service
       delivery. Future PRSCs need to deepen support in the areas of reforms where
       progress has been slow and focus on critical bottlenecks rather than broadening
       the areas of support to new areas.

Finally, the poverty reduction lessons to be learned from these operations are:

   1. It is difficult to reduce monetary poverty with limited increases in per capita GNP
       and without programs which vigorously addresses the improvement of the income


                                          53

                       of the poor. In addition to the programs to improve access of the poor to basic
                       services, there should be programs to specifically boost revenues, including
                       programs to foster growth more energetically.

                  2. Government ownership of the reform program is essential to the implementation
                       of the country's poverty reduction strategy.                  The Government increasingly
                       assumed leadership and initiative in the dialogue to define the content and focus
                       of the policy matrix. As a result, the process of formulating the development
                       agenda has been fully internalized thereby increasing the likelihood of its
                       implementation.

                  3. The first three PRSCs laid the foundations for successful change in key service
                       delivery sectors. However, the approach was too general and not targeted enough
                       to the poor. In the future, the equity focus of the operation needs to be increased.

       * Data on use of bednets varies substantially between basic surveys (2003-2005) and DHS surveys (2006). Two comparable figures from DHS surveys show under 5 impregnated
       bednet use at 7.4 percent in 2001 and at 20 percent in 2006.

       ** Government does not acknowledge any comparable test scores because of extensive teacher strikes in 2005. Cross-country comparison shows Benin remains below the West

Annex 5. Summary of Borrower's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR

     The borrower largely concurs with the contents and conclusions of the ICR.
Specifically, the Borrower agrees that the PRSC operations were implemented in a
satisfactory manner and that the objectives were clearly achieved. The borrower also
concurs with the emphasis added on economic growth and believes that further focus on
this issue would be beneficial.

     The borrower notes in particular the substantial advantages of producing the Letters
of Development Policy, required under the PRSCs. The LDPs succeeded in recording a
number of significant policy decisions in a form that could be broadly distributed to all
domestic participants and stakeholders in the reform. This distribution aided not only in
disseminating information on the reform agenda, but also in communicating the
importance of the reforms.

     The borrower expressed the need for flexibility in shifting plans for the cession of
public cotton ginning facilities, especially given the change in Government and shifting
political pressures. Even so, the need to re-construct and then delay implementation of
the plan meant that government expectations for the reform were not fully realized,
despite great efforts, because there lacked the reinforcement that would be provided by
selling the ginning assets.

     The borrower also specifically acknowledged the impact of the program in education
and noted that the number of teachers recruited under the program may need to be
increased in order to accommodate rapid increases in enrollment.

     The borrower argued in favor of greater harmonization with other donors on
monitoring indicators and evaluation missions. The borrower also notes that government
learned over time how to improve in the management of the PRSC programs and that
more training and coaching in this respect would have been beneficial under the first
operation.

Annex 6. Comments of Cofinanciers and Other Partners/Stakeholders

     We received comments from a multi-lateral donor, the EC, and a bi-lateral donor, the
Netherlands. Both donors found the PRSC series highly pertinent in terms of the sectors
included and in terms of supporting implementation of the PRSP. The fact that the
PRSCs strengthened and used national budget and procurement procedures was also
especially appreciated. The PRSCs, through process and content, were also seen as
strongly promoting the remarkable progress in donor coordination and information
sharing.

     Both donors also noted gaps in information about the policy matrix in different parts
of the government and recommended a more diversified approach to exchanges with
government, so that information and ownership is more broadly distributed. Donors
would also like to see fewer `ad hoc' missions, presumably sector missions that are not
formally coordinated with the full set of budget support donors. Donors also requested
that the PRSC policy matrix be exchanged with them at every stage throughout the Bank
discussions with government.
