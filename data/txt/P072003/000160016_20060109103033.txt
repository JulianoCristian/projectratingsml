3. Program Description

The overarching objectives of the proposed Poverty Reduction Strategy Credits (PRSCs) series are to support
the implementation of Benin's PRSP and to strengthen the Government's capacity to design and carry out its
own development and poverty reduction programs. Broadly, PRSCs focus on policies and reforms with the
highest poverty impact and where IDA has a comparative advantage. Also, given the comprehensiveness of the
PRSP and the high cost of its implementation, the PRSCs are designed to assist the Government in establishing
priorities and implementing a rolling core reform program.

More specifically, the objectives of the PRSCs during the 2004-06 period are to support the Government of
Benin (GOB) in its efforts to reduce poverty through implementing policies designed to: (i) maintain
macroeconomic stability and accelerate economic growth focusing on the effective implementation and
completion of the privatization program, the setting of a sound regulatory framework in liberalized sectors, the
improving of private sector investment climate, and of the legal and judicial systems; and (ii) improve the
delivery, quality, and coverage of basic services while improving expenditure efficiency.

The objectives of PRSC-1 were to: (i) help create the basis for private-sector-led economic growth by
supporting the Government's macroeconomic program and improving the investment climate; (ii) support the
GOB'Spublic expenditure management reform program; and (iii) support the reform of the public resources
management and help finance the Government's expenditure program in key sectors, focusing on the delivery of
basic services tailored to the needs of the poor

PRSC-1 focused on three core sectors: health, basic education and rural and semi-urban water. In addition to
these three sectors, the PRSC supported continuation of implementation of the Environment and Urban
Development and the Forest management programs so as to ensure that they are properly funded, executed and
monitored.

4. Achievement of Objectives and Outputs

5. Major Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcome

The implementation of PRSC-1 benefited from a period of relatively robust economic growth in the wake of the
CFA zone devaluation and trade liberalization, as well as from relative political stability. Implementation also
benefited from the public expenditure management reforms undertaken under the Public Expenditure Reform
Adjustment Credit PERAC which was the precursor to PRSC-1.

6. Bank and Borrower Performance

Overall, the Bank performance has been satisfactory. The PRSC-1 constitutes a key element in materializing
the vision laid out in the Interim CAS (January 2001) and the full CAS (July 2003) to move towards
consolidated programmatic lending. Its objectives are fully aligned with those of the Government's strategy for
poverty reduction as spelled out in the PRSP adopted end-2002. Its design built on progress and lessons learned
from the implementation of past adjustment operations, in particular from the budget consolidation reforms
initiated under the PERAC. While, on one hand, this led to some challenges for selectivity and sequencing
choices and for the program coverage at entry, on the other hand, the pre-existent dynamics and capacity in
some sectors in preparing and progressively implementing results-based budgets provided a good basis and
momentum for an effective start for the reform programs. Preparation of PRSC-1 was built on substantial
analytical work, including a poverty assessment, a social and structural and policy review, diagnostic studies of
public management, a country financial and accountability assessment, a country procurement assessment, an
education country status report, and a PER in the health sector. A productive retreat was organized with the
core local team in June 2003 to share vision and understanding of the program design and content. Also, the
Bank has closely coordinated the operation preparation with IMF, AFDB and core multilateral and bilateral
agencies (EU, Danemark, Netherlands, and Swiss notably).

The Borrower performance is broadly satisfactory. Benin has prepared and adopted a poverty reduction
strategy paper in 2002. A joint IMF and World Bank staff assessment underscored that the latter provides a
solid basis and framework for addressing country's challenging development agenda. The Government's
governorship of the program has improved over time along with the effectiveness of the institutional framework
for coordinating and monitoring the implementation of PRSPI PRSCs.


7. Findings and Implications for SubsequentOperation(s)in Series

The PRSC-1 program Document describes how the program design built on the pre-existing dynamics and
achievements under the PERAC. Thus the work under a prior operation in developing government experience
in results-budgeting was highly instrumental in the successful implementation of PRSC-I.

Nevertheless, monitoring and evaluation capacity in most ministries was still fragile and limited. Team
dialogue with Government should devote greater attention to the result-framework and indicators, and to the
related capacity building activities.

Understanding of the PRSC process and requirements by main stakeholders was fragile and required
improvements over time. Greater team efforts to expand the understanding and ownership by stakeholders
would have improved the environment for subsequent operations.

Donor coordination mechanisms needed to be enhanced so as to lay the ground for greater harmonization of
procedures. Such harmonization was essential both to simplify messages for Government but also to enhance
the efficiency of reform programs and of donor support.

Starting with three sectors was an ambitious beginning, and for the included themes the policy matrix was quite
long and detailed. It would be advantageous for the team and Government to work to simplify the matrix.
