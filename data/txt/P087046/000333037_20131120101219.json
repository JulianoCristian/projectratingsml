The reallocation of credit\n            proceeds will allow for a better distribution of project\n            funds (reconciling investments with funds allocations) while\n            reinforcing operational capacity of executing agencies to\n            achieve the project development objective.

It will allow for completing planned activities\n            to improve operational and storage capacity (1,800 metric\n            tons) of the National Genetic Center, and inspection\n            capacity of the plant health office in the field (3,580\n            Ha/year).
