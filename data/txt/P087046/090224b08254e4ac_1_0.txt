                         Implementation Status Overview
                         At the end of implementation, the PTA-II project has fully achieved the PDOs. On the basis of a catalog of 193 agricultural technologies, and 88 Sustainable Forest Management
                         Plans, INTA and INAFOR provided broader access to agricultural and forestry services and innovations to approximately 70,000 producers (37 percent are women) around the
                         country (out of a target of 50,400). The strategy of Promotoria Rural supported by the project has been instrumental in expanding the outreach of basic agricultural services. The
                         additional financing (AF) Grant H537 to strengthen the National Seed System has served 1,435 seed producers (out of a target of 1,200), and supported the improvements in three
