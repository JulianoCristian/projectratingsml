                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Overall, the PTA-II project is on its way to achieve the PDO. On the basis of a catalog of 187 new technologies and 27 Sustainable Forest Management Plans, both INTA and
                         INAFOR continue providing agricultural and forestry services and innovations to approx. 35,000 producers around the country, including some of the most isolated indigenous
                         communities in the Caribbean Coast of Nicaragua. The results of the 2012 annual survey prepared by INTA show a high level of satisfaction of beneficiaries, adoption of new
                         technologies, and increase of productivity amongst target groups receiving services from the project. The PTA-II Impact Evaluation is underway and will be ready by mid-March; its

                         Report will be discussed during the next supervision mission, preliminary scheduled for April, 2013. Field activities of the Additional Financing (AF) to strengthen the National Seed
                         System are underway in three target areas and in the National Center for Research on Agro Biotechnology (CNIAB). INATEC, INTA, and MAGFOR are working with 45 producers'
                         organizations in the three target areas of the project and have completed the first group of 13 Cooperative Development Plans (PDC) out of 31 PDC that are planned for the project.
                         The first group of Cooperatives are now completing legal and financial documentation to apply to the credit line (Banco Produzcamos) during the next two sowing seasons (Apante

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The original PTA-II operation financed by the Credit 4127 has executed 96.3 percent of the funds. Most of the outstanding expenses are planned to be completed by mid 2013 but
                         would require a reallocation of credit proceeds which is currently being prepared by MAGFOR. Key tasks ahead include completing the training plan, continue promoting the
                         production of registered seed of basic grains in association with research centers and producers, improving office space at INAFOR Headquarters, completing the PTA-II Impact
                         Evaluation and preparing the Final Report of the project. A systematization of the main contributions of PTA-II would be prepared as part of the closing phase of the Credit.

                         As for the AF, ongoing training and business development activities with producers in Nueva Guinea, Boaco, Jinotega, and Tasba Pri, as well as completion of a large amount of
                         procurement processes (equipment, works and a seed processing plant in the CNIAB, building and equipment of three new laboratories for DGPSA) indicate important improvements
                         in project disbursements over the next months. However, allocating resources under the credit line component remains the main challenge as the project has only four sowing
                         seasons until its current closing date. Over the next six months, the main activities of the AF will be to finance and implement 13 PDCs, make the line of credit fully operational after
                         two sowing seasons, and have prepared the next set of 18 PDCs to achieve higher levels of allocation of credit resources.
