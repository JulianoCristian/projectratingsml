                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The PTA-II Credit 4127 has executed 98 percent of the funds. Following a reallocation of its proceeds, the Credit is planned to be fully disbursed by the end of 2013. As for the AF,
                         implementation progress has improved disbursements and commitments. Considering current prospects of the AF, its closing date was extended until June 30, 2014. An Action Plan
                         to address key implementation challenges was agreed with MAGFOR as a result of the October 2013 supervision mission, and is currently under implementation. The next mission is
                         planned for January 2014.
