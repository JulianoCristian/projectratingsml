A. Summary of Proposed Changes
The ATP-II (P087046) is financed out of the IDA Credit No. 4127-NI and the IDA Grant H-537-NI. The
proposed changes are: (i) the reallocation of proceeds of the Credit No. 4127-NI, and (ii) the reallocation
of proceeds and the first extension of the closing date of the IDA Grant H-537-NI until June 30, 2014 (6
months cumulatively). The Government of Nicaragua is progressing towards full execution of the Credit
No. 4127-NI by December 31, 2013. The proposed reallocation of credit proceeds will allow for a better
distribution of project funds (reconciling investments with funds allocations) while reinforcing operational
capacity of executing agencies to achieve the project development objective.

The Additional Financing (AF) to the project P087046 through the IDA Grant H537-NI is aimed at scaling
up project activities to strengthen the National Seed System. In 2013, after overcoming initial delays, the
AF became fully operational. It is now providing technical and business development services to 1,114
seed producers (out of a target of 1,200 producers specialized in certified seed production), as well as by
financing 14 business plans to 13 seed producer organizations (out of a target of 31 organizations).
Currently, the AF is helping produce 1,980 metric tons of certified seeds and projects to reach 3,048 metric
tons at the end of 2013 (63 percent of a total target of 4,852 metric tons).

The proposed six-month extension (until June 30, 2014) and reallocation of grant proceeds is necessary to
achieve the project development objectives. It will allow for completing planned activities to improve
operational and storage capacity (1,800 metric tons) of the National Genetic Center, and inspection
capacity of the Plant Health Office in the field (3,580 Ha/year). Also, it will help establish the Revolving
Fund (US$3.0 million) by financing the last 25 business plans (12 of them are already prepared) to another
18 organizations to produce the remaining 1,804 metric tons of certified seeds to reach the original target.

B. Project Status
Overall, the implementation progress of the project has been Moderately Satisfactory (MS). To date, the
Credit has disbursed 98 percent of funds. On the other hand, the Grant (AF) had a slow startup. Critical
implementation issues faced by the AF included (i) a nine-month delay after signing, due to an additional
assessment of the implementing agency for the credit line component, as requested by the Bank; and (ii)
the administrative, legal and financial status of seed cooperatives, as well as seed market conditions turned
out to be more complex than expected and the project needed more time to help a group of selected
cooperatives become ready for credit services. An action plan was agreed in November 2012 which has
been closely supported and monitored. To date, the AF has disbursements and commitments for US$4.8
million (50 percent of the total funds of US $9.7 million). Also, with a six-month extension, the AF is
ready to commit additional US$ 2.5 million (25 percent) in November 2013 and would commit approx.
US$ 2.1 million by late-January.

There are no outstanding audit reports for the project. The 2012 Audit Report, submitted by the Borrower
on July 4, 2013, has complied with the requirements established in the Terms of Reference. The Auditor’s
opinion is unqualified. The team is preparing an action plan that will be agreed with the Borrower to
address the internal control issues identified by the Audit. Neither this project, nor any other project in the
country portfolio is currently subject to a suspension of disbursements. Project objectives continue to be
considered achievable if a six-month extension of the grant’s closing date is approved.

Explanation
As described above, implementation of the AF has improved. The Grant H-537-NI is ready to commit in
November 2013 additional US$ 2.5 million (25 percent of grant funds) in works, goods, and sub-credits
that would require an extension to be executed. Meanwhile, there is a remaining amount of sub-credits,
works and goods for approx. US$ 2.1 million that the AF is scheduled to commit by end January, 2014,
and disburse over the period of the proposed six-month extension, according to the specific action plan.
This extension would help the AF complete planned activities to achieve the originally expected results.

Reallocations
Explanation
Credit No. 4127. The Government of Nicaragua has honored the agreement of progressively reaching 100
percent financing of incremental staff salaries that were originally covered with credit proceeds. This has
freed most of the Credit proceeds that are now being proposed for reallocation to reinforce operational
capacity of executing agencies to provide agricultural services to 35,000 producers during the last year and
achieve the project development objective. The proposed reallocation will finance rehabilitation works, as
well as purchase, repairs and maintenance of vehicles and informatics equipment required by the three
implementing agencies to deliver agricultural innovations to project beneficiaries during the last sowing
cycle supported by the project. The reallocation would allow for the implementing agencies to be
adequately equipped to continue providing this type of services.

Grant H537-NI. Based on updated figures of the project's Credit Line, the Additional Financing will not
use a small fraction of the category of expenditures originally allocated to Sub-credits. The proposed
reallocation of the Grant proceeds will use these unused funds for sub-credits and the originally
“unallocated expenses” to complete planned activities to improve the provision of agricultural research and
certification services to seed producers, and carry out audit and final evaluation studies.
