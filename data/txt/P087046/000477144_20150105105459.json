Both the Banks\u0092 and\n            the Borrowers\u0092 performances were satisfactory. There were\n            four restructurings that took place and include the\n            following changes: (R1) (i) Reallocation of proceeds, and\n            (ii) extension of the closing date of the Credit agreement.\n            (R2) Change in the implementing agency for Component 1.C\n            (b): The provision of sub credits to finance the carrying\n            out of Cooperative Development Plans of the additional\n            financing, from the Rural Credit Fund (FCR) to the newly\n            created Banco Produzcamos (BP). (R3) Include two additional\n            activities under the TF: (i) carry out two post census\n            studies; and (ii) produce and publish dissemination\n            materials on the Census. The changes were financed with the\n            cost savings. (R4) (i) Reallocation of proceeds of the\n            Credit No. 4127-NI, and (ii) Reallocation of proceeds and\n            first extension of the closing date of the IDA Grant.\n            Several lesson were learned from this project and are as\n            follows: (1) A sector wide platform to coordinate donors and\n            public sector institutions can promote efficient sector\n            investment and long-term strategic planning, but brings\n            coordination challenges. (2) On-farm diversification\n            contributes to boosting incomes. (3) When designing a\n            program for certified seeds to increase production, target\n            markets, storage facilities and marketing skills for\n            increased production need to be considered. (4) Well-aligned\n            incentives for rural extension agents are needed to ensure\n            proper delivery of technical assistance. (5) Seed\n            cooperatives selected for credit should have proven ability\n            in both capacity and infrastructure to ensure the most\n            effective use of credit lines."}, "docdt": "2014-12-30T00:00:00Z"}
