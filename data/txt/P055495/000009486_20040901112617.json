Among the lesson learned are the following:\n            (1) Community-based child welfare services really work: The\n            sub-projects supported under the CWR project made a very\n            substantial impact on the thinking of what is feasible,\n            which once having been proven to work, have formed the basis\n            for subsequent scaling-up by both the EU and\n            Government's own resources.  (2) Child welfare services\n            require addressing the entire needs of the family and form\n            the basis in Romania for the development of modern social\n            services:  Prevention services and reintegration services\n            need to deal with the entire issues of the family, and not\n            just the specific issues of the particular child concerned\n            if they are to be effective.  (3) A Learning and Innovation\n            Loan (LIL) can be a very effective instrument.  (4) The Bank\n            can provide real value-added in an area such as CWR: The\n            Romania CWR project was the first Bank intervention in the\n            field of CWR in ECA.  (5 )The Bank can leverage/broker\n            impact with a variety of donor parties.  (6) Lending buys a\n            seat at the table for policy dialogue: The Bank was able to\n            be continuously involved in issues of CWR in the High-level\n            Policy Group, the CWR Executive Committee and make\n            worthwhile contributions to the CWR over the life of the\n            project.  (7) High profile political focus can magnify\n            action.  (8) Competitive grant-making approach provides\n            incentives for the local level to implement national policy.\n            (9) It is easier to complete civil works than to change mind-sets."}, "docdt": "2004-08-20T00:00:00Z"}
