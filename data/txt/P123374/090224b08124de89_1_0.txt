a   The Public Resource Management and Government Reform (PRMG) Development Policy Grant (Grant H709-ST) was approved by the World Bank's Board of Directors on May 19,
:   2011 after the completion of seven prior actions. The program was signed on June 20, 2011 and became effective on August 24, 2011, after the conditions for effectiveness were
o   met, including the issuance of a satisfactory Legal Opinion. A single-tranche disbursement of US$4.2 million took place in October 2011.
0    The program has achieved satisfactory results so far, although some activities related to the operation were delayed due to the occurrence of presidential elections in August 2011.
0    The Government of Sao Tome and Principe is committed to achieving all results indicators before the program's closing date of February 28, 2012. As of December 2011, five out of
ten indicators had been fully met. Although significant progress has been achieved in the remaining five indicators, a satisfactory completion of the program will depend critically on
-- the Government's expedite completion of all results indicators by the program's closing date. In particular, the authorities should accelerate the preparation of the new Poverty
Reduction Strategy, and the preparation of a fiscal responsibility framework.

Implementation capacity is adequate. The monitoring and evaluation system is based on relevant and easy to monitor indicators and program goals. Although the team has
encouraged institutionalizing an monitoring and evaluation culture in the country, its impact on such a dramatic change in oversight has been limited for this operation but continues to
be addressed in the context of a new operation currently under preparation. There have been some delays in the collection of indicator data and the team has advised the
Government that additional care is needed in this regard.
