Risks and Risk      Four main risks could influence the expected outcomes of the operation: (i) external
Mitigation          factors, such as the continuing slow recovery of the global economy, increasing
                    international oil and food prices, and shortfalls in donor support, could have a
                    deterring impact on economic growth, reduce government resources, and affect the
                    Government’s ability to conduct its reform program—This risk is being mitigated
                    by the Government’s commitment to achieve IMF-ECF targets, which may entail
                    further fiscal policy adjustment through additional expenditure restrain, the
                    acceleration of reforms aimed at improving public revenue management, and
                    strengthened cooperation with donors; (ii) weak human, institutional, and
                    managerial capacity could slow down the pace of implementation—This risk is
                    being mitigated in the design of the project by addressing the findings from an
                    institutional capacity assessment that was carried out, which in particular suggests
                    limiting the number of sectors to be supported by the operation, and through
                    technical assistance financed by the authorities; (iii) political instability could lead to
                    policy reversals or slippages in structural reforms that could affect the Government’s
                    ability to maintain a stable macroeconomic environment and focus expenditure on
                    poverty reducing priorities— Early implementation of key policies, bolstered by the
                    strong mandate received by the new Government in the recent legislative elections
                    held in August 2010, and the overall consensus among all political parties on the
                    relevance of the PFM reforms and macroeconomic stability mitigate this risk; and
                    (iv) fiduciary risks related to the use of public funds remain as internal and external
                    control mechanisms remain weak—This risk is being mitigated through the public
                    finance management reforms underway that increase transparency and
                    accountability of public resources. Overall, the project’s risks are also being
                    mitigated by the degree of the government ownership of the proposed measures, and
                    its commitment to advance its reform agenda, in particular public finance
                    management, as well as by an active and supportive policy dialogue with Bank and
                    IMF staff. In addition, various donors are providing technical assistance to improve
                    capacity-building and ensure full implementation of reforms in the public financial
                    management area.

      THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF SÃO TOMÉ AND PRÍNCIPE
 PUBLIC RESOURCE MANAGEMENT AND GOVERNANCE REFORM (PRMG)
                 DEVELOPMENT POLICY GRANT

                        I.    INTRODUCTION AND OVERVIEW

1.       This program document proposes a Public Resource Management and Governance
Reform (PRMG) Grant in the amount of US$4.2 million (about 2 percent of GDP) to the
Democratic Republic of São Tomé and Príncipe (STP). The proposed grant is a follow up
development policy operation (DPO) to the Public and Natural Resource Management and
Development (PNRMD) DPO, approved in 2008. The proposed PRMG operation supports the
objectives set out in the Government’s Program that are in line with STP’s poverty reduction strategy.
It builds on the achievements and lessons of the PNRMD and other related projects, notably the
Capacity Building Technical Assistance (CBTA) project approved in 2004. The PRMG operation is
designed as a stand-alone operation, consistent with the approach in the Bank’s Interim Strategy Note
for 2011-12. The PRMG grant supports the continued progress and consolidation of reforms
supported by the preceding PNRMD DPO, as well as an IMF program, and helps to consolidate
macroeconomic stability. These sustained reforms could pave the way for programmatic DPO support
in the future, should this become part of the Bank’s program in the next Country Assistance Strategy.

2.       The proposed PRMG operation supports the Government’s effort to mitigate the
economic and poverty impact of the global economic slowdown. The sharp rise in international
fuel and food prices in 2008, together with the on-going international economic and financial
slowdown, have impacted adversely on STP’s economy and fiscal outlook. Growth slowed down
from an average of 6 percent over 2001-2008 to 4 percent in 2009, following a sharp decline in FDI,
tourism receipts, foreign assistance, and oil signature bonuses that did not materialize. This growth
slowdown is challenging efforts to reduce the incidence of poverty which remains widespread and has
added fiscal stress. The PRMG grant will provide additional fiscal resources to support and
complement, in coordination with other donors, the Government’s effort to maintain its public
expenditure programs in priority sectors, including education, health, and agriculture, which aim to
deliver basic services to the population.

3.       The PRMG operation supports critical public finance management reforms to raise
public sector effectiveness on fiscal consolidation. Uncertainties surrounding the outlook for
potential oil production underscore the importance of addressing fiscal policy management. In this
context, the Government aims to accelerate fiscal consolidation to maintain macroeconomic stability
and support growth. Improved public finance management remains a critical requirement to raise
public sector effectiveness when fiscal consolidation limits available resources. Government
objectives supported include: (i) raising the transparency and accountability of budget preparation,
improving the execution and control of public financial management, strengthening the alignment of
public expenditures with poverty reduction activities, and improving the performance of public
enterprises; and (ii) promoting sustainable economic policies by strengthening the fiscal policy
framework and improving coordination with donors. The PRMG objectives broadly coincide with key
recommendations of the Public Expenditure Management and Financial Accountability Review
(PEMFAR), the Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA) Review, the Debt
Management Performance Assessment (DeMPA), and the recently-completed Country Economic
Memorandum (CEM).

4.      This operation will further strengthen institutional capacity to implement the PRSP and
strengthen coordination with donors. The new PRSP under preparation focuses on pro-poor growth



                                                  1
and improved results monitoring. To better coordinate its implementation, the authorities, with support
of this operation, aim at developing in close collaboration with other donors a coordination framework
to foster information exchange around budget implementation and supervision of the PRSP
implementation.

                                  II.   COUNTRY CONTEXT

5.      São Tomé and Príncipe (STP) is a small and fragile state. An archipelago of just over
1,000 square kilometers, STP is one of the smallest economies in Africa with about 160,000
inhabitants and a gross national income (GNI) per capita of US$1,140 (2009). The country faces many
development challenges due to its small size and insularity, limited institutional capacity, and aid
dependency. As in other small island states, STP cannot take advantage of economies of scale in the
provision of infrastructure, services, and economic activities. This translates into: (i) high costs per
unit of government and utility provision services; (ii) little flexibility of the economy to adapt to
shocks; and (iii) few opportunities for risk diversification within the domestic market.

6.       To face large poverty, the authorities have been implementing a PRSP since 2003. A
PRSP Unit was made operational in 2005 to supervise PRSP implementation. A Committee was
appointed in 2008 to develop a new Development Strategy, which is expected to be finalized in 2011,
after the poverty profile is updated. The new strategy will be based on a results-oriented pro-poor
growth strategy, and given the uncertainty about petroleum production prospects the authorities have
emphasized the importance of promoting private sector led growth to reduce poverty.

7.       STP has experienced a decade with the highest GDP growth since independence.
Growth has averaged 6 percent between 2001 and 2009, compared to an average of 1.4 percent over
the 1990-2000 period, fostered by rising world cocoa prices, bonus payments for petroleum
exploration, and buoyant activity in the tourism and construction sectors led by FDI in anticipation of
potential oil production. GDP per capita improved on average 4.2 percent annually during the decade.

8.        Economic growth has been fueled by the surge of the services sector. Services account for
about 60 percent of GDP. The public sector is the main services provider (28 percent of GDP)
followed by the trade and transport sectors (27 percent). The primary sector accounts for about 20
percent of GDP, and its share in GDP has declined in the last two decades, mainly due to the reduction
in the agricultural subsector (notably cocoa production). Despite this decline, the agriculture sector
still has a critical social role as it employs one-quarter of the population and provides about 55 percent
of staple food. The fisheries sector employs around 5 percent of the population (mostly informal) and
accounts for about 3 percent of GDP and is one of the main sources of food and income. To respond
to these challenges, the new PRSP will place a higher profile on raising agricultural productivity to
support growth and poverty reduction.

9.       Economic diversification remains a challenge. STP’s narrow export base is composed of
two products: cocoa and tourism. Cocoa exports have decreased by 71 percent in the past twenty years
associated to lower production. Tourism has replaced cocoa as the primary source of foreign
exchange, with US$9.1 million in 2009 representing 4.8 percent of GDP and over 40 percent of total
exports earnings. STP is very open and imports most of the goods and services consumed reflecting
the country’s dependence on outside sources to satisfy its internal demand. A current account deficit
has been financed with grants and debt relief (around 31 percent of GDP over 2001-2009), and rising
FDI (including signature oil bonuses) in tourism, construction and oil exploration (around 25 percent
of GDP combined over 2001-2009). The economic slowdown reduced the current account deficit
from 51.2 percent of GDP in 2008 to 44.8 percent of GDP in 2009. Oil signature bonuses and

SDRs allocation under IMF programs have increased international reserves to US$48.1 million at
end-2009 (equivalent to 6.6 months of imports), compared to US$24.7 million in 2006.

10.     Poverty continues to be pervasive. There is very limited data on poverty. The last household
survey (2001) estimated poverty incidence at 54 percent (including 15 percent in extreme poverty).
Poverty in 2001 remained largely a rural phenomenon, with 65 percent of the rural population living
below the poverty line and 22 percent below the extreme poverty line. The Government is finalizing a
new household survey and will update the poverty profile in 2011.

11.       Authorities have made continued efforts to implement the PRSP and achieve the
Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). The 2009 UNDP Human Development Report ranks São
Tomé and Príncipe 131st out of 182 countries, comparable to oil producing middle income countries in
the region such as Namibia (128) and South Africa (129). Sector analysis and administrative data
indicate that there has been an improvement since 2001, notably in health and education indicators
that remain above the Sub-Saharan region average (see Table 1). Although many social indicators
have improved recently, they remain weak and progress toward achieving the MDGs is slow and
difficult to measure (see Annex 6).

12.       Substantial progress has been maintained in education and health. STP received
Education for All-Fast Track Initiative endorsement in 2007. Structural reforms have increased the
official primary net enrollment ratio, which is within reach of the universal primary completion rate by
2015. However, quality of education is a concern that reflects a low level of teachers’ qualification
and the limited learning time associated with a triple shift regime. The delivery of health services has
also improved substantially, particularly maternal health and child health care. Maternal mortality has
dropped significantly. This is largely the result of an increase in the proportion of births attended by
skilled professionals. STP has been a success story on the malaria front, reducing the incidence of the
disease in children under five years old, primarily as a result of the use of bed nets, and the treatment
of malaria cases. Mortality from malaria has dropped to close to zero in 2009. HIV prevalence among
pregnant women dropped from 5.4 percent in 2006 to an estimated 1.5 percent in 2009. These gains
notwithstanding, public delivery of social services remains constrained by the inability of Government
and stakeholders to assess the degree to which strategies are implemented and their impact. The 2008
IMF-Bank Joint Staff Assessment Note (JSAN) signaled poor data collection, compilation,
interpretation and dissemination and an inadequate evaluation and monitoring system for the MDGs.
In addition, the PEMFAR and the CEM highlight that social expenditures have a limited impact due
to sector strategies that are not fully consistent with the annual budget allocations and the PRSP.

13.     There is a broad political consensus for reform. The country has consolidated democratic
rule since 1991, where the political system is characterized by coalition arrangements. Despite


                                                            3
frequent government turnover, there has been a broad consensus among political parties that sector
reforms and macroeconomic stability are critical elements to foster growth and reduce poverty. On the
other hand, frequent changes in government have contributed to a slower the pace of implementing
reforms. Despite external shocks, substantial reforms have been sustained and in some instances
(notably procurement legislation in the petroleum sector) reforms have been accelerated. The new
Government that took office in August 2010 remains committed to reforms, notably in public sector
governance. The new Government has reorganized responsibilities between ministries, and appointed
a few independent ministers. In 2006, President Fradique de Menezes, leader of the Movimento
Democrático das Forças da Mudança (MDFM), was reelected for his second and last tenure.
Presidential elections are foreseen in 2011.

14.      Commitment to structural reforms and macroeconomic stability allowed STP to
receive debt relief and achieve high growth. Structural reforms aimed at: (i) pursuing prudent
fiscal and monetary policies; (ii) improving the efficiency of public spending; (iii) liberalizing the
economy by reforming the import tariff structure, preparing for liberalization of the telecoms
sector, and privatizing a number of public enterprises; (iv) developing new strategies in health
and education; and (v) building institutional capacities, especially in the nascent petroleum sector.
These reforms had positive results. In 2007, STP reached the Completion Point of the Enhanced
HIPC Initiative and received debt relief in the amount of US$314 million. Successful
implementation of these reforms and a buoyant external environment, characterized by a booming
activity in the tourism and construction sectors and the arrival of signature oil bonuses, led to a
high economic growth that averaged 6.2 percent during 2006-08.

15.      Difficulties to control inflation led the authorities to strengthen fiscal discipline.
Economic policy loosened as a result of high budget inflows (mainly from the arrival of oil bonuses),
growing social demands, and a very volatile political environment. In a context of a benign external
environment, current expenditures increased substantially to accommodate social demands from 14.7
percent of GDP in 2000 to an average of 27.3 percent in 2006-07. The wage bill reached an average of
almost 9 percent of GDP in 2006-07 compared to around 5 percent in 2002. In addition, food and fuel
prices were on an increasing trend. As a result, annual inflation was larger than 25 percent during this
period. Concerns about fiscal sustainability, particularly given uncertainty in the arrival of future oil
bonuses, led the Government to strengthen fiscal and monetary discipline. As a result of prudent
macroeconomic policies, supported by an IMF Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF)
program, the Government reduced the annual domestic primary fiscal deficit from around 15 percent
of GDP in 2004 to 7.5 percent of GDP in 2008, financed mainly by oil signature bonuses and
privatization receipts.

16.      As it embarked on fiscal consolidation, STP’s economy was hard hit by two consecutive
external shocks: (i) the sharp increase in international food and fuel prices in mid-2008; and (ii)
the international economic and financial slowdown since 2009. The food and fuel crisis had a
substantial effect on the population. The World Food Program (WFP) estimated an increase in the
number of vulnerable people that needed its support (those for whom food is inadequate or at the
limit) by 10-15 percent only one year after the onset of the crisis.1 In response to these shocks, the
Government launched an investment program in 2009 financed with the proceeds of the privatization

    Before the crisis, the share of vulnerable people was estimated by the WFP at 23 percent (35,615 people) of the population.



                                                                  4
of ENCO,2 the fuel import company, with the purpose of increasing food security, and boosting
agricultural and infrastructure development. This program provided farmers immediate access to
improved seeds and supplies and increased food production. Furthermore, the global economic
slowdown since 2009 also had serious repercussions for STP. Growth slowed down to 4 percent in
2009 following a sharp decline in foreign direct investment, tourism receipts, and foreign assistance,
although limited external portfolio and exposure to toxic financial assets kept the country’s financial
system remained relatively unaffected. 3

17.       These external shocks limited the capacity of the authorities to maintain the pace of
fiscal consolidation in 2009. The growth slowdown, and oil signature bonuses that did not materialize
translated into lower Government revenues that the new corporate and personal income tax laws
introduced in 2009 (aimed at simplifying tax rates to enhance compliance), were not been able to
offset.4 The domestic primary deficit widened to 8.2 percent of GDP in 2009.

18.      In 2010, the authorities accelerated fiscal consolidation. Supported by an IMF-ECF
program, the authorities accelerated fiscal adjustment since March 2010 based on the reduction of
non-essential current expenditures, containment of the wage bill, and the enhanced enforcement of tax
collection. Fiscal performance improved during 2010, but the Government’s initial objective of
reducing the annual domestic primary fiscal deficit to 4.5 percent of GDP was not achieved. This is
mainly due to lower than expected revenue collection at the beginning of 2010, which was explained
by delays in finalizing the declaration forms for implementing a new income tax law. 5 In response to
these delays, the Government strengthened the enforcement of tax laws, increasing the collection of
tax arrears. At the same time, the authorities further contained discretionary spending. As a result,
domestic primary expenditures performed well during the year, and the annual domestic primary
fiscal deficit declined to an estimated 5.7 percent of GDP in 2010.

19.       To bring additional inflation stability, the Government introduced a new peg exchange
rate system in January 2010. The small-economy problems of managing a floating exchange rate led
to an agreement with Portugal (backed by a credit line), STP’s main trade partner, on pegging the
Dobra to the Euro (anchored at around 24,500 Dobra per Euro) with the aim of achieving price
stability and maintaining a stable nominal exchange rate favorable for business development. A fall in
food and fuel prices (that make up 67 percent of the consumer price index) as well as the tightening of
monetary policy in preparation for the peg, steadily reduced year-on-year inflation from a peak of 37
percent in June 2008 to an estimated 9.5 percent at end-2010.6 To manage the peg, the Central Bank
(BCSTP) introduced a set of guidelines and regulations for foreign exchange operations, and now
requires commercial banks to hold reserve requirements only in Dobras, including those related to
foreign currency deposits. It is worth noting, however, that the new exchange rate regime has brought

 Under pressure to find additional resources to respond to its economic challenges and as part of its medium term strategy in the
energy sector, the Government sold in 2008 a 35 percent controlling stake in ENCO to Sonangol, the Angolan oil company, for
US$21 million.
3
  STP’s financial sector has weathered the global financial crisis due to limited exposure to the world capital markets.
The number of banks operating in the country has increased from one to seven in the past decade, and the liquidity
position of most commercial banks appears solid. During this period, the Central Bank has strengthened oversight and
its internal controls and audit functions, and is working with the IMF and the Bank of Portugal to further strengthen the
regulatory framework and its institutional capacity.
4
  STP’s domestic revenue ratio remains low, at 15 percent of GDP in 2010; it compares to an average level of 17.4 percent for
fragile countries, and 22.7 percent for Sub-Saharan Africa in 2009.
5
  As further discussed below, the tax laws introduced in 2009 needed to be accompanied by an expansion of the tax
base. In this regard, the Government is taking measures to expand the register of taxpayers with support from the IMF.
6
  Supply disruptions due to a drought and election-related spending contributed to an uptick in inflation during 2010,
but the Government reduced budget expenditures and tightened fiscal and monetary policies.

new challenges since it requires improved coordination and consolidated fiscal policy, flexible labor
and capital markets, and enhanced liquidity management.

20.       The international reserve position has strengthened. Thanks in part to the special
allocation of SDRs and augmentation of access under the IMF-ECF, international reserves have
doubled with respect to their level at end-2006, and are now over US$47 million, sufficient to finance
more than six months of potential imports. The strong international reserve position has provided the
authorities the necessary monetary space to maintain a stable fixed exchange rate throughout 2010.
This was evident when the Central Bank used its strong reserve position to reduce exchange-rate
effects stemming from the ongoing Euro Zone sovereign crisis.

21.       All in all, despite suffering a succession of shocks throughout 2008-10, STP has avoided
major macroeconomic imbalances and growth is estimated to edge from 4 percent in 2009 to 4.5
percent in 2010 (compared to 5.8 percent in 2008). Although FDI declined in 2010, rising
externally-financed public investment projects and elections-related spending supported economic
activity. Over the years, STP authorities have demonstrated a satisfactory track record in maintaining
prudent macroeconomic policies that are sustainable over the medium-term.

22.      To raise public sector effectiveness the Government hastened reforms in public finance
management. During 2008-10, the Government introduced new legislation to improve budget
execution, tax collection, public procurement, public administration, and petroleum governance. Other
structural reforms aimed at improving market competition (drafting a new commerce code,
simplifying business registration procedures, and revising labor laws), are in progress, but begun with
some delay because the Government’s attention was diverted to addressing the exogenous shocks.

23.       Performance of State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs) constrains economic growth and fiscal
management, and the authorities have taken steps to address recurring problems. The
Government privatization program in 2000-01 left it the only shareholder of four fully state-owned
enterprises considered essential in developing key economic sectors. 7 However, the weak financial
situation of SOEs has translated into higher contingent liabilities and transfers from the Government
that make it difficult to maintain fiscal management. Reduced investment and poor operation and
maintenance expenditures have led to irregular and poor quality service provision and payment arrears
from these utility companies. This is particularly evident in the case of the electricity and water
company, EMAE: STP suffers from low levels of electrification (60 percent) and sanitation coverage
(25 percent), and blackouts are frequent, representing annual losses of about 4 percent of GDP. To
improve fiscal management in the energy sector, the Government has begun to address recurring
problem of arrears accumulation between the Government, the electricity and water company EMAE,
and the oil supplier ENCO. In 2010, the Government cleared its arrears with EMAE up to end-2009. 8
EMAE was paid a total of about US$5.8 million (3 percent of GDP), including about US$1.6 million
to fully clear arrears accumulated over previous years. This payment enabled EMAE to partially clear
its arrears with ENCO, which in turn was able to settle its fuel tax obligations to the Government.
Further steps to resolve these issues are scheduled for 2011 (see paragraph 26).

                                      D.       M ACROECONOMIC O UTLOOK

24.       Growth is projected to rise to 5 percent in 2011 and to 6 percent during 2012-13. Growth
will continue to rely on oil exploration activities, especially in the new offshore areas, investment in
construction, and tourism receipts. The small economic expansion in 2011 is projected to be driven by
a modest increase in FDI supporting major private sector projects (e.g., the deep-sea water port). The
growth projections assume a continuation of prudent fiscal policies, appropriate levels of capital
expenditure and PRSP implementation, and continued donor support. Risks to the medium-term
growth outlook include further delays in private sector projects, and lower-than-expected external
project grants through the budget. Continued prudent monetary policy supported by budgetary
restraint is expected to reduce annual inflation to 6 percent by end-2011 and to 4 percent by end-2013.
The fixed exchange rate regime is expected to lower inflation expectations.


7
  These companies are EMAE (Energy and Water services), ENASA (Airport services), ENAPORT (Port services), and Correios
(Postal services). The Government also participates in the capital of a few other enterprises: 49 percent of CST Telecom, 40
percent of Banco International STP, and 30 percent of Air São Tomé.
8
    As of end-March 2010, EMAE’s total debt to ENCO amounted to US$12 million (6.3 percent of GDP).



                                                             7
25.     STP will bolster fiscal consolidation to maintain macroeconomic stability and support
growth. In recent years, STP has been able to finance sizeable domestic primary fiscal deficits thanks
to the presence of oil signature bonuses and privatization receipts. However, these resources are
dwindling. The authorities will accelerate fiscal adjustment in the context of the ECF building on
ongoing efforts to expand the register of taxpayers, enhance the enforcement of tax laws, and improve
customs administration. On the expenditure side, the Government will better prioritize spending
(especially on goods and services and transfers) and will contain expenditures. Capital
expenditures will remain stable, mainly financed by foreign aid. Overall, the domestic annual
primary fiscal deficit is projected to decline to 4 percent of GDP in 2011 and to reach 3 percent of
GDP by end-2013.

26.      The Government aims to prevent the recurrence of overruns and arrears. Reforms
will include the rationalization of foreign missions and the restructuring of the scholarship
program. With regards to the energy sector, additional payments by the Government are expected
in 2011 to settle arrears between the Government, EMAE, and ENCO. The 2011 Budget provides
a more realistic budget for government utility payments, and the Government has started to tackle
structural problems underlying EMAE’s weak financial position, with assistance from the Bank
and the IFC. In addition, an automatic price adjustment mechanism for petroleum products is
scheduled for implementation in 2011 to allow retail prices to adjust to international prices.

27.     The Government is also keen on strengthening public expenditure efficiency to
implement its pro-poor program. This is being complemented with improved policies to
maintain tighter control over the level of public spending and ensure fiscal and debt sustainability.
These are the two most critical areas in the short run and the focus of this DPO (see Section V-B).

28.      The external current account deficit is projected to decrease from 51.7 percent of GDP
in 2010 to an average of 48.5 percent of GDP over 2011-13. International reserves are expected to
amount to US$42.8 million at end-2011 (5.3 months of import coverage). The reduction of the current
account deficit is expected to be driven mainly by lower imports of petroleum and food products, and
will be financed mainly by foreign aid (14 percent of GDP), and FDI, notably in the construction and
tourism sectors (23.5 percent of GDP). With these macroeconomic projections, STP’s external debt is
expected to remain below its 2007 level. Debt servicing is expected to decrease from 5.1 percent of
export earnings in 2009 to an average of 4.6 percent over 2011-2013, at the time when the
Government expects to receive US$26 million (12 percent of GDP) in oil signature bonuses.
Considering the expected oil signature bonuses and debt cancellation to be granted in 2011, the overall
external balance is projected to show a surplus in 2011 (see Table 2 in Annex 2), which would be
used to finance external debt service obligations and restore adequate balances in the NOA.

29.      Perhaps the most important medium-term issue affecting STP’s macroeconomic
outlook is whether or not oil production starts, currently foreseen around 2015. If petroleum is
commercially exploited, a programmed phase out of foreign grants will be needed to ensure a
balanced transition to the potential oil era and avoid a drastic reduction in needed funds to breach the
interim period. However, in the long run, current fiscal policies are not sustainable if petroleum is not
commercially exploited. It is in this context that STP authorities aim to diversify the economy and
foster domestic growth. If STP does not start to produce oil in 2015, a large fiscal consolidation would
be required (see further below). The oil outlook assumes that a last bonus payment of US$26 million
will be disbursed in 2011, which should cover the interim period until oil production starts, even until




                                                   8
2019.9 In case this last bonus payment is not received, the Government should retrench further current
expenditure in 2011.

30.       The Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA) notes that STP’s risk of debt distress will
remain high until oil production starts. 10 Reaching the Completion Point under the Enhanced HIPC
Initiative in 2007 led to a drastic reduction of its debt to GDP ratio from over 300 percent of GDP in
the 1990s to 50.5 percent of GDP in 2009. Indicators are particularly sensitive to export growth,
indicating that diversifying the export base is essential for preserving external debt sustainability.
However, a narrow export base, a high dependence on imports, and heavy reliance on external
financing render STP’s public debt highly vulnerable to exchange rate shocks, and volatility of exports
and foreign grants. The February 2011 DSA notes that under a non-oil scenario, reaching a sustainable
debt level would require an additional fiscal adjustment equivalent to 2.8 percent of GDP per year
during 2011-15 (compared to the baseline). This calls for (i) stronger public financial and debt
management; (ii) financing capital expenditures solely on the basis of grants and highly concessional
borrowing; and (iii) developing a comprehensive strategy to reduce the cost of doing business, attract
investment, and broaden the export base. The PRMG DPO contains key policy actions in this regard,
which are described in Section V-B.

31.      The PRMG resources will enhance the Government’s ability to protect spending in the
priority sectors to help cushion the impact of the crisis on vulnerable households and the poor,
while preserving medium-term fiscal sustainability. Importantly, with support from this DPO, the
Government has increased its budget allocation for pro-poor expenditures for 2011 (see paragraph 78).
The domestic non-oil primary budget deficit of 4 percent of GDP in 2011 is expected to be fully
financed by a small withdrawal from the NOA, as well as other net external financing including debt
relief and funds from this operation. The sharp decrease in the use of oil bonuses and of privatization
receipts reflects the depletion of the NOA and of the privatization account balance. The proposed
PRMG DPO will help finance the deficit, providing support to the achievement of the government
objectives in a context of fiscal containment, and ensuring macroeconomic and debt sustainability.

  The outlook assumes that a last bonus payment, for blocks 5 and 6 in the JDZ, of US$26 million will be disbursed in
late-2011. The authorities are taking steps to reach an agreement with the oil firms involved in these blocks so that this
bonus can be received. If this bonus is paid, the NOA balance would suffice to breach the interim period until 2019,
assuming US$1.5 million allocation to the budget in 2011, US$4.3 million in 2012, and US$3.7 million in 2013.
10
   The DSA shows that the present value of debt to exports ratio remains in breach of the indicative threshold, and that the present
value of debt to GDP ratio will surpass its threshold from 2011 until oil comes on stream.

32.    STP’s macroeconomic framework for 2011-2013 is appropriate for the proposed
development policy operation. The Bank’s view is based on the broadly favorable macroeconomic
performance during 2010. STP’s macroeconomic framework is also supported by the IMF-ECF.

33.       The authorities are strengthening governance in order to reduce poverty and foster
growth. A large program of public finance management (PFM) strengthening, supported by an IDA
project, started in 2004 and focused in improving legislation, building institutional capacity and
providing adequate tools to improve budget control and enhance public expenditure transparency and
effectiveness. Progress has been considerable and, in particular, STP has: (i) adopted improved
legislation to better allocate resources and make them more accountable, including the 2007 Organic
Law on Public Finance Management; (ii) improved public institutions to respond better to
beneficiaries, including a progressive decentralization of public expenditure; and (iii) introduced better
tools to make the public sector more efficient, notably through the interim computerized financial
management information system introduced in 2007 (see paragraph 61). In addition, procurement
legislation and procedures have been strengthened to enhance public expenditure transparency and
effectiveness. These improvements are helping STP to better align limited public resources with pro-
poor and human capital enhancement activities to increase productivity, and raise growth.

34.      Petroleum sector governance has been strengthened. The petroleum sector is critical in
STP economy not only in terms of potential exports and growth but also in terms of its impact on the
broader policy and governance agenda. To address concerns related to the use of oil revenues, the
National Assembly approved the Oil Revenue Management Law (ORML) in 2004. The law
established an account–the NOA–in which all oil revenues are deposited directly, introducing specific
mechanisms to restrict the amount of such revenues that can be used for annual budgetary
expenditures. Capacity and transparency in the petroleum sector has also been built up through the
establishment of legislation and institutions that govern the petroleum sector, such as the National
Petroleum Agency (NPA), created in 2004. The NPA has enhanced its capacity to analyze and follow-
up on petroleum contracts, elaborate policies for the sector, and supervise and regulate the industry
both in the Joint Development Zone (JDZ) that STP shares with Nigeria and its own Exclusive
Economic Zone (EEZ).

35.      Transparency in the petroleum sector continues to be a key priority in STP. STP was
delisted from the EITI in 2010 due to difficulties to set up the EITI committee in the JDZ shared with


                                                             10
Nigeria; delays were caused by the Nigerian counterparts in designating its representatives to the joint
committee. 11 Without own managed operations currently in the EEZ, the STP oil revenues are
obtained only from operations in the JDZ. On its own, the Government of STP and all political parties,
as well as industry and civil society parties are fully in support of, and ready to implement, the EITI.
Indeed, despite being delisted from the EITI, transparency has improved notably, with support from
the World Bank, with the creation of the Petroleum Oversight Committee in 2006 and the Public
Registration and Transparency Information Office in 2007, which hold and disseminate all public
petroleum information in STP. STP has further developed the required legislation and institutions to
exploit its EEZ, and is finalizing the environmental regulations for petroleum operations with support
from Norway. These efforts have allowed STP to initiate in March 2010 the licensing round of seven
blocks in its EEZ following an international competitive bidding process that is expected to conclude
in contracts in 2011. Furthermore, the Government has already created an EITI committee for its EEZ
and continues to coordinate with Nigeria to form an EITI committee for the JDZ. The World Bank
continues to support STP in its effort to implement the EITI in the JDZ and in the EEZ.

36.      Improvements notwithstanding, STP continues to face key governance challenges, with
respect to weak domestic accountability, corruption, and uneven implementation and weak
coordination of core reforms. Government effectiveness is ranked poorly and has shown no
improvement during recent years. This is particularly worrisome given the key role of the public
sector as STP’s main employer and economic agent. Furthermore, limited public resources make it
urgent to improve the effectiveness and transparency of the public sector to respond with fewer
resources to pressing social and economic needs. To respond to this challenge, the authorities aim to
accelerate their public finance management reform.

 III. THE GOVERNMENT PROGRAM AND PARTICIPATORY PROCESSES

37.      The PRSP adopted in 2003 followed an extensive consultative process, with
representatives of government, political parties, civil society, and other stakeholders in the six districts
on the island of São Tomé and on the island of Príncipe. The PRSP was endorsed by the Boards of the
World Bank and IMF in April and May 2005, respectively, after the Government strengthened the
PRSP’s macroeconomic framework. A PRSP unit was set up in 2004 to monitor its implementation,
coordinating with Ministries, private sector, and civil society. This PRSP Unit is functional and
prepares annual implementation reports that are reviewed by the Bank and IMF although the PRSP is
not yet results-oriented and lacks adequate follow-up indicators, which have hampered PRSP
supervision. Joint Staff Advisory Notes (JSAN) were presented to the Bank and IMF Boards of
Executive Directors in 2006 and 2008, emphasizing the need to undertake further poverty diagnostic,
cost and prioritize sector strategies, attract private investment and donor support, enhance institutional
capacity to ensure full implementation, monitoring and evaluation of the PRSP, as well as
macroeconomic and political stability.

38.     The policies set forth in the Government’s medium-term reform program are in line
with the PRSP. The PRSP lays out a strategic plan for poverty reduction based on five pillars: (i)
reform of public institutions, capacity building, and promotion of good governance; (ii) accelerated
and redistributive growth; (iii) creation of opportunities to increase and diversify income for the poor;
(iv) human resource development and access to basic social services; and (v) adoption of mechanisms
to monitor, assess and update the strategy. The Government has translated the PRSP into a medium-
term program for 2010-14, which was endorsed in elections in August 2010 and approved by the
National Assembly in September 2010. This program puts public financial management and


11
     It is worth noting that the JDZ that STP shares with Nigeria is the only JDZ being assessed by the EITI Secretariat.



                                                                  11
governance at the forefront of the agenda, 12 and it is supported by the proposed DPO. For the
medium-term, the Government aims to: (i) consolidate public financial management reforms, in
particular by strengthening budget accountability, transparency, efficiency, and control, and
accelerating the organization and production of the public accounts of the State and their submission
to the Court of Accounts in line with international best practices; and (ii) improve public debt
management as well as strengthening the management of fiscal policy in order to ensure the
sustainability of macroeconomic policies. The Government’s program also identifies sector strategies.
For instance, education and health programs are envisioned in the Government’s program focusing on
primary education (universal enrolment at the basic education level, and quality improvement) and on
primary health.

39.       The Government of STP undertook a comprehensive analysis of the status of its public
expenditure management and financial accountability in 2007, with World Bank support. The
analysis relied on three diagnostic tools: (i) the Public Expenditure Management and Financial
Accountability Review (PEMFAR); (ii) Country Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA); and
(iii) the Country Procurement Assessment Review (CPAR). The Government of STP has drawn on
these analyses in implementing a comprehensive and integrated public financial reform program.
These analyses identified key priority actions, which were translated into a comprehensive action plan.
While this comprehensive approach was risky (as the capacity of government to address many reform
areas at the same time was limited), it has provided an opportunity for achieving key improvements in
the quality of public expenditure management that have eluded many of the previous reform efforts.

40.       The proposed operation is consistent with the Government’s program and supports its
efforts to initiate a new PRSP. Both the Government and its development partners agree that the
2003 PRSP is now outdated and a new development strategy must be adopted. Preparation of new
PRSP is underway led by the Directorate of Planning with a technical committee formed by the PRSP
Unit, the Statistics Office (INE), and sectors. The updated version of the PRSP will require first to
update the poverty profile based on the new Household Survey (expected to be completed in 2011).
The new PRSP will focus on promoting sectors that would create employment and economic
opportunities of the poor. Measures that will be emphasized include (i) diversifying both output and
exports; (ii) improving economic and political governance; (iii) ensuring macroeconomic and fiscal
sustainability; (iv) enhancing the delivery of social services; (v) raising private investment; and (vi)
strengthening donor coordination. The Government expects to finalize this new results-oriented PRSP
in 2011, and has assured the World Bank that the new PRSP will follow a participatory process. The
activities supported by this operation will enhance STP’s capacity to better implement medium term
strategies by introducing a formal consultative mechanism to coordinate donor assistance.

41.     The Government’s commitment to reform is further articulated in the Letter of
Development Policy (Annex 1) and the IMF’s Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies
(MEFP) document. The Government’s objectives are to consolidate macroeconomic stability,
improve public sector efficiency, and raise growth through the implementation of structural reforms.
The economic policies will continue to pursue fiscal policy to improve debt sustainability, and
maintain fiscal discipline to support the fixed exchange rate regime. The Government program is
supported by this operation in two areas: (i) the strengthening public financial management; and (ii)
the promotion of sustainable economic policies.


12
   The program states that ―the inefficient management of public goods associated with the malfunctioning of public management
is one of the main problems that the country is facing […] Strengthening governance is therefore a key priority…in particular
improving the quality and accuracy of public management” (Programa do Décimo Quarto Governo Constitucional de São Tomé
e Príncipe, approved on September 17, 2010, page 3).



                                                             12
The Government Program and Recent Developments in PFM and Economic Management

42.     Considerable progress has been made on improving PFM over the last five years. PFM
reforms have been successfully implemented with the support of the World Bank through two
predecessor operations: (i) the CBTA Project, which started in 2004 and closed recently in September
2010; and (ii) the PNRMD DPO which closed in June 2010. Despite substantial progress, however,
weaknesses persist in the areas of budget planning and execution, financial reporting, and auditing.

43.       The budget preparation process has been strengthened, but challenges remain. Notable
improvements include the adoption of the Organic Law on Public Finance Management (SAFE Law)
in 2007 that replaced the outdated 1986 PFM Law, which eliminated dual budgeting of current and
investment expenditures. In 2008 the Government introduced a new budget nomenclature that
facilitated budget supervision around programs. In addition, to improve the budget planning process
and facilitate the preparation and supervision of the up-coming PRSP, the Government issued a decree
in 2008 specifying all budget codes that correspond to PRSP priorities in social sectors (i.e., the pro-
poor expenditures). However, both budget formulation and the alignment of the budget with PRSP
priorities remain weak as and there is a lack of systematic monitoring of pro-poor expenditures. There
is also a lack of consistency between recurrent and investment expenditures that, in practice, follow
parallel budget processes as the majority of the investment program is financed by donors, which
provides limited information to the Budget Directorate. This complicates the preparation of medium-
term expenditure frameworks and multi-year sector allocations. The Government is aware of these
challenges and with the support of its development partners will continue to implement reforms to
address these issues.

44.      Improved budget tools are having positive impact on budget execution and internal
controls, in particular the Integrated Financial Management Information System (IFMIS), nicknamed
Safinho, introduced in 2007. This IFMIS shares information between the Budget Directorate
(responsible for approving expenditure commitments and issuing payment orders) and the Treasury
Directorate (responsible for actual payment and public accounting). This IFMIS incorporated the new
budget codes and allowed for the first time a functional classification of operations to be introduced.
This system facilitated progressive decentralization of budget execution and was complemented with
new procedures in most directorates to improve budget control and enhance public expenditure
transparency and effectiveness. To ensure proper management of the IFMIS, an Information
Technology Directorate was created in 2008. Efforts to improve Treasury management include the
adoption of a methodology for preparing financial programs and cash plans to better connect the cash
management system to the resource-mobilization schedule, and new functions of the Treasury
Directorate to improve budget controls and supervision of State Owned Enterprise.

45.      However, the current IFMIS is limited by a series of factors, such as limited exchange
information with the Central Bank, the lack of a module for public accounting, and a limited capacity
and reliability of the system to expand it further to all sector ministries. In response to these
constraints, in 2008 the Government begun developing the SAFE-e system, a more advanced system
that incorporates new procedures to prepare the public accounts and uses a more reliable technology,
based on a web-based interface.

46.      Transparency in procurement systems has been strengthened supported by the CBTA
and the PNRMD operations. New procurement legislation was approved and training provided in the
area of procurement to all ministries’ procurement officers. A Procurement Supervisory Body has
been staffed and is operational. A Coordination and Assistance Procurement Cabinet created in 2009
centralizes procurement information, assists the decentralized procurement units and assures
uniformity and quality across the units. As a result of these improvements, over 90 percent of public


                                                  13
contracts above US$60,000 now follow competitive bidding procedures. Yet, procurement problems
exist because of insufficient competition and presentation of bids due to their low value, which has not
been sufficient to attract international suppliers. This problem is common in small island countries and
deserves further analysis.

47.       Public accounting institutions have been created. Prior to 2005, the systems of financial
recording and reporting of public resources were either non-existent or operated at low levels of
efficiency. Government accounts were managed solely with the objective of respecting budgetary
ceilings based on the available financial resources. This rudimentary form of record keeping
undermined the use of accrual techniques and prevented the construction of reliable General
Government Accounts, which makes it difficult to conduct macroeconomic and public financial
analyses and, more importantly, hinders effective internal and external fiduciary control. The 2007
SAFE Law adopted a chart of accounts employing double-entry accounting, which permits a more
homogeneous and transparent recording of financial transactions, facilitating the analysis of outcomes.
This chart of accounts was updated in 2010 to resolve inconsistencies and to better accommodate it to
the reality of STP. Furthermore, the Government created the institutions required to prepare the public
accounts, notably the Public Accounting Directorate (AD) and the Public Assets Management
Directorate in 2009. The latter is in charge of carrying out a survey of State assets and developing a
software program to ensure the management of State Assets and has adopted the legislation that
defines the terms of the survey of all State assets.

48.       The Government is developing an action plan to prepare annual State financial
statements, with support from the World Bank, and has identified technical assistance needs.
Importantly, the ―opening balances‖ for the 2011 fiscal year need to be established and entered into
the SAFE-e system. Furthermore, a Public Accounting Manual that sets out the accounting principles,
procedures, and accounting tables needs to be prepared, and training to the personnel of the Public
Accounting Department needs to be provided to ensure the production of public accounts. For 2011,
the Government should run in parallel the SAFE-e and the Safinho system. The operation (in parallel)
of these two systems should last until the all SAFE-e tests are finalized and the authorities have
defined a calendar for when all corrective technical and administrative efforts will be completed. This
period of parallel operations could be extended until June-July 2011. All in all, to compensate for the
institutional weaknesses of the Public Accounting Directorate to master the accounting principles and
the production of accounting statements that will be produced by SAFE, it is necessary that the Public
Accounting Directorate receives technical assistance during the first 2 or 3 months of the initial phase
of the implementation of the SAFE-e accounting module. Such technical assistance will enable the
Government to produce monthly public accounting statistics in 2011 and harmonize them with the
statistics of the Central Bank. Following satisfactory progress in this regard, the Government expects
to produce pilot public accounts of the State for 2011 by mid-2012.

49.      Revenue administration has been strengthened. Importantly, the Government strengthened
the tax system, with support from the World Bank and technical assistance from the Millennium
Challenge Corporation (MCC) and the Government of Portugal. After reviewing its tax legislation in
2006 to bring it in line with international standards, in 2008 the Government begun to strengthen the
two main tax regimes: the Corporate and Personal Income tax codes in 2008. Legislation was
introduced in 2009 that harmonized taxation between enterprises and individuals, improved the rate
structure, and strengthened tax assessment. Corporate tax rates were reduced from 30-45 percent to a
single rate of 25 percent, which is closer to regional levels. Progressive personal income taxes now
apply to all forms of income, therefore reducing the economic distortions that penalized the formal
sector. Exemptions for payments such as scholarships and social security contributions were also
introduced which are expected to strong positive impacts on human development. These reforms
aimed to reduce distortions and increased revenue buoyancy by simplifying compliance procedures.


                                                  14
With respect to customs, the Government will introduce a new customs code and tariff schedule,
deploy of a new version of ASYCUDA, and enhanced port security in order to raise revenues
collection. Furthermore, the Government is modernizing its customs facility, and plans to integrate the
Treasury, Customs, and other agencies under a common Information Technology (IT) platform.

50.      The Government plans to improve oversight and governance of the public enterprise
sector. The Government’s public enterprise reform strategy aims to achieve greater efficiency,
transparency, and accountability, and to contain fiscal risks. Supported by this operation, the
Governments has submitted to the National Assembly an updated statute governing public enterprises
that reinforces the legal framework for monitoring and control of public enterprises. Specific reforms
of state-owned enterprises are also on the agenda. The Government has completed, with support from
the World Bank and the IFC, a strategy to revitalize the energy sector and promote private sector
participation, and an action plan is scheduled to be discussed at the Council of Ministers in 2011.

51.       Maintaining sustainable economic policies is a key STP priority. Measures identified by
the Government aim to improve fiscal policy management to achieve sustainable fiscal deficit levels,
strengthen the debt management system, improve the efficiency of public enterprises, and align donor
assistance around STP priorities. A key priority is to strengthen the borrowing mandate to the
Government in the SAFE legislation, which is currently not appropriately formulated and allows
contracting debt that is not adequately approved by the Ministry of Finance. To address these
weaknesses, and with support of this operation, the authorities are planning to introduce new
legislation to improve public debt management and raise the transparency and accountability of public
resources.

52.      The Government’s program specifies the importance of improving coordination with
donors. A new unit in the Ministry of Finance (the International Coordination Directorate) is
responsible for aid coordination and for the management of information on external assistance. The
Government plans to set a formal consultative mechanism to improve the flow of information and
better align the priorities of the government priorities with donor strategies, and introducing sector-
wide approaches. A key Government priority is strengthening coordination with donors to raise the
efficiency of public investment projects and to increase investments in infrastructure and energy, in
order to address supply bottlenecks and enhance growth potential. The Government is working with
its development partners to accelerate implementation of foreign-funded projects, while safeguarding
resources allocated for Treasury-funded investment projects and maintenance.

          IV. BANK SUPPORT TO THE GOVERNMENT’S PROGRAM

                                        A.      L INK TO ISN

53.      The proposed PRMG program consolidates Bank support to governance reforms in line
with the priorities identified in the Bank’s Interim Strategy Note (ISN). The CAS expired in 2009
and the Bank has decided to move ahead with an ISN while the authorities finalize the new PRSP that
would serve as the basis for a future Bank strategy with the country. The PRMG program supports
policy reforms identified in the Bank’s ISN, which covers the period between 2011 and 2012 and that
continues to support areas of previous engagement (i.e. deepening reforms in social sectors and public
sector governance, and supporting macroeconomic stability and pro-poor growth). In addition, and
given the pressing needs and insufficient energy in STP, the ISN incorporates the energy sector as a
new area for engagement.




                                                  15
                     B.         C OLLABORATION WITH THE IMF AND OTHER D ONORS

54.     IMF-Bank programs have been closely coordinated. The staffs of IDA and the IMF have
coordinated the DPO and the ECF program to ensure that they complement each other. PFM measures
supported by the ECF program are in large part drawn from the Bank supported PFM reform and the
reform program underpinning the proposed operation is consistent with the macroeconomic program
supported by the ECF.

55.      IFC-Bank Coordination. STP became a member of the IFC in October 2008 and since then,
IFC is assisting STP in several areas including the revitalization of the energy sector, improving the
business environment, and raising tourism prospects. IFC and Bank programs have been closely
coordinated. As a result of the IFC-Bank collaboration in analyzing the energy reforms, the
Government is considering partnering with IFC (as a transaction advisor) to advance prospects for
private sector participation in the sector. STP is not a member of MIGA.

56.      Coordination with other donors. Coordination among development partners faces
challenges because most agencies do not have a representative based in STP (the World Bank
included). To improve coordination, the development partner teams are collaborating on mission
timings to maximum overlap in the field (see paragraph 93). Like the Bank, both the European Union
(EU) and AfDB have been strengthening their engagement with the government in support of the
economic reform program over the past five years. There are complementarities between the IMF,
World Bank, EU, and AfDB programs that support macroeconomic stabilization and PFM. The
World Bank, as of now, is the only donor providing budgetary assistance to STP. The strategic focus,
contents, and prior actions of the DPO have been presented to staff of the European Union which may
provide budgetary assistance in this area in the future. Bank staff also consulted closely with other
major donors such as the AfDB, UNDP, and Portugal, who are providing technical assistance for
budgetary management and other reforms. Portugal has a multi-year project that provides technical
assistance and training encompassing all areas of the Ministry of Finance and International
Cooperation and including a resident macroeconomic advisor. The MCC has supported STP with a
threshold project of US$7.4 million to raise revenue collection (tax and customs compliance) and
improve the business environment. 13

57.      European Union. The EU has been implementing its Tenth European Development Fund
(2008-13) (EUR17.1 million). EU assistance to STP includes projects in the transport sector 14
(EUR13.3 million), the international trade sector15 (EUR 1.3 million), the public finance sector (EUR
0.5 million), and other projects.16 With regards to public finances, the EU is proving technical
assistance to: (i) prepare the public accounts of the State; and (ii) strengthen the planning process in
sector ministries including health, education, agriculture and water and sanitation.


13
   The MCC threshold program assists the Government to improve tax revenues, strengthen administrative capacity at the Tax and
Customs Directorates, and foster private sector growth by improving administrative and regulatory business registration
procedures. Expected outcomes include an increase in the number of registered taxpayers, stronger collection of accumulated
arrears, streamlined customs procedures, and reduced time and cost of reducing businesses. Upon successful completion of the
reforms in these areas STP will become eligible for full MCC support.
14
   The EU continues to support STP to maintain its road network, and is also training civil society groups to develop small
rehabilitation works. The EU support also aims to strengthen institutional capacity in the newly created Transport Planning Unit
(Unidade de Planificaçao do Sector dos Transportes) to prepare a sector strategy.
15
   Concerning international trade, the EU is supporting two areas: (i) the elaboration of a commercial strategy for STP; and (ii) a
cluster-type initiative to strengthen the top five exporting clusters in STP (foreseen as coffee, cacao, flower, vanilla, and pepper).
16
   Other EU assistance includes a food security project (EUR1.7 million), a solid waste management project (EUR0.6 million),
and a project to fight non-transmissible diseases (EUR0.4 million).



                                                                 16
58.      AfDB. The current AfDB’s Results-Based Country Strategy Paper (RBCSP) supports the
Government’s efforts to implement the PRSP in order to reach the MDGs. AfDB is now preparing a
new RBCSP for the period 2011-2014. AfDB’s country allocation for 2005-2009 of US$6.8 million
was in the form of grants, which supported two pillars: (i) poverty reduction in rural areas; and (ii)
promotion of governance in Public Finance Management. The first pillar promoted the diversification
of the country’s economic base, especially with regards to the agricultural and rural sectors, and
reinforced operations in the social sectors. Under this pillar, the livestock development support
project-phase II was approved in May 2006. The second pillar supported macroeconomic and
governance reforms through an institutional support project on governance and a technical assistance
on the PRSP process. These helped to improve public finance management and institutional capacity
to prepare the country for the forthcoming oil era. Given the considerable needs for institutional
capacity building, the AfDB have financed strategic economic and sector studies such as the Country
Governance Profile, and the joint study with the World Bank on the integrated fiduciary assessment.
Furthermore, the AfDB have financed regional capacity building initiatives, within CEMAC, ECCAS,
the African Portuguese-speaking countries, and the small island states.

59.      UNDP. The objective of the 2007-11 strategy of the UNDP is to support the Government at
local and central levels to promote human development, gender equality and reduce poverty by two
thirds by 2015. The strategy, financed by US$2.5 million of own resources and US$2.8 million of
additional resources, focus on three areas: (i) poverty reduction to reach the MDGs and tackle
HIV/AIDS; (ii) good governance to the benefit of potential oil revenues; and (iii) environment and
energy management for sustainable environment. The United Nations is also the leading agency
supporting the Government in strengthening external assistance coordination and in assisting the
Government to develop a Memorandum of Understanding that would create a formal mechanism to
coordinate donor assistance.

                       C.        R ELATIONSHIP WITH OTHER B ANK OPERATIONS

60.      The PRMG program takes forward critical policy objectives of previous Bank
operations, notably the CBTA (US$5 million, approved by the Board in 2004) and the PNRMD
DPO (US$8 million, approved by the Board in 2008).17 Key targets in both operations were largely
met for a majority of outcomes (see further below). The PRMG program supports the next phase of
reforms in line with the recommendations set forth in the Implementation Completion and Results
Reports (ICR) of the PNRMD and CBTA operations. These identify key priorities such as preparing
the financial statements of the State, and raising transparency and accountability in budget formulation
and execution, and improving the performance of public enterprises. The promotion of sustainable
economic policies, regardless of whether or not oil production materializes in the medium term, takes
a more prominent role in the proposed PRMG DPO as the Government embarks on strengthening
debt management and coordination with donors. The PRMG program also continues to monitor
progress in preparing a new results-oriented development strategy.

61.      CBTA. The Bank’s US$5 million 2004-2010 Capacity Building Technical Assistance project
supported reforms in public finance management, petroleum management, and PRSP implementation.
CBTA aimed to support growth and poverty reduction through modernizing and building up capacity
in financial and budgetary management and supervision; and through strengthening basic institutional
and legal infrastructure in the finance and the natural resources and environment ministries. CBTA
consisted of three components: (i) petroleum sector; (ii) public finance; and (iii) support for PRSP
implementation. It assisted in the preparation of legislation and the development of institutions,

17
  The Bank is working with the STP authorities on a US$14.7 million Central African Backbone (CAB) project that has the
objective to improve broadband network services and reduce telecommunications prices in STP.



                                                         17
capacity, and tools to raise STP’s public finance management. CBTA also helped build the
institutional and legal framework to formulate policies, and supervise and regulate the petroleum
sector. CBTA closed on September 2010 and was rated Moderately Satisfactory on its overall
performance.

62.      PNRMD. Annex 4 summarizes the extent to which the proposed PRMG (―DPO 2‖)
operation takes forward several of the policy objectives of PNRMD (―DPO 1‖) operation. The
PNRMD (a single tranche DPO of US$6 million) was approved by the Board in August 2008. STP’s
vulnerability to external shocks materialized in 2008 prompting additional Bank assistance through a
Supplemental Financing of US$2 million, which was approved by the Board in August 2009.
PNRMD’s objectives were to develop institutional capability, introduce modern techniques and
approaches in public financial management, and raise public sector efficiency. It also aimed at
increasing transparency in the petroleum sector, and developing mechanisms to ensure that the
benefits of future oil extraction materialize optimally within standards of good governance. PNRMD
closed on June 2010 and was rated Moderately Satisfactory on its overall performance.

                                    D.       L ESSONS L EARNED

63.      Move towards budget support. The 2006-09 CAS analysis of previous Bank achievements
in STP and the 2011-2012 ISN suggest budget support as an instrument to assist the country given its
small size and limited institutional capacity. The previous CAS and the ISN emphasize that
development policy operations based on capacity building activities should be considered more
effective and efficient in delivering Bank’s assistance. Development policy operations also provide
more leverage to the small amount of IDA resources available to STP. The critical issue is to ensure
an appropriate design and timing of such operations, building on lessons learnt.

64.      The following lessons learned are as documented in the Implementation Completion
and Results (ICR) report for PNRMD DPO, which rated the development outcome to be
moderately satisfactory, the risks to the development outcome to be negligible, the Bank’s
performance to be moderately satisfactory, and the Borrower’s performance to be moderately
satisfactory. The PNRMD’s ICR identifies the following lessons:
         Long-term Bank commitment must be ensured and public governance reforms need to
           be consolidated. Fragile economies beset by persistent poverty and weak or non-existent
           PFM systems such as STP require continuous technical and financial external support and
           the Bank should ensure such assistance continues. The Bank continues its support to STP
           with the proposed DPO, which aims to consolidate and further strengthen PFM in order to
           maintain fiscal discipline, and to improve the effectiveness of public resources to achieve
           its poverty reduction objectives.
         Critical capacity constraints should be identified and technical complexities should not
           be underestimated. During preparation of the PRMG program an institutional capacity
           assessment was carried out, and identified the following: (i) objectives should be focused
           and not very ambitious, given the limited capacity in some areas (i.e., public accounting);
           (ii) sophisticated procedures (including software) in a low capacity country are difficult to
           manage. To strengthen these areas, the government has committed to finance with domestic
           resources a set of critical technical assistance and the Bank has drafted terms of references
           to assist in its implementation.
         Key documents should be translated into the local language. The team discussed key
           documents (including Aide Memoires and the policy matrix) with the authorities in
           Portuguese to better assist them in the understanding and implementation of the DPO.




                                                  18
        Need to strengthen the M&E system in STP. This DPO provides an effective use of M&E
         systems by basing the operation on relevant, precise, quantifiable to the extent possible, and
         easy to monitor indicators and program goals that help track information from all
         government agencies and ministries.
        Strengthen donor coordination. The PNRMD ICR highlighted that future DPOs would
         benefit from having a formal donor coordination mechanism that ensures adequate program
         and project coordination and implementation. The prior actions in the proposed DPO
         support such a donor coordination mechanism as a conduit for pledging donor contributions
         in support of STP’s agenda, and for reducing transaction costs for the already overstretch
         authorities (see paragraphs 92 and 93).
        STP needs to develop a new results-oriented strategy. The proposed DPO supports STP to
         adopt a results-oriented PRSP based on sound analysis and consultative process to ensure
         that STP’s development objectives are met.

65.      Lessons learnt from Bank-wide analytical work on small island states. The Bank has an
extensive knowledge base on small states. Small states are characterized by: (i) high per unit cost of
government services, which implies that public resource management needs to be particularly
effective; and (ii) little flexibility of the economy to adapt to shocks, which implies that the
Government must ensure the sustainability of economic policies. As shown in Annex 7, the
experience of Cape Verde reveals that structural vulnerabilities common to small island states may be
overcome by consolidating reforms aimed at raising the efficiency of investment and foreign aid to
support economic growth and engender domestic savings, and by implementing sound fiscal and
monetary policies, among other reforms. In line with these findings, this DPO supports policies that
are cognizant of STP’s institutional capacity and aim to improve public resource management and to
promote sustainable economic policies.

                             C.       A NALYTICAL U NDERPINNINGS

66.     The PRMG DPO policy triggers and benchmarks draw upon key recommendations of the
Public Expenditure Management and Financial Accountability Review (PEMFAR), the European
Union’s Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability Review (PEFA), the Debt Management
Performance Assessment (DeMPA), and the Country Economic Memorandum (CEM).

67.      PEMFAR. The 2007 PEMFAR provides a comprehensive assessment of STP’s public
financial management systems and capacities. The Country Financial Accountability Assessment
(CFAA) component of the PEMFAR includes recommendations to address key weaknesses in public
sector management and accelerate reforms in the areas of budget preparation, execution, reporting and
control. These recommendations were translated into an action plan that was implemented with the
assistance of the CBTA and the PNRMD. The Public Expenditure Review (PER) component of the
PEMFAR highlights the need to strengthen overall governance and ensure the sustainability of fiscal
policies. The PER also highlights the need to improve the legal framework for assessing the
performance of SOEs, and to strengthen the database of financial information of SOEs. The
Government is following these recommendations in the drafting of public financial management
regulations as well as economic management and supervision legislation.

68.      PEFA. The 2010 PEFA pointed to weaknesses in financial accountability in the public sector
and listed a number of priorities for 2010 and beyond, notably: the publication of an annual statement
of public accounts; the need to raise the transparency and accountability of public resources; and the
modernization of accounting systems and routines.




                                                 19
69.    DeMPA. The 2008 DeMPA report provides a useful baseline of debt management
performance indicators for STP after the HIPC Completion Point. Debt management in STP is weak
and debt indicators show that STP does not meet the minimum requirements for adequate debt
management although it is improving in some areas. In particular, the DeMPA highlights the need to
improve the debt legal framework and debt managerial structures.

70.       CEM. The recently-completed Country Economic Memorandum identifies the constraints to
growth and identifies public financial management and public governance as priority areas for reform
in STP. Particular focus is given to raising public expenditure effectiveness, and enhancing the
resilience of the economy through sustainable economic policies. Specifically, STP would need to
improve macroeconomic stability, which is an overarching constraint, for which the Government
would need to accelerate fiscal consolidation to support the peg to the Euro, and increase the
flexibility of the labor and capital markets to better adjust to external shocks. Furthermore, the
business climate needs to be improved by eliminating red tape, by improving the effectiveness of
public financial management, and by expanding the tax base. These efforts should be accompanied by
investments in human capital and infrastructure. All of which would help reduce the fiscal deficit and
eliminate market distortions, while fostering competition and investment, and creating jobs.

                     V.     THE PROPOSED GRANT OPERATION

                                A.      OPERATION D ESCRIPTION

71.      Program Development Objectives. The overall objective of the PRMG DPO is to assist the
Government of São Tomé and Príncipe to improve public sector effectiveness. This objective will be
achieved by: (i) raising the transparency and accountability in the management of public resources
with a focus on improving budget transparency and accountability and the implementation of pro-poor
expenditures, improving the management of public accounts and assets, and strengthening the
oversight framework for public enterprises; and (ii) promoting sustainable economic policies by
strengthening the fiscal policy framework including the management of public debt, and by improving
donor coordination. The program development objectives are consistent with the objectives of the
Interim Strategy Note 2011-2012. The specific program outcomes and expected results are presented
in the policy matrix in Annex 3.

72.       Benefits. This single tranche IDA financing will strengthen the institutional infrastructure
needed to improve the public sector’s capacity to better deliver key services and support growth. The
work of the departments involved in public financial management would be facilitated as a result of
the PRMG operation. Ultimately, the main benefits of this operation will accrue to all São Tomeans in
terms of better-targeted public expenditures that reduce poverty, and strengthened macroeconomic
stability in support of economic growth.

73.      Good practice principles in conditionality. Box 1 provides information on how good
principles on conditionality have been applied in STP. It demonstrates the appropriateness of the
reform program, especially given the government’s extensive participation in its design.




                                                 20
       Box 1: How Good Practice Principles on Conditionality are being Applied to the Operation
Principle 1: Reinforce Ownership
    The new Government has received a strong mandate in the August 2010 elections with 26 out of 55 seats in the National
     Assembly (2 seats short of a majority)
    The new government has succeeded in mustering support in the National Assembly to adopt in September 2010 its Government
     Program that aims to improve public governance. The country has proven a positive policy reform track record in PFM and
     macroeconomic management with the implementation of the Capacity Building Technical Assistance Project, the PNRMD
     Grant, the 2005-2008 IMF-PRGF, and the ongoing IMF-ECF since 2009.
    The Bank has had extensive discussions with the authorities on the policy options and the Government departments identified
     the critical reforms needed to accelerate implementation of the PFM reforms. Where not enough analysis was available (i.e.
     reform of energy tariffs to ensure public expenditure sustainability) the Bank has agreed with the authorities to support further
     analysis.
    The authorities has sworn their commitment to the reform though a set of critical technical assistance that will be financed with
     domestic resources from the public budget.

Principle 2: Agree up front with the government and other financial partners on a coordinated accountability framework
    The accountability framework (e.g. policy matrix) for measuring progress under the program has been prepared and discussed
     with ministries involved at the technical levels. The country’s leadership was regularly informed of the plans and progress during
     negotiations.
    Other donors (UNDP, EU) do not currently provide budget support but this operation has been discussed with them in order to
     strengthen the PFM’s monitoring and evaluation system, as well as the governance reforms. The activities supported by this
     operation will benefit other donors who wish to use budget support in the medium term.

Principle 3: Customize the accountability framework and modalities of Bank support to country circumstances
    This operation focuses on measures to address immediate bottlenecks in public resource management and governance, which
     closely reflect urgent priorities in economic management. The focus on PFM and governance reforms also takes into account the
     country’s limited institutional capacity to undertake a broad range of reforms in areas where not enough analysis was available,
     such as reforming the regulatory environment or improving the business environment.

Principle 4: Choose only actions critical for achieving results as conditions for disbursement
    There are 7 prior actions, which aim to assure early improvement in PFM and governance.
    Actions that improve the sustainability of fiscal policies will have positive spillover effects on economic growth.

Principle 5: Conduct transparent progress reviews conducive to predictable and performance-based financial support
    The preparation of this operation follows the lessons learned from the PNRMD and the Bank support has been coordinated to be
     incorporated into the 2011 Budget.
 One program review is planned. They will review program progress taking into account the limited indicators available in the
     country and the short period available to have visible impacts (1 year).

                                                    B.         POLICY A REAS

    74.      The Public Resource Management and Governance Reform (PRMG) operation is designed to
    provide additional fiscal resources to São Tomé and Príncipe (STP) to protect priority sector spending
    and support fiscal consolidation and public sector reforms in the aftermath of the global economic
    slowdown. The PRMG operation supports the continued implementation of the 2011 Government’s
    reform program. It supports policy measures aimed principally at (i) raising transparency and
    accountability in the management of public resources; and (ii) promoting sustainable economic
    policies by strengthening the fiscal policy framework and improving donor coordination. This grant
    will also support preparation of new PRSP based on an updated poverty profile originating from a
    2010 household survey and an analysis of growth diversification options.

    75.      This section provides a discussion of STP’s medium-term reform program around the issues
    of focus in the proposed PRMG DPO. This operation consolidates reforms supported by previous
    Bank operations, notably the PNRMD and CBTA. Considerable progress has already been realized in
    these areas over the past few years and the Government’s interest is to accelerate implementation of
    PFM reforms and ensure the sustainability of economic policies. In addition, the authorities aim to



                                                                  21
conclude a new PRSP. Next, the Program Document summarizes the policy background and issues,
prior actions, key next steps, 18 expected results, and performance and monitoring indicators.

             a.        Raising the Transparency and Accountability of Public Resources

76.      The PRMG supports the Government’s efforts to consolidate the PFM reforms
underway. This operation aims to consolidate and accelerate reforms in PFM, which have been
recognized to be time-consuming and challenging for a small country at this level of development.
The PFM policies supported in this DPO are those identified as critical by the PEMFAR and the
PEFA reports, including: (i) increasing the transparency and accountability of budget preparation; (ii)
improving the management of public accounts and assets; (iii) improving the performance of public
enterprises; and (iv) improving payroll management.

Increasing the Transparency and Accountability of Budget Preparation

77.      STP suffers from a lack of transparency and accountability concerning budget
formulation. The 2010 PEFA report notes that the budget proposal is submitted to the National
Assembly for approval but it is not available for public discussion. Meanwhile, the 2010 Open Budget
Index ranks STP 94th out of 94 countries as neither the budget, nor its quarterly reports, are available
to the public. To increase budget accountability and better align the budget to the Government’s
strategy, the Government created in 2008 (with support from the PNRMD DPO) budget expenditure
items that correspond to poverty reduction priorities in social sectors (i.e., pro-poor budget codes).
However, pro-poor expenditures were not specified in the budget and were not open to public debate.

78.       The Government is taking measures to promote an informed debate on how public
expenditures are prioritized through transparency and accountability in public resource
management. With support from this operation, the Government improved transparency and
accountability by publishing the 2011 budget proposal in the Government’s website. In addition, to
facilitate the supervision of pro-poor expenditures and strengthen the financial implementation of the
PRSP, the 2011 budget proposal specifies pro-poor expenditures during 2007-10, and the proposed
amount for 2011. The Government will consider revising the pro-poor budget codes in the future to
bring them in line with the new PRSP. Importantly, following PRSP objectives, the Government is
committed to raising pro-poor expenditures substantially in 2011, in comparison to previous years. In
the medium-term, the Government plans to publish the Budget Laws and the Quarterly
Implementation Reports in the Government’s website. Moreover, it plans to strengthen the links
between budget allocations and policy priorities by publishing pro-poor expenditures. The purpose of
this initiative is to clearly identify intended beneficiaries of public expenditures, and monitor specific
expenditure allocations aimed at promoting pro-poor growth.

Prior action 1: The Recipient’s Council of Ministers has published on the Recipient’s Public
Portal a bill of law that approves the 2011 budget in preparation for its submission to the National
Assembly.

Prior action 2: The Recipient’s Council of Ministers has presented to the National Assembly the bill
of law for the 2011 budget specifying: (a) the expenditure items that correspond to poverty reduction
priorities in social sectors; and (b) that the share of expenditures that correspond to poverty reduction
priorities is at least 35 percent of total expenditures (compared to an average of 30 percent for the
2008-2010 period).

18
  The ―key next steps‖ are part of the Government’s medium-term program and are not considered for disbursement of this
operation.



                                                         22
Improving the Management of Public Accounts and Assets

79.       Significant challenges remain regarding the management of government accounts and
assets. The most critical area is the lack of production of the annual financial statements. This means
that an external audit cannot be conducted by the Court of Accounts, weakening public sector
accountability. The lack of annual financial statements has resulted from the technical complexities of
developing and making operational the SAFE-e system, but more importantly it reflects limited
institutional capacity in public accounting that has delayed the development of critical elements such
as the opening of the accounts, and selection of the accounting standards, among other things.

80.      An important step to making the SAFE-e system operational and producing the annual
financial statements of the State is making the Public Accounting Directorate (PAD)
operational, with appropriate budget and personnel allocations. To this end, with support from this
operation, the Government has recruited a Director of Public Accounting, and has made the PAD
operational with staff (Department Heads and technical staff) and an equipped office space. The 2011
Budget Law assigns resources for training activities for PAD’s staff. In the medium-term, the PAD
will be responsible for preparing a public accounting manual that sets out the accounting principles,
procedures, and accounting tables. The Government will also train personnel of the Public Accounting
Directorate to ensure the production of the annual financial statements. As a result of these activities,
the PAD plans to adopt an accounting framework with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles
(GAAP) and to undertake yearly internal controls of the financial accounts. These measures will
ensure that all budgetary, financial and asset operations are recorded in a reliable and consistent
manner in the public accounts, and that public accounting statistics are harmonized with the statistics
of the Central Bank. Once the authorities have published a first set of financial statements, the next
step would be to submit them to the external auditor for a financial audit. The Government expects to
prepare pilot public accounts for 2011 by mid-2012.

Prior action 3: The Recipient’s Public Accounting Directorate is operational, as evidenced by (a) the
recruitment of a Director of Public Accounting and Department Heads for Accounting Norms and
Procedures and for Monitoring and Analysis; and (b) the allocation of a permanent operational budget
of at least 180 million Dobras (about US$10,000) as per the provisions in the Recipient’s 2011 Budget
Law.

81.      Government institutions also suffer from a lack of information on public assets and
formal guidelines to manage them. Given that foreign assistance finances over 80 percent of the
public investment program, the authorities estimate that an important portion of public assets is not
properly registered and that it may be used for private benefit, thereby undermining public sector
accountability. STP lacks a registry of public assets, and staff at the new Public Assets Management
Directorate lacks guidelines to monitor and control assets.

82.      In response to these challenges, the Government is improving the management of assets.
With support from this operation, the Directorate of Public Asset Management (created in 2008 with
separate functions from the existing Treasury Directorate), has carried out a very comprehensive
inventory of existing mobile public assets for most sector ministries, which will provide critical
information needed to prepare the public accounts of the State. A software system has been developed
to record this inventory of public assets, and the Government has provided training to all ministries on
this new software. Furthermore, the authorities have prepared a manual of operations for the




                                                   23
management of assets.19 Both the inventory and the manual of operations are important elements in
designing a more effective public management system by creating a centralized database of public
assets, and improving the procedures for monitoring, controlling, and replenishing public assets.
Existing problems of inadequate use of public assets are expected to be reduced, thereby improving
the accountability of the public sector. Given the technical complexity associated with managing
assets, the development of this manual of operations is a key step in improving the management of
public assets, and will also contribute to the preparation of public accounting statistics. In the medium-
term, the Government also plans to complete an inventory of mobile public assets for all autonomous
agencies, including the National Assembly, the Presidency, and the Supreme Court.

Prior action 4: The Recipient’s Ministry of Finance and International Cooperation has: (a) carried out
and completed the inventory of existing mobile public assets for at least 90 out of the existing 120
ministerial entities that have mobile assets; (b) published this inventory in its public portal; and (c)
completed and approved a manual of operations to manage the Recipient’s mobile public assets.

Improving the Performance of Public Enterprises

83.      Public enterprises suffer from a lack of accountability, and their performance penalizes
the private sector and puts at risk fiscal sustainability. In addition to taking measures to prevent
the recurrence of overruns and arrears emerging from public enterprises (see paragraphs 23 and 26),
the Government is embarked on a reform program to strengthen internal controls, and provide a legal
framework for performance-based assessments of results. In 2008, the Inspecção Geral de Finanças
(IGF) carried out a diagnostics study of the financial status of the four fully owned state enterprises as
of December 31, 2007. In addition, the Government has recently conducted analytical work in some
SOEs (notably water and energy, and airport services) to assess their financial problems and possible
remedies. However, supervision of public enterprises, now governed by an outdated 1978 Law,
suffers from several problems including weak controls mechanism, both internally and externally.
Furthermore, the existing legislation does not appropriately cover SOEs that formally fall under
the financial supervision of the Treasury that, in practice, has no capacity for this task.

84.       With support from this operation, the Government aims to strengthen its legislation
governing public enterprises, and to set clear managerial structures for better administrative and
financial controls of public enterprises. With support from this operation, the Government has drafted
a new law that would update the 1978 Law, setting forth procedures and managerial structures
concerning the internal organization of public enterprises, financial monitoring and controls, financing
of public enterprises, and private-sector participation. This legislation provides a framework for
conducting results-based performance assessments of public enterprises, and for remunerating the
executives in these public enterprises through performance bonuses. Performance assessments would
depend on an evaluation by the Ministry in charge of the sector, which will be based on the degree of
responsibility of staff, the characteristics of the institution, and the financial performance of the
institution. The use of bonuses aims to provide incentives to managers to improve the financial
performance of public enterprises. In the medium-term, the Government plans to carry out a
diagnostics study of the financial practices of SOEs. This activity will involve the Ministry of Finance
and International Cooperation and line ministries in charge of the sector.

Prior action 5: The Recipient's Council of Ministers has submitted to the Presidency a decree
regulating performance-based assessments of public enterprises.

19
  This manual of operations guides the management of non-real state public assets by establishing procedures for: (i)
maintaining an updated database of non-real state public assets (including entry/exit and amortization principles); (ii)
conducting a financial monitoring of such assets; and (iii) preparing periodic reports for asset management.



                                                          24
Improving Payroll Management

85.      Weak budget controls in public service management hinder fiscal consolidation. The
payroll management has been strengthened, notably in 2009, when staff salaries started to be paid via
bank transfers. However, payroll management is undermined by lack of complete personnel records
and personnel database, and by the lack of reconciliation between distinct personnel information at the
MFIC and the Ministry of Public Administration (MoPA). This lack of centralized information on
Government employees coupled with a lack of rigorous checks may allow ―ghost/shadow workers‖ to
enter the payroll, leading to public sector inefficiency and over-spending.

86.      The Government is addressing weaknesses in payroll management to improve public
sector effectiveness. To address these challenges, the Government plans to complete a general
headcount of Government employees by May 2011. In the medium-term, the Government plans to set
up a system so that payroll records of Government employees are updated on a regular basis.
Specifically, the Government plans to integrate payroll registry into the SAFE-e system by December
2011. Furthermore, the authorities plan to update the civil service statute by December 2011 to better
align salary increases with productivity increases via performance evaluations. This would allow the
public service to attract and retain essential technical, professional and managerial staff, while
managing the performance of civil servants more effectively through a framework of planned
objectives and standards.

                        b.       Promoting Sustainable Economic Policies

87.      The policies supported in this DPO that aim to promote sustainable economic policies
address critical areas identified in the CEM and the DeMPA reports, including: (i) strengthening
fiscal policy management; and (ii) strengthening donor coordination.

Strengthening Fiscal Policy Management

88.      Fiscal policy management is the most critical area to ensuring the sustainability of the
STP’s economic policies. The lack of a clear fiscal policy framework has resulted in persistent
deficits and pro-cyclical economic policies, rising debt levels, and, over time, a loss in policy
credibility. To address these concerns, the Government has designed a set of measures to ensure that
fiscal policy contributes to overall macroeconomic stability. These measures aim to adopt a fiscal
responsibility framework to limit unsustainable deficit levels, strengthen the debt management system,
and align donor assistance around STP priorities.

89.      The Government plans to develop a Fiscal Responsibility Framework in line with
international best practices. The Government recognizes that current procedural and transparency
rules for fiscal management are insufficient to ensure the sustainability of fiscal policy in STP, in
particular given the recent establishment of a fixed exchange regime. Accordingly, the Government
aims to prepare a Fiscal Responsibility Framework to avoid pro-cyclicality in fiscal policy. In
particular, such a framework would make the budget process more hierarchical by providing
procedural rules to guarantee fiscal compliance and avoid misuse of political discretion in budgetary
allocation and execution. It would also provide provisions to limit or suspend the rule if special
circumstances happen (such as ―escape clauses‖ during exogenous shocks). A Fiscal Responsibility
Framework will, on the one hand, increase public sector accountability by setting medium term
commitments for fiscal deficit and public debt, and on the other hand, it will facilitate multi-annual
budgeting, thereby raising public expenditure effectiveness. To this end, the Ministry of Finance and
International Cooperation plans to seek authorization from the Council of Ministers to develop a


                                                  25
Fiscal Responsibility Framework and to launch this process. In the medium-term, the Government
expects to discuss this Fiscal Framework with civil society and STP’s development partners, and this
framework is expected to be adopted in 2012.

90.       An inadequate debt management system hinders debt sustainability. Successful
macroeconomic and structural reforms led STP to reach the Completion Point under the Enhanced
HIPC Initiative in 2007. However, the February 2011 Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA) points out
that STP’s risk of debt distress remains high and that substantial fiscal adjustment would be required
to ensure debt sustainability. The 2008 DeMPA finds that this high risk of debt distress is in part due
to the institutional environment governing debt management. Indeed, STP does not meet the
minimum DeMPA requirements for debt management in most categories, notably the legal
framework and the managerial structures. The borrowing mandate to the Government in the SAFE
legislation is not well formulated and allows contracting debt that is not adequately approved by the
MFIC. Furthermore, the regulation of loan guarantees is not clear or comprehensive, since it only
deals with guarantees to state-owned enterprises. Also, although debt management is formally under
control of the Debt Management Directorate, several other entities also manage debt.

91.       To address weaknesses in debt management, the authorities are strengthening the legal
framework for debt management, as well as building capacity in the Debt Management Directorate.
With support from this operation, the Government has submitted to the National Assembly a bill of
law that set clear managerial structures for debt-related transactions. This legislation provides a strong
borrowing mandate for contracting new public debt that can only be approved by the MFIC and
requires endorsement by the National Assembly. Furthermore, it provides clear managerial structures
for contracting public debt (by only allowing the MFIC to manage public debt decisions), as well as
regulations of loan guarantees for all public entities. The key objective for the medium-term is to
assure strict implementation of best transparency practices by publishing details of all public debt in
the Government’s website. The authorities will also prepare a Debt Strategy that will complement the
legislation by setting debt management objectives with specific concessionality targets, which is
expected to improve the predictability and the alignment of debt procedures with fiscal policy goals.

Prior action 6: The Recipient’s Council of Ministers has submitted to the National Assembly a bill of
law that regulates Public Debt Management specifying the processes and procedures for contracting
new public debt.

Strengthening Donor Coordination

92.      Despite heavily reliance on official development assistance (ODA), STP has a weak
donor coordination system that reduces aid effectiveness and hinders fiscal sustainability. Even
though over 80 percent of the Government’s public investment (PIP) is supported by donors, there is
no formal consultative mechanism that coordinates donor assistance around government priorities and
strategy. Sector-wide approaches and direct budget support are seldom used and parallel mechanisms
for implementing donor assistance (rather than through Government institutions) are common. As a
result, the Government has limited information and control over ODA, which hinders budget
preparation, undermines government accountability, weaken project sustainability and overall reduces
public sector efficiency and the overall impact of ODA. Furthermore, it undermines fiscal
sustainability as recurrent expenditures of donor projects are not adequately planned for. It is also
worth mentioning that in the past five years there has been a considerable shift from the share of
Treasury-financed capital investments, relative to total capital expenditures, towards a reliance on
donor-financed capital investments (see Table 1). This shift in the type of financing for capital
investments calls for stronger coordination with donors. Importantly, the current lack of access to



                                                   26
reliable and standardized donor assistance information inhibits basic coordination and planning. This
is a weakness for the development of a medium-term budgetary framework.

93.      The new Government aims to adopt a new cooperation framework to strengthen donor
coordination and raise aid effectiveness. The Government has reorganized its structure to add the
cooperation competences to the Ministry of Finance, which became the Ministry of Finance and
International Cooperation in 2010. Also, with assistance from the United Nations, it has started to
create three thematic groups to strengthen donor coordination (namely governance, access to basic
services, and infrastructure and food security) to address STP’s development challenges. The
Government has also prepared a draft Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to harmonize donor
assistance around STP’s strategy. This MoU is expected to foster exchange of information around the
government strategy, creating guiding principles that support (rather than substitute for or duplicate
the functions of) Government ministries and agencies. This MoU represents a structural change in
how the Government approaches aid coordination, by allowing periodical exchange of information
through a formal consultative mechanism, fostering debate, and improving medium-term expenditure
planning. In the medium-term, the Governments plans to update the MoU based on donor comments,
and to request donors to review and sign the MoU, which is expected by 2012. Furthermore, the
Government plans to create a single database of external assistance to ensure that donor-financed
projects are adequately registered (e.g., planned results, actual results, commitments, disbursement,
and where possible, pipeline projects and expenditures). These measures will complement the
preparation of the new PRSP.

Prior action 7: The Recipient’s Ministry of Finance and International Cooperation: (a) created a
Directorate of International Cooperation; and (b) submitted to the donor community a first draft of a
Memorandum of Understanding to strengthen aid coordination specifying procedures to: (i) determine
which Recipient’s institution shall be responsible for managing donor meetings and aid information;
(ii) schedule donor meetings; and (iii) report and share information on foreign aid.

94.     The full program supported by the proposed PRMG operation is set out in the Policy
Matrix (Annex 3) and prior actions are summarized in Box 2. The prior actions listed below
support the Government in its effort to implement its reform program, following assurances that it is
committed to carry on with its implementation. During implementation, the Government will need to
maintain satisfactory macroeconomic performance.

                                   A.         POVERTY AND S OCIAL I MPACT

95.     Limited poverty information available. There is a relative paucity of data on poverty with
the most recent household survey dating back to 2001, which hinders the Government in its strategy to
fight poverty. Although administrative indicators (education and health) suggest that poverty is
decreasing, according to the World Food Program, the 2008 economic downturn has led to an
increased the number of vulnerable people (those for whom food is insufficient or at the limit) from 23
percent of the population before the crisis to around 35 percent in 2008. This operation will support
the National Statistics Office in finalizing a household survey that will update the poverty profile in
2011. This new information will help the government to better target pro-poor expenditures and
estimate the impact of key reforms on poverty.




20
  The Government has agreed upon and implemented these prior actions before the presentation of the operation to the Bank’s
Board of Executive Directors.



                                                           28
96.      The actions supported by this Grant are expected to have positive poverty and social
impacts. Notably, supported by this operation, the budget allocation for pro-poor expenditures has
increased relative to previous years. Also, as spelled out in the PRSP, weak public financial
management systems and poor governance are perceived to be critical causes of poverty. Joint World
Bank and IMF staff assessments of STP’s PRSP have emphasized the need for the poverty strategy to
be more explicit on key priorities and budgetary allocations. Indeed, weak Public Financial
Management (PFM) has led to inefficiency, limited control and loss of impact of limited public
resources. To achieve faster poverty reduction, the PRMG program will provide US$4.2 million to
help implement the Government’s economic reform program. First, PFM reforms will help ensure that
domestic and external resources are used effectively and more transparently, and that the budget can
be used as a tool for poverty reduction by improving the accountability system and enhancing the
external oversight of public resources. Second, the revision of the PRSP will update the poverty
reduction goals in line with the new macroeconomic framework and will foster a growth strategy that
benefits the poor through more employment and increasing income.

                                B.      E NVIRONMENTAL A SPECTS

97.      Policy actions supported by the PRMG Grant are not likely to have significant positive
or negative effects on the environment, forests, or other natural resources. The conclusion of an
environmental screening of the proposed reforms, undertaken as per the requirements of OP 8.60, is
that the reforms are not likely to be significant from an environmental point of view. The policies
supported under this Grant address primarily institutional reforms. The focus of the reforms is on
transparency and accountability or public resources, on the efficiency of public expenditures, and on
promoting good governance. If environmental impacts arise, they are expected to be beneficial for
STP. Strengthening public resource management and promoting sustainable economic policies is
expected to lead to more efficient use of public resources, which may indirectly generate
environmental benefits by encouraging the adoption of modern technologies which use resources
more efficiently than those they replace. Similarly, improving the performance of public enterprises is
expected to result in lower subsidies to public enterprises such as the electricity and water utilities,
which will in turn force the utilities to raise prices to reflect costs of services and to operate more
efficiently.

                  C.      IMPLEMENTATION, M ONITORING A ND E VALUATION

98.      Implementation entity. The Ministry of Finance and International Cooperation (MFIC) will
be responsible for overall implementation of PRMG as well as for reporting progress and coordinating
actions among other concerned ministries and agencies. The MFIC has experience in coordinating and
implementing DPO programs as evidenced by the successful implementation of the PNRMD DPO.

99.      Need to improve the monitoring and evaluation (M&E) system of the country. STP has
an inadequate system for monitoring and evaluating the implementation of the PRSP with limited
administrative and technical capacity and insufficient coordination between stakeholders, such us the
PRSP Unit, the Directorate of Planning, and the National Statistical Institute (INE). Furthermore, it
does not have adequate data on poverty indicators. The operation will also strengthen the M&E
system to better monitor PRSP implementation and will emphasize stronger donor coordination
aligned to the PRSP.

100.     Program Monitoring. Following the previous success with the PNRMD DPO, the review of
the program objectives will be based on relevant and easy-to-monitor indicators. A half-year review of
the program will be carried out. Most of the policy areas of the proposed operation have benefited in
the past from the monitoring system in place under the CBTA and PNRMD. In addition, the proposed


                                                  29
operation will benefit from the monitoring system of the ongoing IMF ECF, notably on the
macroeconomic performance. An Implementation Completion and Results Report will be issued
within six months following the closing date of the operation.

                                   D.        FIDUCIARY A SPECTS

101.     The Government is strengthening its fiduciary management. Public financial
management and fiduciary issues are covered as part of the operation in Section V, Raising the
Transparency and Accountability of Public Resources. There are also solid analytical underpinnings to
this operation, including a 2007 PEMFAR. STP’s fiduciary framework is adequate overall to receive
the proceeds of the grant. Government’s commitment to PFM reforms is exemplified by actions
already taken, particularly in light of the implementation of the PFM reform program already
underway which the Government is committed to continuing with support from this operation. STP’s
fiduciary framework, together with the Government's commitment to reforms, is adequate overall to
support this operation.

102.     The IMF has prepared a safeguards report and considered the adequacy of the Central
Bank’s financial management practices as well as the foreign exchange environment. Under the
IMF’s safeguards assessment policy, the Central Bank of São Tomé and Príncipe was subject to a full
safeguards assessment with respect to the PRGF arrangement approved in on August 1, 2005. The
assessment, which was completed on August 2, 2004, found vulnerabilities in the area of financial
reporting, internal audit and internal control. Measures to strengthen the control framework and help
safeguard Fund resources were agreed with the authorities. Some recommendations have been
implemented, including contracting annual external audits, endorsing plans to modernize the Central
Bank’s internal audit function, and adopting International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as the
bank’s accounting framework. Although slow progress has been realized in the implementation of
IFRS, recent annual audited financial statements have been made public, and the implementation of
these recommendations is being monitored by IMF staff.

                                        E.     D ISBURSEMENT

103.     A single-tranche of SDR 2.7 million (US$4.2 million equivalent) will be disbursed upon
grant effectiveness and following the Recipient’s request for withdrawal of proceeds of the
grant. The grant will follow the Bank’s standard disbursement procedures for development policy
operations. The grant will be disbursed against satisfactory implementation of the DPO program, the
appropriateness of the country’s macroeconomic policy framework. Once the operation is approved
by the Board and becomes effective, and following the Recipient’s request for withdrawal of proceeds
of the grant, the Bank will disburse the proceeds of the grant to a foreign currency account maintained
at the Central Bank of São Tomé and Príncipe and forming part of the official reserves of São Tomé
and Príncipe. The Recipient shall provide confirmation to the Bank that upon deposit of the grant into
said account, an amount equivalent to the grant proceeds from the Bank has been credited in the
Recipient’s budget management system, with an indication of the exchange rate applied, where
applicable. The conversion from the foreign currency to the local currency will be based on the
prevailing exchange rate on the date that the funds are credited to the budget management system.
The Central Bank of STP will not impose any charges or commissions on the Recipient for these
transactions.

104.     If the proceeds of the grant are used for ineligible purposes as defined in the Financing
Agreement, IDA will require the Recipient to, promptly upon notice from IDA, refund an amount
equal to the amount of said payment to IDA. Amounts refunded to the Bank upon such request shall



                                                  30
be cancelled. The administration of this grant will be the responsibility of the Ministry of Finance and
International Cooperation.

                               F.       R ISKS AND R ISK MITIGATION

105.    The PRMG DPO has significant country, macroeconomic and institutional capacity risks, all
of which reflect STP’s economic vulnerability and low limited institutional capacity.

106.     The first risk will be the maintenance of a stable macroeconomic environment should
the expected external assistance does not materialize or the global recession continues.
Increasing international oil and food prices and shortfalls in donor support and FDI associated with the
global economic slowdown could have a deterring impact on economic growth, reduce government
resources, and affect its ability to conduct its reform program. The Government is committed to
keeping macroeconomic stability and to continue implementation of the ECF program signed with the
IMF. A shortcoming of the new fixed exchange rate regime is that the Government would not be able
to use monetary policy to address exogenous shocks. In this context, the Government is aware that
fiscal adjustment through additional expenditure restrains, and the acceleration of reforms aimed at
improving revenue management, would be necessary o mitigate this risk. As part of this operation, the
Government will develop a fiscal responsibility framework and a Public Debt Management Law that
specifies the processes and procedures for contracting new debt. Both reforms, in addition to the
existence of the National Oil Account which limits the share of future oil receipts that can be spent,
shows the strong level of commitment of the new Government to achieve economic stability. This
commitment will continue to be supported and monitored by the IMF and the Bank.

107.      The second risk is weak institutional capacity. Capacity constraints in the public sector
could delay implementation of the reform program. Despite significant improvement in term of
capacity building in the MFIC and the Ministry of Planning and Development, major constraints to
the implementation of reforms remain. Following the findings from the institutional capacity
assessment (presented in Annex 8), this risk is further mitigated by (i) sustaining reforms that have
started generating stronger capacity in public financial management and governance; (ii) concentrating
on a limited number of policy areas; (iii) completing a institutional capacity assessment that highlights
the main constraints; (iv) focusing on strengthening donor harmonization to reduce the number of
activities to be implemented by the Government and better target donor assistance; (v) and agreeing
with the government on critical technical assistance required to overcome the weaknesses identified in
the institutional capacity assessment, to be financed with domestic resources.

108.     The third risk is political. A long period of regional and legislative elections has culminated
in a smooth change of leadership, but the Government does not possess a majority in the National
Assembly which could lead to political stalemate and difficulties to maintain a stable macroeconomic
environment, notably before presidential elections take place in 2011. This risk is partially mitigated
by the strong commitment and the broad consensus among the major political parties on the need to
advance economic reforms and maintain macroeconomic stability, as proved by the important laws
that have already been passed in the past despite the Government not having an absolute majority in
the National Assembly.

109.      The fourth risk is fiduciary. Despite the Government’s continued efforts to reinforce public
finance management, some fiduciary risks concerning the use of public funds remain as internal and
external control mechanisms are weak. Following the lessons learnt from the previous PNRMD Grant,
this DPO aims to improve accountability and strengthen control mechanisms. Indeed, this risk is
further mitigated by improving fiduciary standards and notably by producing public accounting
statistics as a prelude for the preparation of the public accounts of the State. These are central


                                                   31
objectives of the Government’s program, which builds on PFM reforms already in course to improve
financial control, including stronger procurement practices. This PRMG program will continue to
sustain improvement in budget implementation and fiscal reporting.

110.     Overall, the project’s risks are also being mitigated by the degree of the government
ownership of the proposed measures, and its commitment to advance its reform agenda, in particular
public finance management, as well as by an active and supportive policy dialogue with Bank and
IMF staff. In addition, various donors are providing technical assistance to improve capacity-building
and ensure full implementation of reforms in the public financial management area.

President of the World Bank Group
1818 H Street, NW
WASHINGTON D.C. 20433
USA


Mr. President,

         1.      On behalf of the Government of the Democratic Republic of São Tomé and Príncipe,
I have the pleasure of submitting to you the policy document of the Public Resource Management and
Governance Reform Development Policy Grant of US$4.2 million. This development policy grant
will support São Tomé and Príncipe in its ongoing reform program and to assist in sustaining our
achievements so far.

       2.      São Tomé and Príncipe (STP) is in need of this support to continue the
implementation of its economic and social reform program that is based on the 2010-2014
Government Program and on our Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP).

         3.       This operation will also support us in our efforts to finalize a new Poverty Reduction
Strategy Paper (PRSP). The policies and reforms of the new PRSP will be formulated in a
participatory manner and we aim to incorporate a new growth diversification strategy. We will also
frame it on an update macroeconomic framework that will take into account the most recent
developments and prospects in the petroleum sector. The PRSP will focus on the need to raise the
level of economic growth and employment creation. In particular, our authorities are committed to
strengthen the reform agenda focusing on removing bottlenecks to growth, particularly in energy,
infrastructure, and private sector development. We are finalizing a Household Survey that will inform
the new PRSP, and we will complete this survey and update the poverty profile by August 2011.
Updating the poverty profile will help us to establish a close link between the objectives of the PRSP
and the Millennium Development Goals, thereby strengthening the monitoring and assessment
mechanisms of our development strategy. A draft results-oriented PRSP will be completed by October
2011.

        4.      This Grant will contribute towards advancing two key areas of STP’s economy: (i)
improving public resource management through greater transparency and accountability of public
expenditures; and (ii) promoting sustainable economic policies by strengthening the fiscal policy
framework and the donor coordination framework.

    A. SÃO TOMÉ AND PRÍNCIPE’S REFORM PROGRAM

Overview

         5.       Our Government has been implementing policy measures in line with the objectives
of set forth in the PRSP, and has achieved important results. Since 2005, structural reforms have


                                                  33
included policies aimed at pursuing prudent fiscal and monetary policies, improve the efficiency of
public spending, and build institutional capacities particularly in the petroleum sector. Our authorities
liberalized the economy by encouraging trade and by privatizing a number of public enterprises.
Moreover, new strategies in health and education have strengthened human capital. With the support
from International Financial Institutions, STP was able to swiftly attain the HIPC Initiative’s
Completion Point in 2007. These reforms also led to a rise in investor confidence and an increase in
economic activity in the services sector, particularly tourism.

         6.      Notwithstanding the hardships of the current external environment, macroeconomic
discipline has been in line with the objectives agreed under the IMF’s Extended Credit Facility (ECF)
program that we have been implementing since 2009. Thanks to the successful implementation of
reforms, STP has reduced its annual domestic primary fiscal deficit significantly, bringing it down
from 10.7 percent of GDP in 2006 to an estimated 5.7 percent of GDP in 2010. Our Government plans
to reduce the annual domestic primary fiscal deficit further to 4 percent of GDP in 2011 and to 3
percent by 2013. We have also seen a drastic improvement in other key economic indicators. In
particular, annual inflation has been reduced from a peak of 37 percent in 2008 to an estimated 9.5
percent at end-2010.

         7.      Our authorities are committed to continue to strengthen macroeconomic performance
in order to safeguard international reserves and the exchange rate peg. The funds made available by
your institution will provide necessary financing to support key public expenditures in 2011. The
budget targets and priorities for this year have been agreed with the IMF as part of the triennial
program supported by the ECF, and with the World Bank. Importantly, our Government has increased
the share of pro-poor expenditures in our budget from an average of 30 percent between 2008 and
2010 to over 37 percent in 2011.

         8.        This operation will also enable us to consolidate the reforms in public finance
management that were supported by the World Bank’s 2004-2010 Technical Assistance Capacity
Building Project. In September 2010, the National Assembly approved the 2010-2014 Government
Program which supports reforms that aim to develop the institutions and capacities to fully implement
the Organic Law for Public Finance Management (SAFE Law) that was approved in 2007,
particularly in relation to raising the transparency and accountability of the budget, and improving the
management of public accounts and assets. In addition, this operation would support us to promote
stronger fiscal policy management and improved donor coordination.

         9.       Our reforms up to now have achieved broad based support. As we forge ahead with
the program, we continue to carefully consult with our partners in civil society, the opposition, and the
private sector in order to ensure that the people of São Tomé and Príncipe have a sound understanding
of the rationale of the structural reforms and their benefits.

Macroeconomic and Budgetary Framework

         10.     Overall, despite the occurrence of exogenous shocks, STP has maintained a stable
macroeconomic framework in close coordination with our development partners. Prudent
macroeconomic policies followed by structural reforms made it possible to establish the conditions for
a sustainable economic recovery. Annual average real GDP growth exceeded 6 percent between 2000
and 2008, which and led to a sustainable improvement in income per capita for the first time since
independence.

       11.       However, two external shocks in 2008 and 2009 caused a reversal of the rising trend
underway. First, there was the increase in international food and fuel prices. Soon afterwards, a global


                                                   34
financial crisis erupted and a deep global recession followed it. These shocks resulted in a slowdown
in economic activity, which shows the fragility of the gains obtained during previous years and the
need to continue working with our partners to build up the resilience of the economy. In response to
the crisis, our authorities sought external assistance to increase externally-financed public investment
projects, which boosted economic activity, and continued to accelerate structural reforms. As a result,
economic growth picked up slightly from 4 percent in 2009 to an estimated 4.5 percent in 2010. In
January 2010, we pegged the exchange rate to the Euro and we have maintained a stable exchange
rate (anchored at around 24,500 Dobra per Euro) even in the context of the Euro Zone sovereign
crisis.

         12.      These achievements notwithstanding, São Tomé and Príncipe’s economy remains
vulnerable due to its high level of debt relative to exports, dependence on foreign aid, and the
relatively narrow export base. Our medium-term macroeconomic outlook shows a rebound in
economic activity, subject to global economic uncertainties. Growth is expected to rise to 5 percent in
2011, and to 6 percent in 2012 and 2013. Annual inflation is expected to continue on its downward
trend and to reach 5 percent by end-2012. We also expect to reduce the domestic primary deficit to 3
percent by 2013, while preserving pro-poor expenditures in the social sectors. Risks to our medium-
term outlook include exogenous shocks that may impact terms of trade and tourism and disrupt
external financing from foreign investors or development partners. The focused implementation of our
program will enhance our country's attractiveness to investors and foster the development and
diversification of production and exports, thus reducing our vulnerability.


    B. PROGRAM ADOPTED IN THE CONTEXT OF BUDGET SUPPORT

         13.      The policy actions summarized below support key components of the 2010-2014
Government Program, and aim to consolidate the implementation of our reform agenda. They focus
primarily on improving the transparency and accountability of public expenditures and on promoting
sustainable economic policies. These areas are important to realize overarching objectives, that is,
economic growth and poverty reduction as well as governance and institutional enhancements. As
previously mentioned, reforms in these two areas, launched several years ago, have already
demonstrated positive impacts on economic growth in STP. We plan to continue making progress in
these areas over the next few years.

Transparency and Accountability of Public Expenditures

         14.     We have increased the transparency and accountability of budget preparation. In
November 2010, we published in its public portal the 2011 budget proposal that was submitted to the
National Assembly for approval to promote an informed public debate on how public expenditures are
allocated. To further increase the transparency and accountability of the budget, we published the
approved 2011 Budget Law in March 2011, and will also publish the Quarterly Budget
Implementation Reports for 2011. The first Quarterly Budget Report for 2011 will be published by
April 15, 2011.

          15.       We have enhanced the monitoring system for poverty reduction. In 2008, supported
by a World Bank operation, we created budget expenditure items that correspond to poverty reduction
priorities (i.e., pro-poor budget codes). To increase the accountability of the budget and to better align
public expenditures to our strategy, we have specified the allocation for all pro-poor expenditures in
the 2011 budget. Our authorities’ goal is to clearly identify intended beneficiaries of public
expenditures, and to monitor specific expenditure allocations aimed at promoting pro-poor growth. In
this regard, our budget now includes a historical record of pro-poor expenditures for all pro-poor


                                                   35
budget categories (the 2011 budget shows pro-poor expenditures from 2007 to 2011). Our Quarterly
Budget Implementation Reports will also specify pro-poor expenditures. In line with our authorities’
commitment to tackle poverty, the share of pro-poor expenditures in the 2011 budget proposal
represents over 37 percent of total expenditures, a notable increase with respect to the average of 30
percent for the period between 2008 and 2010. By end-2011, our Government commits to execute at
least 90 percent of pro-poor expenditures.

         16.     Our Government aims to improve the management of public accounts and assets in
preparation for the production of annual financial statements. We have been working on this reform
for several years. Progress has been achieved with the creation of public accounting institutions and
the adoption of key legislation governing public financial management. Our country still lacks annual
financial statements, but we are taking steps to produce these financial accounts at the soonest. The
Ministry of Finance and International Cooperation has been developing a Computerized Integrated
Financial Management Information System (SAFE-e). The SAFE-e will allow budget execution, and
the production of financial accounts. The development of the SAFE-e was delayed due to technical
complexities, but a pilot version of this system has been completed and it is currently being tested.

         17.     Since January 2011, the Public Accounting Directorate has been operational, with a
dedicated budget and an equipped office space. Our Government has appointed a Director of Public
Accounting as well as two Department Heads and technical staff. Training in public accounting is
currently being provided for the staff at the Public Accounting Directorate. Moreover, a public
accounting manual that sets out the accounting principles and procedures to produce the annual
financial statements according to Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) is being
prepared. This manual will be completed and adopted by August 2011. By December 2011, our
Government will produce monthly public accounting statistics (up to September 2011) and will
harmonize these statistics with those of the Central Bank. Going forward, by July 2012 our
Government will finalize the preparation of the annual pilot financial accounts for 2011. Starting in
2013, our Government will undertake yearly audits of the financial accounts to ensure that all
budgetary, financial, and asset operations are recorded in a reliable and consistent manner.

         18.     We are also improving the management of assets. We carried out an inventory of
existing mobile public assets in all ministries and we have published this inventory in our
Government’s public portal to promote an informed public debate on this issue. Formal guidelines on
how to manage non-real estate public assets have been prepared. A software system has been
developed to record this inventory of public assets, and we aim to integrate this software to the SAFE-
e system. The Ministry of Finance and International Cooperation will create a single database with
centralized information on non-real public assets per Ministry by December 2011. These policy
actions represent important steps for improving the monitoring, controlling, and replenishing of public
assets. Future actions include the completion an inventory of non-real state public assets for all
autonomous agencies, including the National Assembly, the Presidency, and the Supreme Court,
which is expected to be completed by May 2011. This information will be critical in the production of
public accounting statistics.

         19.     Realizing fiscal consolidation will also depend on strengthening public enterprises
which currently suffer from weak finances. In this regard, our Government has drafted a bill of law
regulating performance-based assessments of public enterprises and submitted it to the Presidency for
approval. This law sets clear managerial structures for better administrative and financial controls of
public enterprises. Going forward, our Ministry of Finance and International Cooperation will
complete a diagnosis study of the financial practices of State-Owned Enterprises by October 2011.
This diagnosis will inform an evaluation of the implementation of the Public Enterprise legislation,
which we will undertake in 2012.


                                                  36
         20.     We are also committed to addressing weaknesses in payroll management and will
complete a general headcount of Government employees by May 2011. Future actions to improve the
payroll management include the integration of payroll registry into the SAFE-e system, which is
expected to be completed by September 2011. Our Government will also update the civil service
statute to better align salary increases with productivity increases by proposing performance
evaluations. A draft of this new civil service statute is expected to be finalized by December 2011.

Promotion of Sustainable Economic Policies

         21.     Our Government will develop a Fiscal Responsibility Framework in line with
international best practices to avoid pro-cyclicality in fiscal policy. This framework would set
medium-term commitments for fiscal deficit and public debt, thereby facilitating multi-annual
budgeting and raising public expenditure effectiveness. Our Ministry of Finance and International
Cooperation will prepare a draft Fiscal Responsibility Framework by October 2011, and it expects to
present this draft to key stakeholders including labor unions, NGOs, employer associations, and
donors by November 2011.

         22.     Our Government is fully aware of the importance of ensuring debt sustainability after
HIPC and MDRI debt relief. In this context, we continue to build capacity in the Debt Management
Directorate. Our authorities have submitted to the National Assembly, for approval, a Debt
Management Law. This law will clarify the institutional responsibilities for public debt management,
including by specifying that the borrowing mandate exists solely with the ministry in charge of public
finances, with oversight by the National Assembly. Starting in November 2011, our Government will
begin publishing the details of all public debt in its public portal. Our Government will also prepare a
Debt Strategy, including an action plan to further strengthen debt management, by October 2011. We
are confident that these policy actions will improve the predictability and the alignment of debt
procedures with fiscal policy goals.

        23.       Our Government is aware that realizing fiscal consolidation would also depend on
resolving structural problems with the state-owned utility company (i.e., the water and electricity
company EMAE). In this regard, our Government will prepare an action plan to improve governance
and supervision capacity in the utility sector by September 2011, in addition to proposing an
appropriate tariff structure in early-2012 that would allow EMAE to recover its operational costs.

         24.      Concerning donor coordination, our Government has changed its managerial
structures by assigning donor coordination functions to the new Ministry of Finance and International
Cooperation. A Directorate of International Cooperation, now part of the Ministry of Finance and
International Cooperation, has prepared a draft ―Memorandum of Understanding‖ and will discuss this
Memorandum at a donor meeting scheduled on April 8, 2011. Our aim is to raise aid effectiveness and
to foster exchange of information with donors around our development strategy. Going forward, our
Ministry of Finance and International Cooperation will create a single database of external assistance
and will organize annual donor roundtables. This database on external aid will be launched by
September 2011. Furthermore, our Government will present its 2012 budget proposal at a donor
roundtable which will be scheduled in October 2011.

Implementation of the Program

         25.     The monitoring of the program will be performed by our Ministry of Finance and
International Cooperation, namely the Budget Directorate, which will be assisted by the various
technical Directorates such as Public Accounting, Treasury, Assets, International Cooperation, etc.


                                                  37
Assistance will also be provided by our Ministry of Planning and Development, Ministry of Public
Administration, our PRSP Unit, and our National Statistics Institute. The abovementioned bodies have
participated in the management of the preceding programs, including the two previous programs
supported by World Bank, and the two programs supported by the IMF. Our Ministry of Finance and
International Cooperation will also coordinate with donors that provide financial support to São Tomé
and Príncipe to ensure the successful implementation of its reform program. Our Ministry of Finance
and International Cooperation will be responsible for the monitoring of the bodies involved in the
program, and will produce two progress reports that will be transmitted to the World Bank. These
reports will inform about the reform progress in the areas supported by the budget support operation.
The first progress report will be submitted to the World Bank in September 2011, and the second
report will be submitted in December 2011.


    C. CONCLUSION

         26.     Our program of public resource management and governance reform will consolidate
progress already achieved, and ensure improvements in transparency and accountability of public
expenditures. We expect to see notable improvements in the management of public finances in the
budget and accounting sphere, but also considering the supervision exercised by domestic and
international agents over the execution of the State budget. In addition, our reform program will
promote sustainable economic policies by strengthening fiscal policy management and donor
coordination. All of this would be particularly important given the uncertainties in the international
environment. Furthermore, we attach particular importance to the preparation of a new PRSP that will
guide our strategy in the coming years and provide the elements for pro-poor growth.

         27.     The Government of the Democratic Republic of São Tomé and Príncipe is hereby
seizing this opportunity to reiterate its strong commitment to undertaking necessary reforms actions to
promote economic growth and modernize our country. Our Government is convinced that the efficient
and satisfactory execution of its reform program will contribute towards boosting the national
economy onto a healthy and sustainable basis in view of poverty reduction. In this context, the support
of The World Bank would be important to successful implementation of STP’s continued reform
agenda. In light of the macroeconomic reforms already carried out, the fixed objectives in this
program, and the results achieved during the previous years, which are very encouraging, our
Government requests the favorable consideration of its financing request aimed at the approval of the
Public Resource Management and Governance Reform Development Policy Grant of approximately
US$4.2 million and the provision of significant budgetary support for financing our economy.

                         Statement at the Conclusion of an IMF Mission to the
                            Democratic Republic of São Tomé and Príncipe

IMF Press Release No. 10/429
November 12, 2010

A team from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) visited São Tomé and Príncipe (STP) during
October 29 - November 11, 2010 to continue discussions initiated in May on the 2010 Article IV
Consultation1 22 and to conduct the second and third reviews of the economic program supported by
the IMF under the Extended Credit Facility (ECF) arrangement. 23 The mission met Honorable Prime
Minister Patrice Trovoada, and held discussions with Minister of Finance and International
Cooperation Américo d’Oliveira dos Ramos, Minister of Planning and Development Agostinho dos
Santos Fernandes, Central Bank of São Tomé and Príncipe (BCSTP) Governor Luis de Sousa, other
senior officials of the government and the BCSTP, members of the Economic and Finance Committee
of the National Assembly, and representatives of commercial banks, the business community, and São
Tomé and Príncipe’s development partners.

At the conclusion of the visit, Mr. Tsidi Tsikata, Mission Chief for São Tomé and Príncipe, issued the
following statement in São Tomé:

―The new government that took office after the elections in August 2010 discussed its vision for the
country with the mission and indicated its endorsement of the objectives of São Tomé and Príncipe’s
program supported under the ECF arrangement. The government underscored the importance of a
stable macroeconomic environment for promoting growth and reducing poverty.
―Economic growth has picked up slightly in 2010 after a marked slowdown from 6 percent in 2008 to
4 percent in 2009. The slowdown was driven by a decline in foreign direct investment (FDI)—partly
reflecting the impact of the global financial and economic crisis. Although FDI declined further in
2010, an increase in externally-financed public investment projects boosted economic activity. The
annual rate of inflation has trended down from a peak of 37 percent in July 2008 to 13 percent in
September 2010. The exchange rate peg introduced in January has functioned smoothly and should
help lower inflation further.

―The government and the IMF team discussed measures to strengthen fiscal performance in order to
safeguard international reserves and the exchange rate peg. Measures to lower the fiscal deficit in
2011 will build on recent efforts of the revenue departments to expand the register of taxpayers,
enhance the enforcement of tax laws, and improve customs administration. On the expenditure side,

   Under Article IV of the IMF’s Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members. A staff team visits the
country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials the country’s economic developments and
policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board. At the
conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors,
and a summary is transmitted to the country’s authorities.
23
   The Extended Credit Facility (ECF) has replaced the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) as the IMF’s main tool
for medium-term financial support to low-income countries. It provides for a higher level of access to financing, more
concessional terms, enhanced flexibility in program design, and more focused, streamlined conditionality. Financing under ECF
currently carries a zero interest rate, with a grace period of 5 ½ years, and a final maturity of 10 years. The IMF reviews the level
of interest rates for all concessional facilities every two years.



                                                              55
the government will better prioritize spending—especially on goods and services and transfers—in
order to keep total expenditure within available resources.

―The mission urged the government to address the recurring problem of arrears accumulation between
the Treasury, the water and electricity corporation (EMAE) and the petroleum importing company
(ENCO). This should be done by more realistic budgeting for government utility payments, tackling
the structural problems underlying EMAE’s weak financial position (e.g., large losses in the
generation and transmission of power, and a tariff structure that yields revenues that do not cover
costs), and allowing retail prices of petroleum products to move in line with international prices.

―The mission welcomed recent measures taken by the central bank to improve the health of the
banking system, including enforcing an increase in the minimum capital requirement and intervening
in a troubled bank. In order to maintain the stability of the banking system, the mission urged the
central bank to ensure that its capacity to supervise banks keeps pace with the expansion of the sector.

―Notwithstanding the substantial debt relief it has received from its bilateral and multilateral partners,
STP remains at high risk of falling back into debt distress because of its limited export and production
base. The IMF mission welcomed the government’s commitment to avoid commercial borrowing and
instead rely on external grants and highly concessional loans to finance development programs.

―Most of the program targets for 2009 and the first half of 2010 were met, with the exception of the
performance criteria on the domestic primary deficit. The mission and the authorities reached
understandings, ad referendum, on measures to strengthen performance under the program. IMF
Board consideration of the reviews could take place in January 2011.‖

                   Annex 6: Progress towards the MDGs in São Tomé and Príncipe

In general, STP lacks appropriate and reliable social indicators and sector data. 24 The latest population
census and household survey took place in 2001 although, as part of the implementation of the PRSP
adopted in 2003, the Government, with technical assistance from the World Bank, undertook a CWIQ
Survey in 2005 to update some social indicators. In addition, the first Demographic and Health
Survey, and a new household survey were launched in 2008 and 2009, respectively but results are not
available yet.

STP is classified as a least developed countries but it is ranked among the middle Human
development countries. While there has already been considerable progress toward the MDGs, the
country will not be able to reach many of these targets. Poverty incidence currently stands at about 54
percent, and although the indicator still needs to be updated, anecdotal evidence suggest that it will
difficult to reach the MDG target of 20.5 percent poverty incidence in 2015.

The country appears on track to achieve the universal access to primary education MDG target. 97
percent of school-age children were enrolled in primary schools in 2001, considerable progress from a
ratio of 85 percent in 1985. This achievement has raised literacy rates from about 73 percent in 1990
to 83 percent in 2005, and expected to reach about 90 percent by 2015.

The country also hopes to achieve the reduction in infant mortality rate MDG target of 64 deaths per
1,000 live births. Although the infant mortality rate (currently at 75 percent) is expected to decline
progressively, it will remain far above the MDG target of 20.3 deaths per thousand live births in 2015.

Gender equality is emphasized in the Constitution and reiterated across the various laws and
legislation although women participation in the labor market is lower than man and suffer higher
unemployment. Also, despite good representation at the highest political level, the share of women in
the political process and decision-making is still limited at lower levels.

Maternal mortality ratio has declined but remains high at 75.1 per 100,000 live births. Nearly all
women have at least one antenatal care visit and 81 per cent are attended at birth by skilled personnel,
but only one hospital provides emergency obstetric and neonatal care. Reproductive health services
have been integrated into 89 per cent of health facilities.

The World Bank has supported the development of national strategies to control HIV/AIDS and
malaria. Adolescent sexual and reproductive health is being addressed by incorporating sex education
into secondary school curricula and offering youth-friendly services in public facilities, including
schools. Information campaigns by the media and civil society groups are reaching out-of-school
youth and adults. Results of studies supported by UNFPA on the sexual and reproductive health of
out-of-school adolescents, gender integration, and factors related to maternal mortality will guide new
policies and programs.

  The Government received US$160,000 World Bank grant in 2006 to support the preparation of a National Strategy for the
development of statistics and to strengthen statistical capacity of social and sector specific data.

                   Annex 7: Lessons Learnt from the Economic Success of Cape Verde

In addition to the well-documented lessons from small states, 25 the experience of other small island
economies such as Cape Verde reveals that structural vulnerabilities common to most small islands
may be overcome (see box below). Cape Verde, a small island of 4,000 square kilometers with a
population of 500,000 inhabitants, living in an arid climate with little arable lands, has been able to
turn its structural current account deficit into a surplus over the past years following sound economic
and structural reforms. As a result, Cape Verde has moved out from the status of low income country
to a middle income economy. Such a trajectory may also be envisaged for STP if the country
accelerates reforms to (i) promote and attract foreign capital and foreign aid; and (ii) raise the
efficiency of investment to led economic growth and engender domestic savings.

                             Lessons Learnt from the Economic Success of Cape Verde
Despite many natural handicaps and modest potential growth at its independence in 1975 Cape Verde has achieved a
middle income status today. Defying its poor natural resource base and with a small population of 500,000 inhabitants, Cape
Verde’s real per capita GDP grew on average by 5.3 percent from 1995 to 2009 and by 4.8 percent from 2000 to 2008, faster
than other small island economies and other countries in sub-Saharan Africa, and has brought the country to the status of
middle income economy in 2008. Since 1989, poverty headcount decreased by more than 22 percentage points to 27 percent
in 2007. Cape Verde is now on track to achieve most of the MDGs by 2015. Though relative inequality has increased,
household living standards as measured by comfort factors (home ownership, household appliances, access to water and
sanitation and infrastructure services) are fairly good.
This remarkable success for a small island economy with no natural resources is the result of a major economic
transformation over the last 35 years. The economy is increasingly becoming service-based, led by tourism and commerce.
The country has broken its past dependence on aid and remittances and is becoming a self-propelled economy with domestic
savings averaging 30 percent in 2007-2008. Specialized in export of services, and with substantial tourism-related FDI, the
tourism sector in-flows are now higher than aid and remittances. Behind this transformation there is a relatively-skilled
workforce, adequate governance and adequate economic and social policies.
A key factor of Cape Verde’s success story has been democratic consolidation. Cape Verde enjoys a dynamic social system
supported by a free press, and a vibrant civil society that increasingly participates in the social and political life of the Nation.
Cape Verde is ranked as a ―free country‖ in the 2008 Freedom House’s scoring system, making it the freest among the eleven
Sub-Saharan African states in the ranking.
Enhanced governance and market based policies allowed Cape Verde to achieve steady economic development. Corruption
is perceived as being quite low and Cape Verde ranks second in Africa in the 2009 World Bank CPIA. Political and economic
governance is ranked high by international institutions including Transparency International and the Heritage Foundation.
Despite these positive signs, the country still faces a few governance issues and fiduciary systems need improvements, access
to legal services should be expanded, and regulatory barriers exist. Cape Verde has also moved from a largely centrally-
planned economy to a market-based private sector economy and has improved factor markets and private sector-led growth
through divestiture of state enterprises and utilities, financial sector reform, the strengthening of property rights and price
liberalization that have led to greater private sector participation in the economy. As a result, the Cape Verde Stock Exchange
has steadily raised and its market capitalization is now 25 percent of GDP (compared to zero in 2005). Foreign investment is
high (and represents three times grant assistance) and regulated through the External Investment Law, which states that all
investment proposals must first go through the Cape Verde’s Centre for Promotion of Tourism, Investment and Exports
(Promex).
Sound fiscal and monetary policies, with strict limits on public sector deficits and a peg of the local currency to the Euro,
have substantially contributed to the economic success of the country. An agreement to peg the Cape Verde escudo to the
Portuguese escudo was formalized in 1998, subsequently pegged to the Euro in 1999. The peg has encouraged foreign
investment and facilitated trade with the European Union (EU). This new monetary policy required of strengthened
independence of the Central Bank and the substantial reduction of un-programmed domestic financing. Moreover, fiscal
policy has been sound and prudent. The budget deficit progressively lowered from the early1990s when a large part of
revenues came from grants to a balanced budget firmly financed by domestic taxes, including the value-added tax introduced
in 2004. Revenue buoyancy improved, together with restraint on recurrent spending resulting from civil service reform, all of
which reduced external debt from a peak of 63.7 percent of GDP in 2002 to 36.7 percent of GDP in 2008. A prudent fiscal

stance has allowed the government to implement a countercyclical fiscal impulse to smooth the negative effects of the global
downturn in 2008 and 2009.
Trade liberalization and export-oriented activities have led to better integration into the world economy. Cape Verde joined
the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 2008 after important reforms relating to import tariffs, the customs and commercial
codes and value-added tax. Trade links with Portugal, the former colony, still accounts for over one-half of all imports and
exports, but Cape Verde has developed trade with other countries in Asia, (i.e. the former Portuguese colony of Macao in
China), the United Kingdom, United States, Europe, West Africa and the Portuguese speaking community in general. The
country has successfully attracted significant quantities of FDI in tourism, and overall FDI has increased from US$21 million
in 1990-2000 to US $210 million in 2008 (and is now three times more significant than grant assistance). Cape Verde has also
been highly successful in attracting bilateral and multilateral foreign aid. Furthermore, Cape Verde, which has already a
special partnership agreement with the EU, is negotiating an economic partnership agreement with the EU to ensure a deeper
integration into the EU economy and market.
Remittances from Cape Verdeans living abroad have been crucial for private-sector development. A large and well trained
population abroad (about 500,000 Cape Verdeans work abroad) is behind the large amount of remittances that in the mid-
1990s represented the largest source of foreign financing. They have increased at an annual average of 10.3 percent for the last
20 years because of a stable and credible exchange rate peg, relaxation of foreign exchange controls, and a strengthened
financial system. As a result, Cape Verde was second only to Lesotho among top recipients of remittances in sub-Saharan
Africa and its remittances-to-GDP ratio represented 11 percent of GDP in 2008.
Cape Verde’s authorities have been attentive to reduce external vulnerabilities. To reduce exposure to critical imports, the
government introduced a package of measures, including quotas on a range of secondary goods and taking control of credit
issued by banks to import companies. Also in 1997, the government began to record sales of fuel to ships in full to adequately
plan for future needs. These measures, combined with the increase in exports, have brought the trade deficit down although
critical imports such as food and fuel continue to pressure on trade deficit.

             Annex 8: Institutional Capacity Assessment of the PRMG Operation

An institutional capacity assessment was prepared for the various components of a PRMG
operation as part of the process of preparing the project, particularly focusing on defining the
readiness of the prior actions and subsequent policy reforms. This assessment focused on the
existing state of institutional and human resources capacity in order to ascertain the operation’s
readiness to be implemented and of the actions necessary to ensure its timely and effective
implementation. The related actions to this institutional capacity assessment will be updated
following the next PRMG operation task team mission to the country.

Implementation Arrangements

The assessment ascertained that while a project implementation unit does not exist per se, a
coordinating mechanism exist for the operation functions in the area of Public Finance Reform.
The assessment concludes that the coordinating mechanism could function effectively in order to
implement the operation provided that it is supported by an action plan that could be implemented
with adequate technical assistance (TA).

The Budget Director is the coordinator of the Public Finance Reform. He is supported in this
function by the Budget Directorate under her purview. The Directorate is staffed by 12
professionals who, besides their normal functions in budget formulation, are responsible for
implementing PRMG.

The unit’s staff is comprised of professionals with university degrees and training that have
adequate public financial management experience, many of them having previously worked in the
Treasury Directorate. A preliminary assessment of their capabilities concluded that they could
effectively implement PRMG’s reform program. However, the staff at the Ministry of Finance
and International Cooperation lacks training in public accounting. More importantly, they do not
have an action plan that will allow them to produce the public accounts nor qualified technical
direction to do it. While these issues may not pose a serious problem in implementing the PRMG
operation’s prior actions, they are likely to severely constrain the implementation of the reform
program once the operation is approved by the Bank’s Board.

While the directorate’s staffing may be currently sufficient to implement both functions as work
on both areas intensifies, particularly when the SAFE-e becomes operational, the unit will require
training to deal with problems that may emerge with the system and with public accounting
issues. The unit will also require training and support from a consulting firm to modify the SAFE-
e system as needed.

This assessment identified the TA needed to address the above mentioned issues and
recommended to the authorities that adequate financing for its implementation be included in the
forthcoming government budget. In this respect, the task team has left three aide-memoires
(September and November 2010, and April 2011) with the authorities that included an update of
the status of public financial management issues that needed to be addressed, a matrix of TA
required to ensure that they would be addressed, and a matrix of policy actions related to these
two areas. The documentation provided to the authorities identified, for each directorate
participating in the PRMG operation, the TA that would be required to ensure the effective
implementation of the PRMG program. To this end, the unit has prepared terms of reference for
the TA and an action plan for its implementation. To assist in advancing the TA, the Bank will
assist in the review of the draft action plan and terms of reference by taking a public accounts
specialist in its next mission to STP. In addition, the aide-memoires of November 2010 and April


                                             60
2011 provide an in-depth assessment of public financial management systems in STP, including
an action plan for preparing the public accounts of the State.

PRSP. The household survey necessary to prepare the PRSP has been completed. Financing in
the amount of $60,000 is required to process the survey data and prepare a poverty profile, for
which a consulting firm (AFRISTAT) has been contracted, with financial support from UNDP.
Once the poverty profile is completed, work on preparing a results-oriented PRSP can commence.
Nonetheless, it will be important to improve PRSP monitoring, including the introduction of pro -
poor codes in the budget. The codes exist, but must be specified in the budget. The task team is of
the view that Budget Department has the capacity to introduce the pro-poor codes in the budget.

Budget Department. The task team reviewed the prior actions related to the budget and
concluded that the Budget Department has the capacity to undertake the policy actions of this
operation. Actions related to the management of public assets included in the policy matrix will
need to be coordinated with the Assets Department. A census of public assets, currently being
prepared by a consulting firm, will provide an up-to-date inventory of public assets. Next steps in
this area would require that the Assets Department include the relevant information in the public
accounts. However, a system to ensure that this is done is not currently in place. Therefore, TA
would be required for its implementation.

Donor Coordination. The Ministry of Finance and International Cooperation expects to receive
assistance from UNDP to further revise the Memorandum of Understanding to help specify the
functions of donor coordination and government commitment. This document will focus on three
areas: (i) an annual donor/government review to agree on commitments; (ii) government
commitment to include in the budget the agreements reached with donors; and (iii) annual
reporting on progress on the PRSP’s implementation. Staff from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs
responsible for donor coordination moved to the Ministry of Finance and International
Cooperation to assume more focused responsibility in the area of donor coordination.

Payroll Management. A draft legislation dealing with civil service reform issues is being
prepared for which the Bank will provide comments. The draft is expected to be presented to the
Council of Ministers for its discussion and subsequent approval. The team understands that the
draft legislation, once approved by the Council of Ministers, would be submitted to the National
Assembly for its discussion and subsequent approval. In the meantime, the authorities are
preparing a headcount of government employees. The authorities are also working on changes to
the Civil Code in order to include an evaluation of government employees as part of civil service
requirements.

Fiscal Responsibility Framework. The task team has discussed the policy matrix with the
authorities, listing the advantages and disadvantages of enacting a Fiscal Responsibility
Framework. On the basis of the ensuing discussion, the Council of Ministers would need to
prepare a framework on how issues of fiscal responsibility would be addressed in the area of
public financial management, for which the Ministry of Finance would need to prepare an action
plan of next steps.
