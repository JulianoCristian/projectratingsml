were satisfactory; risk to development outcome was moderate;\n            Bank performance was satisfactory and borrower performance\n            was also satisfactory. Some lessons learned includes:\n            continued attention needs to be paid to changes in the\n            external environment in all new operations; effective\n            supervision will contribute to maintain the implementation\n            pace of a reform program; an adequate institutional capacity\n            building assessment is a key and necessary element for\n            ensuring quality at entry; and continued emphasis on\n            building an Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) culture will\n            contribute to maintaining the implementation of an\n            operation's commitments on track. These lessons are\n            being reflected in arrangements for follow-up operations.\n            They also have general applicability for similar operations\n            in small island countries."}, "docdt": "2012-08-23T00:00:00Z"}
