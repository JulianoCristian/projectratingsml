Some lessons of\n            experience suggest the following. The Bank is better\n            positioned if involved from the outset in an emergency\n            response situation, for it allows rapid financing, in this\n            case, from the National Environment Project, and transfer\n            funds for emergency and preparatory work. Thus, fire\n            prevention activities actually started even before the loan\n            agreement was signed. It is reinforced that for emergency\n            operations, project design needs to be flexible, in light of\n            changing circumstances, and, supervision should be intensive\n            due to the fast preparation, and implementation. Notably, in\n            an emergency, inaction may be politically or psychologically\n            unacceptable. Once large-scale fires occur, the costs of\n            stopping them are prohibitive. In many cases, it may be\n            impossible to contain fires in remote areas, and even then,\n            the government must act, not only to avoid the spread of\n            fire to other sensitive areas such as protected areas and\n            indigenous lands, but to give the general public a sense of\n            safety and security. Emergency projects must be followed by\n            a long-term strategy to prevent future emergencies, and,\n            decentralization and partnerships are essential on the field."}, "docdt": "2005-06-28T00:00:00Z"}
