FELDA VI LAND SETTLEMENT PROJECT
Loan and Project Summary
Borrower:              Malaysia
Amount:                US$28 million
Terms:                 17 years, including four years grace, with interest at
7.5% per annum.
Relending Terms:       To FELDA - 25 years, including 10 years grace, with
interest at 7.5% per annum.
Project Description:  The project fits in with development objectives of the
Government to raise productivity and incomes, and to
reduce poverty. It would consist of the land clearing
and planting of a minimum 62,000 acres of rubber, of up
to 10,000 acres of cocoa in a pilot project, and of
500 acres of annual crops on an experimental basis.
About 6,200 families would be settled in the rubber
areas, and 1,500 additional families would work on
cocoa. The present incomes of these families fall
beneath the poverty line. The project includes ancil-
lary roads, settler and staff housing, and basic
education, health, and community service facilities.
Project risks are related mainly to the price of cocoa,
which is, however, a small component, and to cocoa
pests and diseases.

REPORT ANI) RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIO1NAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO MALAYSIA
FOR THE FELDA VI LAND SETTLEMENT PROJECT
1.        I submit the fol:Lowing report and recommendation on a proposed
loan to Malaysia for the equivalent of US$28 million to help finance a land
settlement project. The loan would have a term of 17 years including 4 years
grace, with interest at 7.5% per year. Onlending terms to FELDA will be
25 years, including 10 years grace, with interest at 7.5% per annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY /1
2.        The latest economic report, "Malaysia:  New Perspectives on the
Third Malaysia Plan" (No. 1594-MA), is dated October 14, 1977. Detailed data
on Malaysia's economy are shown in Annex I.
3.        By most economic indicators, Malaysia has done well in the past
and, in particular, during the Second Malaysia Plan (SMP, 1971-75). The per
capita income of US$860 (in 1976) is among the highest in Southeast Asia.
Public and private investment activity was stepped up and, as a result,
GNP growth, which during the 1960s averaged 6% a year, increased during
the SMP to 7%. Moreover, the trend decline in the terms of trade during the
1960s was reversed during the 1970s, and as a result there was an acceleration
in per capita income growtlh on a trend basis from 2% during the 1960s to about
5% during the Second Plan lperiod. Progress has also been made in reducing
the economy's dependence on rubber, and the manufacturing sector has performed
well in terms of output, employment, and exports. With a high export component
in GNP, the country is very vulnerable to external fluctuations, which were
significant during the SMP. In spite of the increased investment activity
and resulting current account deficits in the balance of payments, Malaysia
managed to maintain a strong external position during the SMP with relatively
low debt service payments and growing international reserves.
4.        Notwithstanding this good performance, existing racial inequalities
in income and employment, and considerable poverty, especially in the country-
side, persisted. The inferior income position of the Malays is related to
the concentration of Malays in traditional smallholder agriculture and their
meager ownership of corporate assets; furthermore, Malays in the modern
industrial sector are poorly represented especially in managerial, professional,
supervisory, and clerical occupations. The inequalities threatened the
stability of the country and, in 1971, prompted the Government to introduce a
New Economic Policy, which is designed to achieve national unity through the
two-pronged objective of eradicating poverty and restructuring society to
eliminate the identification of race with economic function.
5.        More specifically, the policy proposes to reduce in a 20-year
period (1970-90) the sharp income differences between Malays and non-Malays
/L Parts I and II are essentially the same as those prepared in the President's
Report No. 2221-MA, dated February 8, 1978, for the Northwest Selangor
Integrated Agriculture Development Project in Malaysia.



- 2 -
by reducing disparities in the ownership and control of wealth in the cor-
porate sector, and by reducing the concentration of Malay employment in
traditional low-income rural activities while increasing Malay presence
in the relatively high-income urban sectors. Since poverty is largely
concentrated among Malays, a redressal of poverty would contribute signifi-
cantly to a reduction of the racial inequalities of income.
6.        The principal means proposed to achieve these objectives is rapid
growth of the industrial and service sectors. This growth will not only
increase average incomes but will also serve the objective of racial restruc-
turing of the labor force. In addition to pursuing a rapid growth strategy,
the Government also proposes to achieve its goals through more direct means:
on the poverty side, mainly through public investment programs directed
towards the poor and, on the racial restructuring side, through controls and
quotas.
7.        In mid-1976, the Government initiated the Third Malaysia Plan (TMP,
1976-80) reconfirming the goals of the New Economic Policy. The major
objectives of the TMP are: (a) to reduce the overall incidence of poverty
(from 44% in 1975 to 34% by 1980, which would mean reducing poverty in the
agricultural sector from 63% to 49%); (b) to increase Malay employment in the
modern sectors of the economy (from the 1975 Malay share of 32% towards the
1990 goal of 50%); and (c) to increase the share of Malays in the equity
ownership of the corporate sector (from the 1975 Malay share of 8% to 16%
in 1980).
8.        The TMP goals are set out in a framework of substantial economic
growth. The target growth rate for GDP is set at 8.5% per annum. Private
investment is targeted to grow about 10% a year and public investment
about 6%, resulting in an investment of M$44 billion, in current prices, over
the TMP period. Public development expenditures were set at M$18.6 billion,
with a higher level of M$20 billion targeted if additional resources became
available.
9.        In addition to following a rapid growth strategy, the Government
also proposes to reduce poverty through direct programs that will raise
agricultural productivity and production. In the Third Plan, one quarter
(M$4.7 billion) of total public development expenditures is allocated to this
sector (compared with 22% or M$2.1 billion in the SMP). Of this, more than
one third will be spent on increasing productivity in existing agricultural
areas. In addition, one million acres of new land are scheduled for develop-
ment. As a means of reducing poverty, the TMP also provides for improved
housing and other essential services for the poor in both rural and urban
areas. The TMP also stresses that greater attention will be given to
improving the less developed states.
10.       Improved economic information on 1975 and 1976, however, have
significantly altered the macro framework of the Third Plan. First, there
was a larger recovery in traditional exports and in the terms of trade in
1976, as well as higher present and prospective levels of oil production.
Second, it now appears that real private investment fell considerably in
1975 and declined further in 1976.



- 3 -
11.        During 1976, significant increases in exports, both in prices and
volumes, particularly of oil exports, combined with moderate import increases,
resulted in a current account surplus equivalent to 6.2% of GDP. Despite a
reduction in market borrowing by the Government, reserves increased by US$900
million. At the end of 1976, gross official reserves were the equivalent of
about seven months of imports.
12.       Current projections of oil exports and of export prices in general
are higher than those used as a basis for the TMP. Therefore, the resource
outlook for Malaysia is now brighter than was forecast in the Third Plan.
Overall export earnings during the Plan period should be about US$5 billion
more than was forecast in ithe TMP. Largely as a result of this increase,
public sector revenues are also expected to be higher by about US$3 billion.
The likelihood of these additional resources has prompted the Government to
choose the higher TMP target for development expenditures of M$20 billion
(see para. 8 above) and, if implementation constraints are overcome, an even
higher target could be set..
13.       While the availability of resources is thus expected to be consi-
derably improved, there is some uncertainty about achieving the Plan's
private investment targets. As a result of the decline in private investment
in 1975 and 1976, private investment would now have to grow at more than
double the projected 10% rate during the remaining years of the Plan in order
to achieve the Plan targets. While there are a number of possible factors
that were involved in this downturn in manufacturing investment, it is
difficult to determine with any certainty their relative importance.  First,
there was the world recession in 1974-75 which, no doubt, had some negative
impact on investment activity in Malaysia. Second, 1974 was a peak period
for private investment in Malaysia so that some cyclical decline in the rate
of private investment in 1975 would probably have been experienced in any
event. Third, there was considerable uncertainty in the private sector
regarding the impact of the Industrial Co-ordination Act (ICA), passed by
Parliament in 1975, which enforces racial restructuring targets for equity
and employment through a system of licensing of existing and new firms above
a certain minimum size. As far as the ICA is concerned, the Government
acknowledged the uneasiness in the business community and amended the Act in
1976. Two important changes approved were the establishment of an appeals
procedure and an increase in the minimum size at which a firm will be expected
to restructure its equity. It is still too early, however, to judge the
reaction of the private sector to these changes.
14.        Assuming a moderate long-term recovery in private investment,
Malaysia's balance of payments should be in substantial surplus. During the
next five years, the cumulative current account surplus could amount to over
5% of GDP compared to a negligible current surplus in the previous five
years. Since such a current account surplus would be sufficient to provide
for an adequate level of reserves, capital inflows may moderate in the future.
At present, about 19% of pulblic debt outstanding and disbursed is from the



-4-
Bank; this percentage may increase somewhat by the early 1980s. Reserves
are also expected to continue to increase slowly, while the debt service
on public obligations is likely to remain at its present level of 4%-5%
of export earnings. The Bank's share of debt service is currently about
11% and may increase to 12%-14% by the early 1980s.
15.       In general, over the next few years, it is likely that the Govern-
ment will need less external capital than previously forecast, largely because
of strong commodity prices and oil earnings. At the same time, Malaysia has
a serious income distribution and poverty problem. The country needs techni-
cal assistance and expertise to help develop poverty alleviation programs, and
to assist in designing and packaging projects that reach out directly to low-
income families. The Malaysians believe strongly that project borrowing,
particularly from development institutions such as the World Bank, is necessary
to assist them to mount an effective attack on poverty. Bank lending is
therefore focused on strengthening Government efforts to directly reduce
poverty.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN MALAYSIA
16.       The Bank has made 39 loans to Malaysia for projects in education,
population, agriculture, forestry, industrial finance, power, water supply,
sewerage, telecommunications, ports, railways, roads, and urban transport.
Under the proposed project, the Federal Land Development Authority (FELDA)
would be the executing agency. FELDA operates semiautonomously under the
Ministry of Land and Regional Development. The proposed project would be the
sixth loan the Bank has made with FELDA as the executing agency. The first
(Jengka I, Loan 533-MA) and the second (Jengka II, Loan 672-MA) have been
successfully completed. The third (Jengka III, Loan 885-MA), which was
started in 1972, is slightly behind schedule. The fourth and fifth loans
(Johore, Loan 967-MA and Keratong, Loan 1044-MA) are roughly on schedule,
although the village development component of the fifth loan has been delayed
because of poor coordination between FELDA and the state agency in charge of
urban development. This situation, however, is improving. In summary,
FELDA's performance under previously financed Bank projects has been very
good.
17.       Although in many cases disbursements have been slower than expected,
the execution of Bank projects in Malaysia has generally been satisfactory.
As of March 31, 1978, the loans to Malaysia held by the Bank amounted to
US$734.7 million. Fifteen loans have been fully disbursed. Annex II contains
a summary statement of Bank loans as well as notes on the execution of ongoing
projects.
18.       While currently Malaysia is a resource surplus country, the openness
of the economy (exports are 45% of the GDP) and the volatility of the prices
of Malaysia's main exports (rubber, palm oil, and tin) make the continuance of
large surpluses uncertain. To cushion against fluctuation in exports, large



-5-
reserves are needed. With regard to Bank lending, however, the primary
consideration is not resouirce transfer; rather, it is institution-building
and helping Malaysia to expand its capacity to implement programs to combat
the deep-rooted problems o:E poverty and unemployment, particularly in
the rural areas.
19.       Malaysia's commitment to assist its low-income groups has strength-
ened significantly in the lpast few years. The Bank can justifiably take
some measure of credit for its efforts to help Malaysia identify and prepare
projects geared toward the rural poor. In view of Malaysia's otherwise weak
preparation capability, the number of rural development projects recently
financed and in the current pipeline is impressive. The bulk of these
projects. has been financed by the Bank.
20.       While these recent projects are by themselves impressive, they are
not truly representative of the Government's general capacity to develop
projects; this capacity remains very weak, largely because of a shortage of
trained staff. With the help of the UNDP-financed and Bank-executed State
and Rural Development Project, which provides technical assistance in selected
federal agencies (departments) and states, we are helping the Government to
develop further its programs and projects for reducing poverty.
21.       The country needs assistance to help develop future poverty programs
and projects that could reach larger numbers of low-income families in the
rural and urban areas. Bank loans are assisting those in absolute poverty by
providing irrigation and drainage facilities, and farm-to-market roads for
existing smallholders. At the same time, the Bank will continue to assist
landless laborers by helping to develop larger areas of new land for agricul-
ture. The proposed project initiates an important shift in government land
development policy by providing settlers with smaller holdings, thereby
reducing investment costs per family and increasing the number of families
that can be settled while still providing adequate future incomes. The
Bank's lending program will also help improve support services by expanding
extension, by increasing aLgricultural and small-scale industrial credit, and
by producing higher quality seeds. The Bank plans to mount a concentrated
effort to help such institutions as RISDA (Rubber Industry Smallholders
Development Authority), FELCRA (Federal Land Consolidation and Rehabilitation
Authority), and the Agricultural Credit Bank. It also plans to help the
Government expand social Eservices, in particular for low-income groups,
through assistance for formal and informal skill training and the expansion
of family planning services. Assistance to infrastructure development will
be very selective, concentrating on secondary rural road links and extending
electricity into the rural areas.
22.       IFC has been active in Malaysia since 1963 and has made six invest-
ments totaling US$8.69 million. The total commitments under the investments
held by IFC as of March 31, 1978, amounted to US$1.44 million (Annex II).



- 6 -
PART III. THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR
23.       The agricultural sector holds a preeminent position in Malaysia's
economy, contributing about one third of GDP and more than half of the employ-
ment and foreign exchange earnings. Agricultural production has grown at
about 6% p.a. since 1970 and this trend is expected to continue in the near
future.  Over one half of agricultural and forestry production is exported;
about 60% of these exports are based on rubber and oil palm products in which
Malaysia occupies a predominant position in the world market. In addition,
the scope for economically justified import substitution in grains, dairy
products and meats, which represent the bulk of agricultural imports, is
relatively limited. Therefore, continued agricultural growth depends heavily
on increased exports. Based upon Malaysia's physical advantages, the high
degree of competitiveness in traditional exports developed over many years,
and satisfactory market conditions, prospects for such growth appear favorable.
24.       Of the 8 million cultivated acres in Peninsular Malaysia, rubber
occupies 4.3 million, oil palms 1.3 million, and coconuts 0.5 million, accounting
for a total of more than 6 million acres under permanent tree crops, of which
almost two thirds are in smallholdings. The only other major crop is padi
with one million acres. Other crops (all below 100,000 acres each) are pine-
apple, cocoa, tapioca, sugarcane, tobacco, coffee, and groundnuts. Smallholdings
and rural poverty are largely concentrated in rubber, padi, and coconut areas.
25.       Objectives.  Over a quarter of the TMP development expenditures
will go to agriculture, more than to any other sector. The main objectives
of agricultural development policy are: (a) redressal of rural poverty
and regional income disparities; (b) creation of new employment opportuni-
ties; (c) increased stability in rural incomes and foreign exchange earnings
through promotion of new export crops and import substitution; and (d) main-
tenance of growth of export earnings.
26.       Strategy.  The Government is making an all-out effort to pursue
these objectives through a variety of programs which have two major elements:
(a) increasing emphasis on raising productivity and incomes in existing
smallholder agriculture in order to reduce poverty and regional
inequalities; and
(b) new land development in order to generate additional employment at
adequate income levels, but with low investment costs per settler.
27.       Field operations of agricultural programs in existing smallholder
areas are vested in State Departments of Agriculture and a number of Federal
agencies, e.g. FELDA, RISDA, FELCRA, Livestock Development Authority (Majuternak),
and Fisheries Development Authority (Majuikan). The major emphasis is being
placed on improving coordination among these various entities and increasing
their individual capacity for effective implementation.



28.       The TMP's emphasis on existing agriculture is fundamental to achiev-
ing the social objective of alleviating poverty throughout Malaysia. The
development targets include: (a) a 20% increase in double cropping of padi
from 590,000 to 690,000 acres; (b) new and improved drainage on 559,000 acres
(a large percent in coconut producing areas of the West Coast) which would
facilitate coffee and cocoa intercropping under coconut; (c) replanting and
new planting of 500,000 acres of rubber; (d) replanting and rehabilitation of
100,000 acres of coconut; (e) crop diversification of rainfed agriculture; and
(f) general strengthening of agricultural services, particularly extension.
29.       The largest group (30%) of all the poor in Malaysia are in the
rubber areas. The main agencies entrusted with rubber replantings and
land consolidation are RISDA and FELCRA. The Government and the Bank are seeking
to develop the capabilities of these agencies. Due to inherent problems of
land tenure, and small, fragmented and dispersed landholdings, rubber replanting
activity declined over the past decade and is not likely to be significant
during the next few years. Land consolidation also has problems related to
those mentioned above; in addition, the existence of custom law, the dispersion
of authority among different levels of government, and other difficulties
related to exchange of holdings among beneficiaries, inhibit progress in
consolidation. These limitations on replanting and consolidation show that,
in the near future, rural poverty alleviation and increased production will
continue to depend largely on new land development.
30.       The current annual rate of land development by all agencies in
Peninsular Malaysia is about 160,000 acres. Of this, about 60% is for oil
palm and the balance is for rubber. About three fourths of this land is
being developed by FELDA. The above current annual rate of land development
is adequate to provide eventually settlement for 18,000-20,000 families and
jobs for about 30,000 people p.a./l The 30,000 jobs represents almost one
fourth of the total incremental annual employment requirement during the next
decade. The total impact of land development on poverty is even greater,
since it includes the indirect effects of increased agricultural production
and higher incomes on the economy as a whole. These factors amply justify a
continued and expanding raLte of land development. FELDA, given its long
experience, its large-scale operations, and its high levels of efficiency, is
and will remain for a number of years the most important executing agency in
reaching the Government's combined production and poverty eradication objec-
tives. FELDA's policies are designed to: (a) develop as much land
(120,000 acres p.a. at present) as is consistent with high standards of
efficiency to ensure high future productivity and production; (b) help
establish smallholder settlers with sufficiently high incomes (minimum of
about US$1,400 equivalent at 1977 prices) to enable them to escape poverty;
and (c) select settlers from the lower-income groups. By December 1976, FELDA
had developed 813,000 acres of land and settled about 40,000 families.
/1 Given the recent major increases in the rate of development and the
inevitable settlement lags, only about one half of the above settle-
ment and employment fiLgures is presently realized, but the proportion
should increase to the potential level in a few years as the annual
rate of development st:abilizes and time lags are reduced.



-8-
Rubber and Cocoa Subsectors
31.       Rubber.  Malaysia produces about one half of the world's output of
natural rubber, and production is projected to increase at about 3% p.a.
through 1990. Even at this rate and the rates projected for the other main
rubber producing countries, i.e., Indonesia and Thailand, production is not
expected to meet potential future world market demand for natural rubber
beyond the mid-1980s. The favorable supply/demand outlook is an important
factor in the Government's emphasis on rubber development.
32.       Other factors supporting rubber development are: (a) Malaysia's
existing rubber areas are ecologically well-suited to rubber production;
(b) there are still 3 to 4 million acres of virgin lands suited to rubber;
(c) the large numbers and the high proportion of rural poor among rubber
smallholders; (d) as a result of rubber being a traditional crop, the relative
ease with which production could be expanded based on the familiarity with the
agricultural aspects of a large body of smallholders and landless people; and
(e) the well-established and efficient collection, processing, and marketing
channels available to practically all producers.
33.       In addition, efforts must be made to increase employment and
incomes of project participants during the immature period of permanent tree
crop development, thereby permitting smaller holding size and lower cost per
settler. In particular, scope may exist for increased production of annual
crops either as intercrops or as separate crops. Given the dearth of expe-
rience in Malaysia of annual cropping, it would be prudent to introduce
practically oriented field experimentation prior to large-scale planting.
34.       Cocoa.  Private and Government-sponsored plantings of cocoa have
been made in about 60,000 acres, mostly since 1965. Plantings have been made
because of suitable ecological conditions in selected areas, adequate world
market prospects, the advisability for Malaysia to diversify its agricultural
production and exports, and successful disease control measures (pest and
diseases being the major constraint). Cocoa, being a labor-intensive crop,
will also facilitate greater employment creation on a given land area.
The Government now wishes to expand cocoa plantings much more vigorously in
new areas for the above reasons, and has chosen FELDA to do this. FELDA's
experience with cocoa dates back to 1970, when it established cocoa nurseries
and began its inland soils research and experimentation on about 5,000 acres
in Jengka (State of Pahang) under the Bank-financed Jengka III project.
The Bank's Past Experience with the Sector and with FELDA
35.       Performance under the Bank-financed projects has been generally
satisfactory. More specifically, performance under FELDA projects has been
good. The first two Jengka projects, Loans 533-MA and 671-MA, have been
satisfactorily completed. The other three (Third Jengka, Johore, and Keratong,
Loans 885, 967, and 1044-MA) are being implemented roughly on schedule. The
main weaknesses observed in FELDA's operations were related to its own
management information systems, and management of its processing facilities.
The Bank is having a continuous dialogue with FELDA on these matters and
satisfactory progress is being made.

36.       The proposed project draws on experience under previous projects in
that it would promote development through substantially smaller holdings
(from 14 and 12 acres for oil palms and rubber, respectively, to a uniform
10 acres) and smaller investments per family including field, management, and
infrastructure (from US$14,000 to US$10,000) after it was shown that this
could be done without compromising settlers' well-being. These changes would
allow a one-third increase in the number of beneficiaries under this and
future FELDA-sponsored development with a consequent major impact on rural
poverty. Implementation in due course of annual cropping on a large scale
may allow further reductions in landholding size and cost per settler which
would further increase the number of families that could be settled in a
given area.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
37.       The proposed project is part of an ongoing dialogue between the
Bank and FELDA on ways to increase the impact of new land development on
rural poverty. Hence, as indicated above, the project is especially directed
at reducing the holding size and settlement costs per family, thereby permit-
ting an increase in the number of families settled. The introduction of
annual cropping trials in settlement areas, if successful, would further help
reduce cost per settler. Additionally, the project would initiate a diversi-
fication drive into cocoa. The project, therefore, would be of substantial
potential benefit to the country beyond the specific sphere of the project.
FELDA prepared this project, which was appraised in the field in September-
October 1977. Negotiations were held in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, from March 31
to April 3; the Malaysian delegation was led by Mr. Nik Sidek. A Staff
Appraisal Report, entitled, "Malaysia - FELDA VI Land Settlement Project,"
(No. 1863-MA) is being circulated separately to the Executive Directors.
Supplementary project data are provided in Annex III.
38.       The proposed project would finance for a six-year period, 1979-84,
the costs of developing a minimum 62,000 acres of rubber, up to 10,000 acres
of cocoa (to be selected after the necessary surveys are made) in a pilot
project, and 500 acres of experimental plantings of annual crops in four
areas of the states of Pahang and Negri Sembilan in Peninsular Malaysia.
FELDA should make the necessary detailed surveys and consult with the Bank
before selecting land within the project area to be developed under cocoa
and annual crops (see Section 2.06 of the draft Project Agreement).
39.       The project would be implemented following standard FELDA practices,
which include: (a) land clearing, planting, and initial maintenance by con-
tractors (hired by FELDA), followed by maintenance by settlers; (b) recruit-
ment and settlement by FELDA of 6,200 rubber smallholders and of 1,500 hired
labor who would eventually become settlers for cocoa once satisfactory agri-
cultural standards have been reached; and (c) development of the necessary
housing (by FELDA-hired contractors) and infrastructure facilities (by the
respective government agencies); the latter involving roads, water supply,
schools, clinics, stores, and community centers.



- 10 -
Organization
40.       FELDA is a semiautonomous corporation under the Ministry of Land
and Regional Development.  Overall supervision is the responsibility of a
Board of Directors which includes representatives from the public and private
sectors. The Chief Executive is the Director-General, who is also a member
of the Board.  The present senior management team at FELDA is an efficient unit.
Project Cost and Financing
41.       Total project cost which includes taxes and duties of US$2.4 mil-
lion is estimated at US$92-3 million. This consists of US$62.4 million (68%
of total costs) for field development (loans to FELDA for agricultural devel-
opment, including settler housing), US$12.1 million for FELDA management ex-
penses, and US$17.8 million for infrastructure costs. The proposed Bank loan
of US$28 million represents 30% of project costs and would finance 45% of field
development costs. The Government would finance the balance of the project
costs, US$64.3 million.
42.       The US$28 million Bank loan would be made to the Government at an
interest rate of 7.5%, payable over 17 years including 4 years grace. It
would represent 32% of total project costs net of duties and taxes (or 30%
of project costs including duties and taxes) and cover about US$19 million of
foreign exchange costs and about US$9 million of local costs.
Lending Terms
43.       The Government would bear the foreign exchange risk and onlend the
proceeds of the Bank loan to FELDA at an interest rate of 7.5% and maturity
of 25 years including 10 years grace. Additional Government funds would be
lent to FELDA under the project; these funds will be lent at 5-1/2% for 25
years including 10 years grace with no interest for the first 5 years.
FELDA's onlending terms to smallholders are, and would be under the project,
as follows: for rubber settlers, 24 years maturity with 9 years grace at
6-1/4% interest compounded during the grace period. A new activity for FELDA
under the project would be lending to cocoa estates. These loans would be
expected to carry 22 years maturity with 7 years grace at 6-1/4% interest
compounded during the grace period. Lending terms are based on the crop's
long immaturity period and hence the ability to service debt. Assurances
were obtained that no material changes would be made in lending terms except
in agreement with the Bank (see Section 3.01[b] of the draft Loan Agreement
and 2.09 of the draft Project Agreement).
Cost Recovery
44.       FELDA would accumulate a project-generated surplus of US$27 million
by the end of the project's life. The Government would not only recover its
total project costs amounting to about US$100 million by 2002, but is



- 11 -
expected, in addition, to accumulate surpluses of US$360 million by the end of
the project's life due lar,gely to substantial project-derived rubber export
duties. Project costs, excluding such infrastructure as multipurpose roads,
public buildings, and FELDA s supervision expenses, would be financed as
loans and recovered fully. Under the project, such loans would amount to
US$62.4 million or 68% of total project costs and would be recovered at an
interest rate of 6-1/4%. In the case of rubber, in addition to loan repay-
ments, the settlers would indirectly pay a replanting cess and export duties
which are equivalent to 65% of their net cash incomes at full development.
Settlers would also be liable to pay income tax at 6% on incomes of over
M$6,000. In the case of the pilot cocoa project, land areas would be fully
developed and owned by FELDA with settlers participating as hired labor.
Financial Conditions
45.       FELDA's financial condition is strong.  Cash, short- and medium-term
security holdings are estimated at US$123 million at December 31, 1977, and
are to increase to about US$350 million in real terms by 1985. However,
FELDA's available funds are subject to the Government's financial requirements.
Additionally, FELDA plans to make substantial investments in a diversification
drive (now in the planning; stage) and to set aside funds for settler income
stabilization. None of these are reflected in the above financial projections
but, taken together, would reduce substantially FELDA's liquidity.
46.       FELDA's accounts and audits are satisfactory.  As in the past,
separate accounts would be maintained for the project and these, as well as
FELDA's overall accounts, would be audited by independent auditors agreed by
the Bank.
Procurement and Disbursement
47.       Contracts for land development (US$23.5 million), housing and
office buildings (US$10 miLllion), and vehicles (US$1.5 million) would be let
under international competitive bidding procedures in accordance with Bank
Group guidelines. FertiliLzer and chemicals (US$12.3 million) would be procured
under local bidding procedures satisfactory to the Bank. International firms
are well-represented in Malaysia and are competitive. Infrastructure facilities
(US$17.9 million) would be built by PWD under force account procedures.  The
remaining costs, e.g. salaries, operating costs and planting materials,
(US$27.1 million) would bes paid following FELDA practices which have been
followed successfully under past Bank-financed projects.
48.       As agreed by the Bank for past FELDA projects and given the standard
nature of land developmenit, housing, fertilizer, and planting material con-
tracts, FELDA would not nesed to obtain prior Bank agreement for its contract
awards on these (except for land clearing contracts) for amounts not exceeding
US$0.5 million. In the case of land clearing contracts only, the above limit
would be US$1 million where prior Bank agreement would be obtained for only the
larger contracts. These are expected to cover about 30% of all contracts for
land clearing.

Production, Markets, and Prices
49.       At full development by the year 1992, incremental project-generated
production would amount to about 42,000 tons of rubber and 4,800 tons of
cocoa. These levels of incremental production would be easily absorbed by
the world market for both commodities given their very small relative size
and projected supply-demand conditions. FELDA would transport, process, and
market rubber and cocoa, using its well-established and efficient channels.
The output of the experimental annual crops would be small and would be
marketed with FELDA's support, based on previous analysis of favorable local
demand.
Benefits and Risks
50.       The absolute poverty threshold in Malaysia, which is based on the
cost of a minimum subsistence diet and the cost of essential non-food items,
is estimated at M$3,125 (US$1,250) per family of five in 1977 prices. A
typical rubber settler's family income would increase from M$1,200 (US$480)
before the project to about M$1,800 (US$720) by year 9 and up to M$5,500
(US$2,200) beginning in year 13. These increases would provide a sufficient
margin to enable settlers to escape poverty and would provide enough incentives
for participants, even considering the long gestation period. A typical
2,000 acre cocoa estate would derive a 17% financial rate of return from its
investments.
51.       At full development, project-induced annual production (all of
which would be exported) would amount to about US$32 million for rubber and
to US$4.5 million for cocoa. The project would create about 8,000
jobs in land clearing and an additional similar number of permanent jobs
among settler families. The economic rate of return is estimated to be
18%. The most probable negative changes in parameters are not likely to
affect the economic justification of the project.
52.       Project risks are related mainly to the price of cocoa which is,
however, a very small project component; and to cocoa pests and diseases, which
would be diminished under tight supervision. In general, a high probability
of project success is ensured given FELDA's experience, continued large volume
of operations, well-tested policies and procedures applicable to the project,
and high levels of efficiency.
Ecological Impact
53.       FELDA would follow its normal land development standards which
minimize any adverse effects, e.g. rapid tree plantings preceded by cover
crop establishment to reduce erosion and siltation, and leaving as forest
reserves upper ranges of catchment areas, steep slopes, and areas with rich
wildlife. FELDA also applies strict controls to rubber effluents through
improved anaerobic and aerobic ponding, reducing pollution to acceptable
levels. Cocoa effluents would be insignificant. The above measures would
ensure a minimum of negative ecological impact in project areas.

C. PROJECTS IN EXECUTION
Loan No. 774   Sabah Ports Project; US$16.1 Million Loan of June 30, 1971;
Effective Date: August 24, 1971; Closing Date: June 30, 1978
Work has been satisfactorily completed on the new berths at Kota
Kinabalu and Sandakan. Slow progress in completing the access road to
Sandakan delayed full use of the latter facilities until mid-1977. The new
headquarters building has lbeen occupied. Delay in mobilization, procurement
of materials and difficulties in retaining suitable consultant engineers,
compounded with the world-wide inflation, resulted in a cost overrun of about
50%. Settlement of an outstanding claim by the contractors will delay the
final account and the closing date of the loan has been postponed by 18
months to June 30, 1978.
Loan No. 799   Railway Project; US$16.0 Million Loan of February 11, 1972;
Effective Date: April 17, 1972; Closing Date: March 31, 1978
All equipment and materials have been received. Malayan Railway (MR)
operations showed an all-round improvement during 1976 and 1977 although some
key efficiency indicators were still below acceptable standards, especially
those pertaining to locomotive and rolling stock maintenance. As a result of
i successful marketing drive in 1976, a modest financial return of about
1% was achieved that year compared to losses incurred during the previous ten
years. A substantial wage award effective July 1, 1977 imposed a new strain
on financial recovery, but subsequent tariff increases and some economies in
expenditure should produce a break-even result in 1977 and enable a profit to
be earned in 1978 and thereafter. Reasonable progress is being made in
clearing the external audit backlog.
Loan No. 931   Second Highway Project; US$19.5 Million Loan of August 22,
1973; Effective Date: October 25, 1973; Closing Date:
March 31, L980
Overall, the project is about 85% completed. Two of the three
contract sections constituting the new Kuala Lumpur-Seremban Expressway have
been completed and the third section which is nearing completion has been
partially taken over. Except for a two mile section at the northern end, the
Expressway was opened for traffic in October 1976. The improvement works to
the existing Kuala Lumpur*-Seremban Road are substantially completed, while
the widening and improvemient works of the Kuala Lumpur - Batang Kali Road,
which were started in November 1976, will take still one and a half to two
years to complete. Consulting services for various studies and detailed
engineering have been completed. Construction costs have escalated sharply
because of rapid inflation, and the total project cost is now estimated
to be US$46 million, compared to an appraisal estimate of US$37 million.

Loan No. 1214 Second Kuala Lumpur Urban Transport Project; US$26.0 Million
Loan of March 11, 1976; Effective Date: November 11, 1976;
Closing Date: June 30, 1981
The main objective of the project is to increase the efficiency
of the transport system in Kuala Lumpur. Public transport services will be
improved while the use of private cars will be restrained. Although primarily
concerned with urban transport, the project also introduces new approaches to
residential development for low-income families. The main components are:
(a) road and intersection improvements, traffic engineering and control
schemes and new radial roads; (b) transport policy measures including intro-
duction of minibus services, traffic priorities for high-occupancy vehicles
and area road pricing; (c) new serviced plots for about 1,400 households and
150 businesses and improvement of infrastructure services for about 2,100
existing households; and (d) technical assistance to support traffic manage-
ment and transport planning, to prepare an urban development project for
Kuantan, and to review national housing policies and programs. Progress on
the transport components has been quite satisfactory although delays have been
experienced. Execution of the residential components has been less satisfac-
tory due to administrative and policy problems.
Loan No. 1376 Third Highway Project; US$35.0 Million Loan of April 4, 1977;
Effective Date: May 4, 1977; Closing Date: June 30, 1982
The main objective of the project is to improve the highway network
in the East Malaysian State of Sabah through the reconstruction and upgrading
of priority links and the development of the Public Works Department's
maintenance capacity. A further objective is to protect road investments in
Peninsular Malaysia through a pilot road maintenance and pavement strengthening
program in three states. The project also includes an urban study of Kota
Kinabalu in Sabah and a transport/railway study in Peninsular Malaysia.
Construction work on the East and West Coast Roads in Sabah started in
September 1977, about five months behind schedule. The highway maintenance
and upgrading program in Sabah has not yet been started due to a delay of
about one year in appointing consultants to assist PWD. While satisfactory
progress has been made in the preparatory work for the construction in
Peninsular Malaysia, the reorganization of maintenance sections in the three
pilot states is behind schedule due to staff shortages. The consulting
services for the studies are slightly behind schedule and will be completed
during the first half of 1978.
Loan No. 1031  Sixth Power Project; US$45.0 Million Loan of July 25, 1974;
Effective Date: October 22, 1974; Closing Date: June 30,
1980
Loan No. 1178  Seventh Power Project; US$35.0 Million Loan of December 17,
1975; Effective Date: March 10, 1976; Closing Date:
June 30, 1981

Loan No. 1443 Eighth Power Prolect; US$22-0 Million Loan of August 3,
1977; Effective Date: January 9, 1978; Closing Date:
June 30, 1982
The 275 kV transmiission lines from Temengor to Papan and from Port
Dickson to Malacca financed under the Sixth Power Project have been completed.
The Seventh Power Project (the Prai Power Station extension, 3 x 120 MW) and
the Eighth Power Project (the Pasir Gudang Power Station, 2 x 120 MW) are
still in the early stages of construction; the progress is generally satis-
factory.
Based on the Bank's recommendation, the Government has agreed to
apply fuel surcharges to commercial and industrial consumers since mid-1975
and to provide NEB with equity of about US$200 million from FY77-81 on a year
by year basis to bridge NEB's financial gap. Maximum demand and energy sales
for FY77 were 975-MW and 5,297 GWH respectively (16% above FY76 levels).
The co-financing arrangement for the Eighth Power Project (commer-
cial bank loan of US$30 million) was completed on October 4, 1977.
Loan No. 908   Second Kuala Lumpur Water Supply Project; US$13.5 Million
Loan of June 14, 1973; Effective Date: August 27, 1973;
Closing Date: June 30, 1978
The project consists of the expansion of water supply facilities
to meet increasing demands in Kuala Lumpur and the Klang Valley area. The
first part of the project, comprising ordinary water works, was completed
in 1976, practically on schedule and within the cost estimates, and is
operational. The construction of the Langat Dam, the last and major work of
the project, is progressing satisfactorily and is expected to be completed by
the end of 1979. Completion will be two years behind schedule. Cost of the
dam is likely to be about 25% more than originally estimated, resulting in an
increase in total project cost of about 15%. No difficulties are foreseen in
raising the additional funds required. The Selangor State Water Department,
which is responsible for the project, performs well in spite of staffing
problems. Its financial management still needs some strengthening.
Loan 1213-MA   Kuala Lumpur Sewerage Project; US$21.5 Million Loan of
March 11, 1976; Effective Date: August 25, 1976
Closing Date: December 31, 1981
The project is the first stage (1976-81) of a 30-year master plan
for the sewerage of the Kuala Lumpur Metropolitan area. It includes the
extension of sewage collection (about 70 miles of trunk and lateral sewers)
and treatment facilities to serve an additional population of 200,000 in the
Kuala Lumpur Federal Territory; the institution of a separate Sewerage
Department within Kula Lumpur City Hall, with its own accounting system and

finances; engineering and management consultant services; staff training; and
the preparation of sewerage and pollution control measures for the Kuala
Lumpur metropolitan area. The Engineering of the Project has been satisfac-
torily completed. Bidding for two out of the three major contracts (sewers)
has also been completed. However, land acquisition and resettlement of
present occupants are creating serious problems which are delaying the project.
The establishment of a separate accounting system for the Sewerage Department
(Kuala Lumpur City Hall) is progressing well. Action to levy the sewerage
surcharge on water bills has been undertaken after long delays. Compliance
with covenants regarding long-term sewerage and urban planning in Selangor
State is lagging.
Loan No. 885   Third Jengka Triangle Land Settlement Project;
US$25.0 Million Loan of March 30, 1973; Effective
Date:  June 22, 1973: Closing Date:  December 31, 1981
Planting operations have been completed but due to the severe
droughts in 1976 and 1977 a heavy supplying program especially on the rubber
schemes is being carried out, which is due to be completed by the end of
1978. About 23,500 acres of oil palm and 16,400 acres of rubber have been
planted. Planting and maintenance standards are satisfactory. Only scheme 15
is in production. So far, 1,467 houses have been constructed and 1,347
settlers have moved in. Schools and clinics are under construction but will
only be completed about one year after settler entry. Due to delays in
__.LIer house construction, settler entry will be delayed by two to two and a
half yeaLs in various schemes. JKR capacity is a major constraint in speeding
up house constraction. Coordination between JKR and FELDA has improved
considerably and FELDA expects that the backlog will not increase. Oil palm
mill construction on scheme 18 is on schedule and will be completed by April
1979. Water to schemes 16 to 18 is temporarily supplied from Jengka II due
to delays in intake construction on scheme 19. Due to excessive transfers in
middle management field staff, there is lack of leadership which affects
continuity of work.
Loan No. 967   Johore Land Settlement Project; US$40.0 Million Loan of
February 27, 1974; Effective Date: May 16, 1974; Closing
Date: June 30, 1982
Clearing and planting proper are satisfactorily on schedule, except
for phase III of the Ulu Dengar scheme due to late logging. Planting and
maintenance standards are satisfactory. Oil palm production started on four
schemes in 1977. However, due to the severe droughts in 1976 and 1977, early
yields are disappointing. Attacks of elephants and wild boar resulted in a
loss of 25% of the total oil palm stand. FELDA has embarked on a massive
trenching program around the scheme boundaries and indications are that this
program may be effective. FELDA is now preparing for a gigantic supplying program.
So far, 828 houses have been constructed and 710 settlers have moved in. Due
to delays in settler house construction, delays of one to three years in
settler entry are to be expected on various schemes. Lack of capacity in JKR
and in the Ministries of Education and Health has delayed construction of
schools and clinics, but the situation is improving because of the creation of
separate units in these Ministries catering for FELDA schemes. Two of the
five oil mills to be constructed under the loan were commissioned in 1977.

Loan No. 973   Western Jcohore Agricultural Development Project; US$45.0 Million
Loan of April 5, 1974; Effective Date: August 14, 1974;
Closing Date: June 30, 1980
Project civil works are still substantially behind schedule, and
acceleration of work has proven difficult due to unusually severe rainfall
and flooding, refinements in design requiring construction of numerous
small water control structures, and the persistent problems of land acqui-
sition in a settled smallholder area. However, work is progressing on all
drainage basin contracts, at costs considerably below appraisal estimates.
The project has recently been expanded to include the construction of
drainage works and agricultural installations in the Phase II area of
Western Johore and construction of a network of secondary roads in the
original Phase I area.
Loan No. 1044 Keratong Land Settlement Project; US$36.0 Million Loan of
October 3, 1974; Effective Date: January 9, 1975; Closing
Date: June 30, 1983
Clearing and planting operations on schemes 8 and 9 are delayed by
about 9 to 12 months due to late logging. Scheme 2 is in production.
Production on scheme 3 has been postponed due to labor shortages. Schemes 4
and 5 are expected to come in production by late 1978, but this may also
have to be postponed. Despite the labor shortage maintenance standards are
satisfactory. Attacks by elephants and wild boar resulted in a loss of 12%
of the total oil palm stand. FELDA will start a trenching program whereafter
a supplying program will be initiated. Following the decision to reduce the
holding size from 14 to 10 acres settlers of schemes 1 to 5 will be housed
in Town 22, while separate townships will be constructed for schemes 6 and 7
and for schemes 8 and 9. Four houndred eleven houses have been completed
and 283 settlers moved in. The relationship between DARA and FELDA has
improved considerably following the changes in DARA top management and FELDA
expects that the backlog in settler entry will not increase and an effort
will be made to clear this backlog.
Loan No. 1115 Agricultural Research and Extension Project; US$28.5 Million
Loan of Play 30, 1975; Effective Date: October 21, 1975;
Closing Date: June 30, 1982
Project implementation is now about two years behind the appraisal
estimates. A new Director General was appointed in mid-1977 and a new
Deputy Director for Administration was appointed in January 1978, and the
post of Deputy Director for Research is still vacant. Some progress has
been made on international recruitment of Scientist and Research Program
Reviews. Six scientists are now on board and a total of 15 man-years has
been committed representing 15% of the total scheduled under the project.
An additional one man-year has been utilized for consultants to conduct nine
program reviews. Civil works and fellowships are the only components of the
project that have been lproceeding at a satisfactory pace. The extension
component of the project is also about two years behind schedule and has had
similar management constraints with a change in Directors occurring in March
1978. The next six months should be adequate to indicate whether the new
management will be able to get the project moving.

LIoan Nc. 1294  North Kelantan Rural Development Proie,r; US$21.0 Nillion
Loan of July 21, 1976; Effective Datc: October 28, 1976;
Closing Date: December 31, 1981
The project includes the Lemal Irrigation component which will
provide drainage and flood protection to 30,000 gross ha of farmland and
inLenisive irrigation to 12,000 net ha of paddy; construction of 190 km of
rtiraL roads throughout North Kelantan; 15 small irrigation schemes servinp-
1,300 ha of paddy; construction, rehabilitation and equipping of 25 Farmers
D)evelopment Centers (FDCs); and establishment of an effective agricultural
extension service for Kelantan. The project start-up period has seen rapil
implementation of the FDC component, good progress on the agricultural
extension component with planning, staffing and preparation of equipment
specifications proceeding on schedule and a welcome degree of cooperation
between the Farmers Organization Authority and the Kelantan Department of
Agriculture in joint planning of agricultural service buildings and field
operations. Some delay in engineering of roads and irrigation works has
occurred due to delays in approval of staff, but this problem appears to have
been largely resolved.
Loan No. 1444 National Small-Scale Irrigation Project; US$39.0 Million Loan
of August 3, 1977; Effective Date: October 25, 1977;
Closing Date: March 31, 1983
The loan became effective on October 25, 1977 and the project works
have just been started.
Loan No. 599   Education Project; US$8.8 Million Loan of May 23, 1969;
Effective Date: September 16, 1969; Closing Date:
September 30, 1977
The Project provides US$8.8 million for the construction of
technical, vocational, agricultural and general secondary schools and one
teacher training college. All project institutions have been completed and
are in satisfactory operation. The disbursement of the balance of US$200,000
is expected to be completed shortly.
Loan No. 810   Second Education Project; US$15.5 Million Loan of April 5,
1972; Effective Date: July 7, 1972; Closing Date:
December 31, 1978
The project is financing the establishment of a curriculum develop-
ment center, science schools for the University of Penang, vocational schools,
and an educational television system. Implementation has improved but is
still about two years behind schedule mainly due to delays in the appointment
of consultant architects, in the approval of the designs and the campus plan,
and in the preparation of documents by the Public Works Department. Staff
shortages in the Project Unit have also contributed to the delays. The delays
are reflected in slow disbursements, but the problem is currently being
addressed by the Bank and the Government. Project cost overruns are expected
to be financed by the Government.

Loan No. 974   Third Education Project; US$19.0 Million Loan of April 5,
1974; Effective Date: June 26, 1974; Closing Date:
December 31, 1980
The project assists the Government to develop technical training,
preservice teacher training, and an East Malaysia educational television
system. Implementation is about 12 months behind schedule due to earlier
delays in the selection of sites for the Teacher Training Colleges (TTCs).
Contracts have been awarded for 8 out of 13 project institutions. Con-
struction began in early 1976 and most of the project institutes are scheduled
for completion in late 1978. The estimated total project cost is about 25%
over the appraisal estimate. The Project Unit is functioning satisfactorily.
Loan No. 1329 Fourth Education Project; US$35.0 Million Loan of
November 18, 1976; Effective Date: January 14, 1977;
Closing Date: June 30, 1982
The project is designed to improve the quality of primary schooling
and to redress existing imbalances in the provision of primary education
by providing additiona:L classrooms in poverty areas, facilities for teacher
training and one teacher training college in Sarawak. The project includes
three new Industrial Training Centers and expansion of two existing ones. It
includes also a study on community education in preparation of government
investment in nonformal education. Project implementation began in January
1977 and appears satisfactory. Problems in the processing of disbursements
have been resolved.  Shortage of staff in the Project Unit is being remedied
by the Government.  Disbursements are expected to start on schedule in the
first half of FY78.
Loan No. 880   Population Project; US$5.0 Million Loan of February 9,
1973; Effective Date: June 21, 1973; Closing Date:
September 30, 1978
The civil works component continues to make progress. Out of 571
buildings, 127 have now been completed and another 101 are under construction.
Tenders have been awarded for an additional 17 buildings. Until recently,
the most delayed construction component has been the provision of 31 Family
Planning Clinics. This has now been corrected and of the 31 clinics two are
now in the stage of preparation of tender documents. Preparation of layout
site plans has been started for another 12 clinics. The National Family
Planning Board (NFPB) has selected a supplier for the computer to handle the
management information system; a draft contract is being prepared. A review
of the project was carried out by an external team of experts in April 1977.
Program performance in 1976 was even better than in 1975 when the number
of new acceptors was the highest since 1971.
