development\n            objectives of the Government to raise productivity and\n            incomes, and to reduce poverty. It would consist of the land\n            clearing and planning of a minimum 62,000 acres of rubber,\n            of up to 10,000 acres of cocoa in a pilot project, and of\n            500 acres of annual crops of an experimental basis. About\n            6,200 families would be settled in the rubber areas, and\n            1,500 additional families would work on cocoa. The present\n            incomes of these families fall beneath the poverty line. The\n            project includes ancillary roads, settler and staff housing,\n            and basic education, health, and community service\n            facilities. Project risks are related mainly to the price of\n            cocoa, which is, however, a small component, and to cocoa\n            pests and diseases."}, "docdt": "1978-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
