FE'LDA VI LAND SETTLEMENT PROJECT
(LOAN 1590-MAX
PREFACE
1.       The FELDA Land Settlement Project was  the sixth of a series of
Bank-financed FELDA land settlement schemes initiated in 1968. It was
appraised in 1977, and a Bank Loan for US$28.0 million was approved on
June 8, 1978 and signed on August 11, 1978. The loan became effective
on March 9, 1979. The total estimated cost of the project at completion
in 1990 is US$147.3 million, compared to US$92.3 million estimated at
appraisal. The loan was extended for one year, and at the time of final
disbursement, April 24, 1986, a considerable amount of infrastructure,
particularly settler houses and village amenities, were not complete.
The project's Closing Date was June 30, 1986.
2.       The  project was  designed  to  alleviate  rural  poverty  and
increase national export revenues from industrial crop production. It
also encouraged more  diversified  crops  for  export.    To address the
poverty issue, this project was designed to spread benefits more widely
than earlier projects by increasing the number of families settled and
reducing holding size and settlement costs per family.
3.       The PCR was  prepared  by  FELDA,  the government implementing
agency, with an Overview prepared by the East Asia and Pacific Regional
Office, now called the Asia Country Operations Department. The Overview
is based on the FELDA report and on information and reports contained in
Bank files. It highlights project achievements, discusses development
issues, underscores implementation problems and assesses FELDA and Bank
performance.   It  also  reflects  the  views  of  Bank  staff who were
associated with the project. The project has not been subjected to an
audit by the Operations Evaluation Departmenc (OED).
4.       The draft report was seat  to  the Borrower on August 12, 1987,
for their comments. Comments received have been taken into account in
and attached to the PCR as Annex 1.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
MALAYSIA - FELDA VI PROJECT (LOAN 1590-MA)
EVALUATION SUMMKARY
Introduction
FELDA VI Land Settlement Project is the sixth of a series of Bank-financed
FELDA land settlement schemes initiated in 1968. The project provided financial
and institutional support to FELDA, a Federal statutory agency responsible for
carrying out land development and settlement projects. The project supported
the Government's agricultural development objectives of eradicating rural pover-
ty, reinforcing Malaysia's predominant role in natural rubber and palm oil pro-
duction, and introducing new export crops so as to improve the stability of
foreign exchange earnings.
Obiectives
Main project objectives were alleviation of rural poverty and promotion of
increased export revenues from industrial crop production. It also encouraged
diversification of export crops. In addressing the poverty issue, the project
was designed to spread benefits more widely than earlier projects by increasing
the number of families settled and reducing holding size and settlement costs
per family. The objectives of the project were supportive of Government's agri-
cultural development objectives then, and are still relevant today. Speci-
fically, the project was to develop 29,000 ha of diversified tree crops and 200
ha of annual crops, and construct four urban centers/sub-centers, five villages
and related infrastru,ture and social services, for settlement of 6,200 families
and employment of an additional 1,500 workers who would eventually become
settlers.
Implementation Experience
The project met its agricultural development targets and planted 30,430 ha
of tree crops over nine years, two years longer than expected due to delayed
clearances by the State. Crop mix, however, was markedly different from target,
with 38% of the area planted tv rubber and 62% to oil palm, compared to the
appraisal target of 70% rubber, 27% oil palm, and 3% cocoa. The crop mix change
was appropriate and timely, and it improved project potential returns as the
market prospects of oil palm produce were much better than those of rubber, for
which the oil palm substituted. No cocoa was planted because soils at the pro-
posed sites were found unsuitable. 8,000 ha of the planted area were damaged by
animals, primarily elephants, and had to be replanted. FELDA has since de-
veloped, and now uses, a specially designed electric fence to protect young oil
palm from elephant forays. As of December 1986, 4,400 ha of rubber and 14,700
ha of oil palm were in production with yields close to appraisal estimates. Two
palm oil mills financed under the project were completed and commissioned, and
conformed to the high technical standards of the Malaysian oil palm industry and
Government's antipollution standards for effluent control. Milling performance
was satisfactory, although slightly lower than the private sector due to
variable fruit bunch quality.



- iv -
The project was, however, less successful in timely implementation of its
infrastructure program, having settled only 2,490 families, compared to the
6,200 target. One urban sub-center, fivs villages, and housing for the remain-
ing settlers have been delayed and will not be completed until 1990. Other
infrastructure and village amenities are in varioas stages of delay, and the
villages, as yet, do not have permanent water supplies. Construction of settler
houses can begin only after completion of a minimum level of infrastructure.
These infrastructure, implemented by State Planning Agencies over which FELDA
has no influence, were seriously delayed, reportedly, due to administrative
problems and lack of funds. The smaller farm size allocated under this project
exacerbated the pressure on settler incomes, particularly during the period of
low commodity prices, causing FELDA to undertake measures to maintain settler
incomes at an acceptable level, such as delaying settler intake and providing
fuller settler employment.
Total project costs at completion in 1990 are estimated at US $147.3 mil-
lion, 60% over the appraisal estimate of US$92.3 million. The overruns range
from 6% for settler houses, to 32% for agricultural development due to replant-
ing of areas damaged by elephants, to 82% for the seriously delayed village
infrastructure works. Despite the overruns, total cost per settler family is
estimated at US$21,200, higher than appraisal estimate, but similar to earlier
FELDA projects. The loan was fully disbursed and the project closed in April
1986, ten months behind schedule.
Results
The project rate of return has been reestimated at 14%, compared to the 18%
appraisal estimate, due to longer project implementation period, pest damage
which increased costs, and lower commodity price projections. The project rate
of return remains, nevertheless, very satisfactory, and is commensurate with
performance of earlier Bank-supported FELDA projects and underscores the sound-
ness and effectiveness of FELDA's development programs.
Findings and Lessons
Main project objectives of rural poverty alleviation and promotion of in-
creased export revenues from industrial crop production will have been achieved
at project completion in 1990. However, the project was not able to contribute
to export crop diversification, as cocoa and other annual crops were not planted
Four lessons learnt from project implementation are: i) An environmental
assessment, particularly of large-scale development impact on wildlife, must
form a part of basic project preparation. In this project, failure to evaluate
the project's impact on elephants previously inhabiting the project area led to
crop damage, hence cost overruns, and delays; ii) The need to assess physical
and budget capacity of all agencies involved in project implementation, to
ensure integrated and timely project implementation; i1i) The Bank to be more
cautious in prejudging the suitability of crops already well established in a
country; iv) The reduction of cost per settled family via reduced farm size
and, therefore, lower incomes can be counterproductive to the development of
self-sustaining rural communities in a middle-income country such as Malaysia.

MALAYSIA
FELDA VI PROJECT (LOAN 1590-MA,
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
Overview
1.1       This overview was prepared by the East Asia and Pacific Region Proj-
ects Department. It is based on the attached April 15, 1987 Project Comple-
tion Report (PCR) prepared by the Federal Land Development Authority (FELDA),
the government implementing agency, and on information and reports in Bank
files. It highlights project achievements, discusses development issues,
underscores implementation problems and assesses FELDA and Bank performance.
The loan was signed on August 11, 1978 for US$28 million and fully disbursed
on April 24, 1986, ten months into a one-year loan extension. At that time,
all agricultural works had been completed, except for some replanting due to
pest damage, but a considerable amount of infrastructure, particularly settler
houses and village amenities, is not yet complete.
1.2       Project Objectives.  The project is the sixth in a series of Bank-
financed FELDA land settlement schemes initiated in 1968. Its overall objec-
tives were the alleviation of rural poverty and the increase of national
export revenues from industrial crop production.  It also encouraged more
diversified export crops. In addressing the poverty issue, the project was
designed to spread benefits more widely than earlier projects by increasing
the number of families settled and reducing holding size and settlement costs
per family.
1.3       Specific project objectives were the development of about
72,000 acres (29,100 ha) of tree crops, made up of 62,000 acres (25,100 ha) of
rubber and 10,000 acres (4,050 ha) of cocoa, the establishment of 500 acres
(200 ha) of annual cropping; construction of two urban centers, two urban sub-
centers, five villages with inftastructure and social services, and settlement
of about 6,200 families with rubber and hiring of about 1,500 workers for
cocoa who would eventually become settlers.
1.4       Project Preparation to Effectiveness.  Preparation, which began with
a Bank April 1976 identification mission, was very protracted. Issues
included the generally high unit settler cost, appropriate farm size and
narrow crop base of FELDA's program, and FELDA's financial reserves.
1.5       Bank strategy aimed at enhancing the impact on rural poverty by
lowering settler costs from about US$20,000 to as little as US$7,000 per
family--in line with area development schemes in other parts of the world.
This would be achieved principally by reducing farm size from 14 acres to
10 acres (5.6 to 4.0 ha) per family. Lengthy discussions ensued around these
two issues since the proposed changes were not reflected in Government policy
for FELDA, which was to ensure an annual family income of about US$3,600.
FELDA warned that smaller farm sizes could lead to inadequate farm incomes and



- vi -
that provision would have to be made for automatic rescheduling of settler
loan repayments in times of weak commodity prices. (FELDA's 6- to 8-acre
rubber lots in schemes of the 1960s were quoted as failing to provide target
income levels). The Project Performance Audit Report of April 1978 for the
FELDA Jengka I project (Loan 533-MA), in referring to the high cost of FELDA
schemes, commented that the Bank should not feel embarrassed to be associated
with successful schemes if such an investment level was needed.
1.6       On crop diversification, the Bank was not at that time prepared to
support further developments of oil palm, even though Bank Commodities Paper
No. 23 recommended Bank support for oil palm in countries where the crop had
high priority for poverty alleviation. Malaysia had already emerged as a
highly efficient oil palm producer, and the crop promised major benefits for
smallholders in organized production units. On the other hand, rubber did not
evoke any Bank concerns despite less bullish market prospects and high labor
requirements. To promote diversification, the Bank agreed to sizable cocoa
development (4,000 ha) despite the concern of the International Cocoa Organi-
zation on encouraging cocoa planting in countries which were not members of
the International Cocoa Agreement.
1.7       In view of FELDA's substantial reserves, there were qu.tions
whether the Bank should continue to finance their development program. The
loan was eventually justified on the grounds that FELDA's development program
focused on rural poverty for which large credit reserves were needed to main-
tain minimum family incomes when commodity prices were low.
1.8       Appraisal took place in October 1977.  Prior to negotiations in June
1978, Government and FELDA agreed to 10-acre (4-ha) settler farm units and new
settler loan repayment schedules were issued. The project would develop
rubber and cocoa only and the Bank loan would be onlent to FELDA at an agreed
interest rate. The Bank expressed preference for time-slice financing of
FELDA's investment budget, but the Government, concerned about their commit-
ment to 30% Bumiputra procurement preference, strongly favored project finan-
cing. The Bank accepted their position. The loan was approved on June 8,
1978 and signed on August 11, 1978, but it was not until March 9, 1979 that it
became effective due to Government delays in agreeing loan onlending terms to
FELDA.
1.9       Retroactive Financing.  During project preparation and the period
before the loan became effective, land development works proceeded. As there
was no provision for retroactive financing, some major contracts for early
land development were thus ineligible for financing.
1.10      Amendments to Loan Agreement.  rhree amendments to the Loan Agree-
ment were agreed during project implementation. Two significantly modified
the scope of project works and the third was for loan extension. The first
amendment of January 6, 1982 substituted five new schemes in the Cerul and
Tembangau complexes for five schemes of a similar total hectarage in Bukit
Sagu and Krau complexes (PCR para. 2.4). This change was the outcome of seri-
ous delays in obtaining Forestry Department clearances which FELDA needed
before accessing tite land and which stemmed from protracted logging operations
and in some areas, security problems. This amendment also substantially



- vIA -
changed tle crop mix and number of settler families while total crop area
increased marginally to 29,750 ha. Rubber was reduced by 4,200 ha (17Z) to
about 20,900 ha, and cocoa by 3,200 ha (79X) to 850 ha, compensated by the
addition of 8,000 ha of oil palm, or 27X of the target planting area. Settler
families, originally for rubber only but now also for oil palm, were increased
pro rata by 1,170 to 7,370 families. The proposed 200 ha of annual crops was
eliminated for lack of interest. The main crop changes reflected the increas-
ing economic attractiveness of growing oil palm versus rubber and, in the case
of cocoa, the unsuitability of soils in allocated areas. The second amend-
ment, October 24, 1983, introduced loan tinancing for two palm oil mills and
consultant services for other projects. A ttird amendment of January 25, 1985
extended the loan closing date by one year to June 30, 1986, to accommodate
delayed agticultural implementation.
Review of Project Implementation
1.11      Overall Project Achievements.  From 1977 through 1985, the project
cleared 34,340 ha of logged forest lands for agricultural use and settlement
iv six comaplexes comprising 17 schemes and planted about 30,430 ha, thus fully
achieving the project's agricultural target. Some 18,740 ha (46,290 ac) were
planted with oil palm and 11,690 ha (28,870 ac) with rubber, the balance being
areas required for infrastructure development and some waste lands. There
were some severe losses after planting due to animal pests, particularly ele-
phant, amounting to about 241 of the total area (PCR para. 2.4). By December
1986, some 14,700 ha of oil palm and 4,400 ha of rubber were in production
with yields close to appraisal estimates. The project has been less success-
ful, however, in its infrastructure program. To da.e some 2,490 families have
been settled and house construction for a revised 6,335 families in five urban
centers, one subcenter and two villages will not be completed until 1990 (PCR
paras. 2.5.1, 2.6 and Quarterly Progress Report, December 1986). Settlement
access and internal roads, staff quarters and offices and village amenities
are likewise in various stages of implementatica. As yet, villages do not
have permanent water supplies. The two palm oil mills with a combined proces-
sing capacity of 108 tons of fresh fruit bunches (ffb) per hour were construc-
ted at the end of i983 and 1984, but commissioning of the second was delayed
until June 1986 because of insufficient ffb supplies (PCR para. 2.7). The
project-funded consultant services, provided over several years for the prepa-
ration of design works for the FELDA Land Settlement Infrastructure Project
(Loan 2642-MA), were completed and full7 disbursed.
1.12      Agricultural Development.  Progress in land development did not
follow the appraisal program by phasing or by crop mix as shown in Table 1.
Although the project was designed for implementation over seven years, agri-
cultural works extended over nine years. One of the additional years (1977)
was absorbed during the extended period from project appraisal to loan signing
(para. 1.8) and the second (1985) was necessary to complete the delayed field
work program. Further, the annual phasing of field work was uneven, primarily
because of land availability problems associated with Forestry Department
clearances.

Crop mix was markedly different from that targeted. Oil palm was planted over
62% of the total project area against a target of 27% and rubber over 38% of
the area against an original target of 58%. No cocoa was planted, nor was
there any sustained annual cropping. During implementation, oil palm emerged
as a preeminently profitable crop for Malaysia with a very favorable long-term
market demand; and it became increasingly the choice of both FELDA and the
settlers. In contrast, rubber had a much less bullish future. Except for
some sites agrotopopgraphically more favorable for rubber than oil palm
(Tembangau 3, Lepar Hilir 5, both hilly areas), FELDA greatly reduced the
importance of rubber in its planting program from 1980; 75% of the final
rubber area being established in 1977-79, while oil palm accounted for 85% of
all 1980-85 plantings. Differences in total unit development costs of oil
palm and rubber, however, are small and these crop mix changes had little
impact on total project costs but greatly improved potential returns. For
cocoa the soils of the proposed sites were found to be unsuitable ard the
higher risks of the crop compared to oil palm deterred FELDA from pianting.
The failure to sustain the pilot areas of annual crops reflected lack of
interest both of FELDA and the settlers in the program.



- ix -
1.13      This project, like earlier FELDA projects, was plagued by pest
damage to young oil palm plantings, particularly elephant (40%) but also por-
cupine, wild boar and rat. Accumulated damage totaling about 8,000 ha, 27% of
the planted area, has been particularly heavy in several scheme complexes
amounting to 80% in one scheme (Lepar Hilir 2) and exceeding 20% in five
others, Thus crop establishment and settler programs were delayed and costs
increased. Early efforts to combat elephant incursions by deep perimeter
trenches were ineffective. Success came with a technique developed by FELDA
in association with Australian consultants of installing a ringle, two-strand,
electric fence at jungle boundaries costinp about M$2,700/km. More recently,
double fences have been used for severe elephant incursions.
1.14      Crop Production.  The PCR reports crop production to end-1985 only,
at which time 6,910 ha of oil palm (37% of total) was in production and
1,185 ha of rubber (10% of total) had been in tapping for one year. Mean
first-year yields were close to appraisal estimates for both crops--second-
year yields for oil palm are too fragmentary to evaluate. The appraisal yield
profile for oil palm in the years of increasing and peak production (years 5
through 11 with A mean peak of 25.1 tons/ha), however, appears to be rather
optimistic.
1.15      Palm Oil Mills.  Financing of two 54-ton palm oil mills at the
Serting antd Lepar Hilir scheme complexes was part of FELDA's planned network
of processing facilities. Technically, the mills meet the high standards of
the Malaysian oil palm industry and conform to Government's antipollution
standards for effluent control. Milling performances have been satisfactory
but slightly lower than the private sector because of more variable fruit
bunch quality. FELDA has intensified campaigns and training for settlers to
assist them in upgrading harvesting efficiency (PCR para. 2.8.2). Disburse-
ment against eligible costs of the mills was largely completed in 1984.
1.16      Scheme Infrastructure.  Construction of settler houses, scheme
office and staff quarters and urban center/village roads, water supplies and
amenities has been very slow. A considerable amount remains to be completed,
including about 3,600 settler houses (57X of the recently adjusted target,
para. 1.11), office and staff quarters for two complexes, several roads, all
permanent water supply systems and inost of the school and health center facil-
ities (PCR paras. 2.5.1, 2.5.2, 2.5.3, 2.5.4). Implementation is expected to
be cfmpleted by 1990. Due to these infra.tructure delays, FELDA has been
unable to proceed with much of the planned settler housing program. Programs
other than houses are the responsibility of State Planning Agencies, such as
DARA for the State of Pahang; the Town and Country Planning Department, for
village layout design; and State Public Works Departments for design and
construction of roads and water supplies. FELDA held regular meetings with
these agencies and was able to make some contributions towards solving their
implementation problems. Factors cited for the delays include delayed
forestry clearances, delayed preparation of site plans and lack of funds.
1.17      Settler Program.  Construction of houses and village facilities for
scheme settlers lagged far behind the project plan. By September 1986, only
2,390 settlers had been emplaced and an additional 300 houses constructed. A
further 1,180 settlers are expected for 1987 but the program now aiming to
settle about 6,300 families is not expected to be completed until 1990,



several years after crops have come into production. The fewer number of
families is the result of FELDA'9 recent change in settler terms from land
ownership to a settler share system (PCR para. 2.3(a) and (b)]. There are
several reasons for the delayed settler program.
(a) Increasingly FELDA has delayed the intake of settlers until the end
of the crop immaturity period to ensure them a higher, more stable
income, instead of providing sporadic employment during crop imma-
turity;
(b) in response to the recent fall in commodity prices, FELDA has de-
layed bringing settlers into schemes even during early crop maturity
to ensure blttler incomes above the poverty level;
(c) delays in the provision of settlement facilities, particularly water
and roads by other line agencies. Bank financing of the FELDA Land
Settlement Infrastructure Project (Loan 2642-MA) is addressing this
problem;
(d) delays in the land development program; and
Ce) insufficient settlers for schemes in states such as Pahang which
insist on a minimum level of participation of state residents.
Project Costs
1.18      Total project costs at completion in 1990 are estimated at US$147.3
million, compared to the appraisal estimate of US$92.3 million, an increase of
60%. Expenditure to end-1985, four months before full loan disbursement and
closing was about US$95 million, about two thirds of total project cost.
Expenditures by work categories and expected overruns are shown in Table 2.

The extent of the overruns range from 6% for settler houses to 82% for seri-
ously delayed village infrastructure works. The 32% overrun for agricultural
development reflects, in large part, the costs of replanting extensive areas
damaged by pests and the costs of pest control (PCR para. 3.1.1). Actual cost
of land development at the end of the development period is estimated at about
US$2,380/ha, while the total cost per settler family will be approximately
US$21,200, similar to earlier FELDA projects.
Economic Rate of Return
1.19      The project internal rate of return has been reestimated at 14%.  It
is based on constant 1985 dollars and the Bank's 1987 commodity price fore-
casts and excludes the development costs of social infrastructure (settler
houses, village roads and amenities) and mill processing. The revised ERR
crmrpares with the 13.8% of the PCR and 18.0% of the appraisal report. How-
ever, the PCR estimate is based on 1980 constant prices and much higher Bank
commodity price projections, and included all social and milling infrastruc-



- xii -
ture costs. The appraisal estimate was a combined rate fhr rubber and cocoa
only. The reestimated ERR is considered very satisfactory in view of the long
project implementation period, the extent of pest damage and the vicissitudes
of commodity prices. It is commensurate witn performances of earlier Bank-
supported FELDA projects and reflects the basic soundness of FELDA's develop-
ment programs.
Project Issues
1.20      Environmental Protection.  Although the risks of elephant damage to
new plantings along jungle boundaries, particularly in Pahang schemes, was
predictable from experience, no advance planning was undertaken to counteract
the problem. There was no reference to possible elephant damage at appraisal
and no record of any FELDA/Wildlife Department dialogue. The environmental
impact of the project was only considered in terms of i.and and water conserva-
tion. It is well known that elephants follow traditional traveling routes and
that displaced animals frequently return to their old feeding grounds. The
location and extent of elephant habitats bordering the project areas should
have been examined as part of project preparation and measures considered for
the preservation of the elephant population, including leaving major corridors
of elephant movement undisturbed and maintaining the animals' access to the
main forest spine of the Peninsula.
1.21      Urban and Village Centers.  Although the project will eventually
develop eight urban centers/villages, the program has fallen behind schedule.
This can be attributed to delayed planting, generally unfavorable economic
conditions, and the difficulties of integrating and implementing interagency
programs because of planning, budget, implementation and scheduling problems.
However, the urban development targets of the project may be too ambitious in
relation to the size of the agricultural settlement schemes and existing urban
facilities (especially as, for example, at Serting, which is within a few
miles of thriving Bahau town). In many respects, the project repeats the
experience of FELDA's Keratong Land Settlement project (Loan 1044-MA).
Clearly it is necessary for Government and the Bank to carefully assess the
need for urban infrastructure for schemes which are close to established
villages and towns, and to review the past performance and capabilities of
support agencies at appraisal to obtain commitment and realistic scheduling.
It may be preferable, at least for villages, to assign the infrastructure
budget to FELDA who would be responsible for implementation using designs and
supervision of support agencies.
1.22      Farm Size.  The smaller farm size allocated under this project,
which is now standard in FELDA schemes, has serious implications for farmer
income. However, the changeover from ownership to a share system of scheme
operation, with the number of settlers/ha determined by work force require-
ments rather than a predetermined ha/settler land share, recognizes the need
to enhance settler incomes. Further, the established farm size becomes an
immutable quantity under FELDA's settler loan agreement. The low commodity
prices have also caused FELDA to delay settler intake until full crop produc-
tion to ensure fuller settler employment [PCR para. 1.16 (a)), but this may
not be enough to counter the small farm size. The situation will continually
erode as crop production technology changes and reduces labor requirements.



- xiii -
For example, the recent introduction of the pollinating weevil into planta-
tions has eliminated the need for labor-intensive artificial pollination.
FELDA estimates that a settler and his family can maintain about 10 ha of
immature oil palm and 6.5 ha of the mature crop compared to the current FELDA
allotment of 4 ha [PCR para. 2.3(b)].  Thus, the Bank's insistence at project
preparation on smaller farms may vventually prove to have been unwise.
1.23      Annual Cropping.  The pilot annual cropping subproject aimed at
demonstrating ways to provide a more stable and adequate farmer income during
immaturity of the main crop. General experience within FELDA and elsewhere
had already indicated that cash crops could be disappointing because of lack
of farmer interest, poor agronomic knowledge and practice, labor constraints
and farmer reaction to longer working hours in lieu of leisure, and that costs
often outweighed crop benefits. Although proposed after amendment as a 200-ha
program, only 98 ha using three crop systems were established under the proj-
ect. Appropriate technology was demonstrated but there was little support due
to high costs and low returns, the difficulty of its implementation under the
system of plantation agriculture and poor settler response. FELDA was unen-
thusiastic and the program was dropped from the 1982 amended loan agreement.
Unfortunately, there is no reference to this project component in the PCR.
Procurement
1.24      Procurement was frequently an area of difficulty between the bor-
rower and the Bank. Problems concerned procurement of fertilizers, negotiated
contracts, and the prior review threshold.
(a) Fertilizer Procurement. The Bank questioned the competitive ade-
quacy of LCB bidding for fertilizers. The established government
system required that all fertilizer be imported through one or a
combination of seven licensed import firms, consisting of four large
foreign fertilizer manufacturer/distributors and three local import-
ers. Distribution was preserved for 18 local Bumiputra companies.
Wo distributor or Government agency was permitted to use ICB. The
seven importers were questionably providing FELDA, one of their
largest consumers, with adequate exposure to world market forces,
particularly when demand exceeded local supplies. The Bank and
FELDA reviewed the situation. Eventually no change was made in the
arrangement as FELDA, which was interested in access to a more open
market for timely supply of its requirements, went on to install its
own fertilizer mixing plants in association with one of the import-
ers under a subsidiary corporation (FELDA is primarily a user of
mixtures fertilizers). This corporation subsequently tendered com-
petit.!vely against other suppliers with considerable success. The
Bank wav also unhappy with Government procedures of distribution
that excluded importers from participating in awards to distribute,
even though they were often tendering competitively for such work.
For purposes of loan financing, it was agreed that lowest bidders,
of which there were often several including importers, would be
awarded equal participation in the contracts.



- xiv -
(b) Negotiations. FELDA frequently practiced bid negotiation with low
bidders before making awerds and the Bank disallowed several early,
substantial contracts for financing. The Bank declared May 1, 1983
as the date after which no negotiated contracts would be eligible
for Bank financing. The elimination of tender negotiations, how-
ever, had one bizarre effect on fertilizer procurement. FELDA ten-
dered project fertilizers separately from the very much larger bulk
of fertilizers purchased for all other FELDA schemes under negotia-
ted contracts. The result was higher unit prices for the project's
smaller quantities, a disadvantage borne by project settlers.
(c) Prior Review Thresholds. During the course of the project, the
threshold value of contracts for Bank prior review was raised from
US$0.5 million to US$2.5 million (October 21, 1981). This change,
along with the acceptance of SOEs for contracts up to US$0.25 mil-
lion (April 19, 1983), expedited loan utilization.
FELDA Performance
1.25      FELDA has had long experience with the Bank through a series of
successful and well-implemented projects and its performance with this sixth
project was also satisfactory. This was particularly the case in respect of
agricultural development, the main project component. FELDA standards of land
clearing, planting and crop maintenance are acknowledged to be generally in
line with the high standards of Malaysian private sector estates. Operational
standards of the palm oil mills is also very satisfactory. As a result and in
view of the attractive palm oil prices of recent years, FELDA settlers have
enjoyed good incomes up to the onset of the currently low commodity prices.
Like the Bank, FELDA did not foresee the problems of elephant damage, but it
did take effective remedial action.  FELDA was also responsive to term trends
of commodity prices of rubber and palm oil, adapting the crop mix at planting
to reflect relative crop returns. Thus, the proportion of oil palm to rubber
in the project far exceeded earlier planning. FELDA was not successful, how-
ever, in cocoa as project areas initially proposed for development were later
found to be pedologically unsuitable, indicating inadequate evaluations.
1.26      Although FELDA's procurement was initially not in line with Bank
guidelines, they responded positively to Bank requests to comply and the prob-
lems disappeared. In disbursements, FELDA was very lax up to 1983 in making
loan withdrawal applications--later they responded very positively to Bank
concerns by exercising a high level of cooperation with Bank missions in
revising their internal accounting system.
Bank Performance
1.27      The Bank continued to maintain and develop its excellent long-
standing relationship with FELDA. It assisted implementation chrough informal
technical advice and guidance, particularly on agricultural development, which
was well received. Through frank dialogue on development issues, it success-
fully persuaded FELDA to make innovations, such-as decreasing the unit size of
land allocated to each settler. Further, through mutual understanding, the
Bank was able to effectively assist FELDA to modify its administrative proce-



-xv-
dures !or the identification and processing of project expenditures for loan
dist,ursement. The Bank was less successful in encouraging FELDA to develop
annual cropping for supplementary seLLler income.  FELDA and the settlers
lacked enthusiasm and it was closed with little positive result. Annual crop-
ping was, however, an example of a Bank-imposed subproject which, although
conceptually attractive, was not practical under local conditions and did not
appear to fit the social priorities of the settlers. Bank performance was
also weak in the project village infrastructure program. Justification for
urban centers and the difficulties of integrating multiagency involvement were
not addressed or were underestimated at preparation. The capacity of support
agencies to implement project components was not appraised. As a result,
housing and village services were not implemented in a timely fashion and much
remains for completion or modification in scope after loan closing. Project
supervision was inadequate (once a year) during the first two years when the
project had implementation difficulties.
Lessons Learned
1.28      The main lessons to be learned are:
(a)  Development of smallholder agriculture on a plantation basis through
an experienced, well-managed parastatal agency can be both economic-
ally and technically effective, even though in Malaysia the invest-
ment cost/family or unit of land may be considerably higher than in
other countries. It is also acceptable to smallholders, and benefi-
cial to government in terms of efficient use of physical and human
resources and export revenues.
(b)  Impacts of large-scale tree crop development on wildlife popula-
tions, their habitats and their movements must form part of the
environmental assessment of a project. Failure to evaluate their
potential impact on project performance (elephants in the case of
this project) can lead to costly investment increases and program
delays.
(c)  The physical and budgetary capacity of all agencies involved in
project implementation must be assessed and their agreement obtained
at appraisal to ensure integrated and timely project implementation.
The lead project agency is often unable to obtain the required coop-
eration and timely actions.
(d)  The Bank should be very cautious in prejudging the appropriateness
of developing a technically suitable crop in a country which already
has an established reputation for efficient tree crop production.
In not initially supporting oil palm, the Bank did not seem to be
acting in the best interests of the country and for consumers at
large.
(e)  Smaller farm sizes for land schemes to accommodate more settlers is
basically counterproductive to the development of prosperous and
self-sustaining rural communities in a middle-income country such as
Malaysia.



- xvi -
(f) Innovations for pilot project testing need to be appropriate for
local conditions, both physical and human. Thus, efforts to intro-
duce annual cropping to supplement farmer income was unlikely to
succeed given low farmer interest, particularly when their incomes
were satisfactory, labor required and social norms of utilization of
time.

The PEWM VI land S&ttleant Project aim  to establish about 7,370
srallholdings of rubber, oil palm and cocoa on 29,826 hectare of land
organised into seventeen sdwms. A World Bank loan of M$73 million
(US$28 million) has bee obtained to help co-finmce the project csts.
The project has been carried out over a period of nine years, 1977
through 1985. At appraisal, the principal project ccoxnits were :-
a)  Develcpnt of a mini== of 20,882 hectares of rubber,
about 8,094 hectares of oil palm and about 850
hectares of coooa (as a pilot project);
b)  Cocstruction of (i) five urban centr,  ne urban suboentre
and  three  villages  including  office  buildins,  staff
quarters, settlers' houses, store  ard commmty centres; and
ii) access roads, settlet roads, sdhools, clinics and
other social amenities;
c)  Enlact of about 7,370 families.
The agricultural develcpent, hboing, constuction of processing
facilities and project mang enent will be ndertaken by FELDA while the
construction of roads, water supply systems and public buildings such
as schools and clinics will be implemented by the Public Works
Depaurtent. The proceeds of the loan were utilised to co-finance only
the activities underktaen by FEERA.

and highwys and FEfl roads.
2.2 OveralL Develont P
The Project comwncod developwit in the fcrth quarter of 1976
with its first scheme, Lepr Hilir 1.  In view of the slow
disbursat~nt rate as a result of iqplemrntaticn problems because
of inmsiticn of security procedures and delays in forestry
clearance, certain schme in Bkit Sagu Ocplex (5,6 and 7) and
Krau CaVlex (3 and 4) wre replaced with Ce0ul COuplex (1 ard 2)
and Tembangau Cmplex (2,3 ard 4). There were also saxe changes of
crop in the project area due to the soil ard terrain comditions.
The project thus was planted with 18,738 hectares of oil palm and
11,687 hectares of rubber.  To date there are 2,490 settler
families living in settllints in two urban centres, one urban
sub-cenr and two villages. Rubber in tree shes and oil palm
in forteen schemes have come into production and the oil palm
fruit frcm Serting Camplex are processed at Serting Mill with a
capacity of 54 tons of FF per hour. The harvest frnm the other
producing sdhemes are sent to the nearby palm oil mills and rubber
factories outside the project area.
Retaive financing,  owever, was not granted by the Bank znd
financin only started at the end of 1979. The witrwal of loan
proceeds was cmpleted in April, 1986.

ampleted whe the last rubbe area com  into productin in 1990.
2.3 Onhip And 5har s
a) i p  
on enterirg a scbem,, under the owneship sytem a settler is
provided with a house cn 0. 1 hectare lot ard an agrial
holdin of 4 hectares of rubber or oil palm or both. In schwas
with both rutbb  and oil palm the ratio is normaly 3:1.
settlers in schems with rubber and oil palm are allocated
iividual lots for rubber which is also the main crop. HMwer,
oil palm is not pecifically identified but located within an area
or block of 20 hectares identified to 20 settlers.  mey are
registered as occupiers in     ation of a share euivalent of 1
hectare. Unlike rubber which is worked individually, this   stem
has proven to be an effective econamic system especially at the
tt. of harvestinx as this activity together with transport and
processiq is very critical and if left to individuals, could
caus financial losses.
In rubber sdhemes, the settlers begin loan repaymAnt whe rubber
omI into producticn. Hwever for oil palm, settlers do not
iiatelyt oce  loan repayment cn entering the harvesting
stage. Pepayment only begins hen breakevm is achieved betwee 2
1/2 to 3 years frmm the start of harvesting depending on the yield
and the price. Loan repaymt for both rubber and oil palm is
normally calculated  over 15 years.   on  mpleticn  of loan
repayment for nibber, individual title would be issued to the
settlers by the State Goverrent. Meanwhile for oil palm a block
title wlad be issued by the State Goverment to a co-opertive
society set up solely for the purpose of land ownrship. To date
no such titles have bee issued in the project.

fcr the cpa tion.  Settlers are paid wages for wek duie as
well as dividend and bous frm profits mad by the crporations.
7th  labour         I in a Share System is based on the settler
to land ratio vhereby for oil palm iiamature areas the ratio is 1:
10.1 hectares; mature . : 6.5 hectares while rubber for imture
areas 1 : 14.2 hectares and for matu   areas 1 : 4.0 hectares.
Although the area varies, each settler is entitled to a share
equivalent to 4.0 hwctares only.
2.4. Agricluazlblvo1
D~ve1~nt in this project has generally been carried out on
sdsdule without much delay.  At the time of the preparation of
this report about 18,738 hwtares of oil palm and ll,687 hectares
of rubber have been planted and 2,490 families settled.
The erlier develcpmnt of the project was slightly delayed due to
security prvblm and dolays in foetry clearance  dch reslted
in Ec. Saga 5,6 and 7 ard  Kau 3 and 4 being replaced with the
Ceul 1 and 2 and TsiaugaU 2, 3 and 4.
Past attack has caued significant delay for se of the project
areas thus affecting production.  Wild boas and elehants have
been identified to be the major pests, each destryn  about 24%
of total damaged area, follnwd by porcupines and rats with 11%
each. Mhe total area damaged by pests were 8,321 hectares.
Past attack was very evident in Lepar  iir 2 (21%), Sorting 2
(21%), Serting 1 (12%), Serting 4, eper Hilir 1 and 10au 2 (7*
each) and Ispar  ilir 5 (5%).  In the meantime, fire destrye
about 809 hectares of rubber area in Setting 1 and 167 hectars in
Serting 3 both in 1981 and 397 hctares in tpar Blur 2 in 1983.
lephaknt irtrusion is being cx1oed throu  the l1       a     of
electric fencing. Por this project am 141 km. of electric fence
have been erected fron 1980 and          io  of about L1Im. of
electric fence in Tqb3sau 2 is still in pror_s.  To comter
the attack by wild boars, porcupines and rats, shoting and



intenive r-at baiting are being carried cut. Pesticlies whidh
nlude colltar and zinc phosphate are applied and the assistance
of Gana Departeent is enlisted.  Wild boar electric fenoe ard

in scme cases eaf youg palm and rubb  tree is protected by wire
retting or batted femc. Pasats have been             . Works on

exeption of Leper Hilir 5 and Krau 2 whereby sulplying of about
560 bectares of pest dauad area are currently in progress and
will omiplete by 1987.
Apart fr:m the abe r l  enblers, develcpwnt stardards

settler intake for the remainir  sdta     is inevitably
delayed wing to the fact that the povision for basic
infrastructure such as roads and water supply have not bee
omletely fulfiled.  DUe to the above, a large nuaber of
s8hms are still without settlers and it is envisaged that
settlers intalk will cnly be cmLpleted by 1990. To date
2,490  (34%) settlers have been settled.   The appraisal

Oil palm in Leper     r 1 c     into harvest in
Octcber 1984, while rubber in the sam scbema cam
into tapping in January 1985, which were acoarding
to schedule.
An analysis of the average F  yield per hectare
over a tw year period is carried out for the
prject area as illustrated in Aindx IV. Th
appedix indicates that the average yield for the
first and second Year of prodctiCn is 96.8% and
58.6% respectively against estimated yield.  sie
low yield especially  in the  soon  year can
perhaps be attributed to the fact that mst of the
palm are in the firt year of producticn and oly
a few in the second year of production.
For the purpose of  al                production,

2.8.2.   Oil And KErnl  Kaction Bate
The oil palm produce fra  Sertis  catplex are
processed at Serting mill whchave been cmis-
sioned in Novber 1983. Besides Serting Omlex
the mill als  serve  Sertig Hilir, TOdangau,
Palon  Oplexes, Lui Mida and Lui TIn2 which are
all outside this project.   The oil extraction
rates as recorded at the mi   fell short of
FEL's estimated rates as illustrated in
=(a.Hwer  the keHnl reovery rates were
slightly higher than FELl's estimated rates as
illustrated in  A02).   he av                    oil
extraction rates of Serting mill were indicated as
15.23% for 1983, 19.16% for 1984, 18.68% for 1985
and 18.88% for 1986 (up to July).
The kernel recovery rates were given as 3.35% for
1983, 4.69% for 1984, 5.54% for 1985 and 5.60% for
1986 (up to July).
The kernel extracticn rate is slightly l1r Am
compared to the private sector. EXtraction rates
are affected by a muber of factors such as
agrwnomic practices, weather conditions and FFB
quality. FFB quality is also affected by the
social and econcmic norms of the settlers. PFEL
is very sensitive to this issue and are aware of
the considerable losses that settlers have to
bear. Various steps have been taken to isprove
the extraction rates. An aalysis called 'Mams
Passing through the Digester' (MPD) is carried out
to determine the oil content of the PFF barvested
and processing losses, if any.  The settlers are
made aware of the results so that they realise the
recessity of bavesting quality fruits. Cewpaigre
at schbaes lve,l have also been intensified by the
mill and sdhme co-ordination ocimittee which
attempts to make the settlers eqyally re ble
for the efficiency of 173 extraction rates.
Training ccurses are condbcted for sdhue staff
and settlers to instill upon them the financial
consequence of low extraction rates. FFB grading
is not carried out in the  wms served by

The processing cost of per ton of FrB varies with the FP
throu*qat.   The prooessing cost was etoeptionally high
during the first year of oaeissioning due to the low
throuht of the mill.
The promessing cost of the mill is shxn  Aind 
After 1983, the records showed a satisfactory poessing
cost after mre scbes cam  into production.

they were engaged in the field mintenaic work. one rubber
scheme has     into tapping namely Lepar Hilir 1 tiase 1.
Settlers have not cbtained d*ne frm the oil palm areas

for the two Share System Sw*   wsher settles have been
eAaced rnmely, 1rau 1 Roa  1 and Tembangau 2  oase I.
An analysis of AgRpixi XiV (a) indicates that each settler

systm is M$225.75 in 1985 and N$242.23 in 1986 (up to June)
while under the Share System the average ince is m$179.14
for 1985 and M$225.46 for 1986 (up to Jue). The average
is=9 for settlers mder both systms is taken fr. a few
scMa (1 sChet for  onrship system and 2 s&hm for

Oher factors u*iih          t e  to the oost
overrtm are the  aian  field operaticos
and the cost of fertilizers arnd pesticides.  Due
to  pest attack, exteive areas have to  be

3.1.2.   HOUSir  And ROs t DTot
Actal cost icrred uxer tbis category indicate
an incease of 46% over the appraisal estivate.
qis is due to the rising prices of timbes and
others bilding materials in 1978, 1979 and 1980.
The avecage price of a settlers house estimated at
appraisal uNs N$2,065.00. The actbal price per
unit in the MDR VI ?roJeat was M$3,973.00, an
increase by 92.4% per unit.
Another factor which              to the cost
ovem was the delay in hos c tti    due to
delay in the      ion of lay-out plans.  As
such sehmes under project are not fully settled.
The schms affected by this delay are Iar Hilir
5, B1cit Sagu 2,3 & 4, Iar 1 & 2, TeiDanga 2,3 &
4 and Cerul 1 & 2.
For an estiation   of the cost of       r   the
balance of the settler houses, an average unit
price of M$3,600 was used.  ihe remaining settler
hoses are snpcted to be cmrpleted by 1990.
3.1.3.   MM
Tee is no cost overtm for mill cnistruction
because there is no provision for this ccqxnent

Under the  1Aneshp  system  loan  to  settler  oavering
agricultural developit cot (ixnli4    wages pai  to the
settler during the develcpint period) and housing are
repayable at 6 1/4%  ove  15 years after the 6 yers
develcpment period for oil palm and 8 years for rubber
during which interest is capitalised. Hove  the interest
dharged varies; it was waived from 1981 to 1984 but in 1985
the interest was reinstated at 4%. The total lan which the
settler has to repay for 4 hectares oil palm is about
1$32,396 and rnbber M$31,256.  Loan repayment for oil palm
is colle¢ted at the tim  when yield are suff nt to
provide an adequate inoz  of a    i y  M$350 per wmth
for the settler after deducting debt cbligations. In ubber
schemes, loan repayment begis when the area come into
production.
3.4 Pate O£f
At appraisal the combined rate of return for rnbe  and
oocoa was calculated at 18%. Using equxivalent
but with cost and benefits exressed in 1980 constant prices
the  cobined rate of retn for rubbe  and oil palm is
estinated to be 13.6% as show. in    X          XNX.  A lr
rate of return is i   cated due to the Inceased e    tue
of the project.
Fcr the  calclatio   of the  rate  of return, various
assipticns were mde as follow:-
i)  cost and benefits were expessed in 1980 cotan
prices.
ii) value of P prodluction were calculated on x-farm
prices as shown in Aiendix XVI (a).
iii) rubber cperation oot  were projected frz  1987 onwds
while that of 1982 to 1986 wer actual costs hich have
been included under            developent.
