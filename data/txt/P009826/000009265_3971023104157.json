to improve the utilization of\n            existing assets; and to strengthen the IR organization in\n            selected operational areas.  The project consists of:  (a)\n            electrification of some 3000 route kilometers of IR's\n            7500 route-kilometers program for the remainder of this\n            decade, focusing  on the major trunk routes between New\n            Delhi, Bombay, Madras, and Calcutta, together with provision\n            of ancilliary testing and maintenance equipment; (b)\n            modernization of six major workshops, the Integral Coach\n            Factory (ICF), and selected maintenance depots; (c)\n            provision of advisory services and training for the\n            electrification and workshop modernization components."}, "docdt": "1984-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
