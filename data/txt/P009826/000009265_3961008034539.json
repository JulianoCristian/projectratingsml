         private Indian analysts retained by the Bank. The main\n            objectives of the project were to: (i) increase capacity to\n            meet growing traffic demand, (ii) improve utilization of\n            motive power, rolling stock and track, (iii) improve cost\n            effectiveness, (iv) utilize energy efficient traction, (v)\n            improve indigenous manufacturing of electrification\n            components, and (vi) strengthen the organization in selected\n            operational areas. Bank\u2019s performance was uneven as project\n            preparation proceeded over several years. Borrower\u2019s\n            performance was uneven. . The key lessons learned from the\n            project were (a) the most obvious is that it makes no sense\n            to extend electrification beyond the existing 10,000 km core\n            system; (b) the need for technology transfer for diesel and\n            electric locomotives as well as light weight high capacity\n            wagons is greater than ever; (c) Indian Railways badly needs\n            to begin using state-of-the-art network flow models and\n            corridor simulation models in their planning; and (d) in the\n            absence of reform inducing financial crisis or exogenously\n            imposed reforms supported by the highest level of government\n            it is difficult to see a convincing argument that the\n            controversial investments will be implemented."}, "docdt": "1995-03-29T00:00:00Z"}
