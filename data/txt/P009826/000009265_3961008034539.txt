INDIAN RAILWAY ELECTRIFICATION AND WORKSHOP
MODERNIZATION PROJECT
(LN 2417-IN)
PREFACE
1.    This Implementation Completion Report (ICR) is based on a review of the files of the project, the
original staff appraisal report, a partial draft ICR by the project supervisory engineer, and a detailed report
and economic analysis prepared by a team of private Indian analysts retained by the Bank.
2.    It was the third operation in a series of five interrelated Bank-supported railway technology transfer
projects commencing in 1978 and ending in 1992. Many of the issues raised in the project under review can
only be grasped within the context of the entire technology transfer series and it was decided to examine the
experience with this project in the context of fourteen years of related lending. The project itself was
complex and controversial as were those preceding and following it so the ICR is, of necessity, somewhat
lengthy. The effort, therefore, takes on some of the characteristics of sector work and it has served the
division in that capacity.
3.     The information base for the detailed report by the ICR team was not readily available in IR reports.
But, IR staff cooperated well with the ICR team and the team of local consultants performed very well in
extracting, organizing, presenting and analyzing the information available. It is the first retrospective look at
railway electrification in India.
4.    In setting the context for the technology transfer series the OED audit of the first and the PCR for
the second were consulted as were the appraisal reports of the fourth and fifth operations.
5.     At the time this document was submitted to the Board the written version of the project experience
from Indian Railways had not been received.

INDLIN RAILWAY ELECTRIFICATION AND WORKSHOP
MODERNIZATION PROJECT
(LN 2417-lN)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
1.    The main objectives of the project were to:  (i) increase capacity to meet growing traffic
demand, (ii) improve utilization of motive power, rolling stock and track, (iii) improve cost
effectiveness, (iv) utilize energy efficient traction, (v) improve indigenous manufacturing of
electrification components, and (vi) strengthen the organization in selected operational areas.
2.    The above objectives were to be pursued by: (i) completion of the electrification (3000 route
kilometers) of the high density quadrilateral formed by the megacities of Delhi, Madras, Calcutta and
Bombay; (ii) the modernization of six key workshops, one manufacturing unit and 37 selected
maintenance depots; and (iii) the adoption of a real-time, computer-based, Operating Information
System (OIS).
3.    The OIS component was not implemented (and remains unimplemented) so its contribution to
the project objectives is not yet being made.
4.    The workshop modernization component for the six major workshops and the coach
manufacturing facility was implemented under budget in US$ terms but at a 100 percent time overrun.
Five of the seven main workshop and manufacturing components are functioning well and likely to be
good investments from the micro analytical point of view.
5.    The electrification component was physically completed much as specified at appraisal despite
substantial time overruns for some sections. In US$ terms the cost overruns were not substantial for
any of the sections. The traffic projections for the electrified sections were generally underestimated
with actual traffic flows (passenger and freight in millions of gross ton-kilometers) on the average
about 7 percent above appraisal expectations.
6.    Despite completion under budget and more traffic than expected the retrospective economic
analysis shows that the electrification investments were not good in economic terms. Revised analyses
were done for sections I (Jhansi-Itarsi) and 5 (Balharshah-Vijaywada) following the format and
assumptions utilized in the original SAR. Both sections had traffic densities of about 40 million
GTM/RKM in 1990-91 and both were completed with cost overruns well below the average for all the
sections. Jhansi-Itarsi had only a 19 percent cost overrun and was energized on schedule. Yet, the
revised economic analysis for this section shows an IRR of about 9 percent - down from the original
SAR estimate of 23 percent. For the Balharshah-Vijaywada section the cost overrun was 31 percent



ii
and the time overrun was about four years. The revised IRR for this section is now about 2 percent
rather than the SAR estimate of 41 percent. These two sections accounted for 27 percent of the route
kilometers electrified under the project, experienced the lowest cost overruns and had the highest
traffic densities. It is reasonable therefore to assume that the rest of the sections were not superior in
economic performance and that the electrification component as a whole is not likely to yield a
satisfactory return on the investment.
7.     There are numerous reasons for this poor outcome. The implementation period that required
eight years rather than four years for many of the sections is a principal cause. Another reason is that
the shift from diesel to electric on the energized sections was gradual and partial rather than abrupt and
complete as was assumed in the SAR economic analysis. Thus, for Jhansi-Itarsi freight traffic was 42
percent electrified in 1989-90 rising to 67 percent in 1993-94 and is expected to reach 90 percent by
1996-97. Part of this is because some freight arriving on the electrified sections from nonelectrified
sections will proceed under diesel power. Part is because of the far more serious problem of a general
shortage of electric locomotives. This latter problem is exacerbated by the fact that the 6000 HP state-
of-the-art electric locomotives assumed in the original economic analysis were never introduced
because of the failure of the technology transfer initiated under the previous lending operation. The
obsolete electric locomotives that were used never achieved the efficiencies expected in terms of speed,
maintenance cost, capital cost or energy saving. In many cases the old diesel locomotives did just as
well or better. Finally, the collapse of oil prices in 1986 combined with rising domestic electric power
costs removed many of the energy saving benefits assumed to be associated with electrification.
8.     Of the four categories of assessment the Bank considers for its completed projects the one under
review was neither Highly Satisfactory nor Highly Unsatisfactory. In fact, the outcome for this project was
somewhere between satisfactory and unsatisfactory. Some of the workshop components that were well
supervised and had working management information systems (MIS) in place showed very satisfactory
rates of return (25 percent in the case of Golden Rock). At least four of the six workshop modernization
components had satisfactory rates of return. But, the workshop component was only 13 percent of total
completed project costs. The electrification component finally dominated the total project cost, accounting
for 80 percent of expenditures. And, the rate of return on the electrification investments was likely to be in
the area of 4 percent. The weighted average rate of return on the total project is therefore estimated at
about 7 percent.
For a Satisfactory rating the project must have:
"achieved most of its major objectives and have achieved or be expected to achieve satisfactory
development results with only a few shortcomings."
For an Unsatisfactory rating the project must have:
"..failed to achieve most of its major objectives and is not yielding and is not expected to yield
substantial development results, and has significant shortcomings."
9.    With two of the six major workshop modernizations and virtually all of the electrification
investments unlikely to show satisfactory economic returns and very slow progress on the OIS system, the
Unsatisfactory rating must be chosen.

INDIAN RAILWAY ELECTRIFICATION AND WORKSHOP MODERNIZATION PROJECT
LN 2417-IN
I. Introduction
1.    This project was the third in a series of five interrelated technology transfer projects commencing in
1978 and ending in 1992. These five projects (TEK I through TEK V) and their components are set forth in
Table I and provide part of the essential context for understanding the role and impact of TEK III, which is
the subject of this report. The rest of the context is provided by setting forth the rationale for the technology
transfer series and what, broadly, has been achieved with this 14 year US$ 1.2 billion effort.
2.     Previous to the TEK series the Bank had made thirteen loans to Indian Railways (IR) which were
essentially lines of foreign exchange credit. In 1976 Bank management decided that it had achieved all it
could under a sector lending format and that a project specific format should be adopted in which the transfer
of modem efficient railway technology would be the central objective. While IR had successfully introduced
first generation diesel and electric technology together with four axle wagons it had not, in the absence of an
effective R&D organization, been able to continuously upgrade the new technology. Neither had it been
able to rationalize its management and labor practices nor its steam based system of maintenance and
overhaul facilities. Too, the communications and computer technology which had revolutionized developed
country railroad operations had hardly touched IR.
3.    Bank staff saw the priorities as the rapid transfer of off-the-shelf locomotive and wagon technology
together with a computer based Operations Information System (OIS) to provide efficient control of the
costly new rolling stock and locomotives. TEK I was, therefore, originally conceived as locomotive and
rolling stock technology transfer to the vertically integrated IR manufacturing operations. The first request
of Bank management at this point was to corporatize the manufacturing operations of IR so that they could
be treated as the industrial enterprises they were (and still are). This position was not accepted by IR or the
Government. Nor did the Government accept the related notion that the second generation of locomotive
designs should be imported. This conflicted with the then national policy of indigenous technology
development. TEK I was then downgraded in 1978 into support of the already existing IR plans for a wheel
and axle plant, the modernization of existing workshops and the purchase of spare parts. The only
concessions to the original Bank objectives were to consider workshop rationalization as well as
modernization and to accept assistance in the indigenous development of the second generation of
locomotives through a research and development (R&D) component.

4.      By the time TEK n1 began in 1982, it was clear from the failure of the R&D component of TEK I
that second generation (by then third generation) locomotive technology and freight wagon technology had to
be imported.1 TEK 11 looked much more like the Bank's original idea of the TEK series. Electric
locomotive prototypes and bogies for high capacity wagons were to be imported for testing under Indian
operational conditions and a modem diesel remanufacturing facility at Patiala was included. The big
disappointment with TEK 11 was the inability to get the OIS component imported and installed. As in the
earlier case of the locomotives it was thought that an indigenous OIS was entirely feasible.2
5.      TEK  m  (the subject of this report) came along in 1984 and was really the residue of TEK  11
components that could not be accommodated two years earlier.3  It called for more workshop modernization
and supported the accelerated electrification of the high traffic density double track sections of IR. The very
slow progress of the workshop rationalization effort under TEK I was accommodated under the TEK HI
workshop modernization component by asking for no more than what had already been agreed (but not
delivered) under TEK I. The big push under TEK m was to get the OIS component going since it was by
then apparent that the indigenous effort was not forthcoming. The serious problem of redundant rail labor
was also being confronted by the inclusion of a comprehensive manpower study.
6.      TEK IV came in 1988, four years after TEK m  and was aimed at modernizing IR track and track
maintenance technology by financing the import of high strength steel rails that could not be manufactured
indigenously and by importing track installation and maintenance equipment that would allow near
continuous use of the now  saturated main lines.4  The new  track would also accommodate the smaller
diameter wheels and heavier axle loads of the proposed new freight rolling stock.
7.      TEK  V was a final attempt in 1992 to revisit the original 1978 objectives of the TEK  series.;
Despite the disbursement of almost US$ 1.2 billion in loans and credits over fourteen years, the locomotive
and rolling stock initiatives under TEK 11 had not yet born fruit and IR continued with the technologies of
the 1960s. TEK V called for the urgent and rapid transfer of diesel and electric (by now fourth and fifth
generation) technologies to IR manufacturing operations as well as light weight high capacity freight rolling
stock. There was a large component for the long-delayed OIS and no attempt to support the failed domestic
R&D effort. By this time the problem of line saturation and locomotive and rolling stock shortages were
apparent to all as was the accelerating labor bill.
8.      In the general environment of national economic reform of the 1990s, Bank management returned to
its 1978 position that the vertically integrated manufacturing operations of IR should be "unbundled" from
IR, the transport enterprise, so that the desperately needed technology transfer could finally take place. As

in 1978 (and in 1980), IR management refused to consider such a move and the scheduled loan negotiations
were canceled - and never subsequently taken up.
9.     As of 1994, only TEK IV is still disbursing. At the request of IR, US$ 130 millions of the TEK IV
loan was canceled on the grounds that the high strength steel rail could be manufactured indigenously and
need not be imported. Subsequently it was found that the domestic rail quality could not be improved, but
the canceled amount could not be reinstated.
10.    Since the cancellation of the scheduled TEK V loan negotiations in 1992, Bank rail lending in India
has focused on non-controversial specialized operations such as that for the Container Corporation
(CONCOR), a corporatized wholly-owned subsidiary of IR, and for the Bombay suburban rail operations
(BUTP I).
IH. TEK m Project Objectives
11.    As stated in the Staff Appraisal Report (SAR), the main objectives of the project were to: (i)
increase capacity to meet growing traffic demand, (ii) improve utilization of motive power, rolling stock and
track, (iii) improve cost effectiveness, (iv) utilize energy efficient traction, (v) improve indigenous
manufacturing of electrification components, and (vi) strengthen the organization in selected operational
areas.
12.    Objectives (i) and (ii) were, and remain, critical to the well being of IR and the transport sector.
Objectives (iii) and (vi) are generally desirable and generic to most projects. Objectives (iv) and (v) are both
desirable and explicit.
13.    The above objectives were to be pursued by: (i) completion of the electrification (3000 route
kilometers) of the high density quadrilateral formed by the megacities of Delhi, Madras, Calcutta and
Bombay; (ii) the modernization of six key workshops, one manufacturing unit and 37 selected maintenance
depots; and (iii) the adoption of a real-time, computer-based, Operating Information System (OIS).
14.   The linkage between the project components and the project objectives is clear in the case of the OIS
component6. The Bank had been pushing (unsuccessfully) for the OIS since before TEK I in 1978. The
TrEK HI SAR, in paragraph 2.25, makes the capacity expansion and efficiency case for the OIS again and, in
paragraph 6.02 specifies OIS related items as preconditions for loan effectiveness. For the workshop
modernization component the linkages with objectives (i), (ii), and (vi) are clear insofar as the individual
workshops are concerned but not in terms of the entire national system of workshops. Individual workshop
rationalization and modernization was to take place but not system rationalization. The latter objective was
pursued unsuccessfully under the TEK I workshop modernization component. The electrification component
was generally supportive of all the project objectives since the investment was restricted to the increasingly
congested high density lines of the megacity quadrilateral. The pursuit of objective (v) was presumably
made operationally explicit by linking it with the electrification component.
6      The OIS "component" was not financed under TEK III. It was pursued as a precondition for negotiations and then loan
effectiveness.

Im. Achievement of Objectives
The OIS Component
15.    The OIS component was not implemented (and remains unimplemented) so its contribution to the
project objectives is not yet being made. Under TEK I, in 1978, the OIS initiative and its well-documented
impact on capacity expansion and capital efficiency was promoted. Under TEK 11, adoption of an
implementation action plan was a precondition for project processing. Under TEK ml, the Bank sought
assurances that Indian licenses and approvals would be forthcoming for importing the OIS software and
hardware. This was a precondition for negotiations that led to a one year delay in completing negotiations.
The appointment of OIS consultants was then a precondition for TEK m loan effectiveness and this led to
another one year delay and near cancellation of the loan. The contentious OIS initiative cost two years delay
between TEK m appraisal and loan effectiveness. By the time TEK V was appraised in 1992, the Bank was
still calling for the implementation of the OIS system, initially on the Northern Zonal Railroad.
The Workshop Modernization Component
16.    The workshop modernization component for the six major workshops and the coach manufacturing
facility was physically implemented but at a 38 percent rupee cost overrun and approximately 100 percent
time overrun. The facility cost and productivity results are given in Table 2.7  While the Integrated Coach
Factory (ICF) at Madras experienced a 26 percent cost overrun and took nine years to complete, a
retrospective economic analysis by Bank staff yields an expected IRR of 13 percent - down from the 20
percent estimated at appraisal (See Annex II). This still satisfactory outcome derives from exceeding the
output target of 1000 coach POHs per year. Two other workshops were reevaluated by Bank staff - that at
Golden Rock and that at Ajmer. The Golden Rock facility was completed under the cost estimate and the
POH cycle time targets have been achieved but the annual number of POHs have not been achieved because
of lack of demand. The revised economic analysis shows an IRR of 25 percent similar to the 27 percent
estimated at appraisal. For the Ajmer workshop the experience has not been good because of cost and time
overruns, reduced output figures and less than targeted cycle times. The revised IRR was estimated at 2
percent down from the 24 percent at appraisal. No other workshop investments were reanalyzed but; based
on the cost, output and productivity figures in Table 2; it is likely that the facility at Jagadhri was not, in
retrospect, economically justified. Thus, five of the seven main workshop and manufacturing components
are functioning well and likely to be good investments from the micro analytical point of view.
These are Rupee cost overruns which, because of the long implementation period, inflation rates of about 10 percent and a Rupee
to US$ conversion of 11 in 1984 and 30 in 1993, are not serious in terms of real resources. If a weighted average exchange rate
of Rs. 20 to the USS is used for the total cost of this component there is a substantial cost underrun in terms of real resources.

17.    While most of the project preparation for this component was focused on the seven facilities referred
to above it is important to note that 57 percent of the workshop component (about 19 percent of total project
costs) was originally allocated to 37 different "support" facilities scattered throughout the system. This
subcomponent absorbed the Rupee cost overruns of the seven major facilities and the electrification
component. but, even after reduction (to about 7 percent of total project costs) involved the purchase and
installation of over 1,300 major machine tools at a cost of about US$ 74 million. It was t his subcomponent
that helped make the project so complex and added greatly to the procurement burden. It is virtually
impossible to supervise such an operation and equally difficult to assess the impact of putting new machine
tools into these shops. 8 For purposes of weighting, the economic return on this component was assumed to
be 10 percent.
18.    Nevertheless, locomotive and rolling stock availability for the entire rail system increased quite
dramatically from 1986 on with diesel locomotive availability now at 90 percent, electric at 93 percent,
coaches at 91 percent and wagons at 96 percent (See Table 4 in Annex 1). The workshop components under
TEK I and TEK m undoubtedly had much to do with this improved performance.
19.    However, this same improvement could have been achieved with a greatly reduced set of national
maintenance facilities.   If maintenance system  rationalization could have been achieved as well as
modernization less than half of the facilities extant would be required for maintenance and overhaul facilities
and the machine tools in the facilities retained would have been utilized much more intensively and
efficiently. There would be no need to deal with 37 different facilities operating single shifts and in many
cases, e.g. Golden Rock, with work loads less than the facility capacity. The problem of redundant
maintenance facilities means that the modernization required to have efficient locbmotive and rolling stock
availability is itself both costly and inefficient. This factor was not considered when programming machine
tools for the 37 support units and could not be considered for the same reason that it was not successfully
addressed in TEK I.
The Electrification Comp~onen
20.    The electrification component was physically completed much as specified at appraisal despite
substantial time and Rupee cost overruns for some sections (Table 3). For the entire 3043 km, the
Rupee cost overrun was 82 percent above appraisal estimates. The most egregious overrun was for the
last two sections Bina-Katni-Bilaspur where the appraisal costs were exceeded by 229 percent. These
two sections, which accounted for 19 percent of the route kilometers to be electrified, eventually
accounted for 34 percent of the route electrification costs. These two sections were also the last to be
energized almost four years after the original expected completion date. The other difficult sections
were the third, fourth and sixth which experienced cost overruns in excess of 80 percent. In US$
terms however, the cost overruns were not substantial for any of the sections and the electrification
component was completed approximately on budget in real resource terms (See Table 5 in Annex I).
While originally estimated to require 67 percent of total project costs it eventually consumed 80
percent of the resources available for the project.
21.    The traffic projections for the electrified sections were generally underestimated with actual traffic
flows (passenger and freight in millions of gross ton-kilometers) on the average about 7 percent above
appraisal expectations. On the surface this is adequate forecasting performance for capital budgeting
purposes. However when the traffic flows are broken down into freight and passengers, the actual passenger
traffic was 23 percent above expectations while freight was only 4 percent above projections.  The
This point was made in the 1987 Audit of the 1978 TEK I operation but was much too late to be reflected in the 1984 TEK HI
operation. This is one of the criticisms of the Bank's system of post completion technical audits, i.e. the lessons arrive too late to
be of any operational use.
As an example of what is possible; the US CONRAIL system, which has a locomotive fleet about 25 percent of the IR fleet, has
one workshop for overhauls and 2 sheds for running repairs and maintenance, plus 3 fueling facilities.

unexpectedly high growth in passenger traffic has substantial operational as well as financial implications for
the railway. The operational implications derive from the fact that passenger trains are competing for track
space with freight trains and that a single passenger train generally takes up twice the track capacity required
for a single freight train. The financial implications derive from the fact that freight services generate the
profits to cover the money losing passenger services.
22.    The actual traffic densities in 1990-91 on the various sections in millions of gross ton-kilometers per
route-kilometer are also given in Table 3. Here it can be seen that the average for the entire 3043 kilometers
electrified was 33.3 MGTKM/RKM with a high of 41.7 million tons on section 5 and a low of 13.3 million
tons on section 10. The European experience with mixed passenger and freight operations generally
supported electrification when the gross tonnage exceeded 20 to 30 million per route-kilometer and, with the
exception of sections 7 and 10 all meet or exceed this rule-of-thumb. There should, therefore, be a good
retrospective economic argument for the electrification investment.
23.    Revised economic analyses were done for sections I (Jhansi-Itarsi) and 5 (Balharshah-Vijaywada)
following the formnat and assumptions utilized in the original SAR (See Annex HII). Both sections had traffic
densities of about 40 million GTM/RKM in 1990-91 and both were completed with cost overruns well
below the average for all the sections. Jhansi-Itarsi had only a 19 percent cost overrun and was energized on
schedule. Yet, the revised economic analysis for this section shows an IRR of about 9 percent - down from
the original SAR estimate of 23 percent. For the Balharshah-Vijaywada section the cost overrun was 31
percent and the time overrun was about four years. The revised IRR for this section is now about 2 percent
rather than the SAR estimate of 41 percent. These two sections accounted for 27 percent of the route
kilometers electrified under the project, experienced the lowest cost overruns and had the highest traffic
densities. It is reasonable therefore to assume that the rest of the sections were not superior in economic
performance and that the electrification component as a whole is not likely to yield a satisfactory return on
the investment.
24.    There are numerous reasons for this poor outcome (See Annex II). The implementation period that
required eight years rather than four years for many of the sections is a principal cause. Another reason is
that the shift from diesel to electric on the energized sections was gradual and partial rather than abrupt and
complete as was assumed in the SAR economic analysis.10 Thus, for Jhansi-Itarsi freight traffic was 42
percent electrified in 1989-90 rising to 67 percent in 1993-94 and is expected to reach 90 percent by 1996-
97. Part of this is because some freight arriving on the electrified sections from nonelectrified sections will
proceed under diesel power. Part is because of the far more serious problem of a general shortage of electric
locomotives. This latter problem is exacerbated by the fact that the 6000 HP state-of-the-art electric
locomotives assumed in the original economic analysis were never introduced because of the failure of the
technology transfer initiated under TEK II." The obsolete electric locomotives that were used never
achieved the efficiencies expected in terms of speed, maintenance cost, capital cost or energy saving.
Finally, the collapse of oil prices in 1986 combined with rising domestic electric power prices removed
many of the energy saving benefits originally assumed to be associated with electrification.
10     A transition period of a year or so would not have been unreasonable.
Under TEK II the Bank helped finance the import of eighteen prototype AC electric locomotives for testing to provide the basis
for a new locomotive design. The locomotives were purchased and tested as agreed but did not lead to a decision for large scale
technology transfer and manufacture.

25.    Electrification proceeded without a coordinated plan for electric locomotive acquisition and revised
train operations and maintenance procedures. Despite the statement of the capacity expansion objective in
the TEK m  SAR, the economic analysis employed did not consider this objective explicitly and the main
benefit assumptions were reduced capital cost for locomotives and wagons and reduced energy consumption
because of the introduction of the new technology. The real benefits of electrification of congested mixed
passenger and freight operations is now in the expansion of track capacity because of the superior
acceleration and speed of electric locomotives together with their lower maintenance cost and higher
availability. The question of track capacity and saturation was never addressed in the SAR or in the
economic analysis nor was there an analysis of optimal train operations under state-of-the-art electric
locomotion.12  Instead, the popular justification for electrification i.e. energy saving and foreign exchange
saving was reflected in the economic analysis and, under the then prevailing prices of electricity and diesel
fuel, provided a sufficient justification for going forward. In retrospect it was not an adequate approach to
the issue.
IV. Major Factors Affecting the Project
26.    For the OIS component, the major factor impeding progress was the lack of enthusiasm  for
computer based information systems from the management of the zonal railways and from the clerical labor
force. The zonal railways were fearful of losing independence and control to the central Board with such a
system. The clerical workers who were engaged in manual collection and compilation of OIS type
information were also fearful of losing their jobs to computers. Finally, there was a group of technologists
outside the railways who believed that both the software and hardware for such a system could be developed
indigenously and need not be imported. There was no real "ownership" of the OIS concept in India at least
not in enough force to prevail against those who resisted it.
27.    For the workshoD  modernization component the major factor was the plethora of redundant
workshop facilities that could not be "rationalized" because of the self sufficiency preferences of the zonal
railways and the impact on the labor force. This led to the need to modernize 37 separate support facilities
when a fraction of this number could have done the job. This portion of the project was very loosely
planned and impossible for Bank staff to supervise. An isolated factor was the large scale conversion of
meter gauge rail to broad gauge which rendered the Ajmer meter gauge workshop largely redundant in its
own right.
28.    For the electrification component, two major exogenous factors were the rise in electricity cost vis a
vis diesel fuel cost when world petroleum prices collapsed in 1986 and the development of extremely fuel
efficient diesel locomotive technology subsequent to project appraisal. The energy saving dimension of
electrification has, in the 1990s, nearly disappeared. The foreign exchange savings argument also no longer
holds as the Indian economy expands its foreign trade sector and now has a "problem" of excess of foreign
exchange. The failure to transfer the state-of-the-art electric locomotive technology in time to make use of
12      The Chinese - not the Europeans or North Americans - have led the way in gaining the benefits of optimal train operations plus
electrification on their mainline double track operations. As early as 1988 China railways was routinely moving between 140 and
180 MGTKM/RKM, almost three times the mainline Indian densities. See: Present Situation of Chinese Railways and Uoeradina
Program, Permanant Way Bureau, Ministry of Railways, China Academy of Railway Sciences, Beijing, December 1989. For a
more recent example of the approach to optimal train operations and investments in China see: "Railroad Capacity Planning: A
Case Study of the Beijing-Shanghai Rail Corridor", by Carl Van Dyke and Llewellyn Davis, Journal of the Transportation
Research Forum, Vol. XXXII, Number 1, 1991, p. 86-102.



I1
the electrification infrastructure was also a major factor. Obsolete technology together with obsolete train
operations and control have made it impossible to obtain the real and urgent capacity expansion benefits of
electric technology.
29.    An isolated factor that affected the electrification component quite substantially was the attempt early
in project implementation to introduce a new and untried 2x25 kv AT electrification system on the 580 km
sections 9 and 10 (Bina Katni-Bilaspur) instead of the existing 25 kv BT system. The new system has been
used successfully in France, Japan and Russia, has certain very real advantages over the 25 kv BT system
and is fully compatible with it. The Bank approved this technical change and a contract for US$ 2.5 million
was awarded to a consortium of consultants who submnitted their initial recommendations in early 1989. In
mid 1990 when the bids for this section were opened the costs were very much higher than expected. This
was the section that ultimately experienced the 229 percent Rupee cost overrun, consumed 34 percent of the
electrification resources, and was finally energized only in mid 1994. However, it is logical for the Indians
to eventually convert to this system so the extra cost and time for this investment may be justified as a form
of necessary R&D.
V. Project Sustainability
30.    The workshop modernization objectives have generally been achieved and the availability figures for
locomotives and rolling stock are good even by developed country standards (See Table 4 in Annex I). The
same objectives could have been achieved at much less expense if workshop rationalization had been
possible. In the Indian political climate this was not possible but there is no reason to believe, even under an
unrationalized system, that the rolling stock and locomotive availability figures will not be sustained.
31.    For the OIS and electrification component the question of sustainability of the original objectives
does not arise because the objectives were not achieved and are not likely to be achieved any time soon. The
experience with the entire TEK series, culminating in the aborted 1992 TEK V project, which was to again
pursue these objectives, is sufficient proof of the difficulty of obtaining and sustaining the benefits of state-
of-the-art rail technology in India.
VI. Bank Performance
32.    Bank performance was uneven as project preparation proceeded over several years. In June 1980 a
Project Brief for an electrification project was prepared in which the issues of the obsolete electric
locomotive technology, inadequate manufacturing capacity and the inadequate supply of domestic electric
power were raised. The sole benefit of electrification mentioned at this point was energy and foreign
exchange saving. In 1980 and 1981 world petroleum prices were at their all time high and the emphasis on
substituting domestic coal-based energy for imported petroleum-based energy is understandable.
Nevertheless, the domestic power supply was so irregular that there was even then discussion of Railway
owned and operated power plants - vertical integration by IR into the troubled power sector. The proposal
was not accepted but the fact that it was considered indicates the serious nature of the problem.
33.    Comments on the Project Brief did raise questions concerning the exclusive energy saving approach
and the crude rule-of-thumb measures being used (MGTKMIRKM). The point was that, depending on the



12
circumstances, the breakeven point for electrification was anywhere between 20 and 100 MGTKM/RKM
and that Indian rail traffic was nowhere near the 100 MGTKM/RKM density.'3 There is no response to this
criticism in the file.
34.    In August 1980 a letter from the Bank to the Government pointed out the electric locomotive
technology and manufacturing constraint and recommended that the manufacturing operations of IR be
corporatized so that technology transfer and electric locomotive output could proceed smoothly as a
manufacturing issue rather than a rail transport issue. The latter recommendation was not accepted and
project preparation proceeded.
35.    Appraisal took place in January 1981. In the March 1981 Issues Paper there was no discussion of
economic justification or the shortage of electric power in the country. Only the locomotive technology and
the OIS system was highlighted. In the Decision Memorandum it was agreed that the key assumptions for
justification and the question of availability of electric power would be treated in the Staff Appraisal Report.
Subsequently in April 1981 doubts were raised in an internal memorandum about the availability of
adequate electric power and the need to extend the high voltage network to serve IR. If this were the case the
costs should be included in the electrification project. There is no response to this criticism in the file.
36.    By this time the Bank was committed to the project without really examining the economic
justification, in particular the impact of electrification on train operations in the high density corridors. In
October 1981 IR's essentially energy saving approach to analyzing electrification investments was finally
given approval by the Bank. At this time the petroleum commodity price index stood at 119.3 up from 56.0
in 1978.
37.    Preparation dragged on because of the failure to move on the OIS system. In April 1983 a post
appraisal mission was mounted largely because of the addition of the workshop modernization component to
the electrification and OIS components. In July and August of 1983 a supplementary Issues Paper was
followed by a Decision Memorandum. The petroleum price index stood at 101.8 and there was no trouble
in justifying the electrification investment primarily on energy savings. Workshop modernization was
discussed in depth but rationalization was mentioned only in the context of a study. No mention was made
of the rationalization experience of TEK I.
38.    By February 1984 the Yellow Cover SAR was circulated and the main concern was for progress on
the OIS system. Two of the conditions for loan approval were the guarantee by the government that there
would be adequate electric locomotives and electric power for the railroads on a priority basis. Two of the
outstanding concerns critical to project success were to be dealt with through loan conditions. These were
subsequently dropped at negotiations. The project was finally made effective in May 1985, almost four
years after initial appraisal.
39.    In November 1985 the first supervision mission's Back-to-Office report was submitted. At this time
Bank staff predicted a serious shortfall in electric locomotives for the electrified system. The estimate was
150-200 locomotives lacking by 1990. This was a prediction that eventually came to pass.
40.    In 1986 world oil prices collapsed and the price index of petroleum dropped to 42.0 from levels in
excess of 100 in the early 1980s. An internal Bank memo of March 1986 indicates that this fall in petroleum
prices, if sustained, would reduce the IRR of three of the ten sections to be electrified to levels below 7
13    The Bank's own internal study on rail electrification world wide did not appear until 1984. See: Railways and Energy, by Liviu
Alston, World Bank Staff Working Paper No. 634, March 1984.



13
percent. These price levels have been sustained through 1993 and are expected to rise only gradually
thereafter. In retrospect it was easy to justify electrification at fairly low traffic densities with the high
petroleum costs of the early 1980s and there was no need to go in search of the more difficult to obtain
benefits of electrification. Also, while there was congestion there were no serious theoretical capacity
constraints on the main lines in 1981 at the time of appraisal. Bank staff had no incentive at the time to
simulate the train operations on the sections to be electrified.
41.    During the entire period of the TEK series the domestic power supply in India has been a serious
problem, restricting the growth of private industiy which has been willing to pay almost double the long run
marginal cost of providing electric power based on the price they are paying for in-house power generated
with diesel engines.14  IR has been given priority for the high value uninterrupted power provided by the
State Electricity Boards (SEBs). The very first memorandum in the file by Bank staff in June 1980 stressed
the problem of inadequate electric power but the issue was never addressed except to insist that IR be given
priority in the queue. On this issue Bank staff can be faulted since the alternative use of the electric power in
terms of foregone industrial production should have been considered in the economic analysis. The fact that
energy efficient diesel locomotives have subsequently been developed that very nearly preclude any energy
saving with electrification is something that Bank staff could not have anticipated at the time. Nevertheless,
the wisdom of rail electrification in an environment of chronic power shortage was, and remains, in
question.
42.    The lack of progress on the workshop rationalization because of labor and political resistance was
well known to Bank staff at the time. The second best approach of providing machine tools to redundant
shops, while less efficient, is realistic and possibly justified given the beneficial impact on locomotive and
rolling stock availability. Bank staff can only be faulted for not making this reality more explicit in the
project documentation.
Vil. Borrower Performance
43.    Indian Railways is one of the largest vertically integrated transport-manufacturing conglomerates in
the world. It operates under five major constraints that limit its ability to perform as a rational commercial
enterprise might. First, it is directly under a Minister of Railways who is answerable on a day to day basis
to Parliament. Second, the major procurement and investment decisions of IR are invariably picked up and
discussed in the popular press. Third, the management of IR has extraordinarily short tenures in any
position typically from six to eighteen months. Fourth, IR has a labor force of about 1.7 million of which at
least 400,000 are not needed for current and future rail operations.  Fifth, IR has become primarily a
passenger railroad serving a literate and vociferous clientele who have become accustomed to underpriced
(frequently free) service which has priority over freight. There is no countervailing lobby for better quality
freight service.
44.    While there was frequently a meeting of the minds between Bank staff and IR staff at the technical
level, the agreements that were negotiated at that level were frequently reversed for high level political
considerations. The refusal to import locomotive technology under TEK I is an example. The subsequent
failure to transfer the OIS technology and the electric locomotive technology arose partly from the criticism
14     In 1991/92 India's overall electric power shortage was estimated at 8.5 percent and peaking power shortage about 17.7 percent



14
of the popular press which did not have more than a superficial grasp of the underlying techno-economic
issues. For most uninformed observers the 1960 electric locomotive technology was adequate in that it was
cheap and domestically produced. Similarly, India was producing both computers and software so, the
argument went, there was no need to import the OIS system. While track capacity can easily be expanded in
the main corridors by simulating train operations and revising the passenger and freight time table, both
passengers and the press would object strenuously to tine table changes. Rationalization of workshops
quickly ran into the problem of labor redundancies and facility closures. Finally, the frequent change in
senior IR management made it necessary for Bank staff to revisit key decisions either because the new
managers had different ideas or because they needed to be brought up the learning curve concerning
complicated techno-economic issues that were thought, by Bank staff, to have been resolved.
45.    Much of this organizational complexity and inertia was reflected in the Bank supervision reports
under the general heading of "procurement problems". The floating of tenders and awarding of contracts
together with subsequent implementation took much longer than is normally expected for such project
components. This was then reflected in the three to five year delays in component implementation which
hurt the economic returns on the investments. Part of this was difference of views between the Bank and IR
regarding the form of acceptable bidding documents.15 Part was the fact that detailed specifications for the
major components were not ready at the time of loan effectiveness. This factor combined with the constant
changes in IR requirements reflected in requests for reallocation of loan funds. Probably most serious was
the fact that any contract in excess of US$ one million (of which there were many) required the formal
approval of the full Board and the Minister of Railways. This latter requirement routinely required three to
seven months and in the case of more controversial items much longer.
46.   IR management frequently could not or would not deliver on their more controversial commitments.
In the TEK HI project under review here the failure to transfer the electric locomotive technology,
manufacture sufficient new locomotives and operate the electrified sections in a manner that would yield the
benefits of electrification was a major shortcoming in borrower performance.  The form but not the
substance of electrification is being implemented. Related to this issue is the failure to monitor and evaluate
effectively the electrification program.  Bank staff had a very difficult time collecting the data for
reevaluating the performance of the project for this implementation review. Since electrification has been the
center piece of the IR investment program for many years now it is disappointing to see that there has been
no systematic attempt within IR to monitor and evaluate its actual progress and compare that with original
expectations.  The slow progress on the OIS initiative after 16 years of sustained effort is another
disappointment as this is one of the most cost-effective investments conceivable for IR.
47.    For the non controversial workshop modernization component borrower performance was much
better as no vested interests were threatened and no single investment was large enough or technologically
controversial enough to attract the interest of the press or public.
VIII. Assessment of Outcome
48.    Of the four categories of assessment the Bank considers for its completed projects the one under
review was neither Highly Satisfactory nor Highly Unsatisfactory. In fact, the outcome for this project was
somewhere between satisfactory and unsatisfactory. Some of the workshop components that were well
supervised and had working management information systems (MIS) in place showed very satisfactory rates
of return (25 percent in the case of Golden Rock). At least four of the six workshop modernization
components had satisfactory rates of return. But, the workshop component was only 13 percent of total
15    This has since been resolved since a standard form acceptable to the Bank has now been adopted by IR.



15
completed project costs. The electrification component finally dominated the total project cost, accounting
for 80 percent of expenditures. And, the rate of return on the electrification investments was likely to be in
the area of 4 percent. The weighted average rate of return on the total project is therefore estimated at about
7 percent.
For a Satisfactory rating the project must have:
"....achieved most of its major objectives and have achieved or be expected to achieve satisfactory
development results with only afew shortcomings."
For an Unsatisfactory rating the project must have:
"....failed to achieve most of its major objectives and is not yielding and is not expected to yield
substantial development results, and has significant shortcomings. "
With two of the six major workshop modernizations and virtually all of the dominant electrification
investments unlikely to show satisfactory economic returns and very slow progress on the OIS system, the
Unsatisfactory rating must, therefore, be chosen.
IX. Future Operation
49.    In retrospect rail electrification in India was probably premature by ten to twenty years. Given the
chronic power shortages in the country, the absence of abundant low cost hydro power, the relatively low
traffic densities in the congested rail corridors and the availability of energy efficient diesel technology, the
best approach would have been to continue with improved diesel technology and emphasize optimal train
operations through investments in communications, signaling and time table revision.  However, the
electrification investment is now a sunk cost and the relevant question is how to make the best use of the
technology in the future.
50.    Much depends on the performance of the Indian economy and the induced demand for intercity
freight and passenger traffic for all modes - road, rail and air. This demand could easily double in the next
ten years and there is every indication that the now dominant highway mode will not be able to continue to
expand in the high density corridors as it has in the past. i6 The railway, with its unitilized capacity potential
in the high density corridors, could then relieve the strain on the transport infrastructure and allow the
economic growth to take place. Here the electrification investment would be extremely useful for reasons
that were not considered in the original project preparation. Rather than energy and foreign exchange saving
the future benefits would be the expansion of track capacity on a megacity quadrilateral that would be
approaching the traffic densities experienced on the railways of China. But, to get these benefits the
substance rather than the form of electrification will have to be pursued. This means state-of-the-art electric
locomotives operating on track sections with near optimal train scheduling.
51.    These objectives can be pursued now by importing the electric locomotives assembled and by
simulating train operations in the congested corridors and revising the outdated timetables. The Asian
Development Bank (ADB) has recently supported the train operations simulation studies so much of the
information for new timetables is now available.17  The locomotives are the missing element.  This
presumes, again, that the necessary electric power will be available.
16     See: India- The Transport Sector - Lone Term Issues, Report No. 13192-IN, The World Bank, September 1994.
17     See: Study on Alleviation of Line Capacity Constraints, Indian Railways, October 1994.



16
52.    The problem of domestic electric power supply will not be solved for many years though and it may
be that modern, high horse power, energy efficient, high adhesion diesel locomotives will have to continue
to run under wire to move the traffic. The problem with the modern diesels under high density mixed
passenger and freight operations is that their acceleration characteristics are not as good as those of electric
locomotives and that even under optimal train operations the same track will not have as large a capacity as
it would under electric operations. This is particularly crucial as traffic approaches 100 MGTKM/RKM.
Currently the saturated sections of IR are in the neighborhood of 50 MGTKM/RKM so modem diesels can
still do the job and are anyway required for the rest of the nonelectrified system.
53.    The major workshops are generally working as well as can be expected under a nonrationalized
system. Rationalization awaits national economic reform efforts for State Owned Enterprises (SOEs) in
general. Until a national exit policy together with a downsizing and disinvestment policy for SOEs is
formulated, it is difficult to see Indian Railways taking the lead independently in this controversial area.
54.    The OIS system is said to be ready now for implementation in the Northern Zonal Railway. If it is
allowed to be introduced in substance as well as torm then the benefits should be rapid and obvious and the
introduction to the other zonal railways highly desirable. The Northern zonal experience is an obvious one
to monitor in the future.
X. Key Lessons Learned
55.    A series of techno-economic lessons have emerged from the TEK 11 experience and its larger
context - the entire TEK lending series. The most obvious is that it makes no sense to extend electrification
beyond the existing 10,000 km core system. The traffic densities are not there, the power supply remains
questionable and the energy and foreign exchange savings are no longer an argument.
56.    The need for technology transfer for diesel and electric locomotives as well as light weight high
capacity wagons is greater than ever. The Bank's argument for "unbundling" the manufacturing entities of
IR is increasingly relevant for the technology transfer. The resulting corporate entities would be legally able
to form joint venture manufacturing operations with foreign companies who would make the designs and
future upgrades available for domestic and foreign sales. The politics of technology and procurement would
no longer be central to the railway and the railway management could concentrate on transportation rather
than manufacturing and R&D.  In light of the successful unbundling of the Container Corporation
(CONCOR) from the IR conglomerate, it would seem that the IR management would be more open to the
possible benefits to be gained from corporatization.
57.    As computerization and computer literacy spreads throughout IR the possibility of finally adopting
and making use of a real time OIS system increases. The Bank's argument for an OIS system continues to
be relevant. Much of the development has already taken place over the last 16 years. It remains to be
implemented to an extent which will allow the potential benefits to begin to accrue.
58.   IR badly needs to begin using state-of-the-art network flow models and corridor simulation models
in their planning. There is a very large payoff in congestion reduction in the megacity quadrilateral simply
from developing new time tables for freight and passenger trains. Current time tables are many years old
and have been subjected to incremental changes over the years that are far from optimal. The ADB has been
assisting IR in this area. The Bank has been doing the same in the area of network flow models with free
standing technical assistance financed by a Japan grant. This is the Long Range Decision Support system
initiative. These are the same models that the Chinese have used successfully in getting the most out of their
intensively used rail system. As traffic increases, gauge conversion progresses and the network effects of



17
rail investments and operations increases, these planning tools, which are now standard features of most
large developed country railways, need to be adopted and used.
59.   Finally, it is clear that none of these techno economic lessons are likely to be taken on board by an
IR management that typically serves no more than 18 to 24 months (and frequently less) in their positions
before moving on or retiring. Under the crucial TEK II loan operation the Project Completion Report points
out that during project implementation there were no less than six different managers in the key technology
transfer position within IR.
60.   Beyond the techno-economic lessons that emerge from TEK m1 and the TEK series there is a larger
set of lessons for the Bank and its approach to rail lending in India. From the point of view of project
ownership and implementation there are two broad types of IR project components: the benign and the
controversial. The benign components are the ones that the traveling public, the press, politicians, and
organized labor see as beneficial or at least not threatening. Over the 16 years of the TEK series these are
seen to be the importation of spare parts, workshop modernization, new industrial operations, electrification,
and the conversion of meter and narrow gauge track to broad gauge. More currently there is support for (or
lack of opposition to) corporatized import-export container operations and the upgrading of suburban rail
passenger services. The common element of the benign components is that they have no impact on labor
except an expansion, do not threaten the notion of national R&D self sufficiency, and require no fundamental
change in current train operations.
61.   The controversial components are the importation of new technologies for diesel and electric
locomotives, the importation of new designs and materials for rolling stock, the importation of OIS
technology, the rationalization of workshops and the corporatization of manufacturing operations. The
common element of the controversial components is that they have a substantial impact on labor (and
management), explicitly recognize that domestic R&D is not adequate to produce an appropriate technology,
and require fundamental changes in current train operations.
62.   The electrification component of TEK m was benign in form but highly controversial in substance.
While the electrification infrastructure received general support and was implemented, the necessary new
locomotive design and revised train operations were not forthcoming. The OIS system for which the
investment is the least and the documented payoff the greatest has also failed to make rapid progress because
it violates the R&D self sufficiency constraint, the impact on labor constraint and the impact on train
operations constraint. Only the workshop modernization component of TEK m1 was benign.
63.   In the absence of reform inducing financial crisis or exogenously imposed reforms supported by the
highest level of government, it is difficult to see a convincing argument that the controversial investments
will be implemented. The controversial ones are likely to be frustrated even if supported at the technical
managerial level in the railways. The problem is that the controversial components, generally speaking,
have the highest economic payoff for the railway and the national economy. As long as this situation obtains
it is difficult to envision comprehensive Bank lending to IR any time soon. It has been given a serious try
with US$ 1.2 billion in five operations over 14 years and we would be remiss if we failed to learn the
lessons of the experience.

ANNEX II
RETROSPECTIVE ECONOMIC ANALYSIS OF WORKSHOP MODERNIZATION
COMPONENT
INTRODUCTION
1.    The project included a Workshop Modernization component covering the modernization and
expansion of six workshops, the Integral Coach Factory (ICF) and 37 running maintenance sheds/
depots.
2.    At appraisal, the total cost for modernization of six workshops and ICF was estimated at
Rs. 1,852.8 million (including contingencies). The final cost is Rs. 2,555.0 million.
3.    Table I shows the "Cost and Results of Workshops Component." It is noted that
implementation of modernization took much longer than anticipated. Sub-components that were
planned for completion by June 1988 have actually been completed in 1993 and 1994.
4.    The project implementation of ICF, Golden Rock and Ajmer Workshops has been studied in
detail and findings are contained in the following paragraphs. For each sub-component an economic
evaluation has been attempted. Basic details, which formed the input for the economic evaluation for
the three units are also attached.
ICF
5.    The project objective was to increase the capacity for manufacture of passenger coaches from
850 to 1000 coaches per year and included procurement and installation of 165 machines and the
expansion of covered area for manufacturing activity. Against the appraisal cost of Rs. 540.6 million
(including contingencies), the actual cost was Rs. 678.8 million. The project implementation took nine
years against the original estimate of 3-4 years.
6.    The project objective was realized during year 1990-91 with the manufacture of 1013 coaches.
Thereafter, the yearly production has been consistently above 1000 coaches. The increase in coach
production has been accompanied by increased manpower productivity which improved from 6.65
direct workers per coach in 1986-87 to 5.6 in 1993-94.
Economic Evaluation
7.    At appraisal, the economic evaluation projected a 20 percent rate of return for this sub-
component. The detailed basis of economic evaluation at appraisal is not available. A revised IRR
was estimated on the basis of costs. outputs and time frame as projected at appraisal and yielded a
return of 7.8 percent when no increase in staff productivity was considered. An economic evaluation
based on actual cost, implementation period and output shows an economic rate of return of 13.2
percent. However, if the increase in staff productivity is attributed to the project an IRR of 17.7
percent is obtained. The actual rate of return is higher perhaps due to the increase in coach production
exceeding the target projected at appraisal and the fact that a substantial increase in output was realized
from year two onwards.

Annex II
GOLDEN ROCK
8.    The project objectives of modernization include increasing diesel locomotive POH capacity
from 72 to 144 units per year, reduction on POH cycle time for locomotives from 23 to 19 days and
for coaches from 15 to 13 days and increase capacity for rewinding of traction machines. Against the
appraisal cost estimate of Rs. 280.9 million (including contingencies), the actual cost was Rs. 275.4
million. The project implementation was completed over nine years against the original estimate of
3-4 years.
9.    The increase in diesel loco POH and reduced POH cycle time were realized gradually and by
1990-91, 120 loco POH and cycle time of 20 days were achieved. Further increase of POH has not
taken place due to staff constraints and non-availability of workload. The POH cycle time has
improved further to 17.7 days in 1993-94. The electrical machine rewind has increased from 144 in
1985-86 to 378 units in 1993-94 against a project target of 374. The POH cycle time for coaches
improved from 15 to 13 days by 1992-93 but has slipped back to 15 days in 1993-94.
Economic Evaluation
10.   At appraisal the economic evaluation estimated a 27 percent IRR for this sub-component. As
the basis of the economic evaluation carried out at appraisal is not available, the same was carried out
again with costs, outputs and time frame as projected at appraisal. This has yielded an IRR of 50
percent.
11.   An evaluation based on actual cost, implementation period and outputs has also been carried
out and shows an economic rate of return of 24.7 percent.
AJMER
12.   Ajmer Workshop currently handles meter gauge (MG) stock only. The project objectives of
this sub-component include increase in POH of diesel loco from 36 to 72 per year and that for coaches
from 2664 to 3600 (four wheel units) per year and reduction of POH cycle time for diesel from 47 to
18 days, coaches from 21 to 14 days and wagons from 8 to 6 days. Setting up of electrical traction
machine rewinding capacity for 218 units per year was also planned. Against the appraisal cost of
Rs. 235.4 million the actual cost was Rs. 297.1 million. The project implementation took eight years
against the original estimate of four years.
13.   The increase in diesel locomotive POH to 60 units per year was realized in 1990-91 and has
ranged between 60 and 63 in the subsequent years. It was understood that although the workshop had
developed capacity for 72 POH per year, it did not have the workload to utilize this capacity in full.
There has not been any significant increase in the coach POH which was 2580 in 1986-87 and stood at
2606 in 1993-94 after declining to 2244 and 2160 in 1989-90 and 1990-91 respectively. The POH
cycle time for diesel locomotives, coaches and wagons has improved to 22.5, 18 and 6 days
respectively against respective targets of 18, 14 and 6 days. The facility for electrical machine re-wind
has been setup but the initial production is expected in 1994-95.



28
Annex II
14.   At appraisal the economic evaluation projected a 24 percent IRR for this sub-component. As
the basis of the economic evaluation carried out at appraisal is not available, the same was carried out
again with costs, outputs and time frame as projected at appraisal. This has yielded an IRR of 29.4
percent.
15.   An evaluation based on actual cost, implementation period and outputs has also been carried
out and shows an economic rate of return of 1.9 percent. A much lower actual rate of return as
compared to IRR anticipated as per projections at appraisal is attributed to longer implementation
period, cost over-run and delayed and only a partial realization of post-project outputs.
16.   It is anticipated that with large scale gauge conversion, there shall be a significant decline in
the workload for Ajmer Workshops.
17.   It may be noted that the IRR obtained for the sub-components on the basis of actual data is
strictly not comparable with the IRR obtained at appraisal, since the basis for the two evaluations is not
identical.
BASIS OF ECONOMIC EVALUATION
COSTS
18.   All project costs have been considered. To arrive at economic cost, where available, custom
duties were reduced from the financial cost. Where data on custom duties was not available, 80
percent of financial cost was assumed as the economic cost.
19.   Additional working capital required to be injected to increase production was considered as a
cost at the appropriate time.
20.   Maintenance cost of additional assets employed was considered at 2.5 and 5.0 percent for civil
engineering and other assets respectively.
BENEFITS
21.   The benefits were reduced by 20 percent to arrive at economic level of benefits. Residual
value of assets after 15 years was estimated on the following basis:
Civil Engineering assets                 50%
Mechanical, Electrical and Telecom assets    10%
22.   This value was considered as a benefit in the 16th year. Return of additional working capital
was considered as a benefit in the 16th year. Net benefits were arrived at by reducing the annual
operating costs from benefits. Benefits from increased output were estimated as follows:



29
Annex II
23.   ICF:
If the capacity for coach building at ICF was not enhanced, IR would have purchased the
additional coaches from other Indian coach builders at a cost higher than the cost of coaches built at
ICF. Bharat Earth Movers Ltd. (BEML) has been supplying BG coaches to IR for several years and
BEML price is a reasonable indicator of the cost of coaches from at alternative source. It was noted
that BEML prices less taxes were about 25 percent higher than cost of coaches manufactured at ICF.
Product of additional coaches built at ICF as a result of capacity expansion and difference of BEML
and ICF coaches provides one benefit streams.
The expansion of coach building capacity and attendant process improvements have lead to
increase in man-power productivity, thus reducing labor cost component of cost of coach production.
Manpower cost savings for 850 coaches per year (pre-project capacity of ICF) provided the
second benefit stream for the economic evaluation. For this analysis labor productivity improvement
over base year 1989-90 was considered as ICF achieved 1000 coach production in 1990-91.
24.   GOLDEN ROCK:
Benefits for this sub-component have been estimated for additional out-turn of diesel loco POH
and the reduced cycle time for POH. Benefit due to additional POH was assessed by reducing repair,
maintenance and sinking fund costs as well as the operating costs from the value added during POH.
Value added for POH was estimated as recovery of depreciation of locomotive over a six year period
assessed as per IR General Code Volume 1 (Annex IV para 719). In case of diesel locomotives, it
translated into about 25 percent of the cost of a new locomotive. Benefit for each year was assessed on
the basis of additional POH carried out and current loco cost.
The one time benefit due to reduced cycle time for POH was assessed by considering the total
locomotive days saved converted to locomotives saved and cost of locomotives.
25.   AJMER:
The benefit for Ajmer Workshop modernization was assessed on lines similar to that for
Golden Rock except that besides the benefits of additional POH and one time saving of locomotives
due to reduced cycle time, the one time benefit of reduced cycle time for coach POH was also
considered.

ANNEX III
RETROSPECTIVE ECONOMIC ANALYSIS OF ELECTRIFICATION COMPONENT
1.    The overall economic return of the Jhansi-Itarsi route electrification project was
estimated at 23.5 percent and that of Balharshah-Vijaywada route at 40.5 percent at the pre-
appraisal stage. The project was envisaged to be completed by 1988-89 and thereafter freight
as well as passenger traffic were assumed to be hauled by electric traction. The main benefits
of the project related to: (i) higher locomotive kms per day per locomotive in use, (ii) a
substitution ratio of electric versus diesel locomotive of less than one, (iii) lower maintenance
cost and higher locomotive availability, (iv) higher average speed and (v) savings in energy
cost etc.
2.     The basic objective of this loan project as a whole was to increase capacity to meet
growing demand. However at the pre-appraisal stage the benefits on this count seem to have
not taken into consideration and hence not quantified for inclusion in the benefits stream.
Besides, the benefits due to savings in coaches have not been considered because of assumption
relating to no change in speeds with and without the project scenarios.
3.     Electric traction on the Jhansi-Itarsi route partially commenced in 1989 and even in
1992-1993 only 57 percent of freight traffic were carried on electric traction and the rest by
diesel engines. As regards passenger traffic the percentage share were 90:10. Discussion
with the zonal railways officials indicate that there was a gradual phase out of diesel operation
from 42% in 1989-90 to 57% in 1992-93. It is also felt that the maximum percentage of 90%
will be achieved by 95-96. Due to strategic reasons it is not considered advisable/desirable to
go beyond 90% of freight traffic. In the case of Balharshah-Vijaywada route also the build up
of electric traction has been gradual and by 1993-94 85% freight and 100% passenger trains
were operating with electric locomotive.
4.     The revaluation of economic benefits and estimation of rate of return are tentative as
the benefits of the project have just now started to appear. It may be mentioned that the
project completion report for these electrification routes has not been prepared and the required
performance indicators data/information have not been compiled. For the evaluation, we have
therefore used the relevant data of the concerned divisions of the Central and South Central
Railways. Besides, the main basic assumption of the project viz. use of new 6000 hp electric
locomotives on the electrified route has not been implemented. It was also given to
understand that inadequate availability of electric locos, maintenance infrastructure and staff
were the main reasons for gradual build up of traffic to be hauled on electric traction. This is
considered to be one of the important and crucial constraints which have significantly affected
the rate of return of ex-post evaluation stage. This and the other system constraints, outside
the control of the project implementing authority, have resulted into very low rate of return at
the re-evaluation stage.
5.     Due to the non availability of all the assumptions relating to main parameters/
operational indicators used for estimating incremental benefits under "with and" "without"
project scenarios at the pre-appraisal stage, an attempt has been made to estimate the rate of
return on the basis of actual performance of the identified parameters. For this a suitable
program was developed and used after pretesting on the basis of pre-appraisal data for Jhansi-

Itarsi section available in the SAR. The resultant estimate of economic rate of return may not
be strictly comparative, with that of the appraisal stage. It however indicates the impact of
non realization of assumptions on the viability analysis. The analysis does clearly bring out
the importance of ensuring achievement of projected benefits so as to obtain the estimated rate
of return. The ex-post evaluation also questions the validity of some of the assumptions under
the existing system constraints as well as need to ensure simultaneous investment in the rolling
stocks viz electric locos and human resources development for achieving desired benefits.
6.    For the meaningful analysis of the returns estimated at appraisal stage and ex-post
evaluation stage a comparative statement of basic assumptions made for estimating costs and
benefits at the appraisal stage with the actual performance of the same during 1989-90 to 1992-
93 is crucial. The following statement gives the comparative analysis.

7.     The actual data for the two routes were gathered from the officials of the two zonal
railways and the published monthly operating statistics for each division. It has to be borne in
mind that data specific to each route was not available and therefore the divisional operating
results had to be used for the analysis. In view of this the estimated returns at the ex-post
evaluation stage may be treated as indicative.
8.     As stated earlier, a program was developed and pre-tested for the evaluation of
economic IRR. The actual performance data for the period 1987-88 to 1993-94 was then used
to estimate the IRR of nine percent for Jhansi-Itarsi and two percent for Balharshah-Vijaywada
routes.
9.     The reasons for the lower actual rate of return on investment are analyzed in a
subsequent section. However, the comparatively lower return of 2 percent vis-a-vis 40.5
percent at appraisal, for the Balharshah-Vijaywada route is attributed to practically no
difference in operational performance indicators e.g. average trailing load, speed and engine
utilization between diesel and electric traction. As stated in the appraisal report, the return is
most sensitive to engine utilization. For this section, the electric engine utilization in 1992-93
and 1993-94 were marginally lower than for diesel against the projection that this would be the
higher by 100 km/day.

Annex III
ELECTRIFICATION OF JHANSI-ITARSI SECTION
(CENTRAL RAILWAY)
10.   Jhansi-itarsi section (381 route km) is part of IR's trunk routes connecting Delhi with
Madras and Bombay. It is mainly a double line section except for small stretches of single
line over some major rivers. This section has a high line capacity utilization (100-120
percent) and passenger trains constitute 53-59 percent of trains operated on this section.
11.   Traffic levels projected and actual are as follows:
TRAFFIC LEVELS                   TRAFFIC DENSITY
Mil. GTKM/Annum                Mil. GTKM/RKM/Annum
Projected          Actual        Projected           Actual
1981-1982                                 11,035                              29.0
1986-1987                11,390
1990-1991                13,640           14,150             35.8             37.1
1992-1993                14,220           14,516             37.8             38.1
2010-2011                20,680                              54.3
It is seen that traffic growth has been in line with projections considered during appraisal.
12.   The ruling gradient of this section is 1/200 with the exception of 1/80 gradient between
Midghat and Budni stations of Bhopal-Itarsi sub-section.
13.   The Jhansi-Itarsi section was engerised in March 1989. This electrified double line
section has seen about five years for the stabilization of change over from diesel to electric
traction.
14.   The following salient features are worthy of note regarding the post-electrification
operation on Jhansi-Itarsi section.
Build up of Operations with Electric Traction
15.   The use of electric locomotives on this section has increased gradually from 42 percent
freight trains hauled in 1989-90 to 67 percent in 1993-94. However 90 percent of passenger
trains have been hauled by electric locomotives since 1990-91.
16.   It was understood that with the induction of more electric locomotives in the
forthcoming years, by 1996-97, 90 percent of freight trains shall also be brought under electric
traction.
17.   So far, existing 4000 hp WAG5 (freight) and WAM4 (passenger) electric locomotives
are in use and projected new 6000 hp high horse power locomotives have not been acquired
and deployed.

Electric Locomotive Usage

locomotives is given below:

Speed of Freight Trains
19.   There is no significant difference in the speed of freight trains and between pre and
post-electrification periods as can be seen from the following table:
AVERAGE SPEED OF TRAINS (km/hr)
(Average for Jhansi and Bhopal Division)
Freight
Electric              Diesel
1988-89              28.0                  26.0
1992-93              29.0                  28.5
20.   It was gathered that potential for higher average speed with electric traction could not
be realized as this saturated section has a large proportion of passenger trains which makes
extended runs for freight trains difficult. Lack of dynamic brakes on about half the electric
locomotive fleet has also contributed to the non-realization of higher average speeds with
electric traction
Trailing Loads
21.    By and large the section is operated with existing 4000 hp WAM4 and WAG5
locomotives. As the authorized loads for diesel (WDM2) and electric (WAGS) locomotives
for freight trains are almost identical, there is little difference in the trailing loads hauled by
diesel and electric locomotives. The following tables show the authorized and actual average
trailing loads on freight trains hauled by the two modes of traction:

22.   The electric locomotives on this section haul 21 coach passenger trains which were
earlier hauled by two diesel locomotives, thereby saving locomotives. Currently six pairs of
such trains are in operation on this section.
ELECTRIFICATION OF BALHARSHAH-VIJAYWADA SECTION
(SOUTH CENTRAL RAILWAY)
23.   Balharshah-Vijaywada section (454 route km) on South Central Railway (Secundrabad
Division) is part of the Madras-Nagpur-Delhi trunk route that has now been fully electrified.
The electrification of Balharshah-Vijaywada section was completed in the following phases:
Vijaywada - Dornakal              March - December 1986
Dornakal - Ramagundam             November 1987 - March 1988
Ramagundam - Balharshah           September 1988 - March 1989
Thus this double line section stands fully electrified since March 1989 and has had about five
years for the stabilization of change over from diesel to electric traction.
24.   Although Vijaywada-Balharsah section is part of the Madras-Delhi north-south trunk
route, it has substantial originating/terminating and local traffic, in addition to through traffic.

Annex III
This section lies in a mineral rich belt and generates coal, dolomite and cement traffic. This
section also handles rice and fertilizer traffic. Part of the terrain is hilly with ruling gradients
of I in 100. This section is operating at near saturation with capacity utilization ranging
between 90-100%. About 50% of line capacity is utilized for passenger trains and the balance
for freight trains. This section has several sidings and three branch lines. However, as only
the main line has been electrified, about 20 diesel locomotives are utilized for servicing sidings
and branch lines.
25.   The projected and actual traffic levels are given below:
YEAR           TRAFFIC           TRAFFIC DENSITY

1986-87        16,850    18,460       37.5       40.6
1990-91        19,970    21,080      44.0        46.3
1992-93'       21,700    22,530       47.8       49.6
Thus the traffic growth on this section was somewhat higher than the projections at appraisal.
26.   The following salient features emerged during discussion with S.C. Railway officials
regarding the post-electrification operation on Vijaywada-Balharshah section.
Build up of Operation with Electric Traction
27.   The build up of operation with electric locomotives was gradual as can be seen from
the following table:
YEAR        PERCENTAGE OF TRAINS HAULED
BY ELECTRIC TRACTION
Freight          Passenger
1990-91          57                 70
1991-92         71.5                80
1992-93          74                 90
1993-94          85                 100
1994-95          90                 100
(estimated)
28.   It was explained that deployment of electric locomotives was constrained by the
availability of:
- electric locomotives
- loco sheds
- maintenance and operating staff
29.   Furthermore, a certain proportion of freight trains (about 10 percent) are hauled by
diesel locomotives which go to the section for servicing sidings and branch lines. As a result
S.C. Railway has had to continue diesel locomotive maintenance facilities.



42
Annex III
30.   IR have, so far, insisted that siding owners bear part of the cost of electrification of
sidings. As the siding owners have been reluctant to do so, IR are now considering
electrification of sidings and branch lines at their own cost as it will enable IR to withdraw all
diesel locomotives from this section.
Electric Locomotive Usage
31.    Locomotive usage data is maintained as per locomotive base station and not for each
station on which these locomotives operate. The available usage data shows that contrary to
projections at project appraisal indicating substantially higher usage of electric locomotives,
there is no significant difference between electric and diesel locomotive usage. For example
the utilization in terms of km/engine/day in use for electric and diesel locomotives on the
Secundrabad division was as follows:
LOCOMOTIVE UTILIZATION km/engine/day in use
Freight               Passenger
Electric   Diesel    Electric      Diesel
1992-1993            421        429         793         720
1993-1994            418        423         792         720
Projections as
per appraisal        550         450                    560
32.   It was stated that usage of electric locomotives was adversely affected due to change of
traction at points were electric locomotives picked up trains brought to main line by diesel
locomotives from branch lines. Invariably the electric locomotive had to wait for the
incoming train. Secondly in case of vacuum braked trains, some time was lost, since the
electric locomotive exhausters were of lower capacity than those fitted on diesel locomotives.
As a result, an incoming diesel hauled trains sometimes required elimination of leaks before an
electric locomotive exhauster could create the required level of vacuum.
33.    Another reason that has adversely affected the utilization of electric locomotives is the
non-availability of dynamic brakes on a large proportion of locomotives. Although, provision
of dynamic brakes on electric locomotives is a standard feature, for some years, IR have
manufactured electric locomotives without dynamic brakes. On such locomotives the drivers
experience the loss of brake power and tend to operate trains at lower speeds than those
dictated by locomotives power. It was learnt that IR are now retro-fitting electric locomotives
by dynamic brakes.

Annex III
Speed of Freight Trains
34.   There is no significant difference in the speed of freight trains between electric and
diesel hauled trains and between pre and post electrification periods.
AVERAGE SPEED OF FREIGHT TRAINS km/hr
SECUNDRABAD DIVISION
Electric         Diesel
1988-1989          24.1            22.3
1992-1993          21.3            21.9
35.   The potential of higher average speeds with electric locomotives cannot be realized on
near saturated sections having substantial passenger train traffic. It is rare for a freight train
to get an uninterrupted run of say, a couple of hours on such a section. As stated earlier, the
lack of dynamic brakes on a substantial proportion of electric locomotives has led to
locomotive crews operating trains at speeds lower than those feasible.
Trailing Loads
36.   The average trailing loads hauled by diesel and electric locomotives are similar as can
be seen from the following table:
AVERAGE TRAILING LOAD (tonnes)
1991-1992   1992-1993
Diesel           1677        1698
Electric         1612        1589
37.   IR have, so far not procured electric locomotives with higher hauling capacity and
continue to operate this electrified section with WAGI, WAG4, and WAG5 locomotives. The
hauling capacity of electric and diesel locomotives is similar as can be seen from the following
tables:

Annex III
38.   It is therefore not surprising that the trailing load of freight trains hauled by electric
and diesel locomotives are of the same order. They are in fact 4 to 6% lower for the electric
locomotives.
39.    However, in the case of passenger trains a single electric locomotives can haul a 21
coach express train while a diesel loco can haul a maximum of 18 coaches. On Vijaywada-
Balharshah section four pairs of 21 coach express trains are operating where one electric
locomotive has replaced two diesel locomotives thereby saving the number of locomotives
deployed.
