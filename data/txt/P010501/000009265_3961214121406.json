           irrigation and drainage subsector and increase farmers'\n            incomes. The specific objectives are to: (a) redefine\n            Government's role in groundwater development and\n            provide assistance to facilitate change; (b) develop a\n            monitoring program and regulatory framework to ensure\n            sustainable use of the groundwater resources; (c) develop\n            sustainable farmers' organizations; (d) increase\n            beneficiaries' incomes and alleviate poverty; (e)\n            rationalize public expenditure on operation and management\n            of the irrigation and drainage systems as well as increase\n            the recovery of public expenditures on irrigation\n            infrastructure; and (f) avoid environmental hazard of saline\n            water intrusion into fresh groundwater aquifers. The project\n            covering a large part of fresh groundwater Salinity Control\n            and Reclamation Project (SCARP) areas in Punjab will be\n            implemented over a period of five years. The major\n            components are: (a) disinvestment of SCARP tubewells; (b)\n            development of a groundwater monitoring and regulatory\n            framework; (c) improvement of irrigation conveyance\n            facilities; (d) prevention of saline groundwater intrusion\n            in fresh aquifers; (e) monitoring and evaluation of the\n            project; and (f) project management, and technical\n            assistance and training."}, "docdt": "1996-06-13T00:00:00Z"}
