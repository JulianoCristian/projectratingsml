This is one of the few\n            projects in the water sector in Pakistan that has been\n            completed within the original credit closing date. Key\n            project components exceeded project targets and the project\n            objective was largely achieved. Lessons learned from the\n            project include: 1) The quality of social mobilization and\n            after-care capacity building, to a large extent, determine\n            the quality and sustainability of farmers'\n            organizations (FO). 2) Key project staff should be on board\n            by project approval. 3) A national water policy must guide\n            the preparation of a groundwater regulation framework. 4)\n            The procurement process for key works, goods, and\n            consultants services required during the first year of the\n            project should be at an advanced stage by project\n            negotiations, so that disbursement commence immediately\n            after effectiveness. 5) Women's involvement enhances\n            sustainability of FOs by facilitating conflict resolution\n            and improving quality of decisions regarding location of\n            irrigation structures."}, "docdt": "2002-06-10T00:00:00Z"}
