Development in SCARP (Salinity Control and\n            Reclamation Programme) Areas Project in India, which aims to\n            increase the scope and productivity of Punjab's\n            irrigation and drainage subsector and to increase farmers\n            incomes while installing tubewells and monitoring\n            groundwater to prevent waterlogging and saline intrusion.\n            This note covers social as well as environmental aspects of\n            the project, although this abstract mainly focuses on\n            detailing mitigations to environmental impacts. To prevent\n            the closure of SCARP tubewells from reducing irrigation\n            water supply and thus decreasing land use, the\n            diversion/regulatory structures of the canal system will be\n            rehabilitated. Land use permanently reduced by installing\n            tubewells and surface drains will lead to decreased land\n            productivity, but this is insignificant when compared to the\n            impact on the total project area. Dust, smoke, and noise\n            generated by construction machinery will be reduced by using\n            good engineering practices. Diesel operated tubewells may\n            result in air pollution, but the pollutants expected to be\n            dispersed are half that presently generated by privatized\n            tubewells (PTWs). To help reduce polarization between\n            farmers and government agencies, farmers organizations will\n            be developed as institutions, and community tubewells (CTWs)\n            and water courses will be communally developed."}, "docdt": "1994-08-11T00:00:00Z"}
