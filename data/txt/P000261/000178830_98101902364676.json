The Second\n            Bougouriba Agricultural Development Project seeks to\n            consolidate the experience of the first phase and, without\n            expanding the extension service, will aim at including a\n            greater number of farmers, further increasing agricultural\n            and livestock production in the Bougouriba ORD. Attention\n            will be concentrated on the technical management of rainfed\n            agriculture by improved organization of the training and\n            extension systems, input distribution and credit. Successful\n            animal health activities will be continued and improved\n            animal husbandry practices and increased use of animal\n            traction promoted with modest adoption goals recognizing the\n            relative novelty of these ideas in the area. About 22,000 of\n            the 33,000 farm families in the area will be directly\n            reached by the agricultural extension program, an increase\n            of 9,000 from present levels. Emphasis will be upon\n            increasing yields of the main foodcrops -- millet and\n            sorghum -- by simple husbandry techniques; together with\n            recommendations for the cash crops grown by farmers in the\n            various regions -- principally yams in the south, groundnuts\n            in the east, and cotton in the north and south. The project\n            also includes small programs designed to encourage more\n            fruit and fuelwood."}, "docdt": "1981-01-31T00:00:00Z"}
