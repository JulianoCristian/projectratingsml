 Government's medium-term reform agenda, which was\n            outlined in the 1996-1999 Policy Framework Paper (PFP) and\n            which was also articulated in the Country Assistance\n            Strategy Report (CAS Report no. 17269) that was presented to\n            the Board on January 29, 1998. The overall reform agenda\n            seeks to liberalize the economy, reduce the size of the\n            public sector, foster private sector development, and\n            support social sector development - with the ultimate\n            objective of reducing the incidence of poverty. The policy\n            reforms in the energy sector are necessary for establishing\n            an environment conducive to supply-response in the energy\n            sector and self-sustained growth of the private sector. The\n            objectives of the reforms are to rationalize the\n            procurement, production, distribution, and consumption of\n            energy. They will lead to the effective transfer of\n            responsibility to local communities for the management and\n            use of forestry resources, liberalization of the procurement\n            and distribution of petroleum products, abolition of the\n            monopoly and special convention enjoyed by SAR (Societe\n            Africaine de Raffinage/African Refining Company),\n            privatization of the local electric power utility, SENELEC\n            (Societe Nationale d Electricite de Senegal (Senegal\n            Electric Company), and opening up of the power sector to\n            private investment."}, "docdt": "1998-04-23T00:00:00Z"}
