SECOND AGRICULTURAL MARKETING PROJECT
LOAN AND PROJECT SUMMARY
Borrower:           Nacional Financiera, S.N.C. (NAFIN)
Guarantor:          United Mexican States
Beneficiaries:      The Trust Fund for Commercial Development (FIDEC), private
sector enterprises through commercial banks, and the National
Marketing Information Service (SNIM).
Amount:             US$100 million equivalent
Terms:              Seventeen years, including five years of grace, at the
standard variable interest rate.
Relending Terms:   Ta'e Borrower would transfer US$100,000 to SNIM as a grant;
the balance of the loan amount would be made available to
FIDEC, of which US$98.6 million would be on-lent to private
enterprises through commercial banks. Subloans would be
denominated in Mexican pesos or U.S. dollars at the option of
the sub-borrower. For loans in pesos, the Borrower would
make the funds available to FIDEC in pesos at the one month
CETES (Mexican Treasury Bills) rate, which represents the
marginal cost of funds to the Government, or at any other
reference rate mutually agreed between the Borrower and the
Bank; FIDEC would repay principal and interest with the same
terms and grace periods as the Bank loan. The Government
would take the foreign exchange risk on the loan. The CETES
rate, being a market based rate in in open capital market,
includes a foreign exchange risk component. For loans
denominated in U.S. dollars, the Borrower would make funds
available to FIDEC at the three-month LIBOR rate plus 0.5
percentage point. FIDEC would on-lend the funds to
commercial banks either in Mexican pesos or U.S. dollars at a
weighted average interest rate to provide FIDEC a margin of
at least 2.0 percentage points over FIDEC's weighted average
cost of funds (either in Mexican pesos or in U.S. dollars,
respectively). These banks would relend the funds to sub-
borrowers at rates established in the General Interest Rate
Agreement between Mexico and the Bank (peso subloans) and at
a rate equal to LIBOR plus 4.0 percentage points (dollar
subloans).

MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO NACIONAL FINANCIERA, S.N.C.
WITH THE GUARANTEE OF THr UNITED MEXICAN STATES
FOR A SECOND AGRICULTURAL MARKETING PROJECT
1.       The following memorandum and recommendation on a ptoposed loan to
Nacional Financiera, S.N.C. (NAFIN) for US$100.0 million equivalent is submitted
for approval. The proposed loan would be repayable in 17 years on a fixed
*       amortization schedule, including 5 years of grace, at the Bank's standard
variable interest rate and would help finance an agricultural marketing project.
2.       Background.  Mexico has started to adapt its food distribution systen
to the pressures of urbanization as evidenced by the presence of modern
supermarkets competing with each other in nearly every city, the development of
wholesale markets, and producers starting to by-pass the traditional channels by
selling directly to retailers or exporting. Yet part of the marketing sector
continues to operate inefficientlv: (a) there is still rudimentary packing,
limited availability of cold storage, and lack of on-farm storage and
specialized transport equipment, resulting in product losses and higher prices
to the consumer; (b) the lack of specialized transport equipment as well as the
deficiency of pre-export facilities in border cities, have restricted the
development of exports; (c) the lack of markets in medium-sized cities results
in additional transshipment of products, more intermediation and higher prices
to the consumer; (d) at the retail level, there remains a large number of
traditional corner stores with high unit operating costs; in Mexico City,
modernization of retail has been slowed down because of complicated licensing
procedures to open new stores; (e) market information has progressed, but the
National Market Information Service (SNIM) does need to cover other important
subsectors such as fish and meat; and (f) there remains a lack of long-term
funds because at the present time, most of commercial bank resources are short
term.
3.       During the last five years the Government has been opening up the
economy and liberalizing the trade regime and very recently has taken major
steps to reform the financial system in Mexico by liberalizing interest rates
and removing most forced lending. The Agricultural Sector Reform has been
uneven. In basic grains and oilseeds the Government is committed to bring
prices in line with international prices. However, much of the marketing and
storage of these commodities are still handled by CONASUPO and are subject to
trade restrictions, mainly quotas.  Further reform in this area will be
addressed under AGSAL II now under preparation. In the distribution of
perishable food products, the Government has promoted private sector investment
in commercial infrastructure through fiscal incentives, technical assistance,
creation of a national market information service and provision of credit to the
private sector. This effort was supported by the Bank through the Agricultural
Marketing Project for Perishables (2262-ME), which has contributed US$115
million to the development of the sector and has helped develop FIDEC as a trust
fund specialized in the financing of marketing projects.
4.       The achievements of the first project are positive.  The project has
contributed to the modernization of marketing infrastructure through the
financing of 300 transport units, 80 medium-sized supermarkets, 11 wholesale and
retail markets, 55 self-service stores, 2300 shops, 2000 warehouses, and 80 cold



storage facilities.  The creation of the National Market Information Service has
helped improve the transpa:ency of transactions in perishable products. In
addition, the project helped to introduce new technologies and new methods of
management. The project also increased vertical integration and improved
competitior.. Finally, it had a positive environmental impact as new markets and
stores have a better sanitation than the old ones they have replaced. The total
amount was committed in 5.5 years and the loan is being closed in 6 years.
5.       Yet, there is further need for the improvement of FIDEC's operations so
that it can provide better technical assistance to commercial banks in project
appraisal. The Government's strategy is that FIDEC (a) develop a wider vision
of the food distribution system; (b) improve its mix of staff and upgrade its
skills; and (c) improve its monitoring and evaluation system. These
institutional deficiencies would be addressed under the proposed project. The
Government also intends (a) to transform FIDEC into principally a long-term
funding institution during a transitional period when long-term funds are not
yet available from financial markets, and (b) to redefine FIDEC's future when
long-term financial markets re-emerge and private marketing companies can easily
have access to long-term financing.
6.       Rationale for Bank Involvement.  The proposed project would consolidate
the progress achieved under the first Agricultural Marketing Project by
providing credit to continue to modernize the food marketing system throughout
the marketing chain from agroprocessors to consumers and increase private sector
participation in food distribution. The project would strengthen FIDEC in areas
where institutional weaknesses have been identified. It would also improve the
transparency of food commercial transactions through (a) an extension of the
National Marketing Information Service and (b) a study on the iasue of licenses
to open modern retail stores in Mexico City.
7.       The project is a transitional step and fits well within the context of
progress on broader financial sector reforms supported by the bank under the
Financial Sector Adjustment Loan (FSAL). FIDEC, the trust fund of the Bank of
Mexico, with specialized knowledge and experience in marketing projects, will
have an important role to play until long-term ftnancing is adequately provided
by financial markets. In addition, FIDEC plays an important role in providing
technical assistance to the commercial banks to promote investments to bring
about efficiency improvements in this highly specialized sector. This technical
expertise would be transferred gradually to the private sector. First, the
roles of related development funds would be redefined as recommended under the
FSAL. FIDEC would continue to be the main source of channeling long-term
financial resources for agricultural marketing development. During the last
five years FIDEC, and to a smaller extent FIRA and FICART, played a major role
in financing the modernization of the perishable marketing sector in Mexico.
Under the proposed project, resources would be channelled through only one trust
fund (FIDEC) instead of three; therefore, overlapping trust fund
responsibilities would be eliminated. Moreover, to help FIDEC to turn
principally into a long-term financial institution, 80% of proposed loan funds
would be channeled to long-term loans with only the balance of 20% to be used to
finance short-term loans. FIDEC is currently one of the financially healthier
trust funds of the Government, well capitalized under the Agricultural Marketing
for Perishables Project and having done more than 95% of its rediscounting
operations at rediscount rates above the average cost of funds (ACF) to the
banking system. FIDEC is already committed to emphasizing long-term lending;
the share of long-term loans on FIDEC's overall portfolio has increased from 20%



- 4 -
In December 1988 to juat over 40% by October 1989, surpassing our projectet
change for Dectnmbor 1989.  Second, the proposed project would help tIDgC to
eliminate interest nubsidiea.  In addition, under the proposed project, FIDEC,
would be borrowing the loan funds from the Government at market rates (CETES)
and would repay the loan over the same term and grace period as the Bank loan to
NAFIN, inutead of receiving the loan funds as capital contribution by the
Government.
8.       Proet Obectives.  The main project objectives would be tot
(a) improvc the welfare of consumers, producers, exporters and tr&ders by
reducing losses, improving product quality, and handling more products per unit
of floorspace in wholesale and retail, which would result in lower prices for
consuni;urs anti increased revenues for producers, exporters and traders,
(b) improve the transparency of the system and thus competition through a better
dissemination of information on prices and volumes of products traded, (c)
consolidate the institutional development of FIDEC within the context of the
restructuring of the financial sector in Mexico and the redefinition of roles of
trust funds and development banks.
9.       Project Description.  Project components would includes (a) a general
line of credit to help agroprocessors, wholesalers, and retailers modernize
their marketing operations through investment in specialized packing, transport,
storage and warehouse equipment, creation of new wholesale and retail markets,
and modernization of retail stores (99% of total project cost); and
(b) institutional development of FIDEC and participating co=mercial banks,
further development of the National Market Information System (SNIM), and
technical assistance to retailers and producers, and market-related studies
including an auction system for selected wholesale markets (1% of total project
cost). The Bank loan would finance US$100.0 million or 56% of total project
cost (US$177.6 million, as shown in Schedule A). Foreign exchange would
represent 35% of total project c)st. Retroactive financing of up to US$10.0
million is recommended for expenditures incurred during the twelve months from
the expected loan signing date. A description of the proposed procurement
arrangements and the disbursement schedule is presented in Schedule B. A
timetable of key project processing events and the status of Bank group
operations in Mexico are given in Schedules C and D, respectively. The Staff
Appraisal Report, No. 8095-ME, dated November 14, 1989 is also attached.
10.      The project would be implemented by FIDEC.  Credit would be channelled
through the commercial banks which would on-lend to the sub-borrowers at terms
consistent with those of the General Interest Rate Agreement (GIRA) for peso-
denominated subloans and at LIBOR plus at least 4 percentagc points for dollar-
denominated subloans. FIDEC would also be responsible for the institutional
development component with the help of technical assistsnce from consultants.
FIDEC's rules of operation have been recently modified and are considered
adequate. FIDEC's staff skills would be improved t-nder the institutional
component of the proposed project. In addition, commercial banks'
creditworthiness anas ysis relative to project appraisal will be enhanced so that
FIDEC can delegate more project evaluation responsibility to commercial banks.
SNIM would be responsible for further development of the national market
information service and would receive US$100,000 for computer equipment from
NAFIN as a grant.
11.      Agreed Actions.  During negotiations assurances were obtained from the
Government that: (a) interest rates and intermediation margins would be set up
in such a way that they would provide FIDEC with a margin of at least 2.0



percentage points over FIDEC's cost of funds for either peso-denominated
subloans or U.S. dollar-denominated subloans, (b) interest rate to final
beneficiaries would be in accordance with GIRA, (c) FIDEC would carry out a
study to review the regulatory aspects affecting the food retail sector in
Mexico City, and a study on the feasibility of introducing an auction system in
selected wholesale markets, (d) FIDEC would create a high-level position
reporting to the Director General of FIDEC to implement the institutional
component of the project, and (e) FIDEC's long-term goal would be redefined in
accordance with the liberalization of the financial sector as required under
FSAL.
12.      Conditions of loan effectiveness would be (a) that the terms of
reference for a study to review the regulatory aspects in the food retail sector
in Mexico would have been agreed with the Bank, and (b) that the Borrower has
entered into contractual arrangements satisfactory to the Bank with the
Guarantor and Bank of Mexico, FIDEC and SNIM concerning the flow of loan funds.
13.      Benefits.  The principal benefits of the project would be reduction in
marketing costs, improvement in quality and distribution of food products, and
less congested urban markets would increase the real income of producers,
merchants and consumers. The project would also help develop exports and create
at least 20,000 new jobs. Investment subprojects are expected to yield
financial rates of return ranging between 17 and 44%.
14.      Risks.  The principal project risk would be a possible contraction of
credit demand due to currently high real interest rates; although these rates
are still quite high, they decreased by over 20 percentage points during the
last few months after a tentative agreement was reached on Mexico's external
debt reduction. In addition, the external debt reduction agreement, expected
soon between Mexico and its commercial creditors, would have a beneficial impact
on Mexico's fiscal situation and renew Mexico's confidence in its future
economic st~bility. This, in turn, is expected to bring about further decreases
in real interest rate and a gradual restoration of growth. Moreover, the
Government's commitment to open up the economy through structural adjustments in
the agricultural, industrial, and financial sectors mitigates the possible risk
of contraction of demand as these adjustments are already inducing substantial
private sector investment.
15.      Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed loan.
