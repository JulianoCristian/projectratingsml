"abstracts": {"cdata!": "Ratings for the Institutional Reform\n            Project in Bolivia were as follows: outcomes were moderately\n            unsatisfactory, the risk to development outcome was high,\n            the Bank performance was moderately satisfactory, and the\n            Borrower performance was also moderately satisfactory.\n            Lessons learned included: a political economic analysis of\n            reforms was not undertaken as part of the project's\n            design, affecting project implementation. The project\n            strategy relied squarely on the strong leadership role of\n            personalities, rather than placing the project within an\n            institutionally strong agency. This strategy collapsed with\n            the change of government. Project implementation improved\n            dramatically when incentives for reform were identified and\n            the main stakeholders of reforms took the driver's\n            seat. Fiscal constraints created incentives to improve\n            revenue collection, and the Ministry of Finance strongly\n            supported reforms in collection agencies and control of the\n            payroll. The Ministry of Finance took the leadership of the\n            project and promoted reforms in Tax and Customs Agencies, as\n            well on civil service wage bill management. Positive results\n            in Civil Service Reform should be expanded across all levels\n            of governments and enhanced with the implementation of\n            policies for a merit-based promotion system and a new\n            structure of salaries. Mechanisms to promote and facilitate\n            access of indigenous people to the Civil Service-a very\n            important policy in the Government agenda can be\n            strengthened if the Civil Service reform continues in this\n            direction. Strong analytical work could have provided\n            information about alternatives for reform and reduced the\n            expectations generated by the project's ambitious\n            design. Analytical work performed during project\n            implementation demonstrated that the Financial\n            Administration and Control System (SAFCO) legal framework\n            needed to be improved due to weak regulations and the\n            prevalence of informal practices in the budget process. The\n            studies also showed that Integrated Public Financial\n            Management System (SIGMA) has important weaknesses. Had this\n            information been available earlier, a more adequate strategy\n            to introduce a results-based management reform could have\n            been designed for the project. Strengthening the regulatory\n            framework and information technology systems should be\n            guaranteed before introducing a results-based management system."}, "docdt": "2008-03-27T00:00:00Z"}
