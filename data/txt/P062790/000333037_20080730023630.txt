SECTION 1: CONTEXT, DEVELOPMENT OBJECTIVESAND PROJECT DESIGN

1.1. Context at Appraisal

1.      In May 1998, Bolivia's Country Assistance Strategy (CAS)1 for 1999-2002 was
approved2. The principal objective of the CAS was to contribute to poverty reduction. To
achieve such an end, World Bank assistance as embodied in the 1998 CAS focused on three
pillars, namely: (i) opportunity--supporting the development of the private sector as the
motor of growth; (ii) equity--improving the standard of living of the poor; and (iii)
institutionality--strengthening the institutional framework to ensure a more just and
transparent public administration. To support the later pillar the CAS proposed to focused
Bank's assistance in: (i) modernizing the state, and the legal and institutional framework for
the private sector; (ii) implementing judicial reforms; and (iii) assuring an integrated
framework for municipal and departmental strengthening.3 State modernization would include
augmenting responsibility and accountability, increasing transparency, developing a professional
and stable civil service, improving internal processes, and refining the responsibilities and
competencies of agencies. The IRP would directly support the objectives of the Institutionality

Pillar by changing systemic rules and incentive structures, consolidated through modernized
organizations at the central and regional government levels4.

Historical Background- Low Economic Growth and Poverty Reduction Rates amid High
Macroeconomic Stability

2.      Although by 1998, Bolivia had attained a significant level of macroeconomic
stability following the historically unprecedented hyperinflation of 1984-1985, the
improved stability did not have the expected positive impact on overall poverty reduction.
Moreover, while economic stability was reflected in both a relatively high 4 percent GDP
growth , as well as the relatively low 6.7 percent inflation rates Bolivia remained one of
the poorest countries in Latin America with a annual per capita incomes of under US$1,000
and social indicators similar to those of sub-Saharan Africa.

3.      The high poverty levels (67 percent nationally and 81 percent in rural areas) were
mainly attributable to a history of low economic growth, limited human capital investments
and marked differences between social classes. Although Bolivia was one of the first
countries in LAC to implement structural adjustments and significant economic reforms in
1985-1997, annual per capita income growth persistently hovered at a mere 1.7 percent.
This was in part due to the fact that most reform efforts focused on macroeconomic
stabilization. From 1975 to1995, the average total investment rate barely represented 15
percent of GDP -- a significantly lower rate than that of countries which had succeeded in
significantly reducing overall poverty levels during this same period. Bolivia's dependence
on mineral exports and its narrow industrial base have also constrained the shift towards
labor-intensive, export-oriented growth. Overall, these have been important obstacles for
the creation of the virtuous cycle of growth, employment generation, and poverty reduction.
Finally, poverty in Bolivia has historically been associated with low levels of education,
health and nutrition, reflecting the significantly lower levels of investment in human capital
as compared to Latin American standards.5

Institutional Reform of the Public Sector: A Sine qua Non to Generating Growth, Equity
and Poverty Reduction.

4.      The Public Sector Modernization (PSM) program sought to improve the
effectiveness, efficiency, and transparency of the Bolivian public administration in order to
strengthen the country's ability to implement its economic and social development
programs and thus combat poverty. The program built on the substantial reform of the state,
including privatization and decentralization initiatives, undertaken by successive Bolivian
Administrations since 1985. That effort had significantly reduced the size and scope of the
central government, permitting the proposed program to aim at strengthening the remaining
core public sector. The first operation of the program (Institutional Reform Project) would
reform the basic institutional framework for the public sector and pilot those institutional
reforms along with organizational strengthening in several key agencies. Institutional
reforms aimed to introduce a performance assessment system, a national integrity program
to combat corruption, and the creation of a new human resources system, as well vertical

reforms aimed at strengthening key agencies were the core of the proposed reforms. Those
agencies identified for reform in Phase 1 tentatively included the ministries of Finance
(including its Internal Revenue and Customs Services), Agriculture, Housing, Sustainable
Development, Education, and a regional prefecture government to be determined.

5.       One obstacle that has undermined the success of wide scale reform efforts in
Bolivia is directly linked to the historical lack of requisite Congressional backing to
institute such reforms. Specifically, although four democratically-elected presidents
assumed office between 1982 and 1997, none would have the majorities in Congress
necessary to secure the approval and implementation of proposed reforms. Faced with
this impasse, political parties resorted to various pacts aimed at forging majorities in
Congress. These pacts were based in the distribution of authority among the political parties
to appoint personnel and define and implement policies in predefined areas of the public
sector. This was called the "cuoteo" of the public sector and led to cronyism and patronage.
This, in turn, undermined the ability of these successive governments to put in place the
institutional foundations necessary to ensure efficiency, transparency and quality of public
sector operations and services.

6.       The overall efficiency of the State in spearheading and implementing reforms has
furthermore been undermined by the wide scale turnover of personnel that has
characteristically accompanied successive changes in administration. Unsurprisingly, such
broad-based changes throughout government levels in turn undermined the efficiency and
transparency of state functions, the continuity of reforms, as well as the development of a
professional, merit-based civil service system. Moreover, Bolivia's public sector has
traditionally been characterized by poor recruitment standards, salaries structures which
were too low to attract or maintain qualified staff, the lack of career development or
performance assessment systems, and scarce or inexistent training opportunities.. Instead,
many public sector positions were covered by consultants often paid with international
donor money, which gave rise to enormous differences in salaries between these and
salaried civil servants, potential conflicts of interests, and disincentivized public servants
paid by the state.6


                                 Box 1: Halting Efforts at Civil Service Reform
      Towards the end of 1997, some measures were taken to reform the civil service system and
      encourage the selection of autonomous and independent authorities, particularly in the National
      Election Court, the Central Bank and the Auditor General. The World Bank and various other
      donors worked with Bolivia in the 1990s to design the Civil Service and Administrative Reform
      (CSAR) project, which financed the salaries of public servants in key positions hired by the
      central government in a competitive process. Two hundred and sixty public servants were hired
      to fill positions in different agencies, and their salaries were covered with contributions from
      bilateral donors and a Project Preparation Facility (PPF). In 1997, the new administration asked
      the Bank to suspend preparation of the CSAR project and instead focus on basic reforms in
      human resources management, in an effort to modernize a larger portion of the public sector.

7.       Other reforms, such as the privatizations program gave rise to regulatory system
that was still weak in the 1990s. Moreover, following such regulatory reforms, from 1994
to 1996 the government launched the privatization processes of a number of large state-
owned companies and undertook structural reforms aimed at encouraging private
investment and economic growth. In parallel, the government also established an
independent sectoral regulatory system--SIRESE. However, the change in administrations
during the 90's ultimately weakened this system given both that various superintendent
positions remained vacant, as well as the fact that the government openly discussed the
possibility of changing the system's design, which negatively affected the operation and
consolidation of the system in its first phases of development giving rise to concern and
uncertainty among potential investors.7

8.       During this timeframe, there was also a widespread perception among Bolivians that
corruption had grown in some branches of the public sector--particularly the judicial
branch, where authorities were appointed based on their political contacts--. Furthermore,
citizens often complained about inadequate policies and the inadequate qualifications of
government officials. The private sector singled out Customs and the Internal Revenue
Service as the most corrupt agencies8.


9.       With some notable exceptions, including the Central Bank, the Auditor General, and
the Electoral Commission, the provision of public services was deficient. Beyond
weaknesses in the Civil Service Regime and the Budget Process, state organizations
suffered serious structural deficiencies. Many ministries did not perform the functions for
which they were created and their activities did not reflect government priorities due to
confused and overlapping legal mandates and the lack of management and information
systems to track the implementation of public policies. A further factor undermining the
overall congruency between a given agency's activities and expressed Government
priorities, stemmed from the enormous amount of donor resources in the Bolivian budget,
which in some cases, served to skew ministerial management priorities to donor interests
and objectives beyond or contrary to government priorities.9

        Bolivia Institutional and Governance Review (IGR) ­ "Bolivia: From Patronage to a
        Professional State" 10

        This study was prepared in parallel with project drafting but delivered subsequent to final
        drafting of the Bolivia: Institutional Reform PAD. It describes transformations in Bolivia's
        political economy since 1980, and efforts made to consolidate macroeconomic stability and
        democracy. The study underscores that despite both the ambitious reforms related to the market
        economy, and institutional reform efforts, the quality of public services remained very low, due
        to among other things, the lack of implementation of the reforms and institutional weaknesses.
        The IGR explored politically feasible reform options, in an effort to narrow the gap between
        the ideal performance of public entities and the informal practices that characterizes its
        operations in Bolivia.11


10.     In order to address some of these problems, in 1998 the government set up the
National Integrity Commission (Comisión Nacional de Integridad--CNI), which was
chaired by the vice-president and comprised of representatives of the ministries of the
presidency, finance and justice, as well as the Prosecutor General, the Auditor General, the
presidents of the Senate and the lower house of Congress, the Supreme Court and the
Judiciary Council. The principal aim of the CNI was to strengthen anticorruption efforts,
redefine the relationship between the government and civil society, and carry out a public
sector modernization program. The CNI was also expected to play a critical role in the
implementation of the Institutional Reform Project.

11.     The conditions described above were expected to represent some of the most
important risks to successful implementation of the project reforms Moreover, the CAS
highlighted that the development of institutions for effective implementation of the legal
reforms was a pending task, and that weak efforts to reduce corruption would continue to
hinder private sector development and the implementation of the poverty reduction
strategy. The CAS further noted that weaknesses in the public management tools were
considerable throughout all government levels.12

1.2. Project Development Objectives and Key Indicators

12.     The project goal was to help modernize Bolivia's public administration to improve
its effectiveness, efficiency and transparency, and in particular to strengthen its capacity to
implement economic and social development programs, and provide services in support of
poverty reduction.13 The IRP was conceived as the first phase (2000-2005) of an Adaptable
Program Credit (APC), totaling an estimated US$72 million jointly funded by the World
Bank (US$32 million), Sweden (US$7.8 million), Denmark (US$10.78 million) and the
Netherlands (US$14.5 million), with a matching Bolivian contribution of US$21 million.
The project comprised (i) horizontal reforms including a performance assessment system, a

national integrity program to combat corruption, and the creation of a new human resources
system, and (ii) vertical reforms aimed at strengthening different agencies.14

13.      The project was to focus on supporting the reform of the public sector's basic
institutional frameworks, with pilot experiences in organizational strengthening. These
institutional reforms would be concentrated in the principal agencies through Institutional
Reform Agreements (IRAs). The IRAs were to: (i) be effective for a one year period,
renewable contingent on performance; (ii) transfer part of the credit resources to the
respective pilot agencies to fund implementation of the reforms; and (iii) oblige the pilot
agencies to undertake their respective restructuring programs in accordance with an
operations manual, including annual implementation plans and performance indicators that
would serve to commit such agencies to achieve the agreed results.15 Credit resources
would likewise finance the additional wages of management and professional personnel
hired via competitive processes by the pilot agencies as part of implementation of the IRAs.

14.      As stated in Annex 4 of the PAD, the main benefits expected to be derived by the
project were:16

         · Improved public sector efficiency (speed and cost reductions) and effectiveness
             (impact) in reformed public agencies.
         · Improved accountability through the development of a management by results
             systems and culture.
         · Increased transparency in management and visible reduction in corruption.
         · Increased tax collections through improvements in tax administration.

15.      According to the PAD, Bolivia's public administration was expected to significantly
improve by the end of the program. Most civil servants in the central government, including
the nine regional departments, would be hired and promoted on merit and paid according to
coherent market-related salary schemes, rather than significantly underpaid or financed on
an ad hoc basis by external donors. A more defined and secure performance-based career
path would sharply reduce staff turnover and promote sustained quality improvements,
professionalism, and esprit de corps. Public employment would have fallen in the central
government from around 13,000 to 9,400 and it would be seen more as a legitimate career
option for educated Bolivians rather than a non-productive job with little prestige and low
pay, or a source of patronage for political parties. Honesty and transparency in the
collection and use of public resources and provision of public services would be more the
norm than the exception. Financial management would have been deconcentrated to line
agencies through the parallel integrated financial management project, with accountability
enhanced through modern information systems and adherence to uniform regulations and
procedures. The budget process would have become a more reliable and powerful tool for
medium-term strategic planning. Ministries and agencies would have more coherent legal
mandates, primary responsibility for managing their human and financial resources,
streamlined organizational structures, smaller staff with a significant shift in skills balances,

and be subject to publicized performance criteria. Service delivery would be measured and
budgets adjusted according to results achieved. While the reform agenda would not be
complete, major and demonstrable gains would have been achieved and citizens and leaders
alike would view the public sector more as a national resource capable of enhancing the
general welfare rather than a source of corruption, private gain, or an impediment to
development.17

16.     The PAD stated that of these benefits, only the increase in tax efficiency would be
quantifiable for a cost-benefit assessment. The government estimated that the increase in
customs and tax collections in the medium and long term would exceed the cost of the
program. However, as project implementation demonstrates, other benefits were also
quantifiable. For instance, reforms in the management of the civil service and wage bill
impacted the number of public employees, the wage bill cost and control, and overall public
finances18.

17.     Annex 1(A) of Schedule 4 of the Development Credit Agreement set forth the
following performance indicators to assess progress under the project19.




17PAD, page 2
18There are anecdotic references of this impact but a study to identify all the benefits is required. For instance,
the implementation of the Biometric Registry allowed the identification of ghost workers.

18.      Annex 1 of the PAD (Project Design Summary)20 describes a set of program and
project indicators:

         · The first group of indicators refers to the relationship of the project with the
             CAS agreement.
         · The second group refers to the results expected upon conclusion of the ten-year
             program through execution of the three planned projects.
         · The third group is impact (outcome) and input (output) indicators of project
             development objectives.
         · The PAD also includes a set of triggers to be met before continuing to
             subsequent phases of the program.21

1. 3. Revised Project Development Objectives and Key Indicators

19.      The project development objectives were not revised. During project
implementation two amendments were made to the Development Credit Agreement (DCA)
to revise three performance benchmarks.

20.      First, via an amendment approved on October 29, 2001, the target figure for
benchmark No. 5 (public employees incorporated into the civil service in 2001) was
reduced from 1,332 to 1,072. Although the project was launched in January 2000, no
progress in the civil service component was made during the first eighteen months of
implementation. The incorporation of public employees to the civil service was not possible
due to the fact that the Civil Service Statute22 while approved by the Congress in October

20PAD, pages 22-25.
21Ibid, pages 10-11.
22Law 2104 of June 21, 2000 (www.congreso.gov.bo/leyes/2104.htm) modified Article 77 of Law 2027
(Civil Service Statute, October 27, 1999, www.congreso.gov.bo/leyes/2027.htm) such that this second law
would take effect 90 days after the Civil Service Superintendent takes office. According to the existing norms,
the Senate should approve by a two-thirds vote the list of candidates for each of the 18 superintendencies.
These are then sent to the president, who then chooses the future regulatory authories from that list.


                                                                                                            18

1999 did not become effective until June 2001. This delay stemmed from the lack of
political will and consensus to appoint the civil service superintendent, a legal condition to
render the Civil Service Statute effective. The revision of the indicators represented a
"corrective restructuring" which responded to the constraints generated by the prevailing
political dynamics.23 However, this restructuring only changed the expected results for year
2001, and kept the original expected results for the rest of the implementation period.

21.      An amendment signed on August 8, 2005 modified the baseline for benchmark 3
(internal revenues as a percentage of the GDP). The baseline data for tax collection was
reduced from 7.48 percent to 4.89 percent based on the level of taxes actually collected in
baseline year 1998. As a consequence, the benchmark figures for the following years were
adjusted using the proportion of collection growth estimated in the original benchmarks.
The same amendment also included a revision to the baseline for benchmark 4 (total
number of central government employees). The official figure increased from 13,000 to
19,202 public employees, based on updated information from the wage bill generated by
the Ministry of Finance. As a consequence, benchmark figures for the following years were
also corrected using the proportional reduction of public employees estimated in the
original benchmarks. Both of these changes were aimed at correcting wrong or incomplete
information included in project design, while maintaining the project's outcomes and
impacts. Annex 8 (Revised Annex 2 of Schedule 4 of the DCA) shows the revised
performance indicators.

1.4. Main Beneficiaries

22.      The PAD identified the restructured government agencies as the primary
beneficiaries of the project, and the citizens, business community, and bilateral donors as
secondary beneficiaries, as they would all benefit from improved and lower-cost public
sector services.24

1.5. Revised Components

20.      On August 8, 2005, an amendment to modify two project components was
approved--Component A: Performance-Oriented Management and Evaluation of Public
Sector Organizations and Component B: Combating Corruption--were cancelled (see
Annex 11: Government letter requesting the cancellation of parts A and B of the project's
components and amendment).

24.      Component A: Performance-Oriented Management. Due to the political crisis, three
presidents and almost all the authorities at the Executive Branch were changed between
2002 and 2005. These events prevented authorities to commit with this reform. Besides,
the financial management reforms -­the basis for the development of a results based
management system -- pursued through the public financial management information
system (SIGMA) and the Administration and Governmental Control System (SAFCO)
Law25 did not make enough progress to allow the implementation of a performance-
oriented management system.

25.      Instead, the government agreed with the Bank, IMF, IADB, and donor community
to prepare a set of studies to evaluate SIGMA and propose a plan to improve its
performance26. The Bank likewise undertook an evaluation of the SAFCO systems which
identified main implementation problems and suggested a set of reform measures27. The
government proposed that implementation of this component be cancelled pending the
resolution of constraints undermining implementation of the SIGMA and SAFCO systems.

21.      Component B: Combating Corruption. This component sought to establish
mechanisms to prevent, detect, and sanction corrupt practices in the public administration,
and included some of the tools in the international anti-corruption arsenal: an assets-
declaration system, and procurement, audit, and procedural simplifications. Some advances
were made in all of these areas. In October 1993 the government created the Presidential
Anti-Corruption Delegation (Delegación Presidencial Anti-Corrupción--DPA) and in
November 2004 approved the Integral Anti-Corruption Plan (Plan Integral Anti-
Corrupción--PIA).28 These initiatives included the main activities to be undertaken with
project support, and employed tools developed by the project such as the evaluation of the


25Law 1178 (www.hacienda.gov.bo/normas/pdf/LEY-1178.pdf).
26 The studies on SIGMA were financially supported by the PHRD 052116, Japanese Grant for
implementation of the IRP. The PHRD objective was to assist the Government in the implementation of the
Institutional Reform Project. Its main activity was carrying out of a capacity building exercise to ensure the
Recipient will effectively assume the sustainability and security of the SIGMA (financial management
information system). The studies covered the following areas: System Security, System Sustainability,
System's hardware and software assessment, Assessment of the System's Conceptual Design.

(www.descentralizacion.gov.bo/portal2/downloads/LEGISLACION/DS/28631.pdf) issued the regulations for
the Law of Organization of Executive Power (LOPE). The regulations created the Vice-Ministry for
Transparency and the Fight Against Corruption, within the Justice Ministry. The vice-ministry takes the place
of Presidential Anti-Corruption Delegation, which was created by Supreme Resolution 223623 (June 27,
2005).

public employee asset-declaration system and audits. The government and donor
community agreed to finance the anti-corruption agenda with resources from a donors'
basket fund and therefore decided to cancel the component in question.

1.6. Other Significant Changes

Extensions of Closing Date

22.      Two closing date extensions were approved during project implementation. The first
was granted in light of the Government's proven commitment to continue institutional
reforms as evidenced in unprecedented disbursement rates as well as its interest in
advancing towards preparation of the second APL. Moreover, between early 2004 and
2005, the government (the fourth administration since project effectiveness) had defined a
new public sector reform strategy. While important advances had been made during this
timeframe under those components that continued to be in line with the priorities embodied
in the new reform strategy, a number of important modifications were requested (including
the cancellation of components and the reallocation of funds) in order to closely align the
project to the new strategy. Given the above, in June 2005 the first extension to the closing
date was granted so as to allow the government additional time to complete a set of
important project's activities as well to prepare a new strategy for the second phase of the
APL. Subsequently, in March 2006, a second extension was granted to allow the current
administration (the fifth since project effectiveness). During this second extension the
current administration prepare an analysis of the reforms implemented with the project and
define its own institutional reform program.

June 28, 2005  March 31, 2006   The extension of the closing date was to allow the project: (i) to

                                to carry out activities under a proposed restructured Project. The borrower
                                submitted to the Association a proposal for restructuring the DCA which
                                included: (i) transfer of the Project's Technical Unit from the Ministry of
                                Sustainable Development to the Ministry of Finance; (ii) cancellation of

                                2006) from the DCA and Bilateral Grant Agreements.
March 28, 2006 May 30, 2007     The second extension of closing date was to allow the project to
                                satisfactorily complete a set of important activities that were being
                                executed and that were supposed to continue under a proposed second
                                phase of the project. The Borrower and Donors agreed with the Bank on a
                                specific Action Plan. During the period of the extension the agreed Action
                                Plan was to allow the project to maintain a satisfactory implementation
                                rating by allowing the completion of the implementation of successful

Modification of Schedule 3: Procurement and Consultant Services of the DCA

23.     On October 7, 2002, a new Schedule 3 was agreed upon between the government
and the Bank and reflected in an amendment to the DCA. This amendment was Bank-
driven, rather than proposed by the government, and reflected the Bank's decision to
implement a uniform procurement schedule in Bank's projects.


Reallocation of Funds

24.     The table below compares the original credit amounts allocated to each category of
expenditures, as well the percentage of expenditures that were to be financed under the
credit, with the revised ones as per amendments made to the DCA. The rationale for these
modifications were as follows:

   · Amendment to the DCA of January 14, 2005. As the preparation of IRAs proceeded,
         including organizational restructuring analyses and salary-sustainability studies, it
         was evident that more funds were necessary to finance salaries and less was needed
         for consultancy services. The government's decisions to accelerate the incorporation
         of civil servants into the new civil service regime ­one of the main project and Civil
         Service component's objectives- and to expand the IRAs to new agencies through
         simplified agreements for institutional reform, created the need to increase the
         project funds allocated to finance the incremental salaries of the new civil servants.
         As a result, the amount allocated to Category 2 (Consultants) was reduced by SDR
         8 million, while Category 3 (Salaries) was increased by SDR 8.14 million. Besides,
         the amounts allocated to Category 3 (salaries) for each year of implementation were
         substituted for a total amount to be disbursed during the life of the project.
   · Amendment to the DCA on August 8, 2005. The amount reallocated to Category 5
         (Refunding of Project Preparation Advance) reflects the amount actually spent on
         this activity.  Category 6 (Unallocated) was cancelled and a new amount of
         remaining project funds was cancelled in April 27, 2005.

Cancellation of IRAs with Ministries

25.     At the start of 2004, the IRAs signed with three ministries (Ministry of Education;
Ministry of Housing and Basic Services; Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development)
were cancelled by the government (see Annex 15) According to an independent project
evaluation undertaken in 2005,29 "this was the project's biggest setback".           The main
reasons explaining this decision were30:

    · The organization schemes of the IRAs worked well for agencies such as the tax
        collection administration, where incentives and culture are different from those at
        the ministries. The application of this rigid management model did not permit its
        adaptation or evolution towards other forms of agencies, such as the line ministries.
        The model designed for the reorganization of public entities fitted to agencies as
        Customs and Tax Revenue services. However, this model did not respond to the
        characteristics of more rigid bureaucracies as the ministries.
    · The vulnerability of the reform--in light of frequent changes in administration and
        resulting changes in the organization, institutional mission, functions and attributes
        of the ministries--rendered implementation of the reform increasingly difficult.
    · Frequent changes of authorities resulted in weak reform ownership.
    · The government considered that ministerial reform required different types of
        intervention that could not be addressed by the IRP, including the definition of
        sector policies.
    · The introduction of different salary schemes throughout the executive branch
        generated disparities and complaints from public employees.


SECTION 2: KEY FACTORSAFFECTING IMPLEMENTATION                              ANDOUTCOMES

2.1. Design

26.     Among the explicit critical assumptions on which the project was based, the PAD
listed political and economic stability; government capacity for setting and maintaining
coherent policy priorities; continuous commitment of the government to the IRP;
restructured organizations maintained despite resistance from special interests; and
acceptance of the reforms by key non-government stakeholders. There were also two
implicit assumptions in the PAD. First, it assumed that GDP would continue to grow at an
impressive rate of 5.7 percent (Annex 4 of the PAD). This assumption was needed to
calculate likely tax and customs revenues, and was not explicitly related to project risk.
Second, the PAD assumed that the government and Integrated Financial Management
Project (ILACO) project would between them deliver improved budgeting and financial-
information systems (results-oriented budgeting, SIGMA, etc.) on which IRP components
could build.

26.      Neither the explicit political assumptions nor the implicit economic and financial-
management assumptions turned out hold true. First, the economy has entered into deep
problems as growth has faltered: from 1999 to 2006 GDP growth averaged between zero to
three percent (Figure 1). Nor did the budgeting and financial-management-reform actions
expected to take place in parallel with the IRP occur.

27.      Project preparation and startup involved key stakeholders such as the President,
Vice-President, several ministries, staff of pilot agencies, donors, and (through the CNI)
representatives of civil society and senior officials in the judiciary and legislature. This
effort was to be further complemented by national evaluation reports, citizen surveys
undertaken by the CNI, and feedback to social communications campaigns to obtain
information on public perception of performance and reform results. However,
complications arose in implementing this strategy. First, it is not clear what real role the
CNI played in channeling the perceptions of civil society into project preparation.31Second,
national evaluation reports, citizen surveys, and social campaigns appear to have been too
limited in scope and results to be useful in defining the necessary baseline for


31As mentioned in the preface of the IGR (2000), by August, 2000 one weakness of the CNI was precisely
that neither the private sector nor civil society was part of its structure.


                                                                                                                           26

implementation of components A-C and also the set of pilot agencies to be subjected to
organizational restructuring under Component D.32Third, previous successful reform
experiences in the regulatory field (i.e. the superintendencies) were insufficient to serve as
a model to be followed by service delivery agencies (i.e. Customs, Internal Revenue
Service or National Road Service), given the fact that the former are deliberately set up
outside the hierarchical structure of the government. In contrast, it would be unrealistic and
undesirable for the main public service agencies to be completely free of ministerial
control.33

28.     According to the PAD, the IRP would be organized along three levels. First, the
CNI, which was chaired by the vice-president and comprised of high-level government
representatives, would be the maximum institution in charge of overseeing the entire state
modernization program as well as the anti-corruption effort, and define the required
policies. Second, the Project Coordinating Unit (PCU) was to be responsible for
administration of the project. Third, the Donor Coordination Committee was set up with the
participation of the three bilateral donors (Denmark, Sweden, and Netherland) and the
World Bank to facilitate the coordination and execution of project funds. As project
implementation proceeded, the CNI met only a few times and its role in overseeing and
enforcing consistency and coordination was weak due to internal political problems. The
PCU changed its location six times, which clearly hampered its effectiveness due to the
constant change of Government's leadership. The PCU was under the control of the Vice-
Presidency, Ministry of the Presidency, Ministry of Sustainable Development, and Ministry
of Finance during project's life.

2.2. Implementation

29.     Country conditions during project implementation differed substantially from those
prevailing at preparation. Neither the PAD nor the IGR that was prepared in parallel could
have foreseen the changes that took place in subsequent years. Important economic, social
and political events marked the beginning of a series of transformations that would affect
the course of the country and thus project implementation.

30.     Beginning in 1999, an economic recession in large measure driven by external
causes began to take root. Between 1999 and 2005, GDP grew on average a mere 1.9
percent -- less than half the growth attained during the period 1993-1998. This created
important obstacles for the project to meet its customs and internal revenue collections
targets. The economic crisis that ensued reduced the capacity to import and changed the
structure of imports, leading to less customs revenue, one of the criteria underlying the
IRP's success. However, as is discussed below, fiscal constraints actually provided an
important window of opportunity to pursue some of the objectives aimed at improving
fiscal conditions.



32 The information provided by the National Integrity Plan (NIP) published in June 1999 in this regard is
scant and fragmented and did not constitute a good basis for implementation of the IRP.
33Hence, effective functioning of service delivery entities requires an ability to manage and enforce a quasi-
contractual arrangement between the agency and the parent ministry (World Bank, 2000).



                                                                                                            27

31.     Latent political and social unrest would finally come to bear through the explosion
of social, economic and political demands that arose in 2003. Wide scale public recourse to
taking to the streets gained extraordinary concessions (such as salary increases for certain
sectors) and furthermore paved the way for important political changes including: the
approval of a referendum for a new constitution (currently in process); the popular election
of regional authorities (prefects were previously appointed by the president); the passage of
a modified the legal framework governing the exploitation of natural resources; and the
allocation of fiscal revenues to sub-national governments. Bolivia's traditional political
system essentially based on an "agreed democracy" among the three major political parties
and "political quotas" to manage the government was no longer able to respond to the
demands of society at large. The project's objective of depoliticizing the central
government was negatively affected by such unprecedented circumstances. Confronted
with such formidable and rapidly changing state of affairs, the Government's attention and
priorities understandably veered away from the institutional reforms pursued by the project.

32.     The project implementation phase saw an end to political stability. Six different
presidents would preside since the project's launch in 2000, and as a result, the government
entity responsible for project implementation as well the Project Coordinating Unit's
location changed the same number of times, thereby negatively affecting project leadership
and the government's commitment to the IRP program.

33.     These conditions created different scenarios during project implementation as
follows:

    · 2000-2002. The government was unable to launch the ambitious reform agenda
        supported by the project due to the deterioration of the prevailing economic, social
        and political conditions, as well the lack of strategies to overcome traditional public
        sector weaknesses. As highlighted in the Bolivia Country Assistance Evaluation34,
        overly-optimistic economic, political and social assessments were also a driving force
        during project preparation. Despite contradictory indications raised by the beginning
        of strong social unrest and analytical evidence highlighted in the 2000 Bolivia IGR,35
        the government launched an ambitious reform with weak strategies to overcome the
        prevailing informality in the operation of public management systems (financial
        management, public expenditure and human resources); capture of public bureaucracy
        by political parties; and the pervasive practice of patronage/clientelism. All of these
        constraints prevented the government from achieving major advances, so that project
        implementation would limit itself to mainly focus on the completion of the required

        regulatory frameworks and the preparation of analytical work that would serve as the
        basis for the restructuring of pilot agencies. Weaknesses in public administration were
        not resolved with the approval of new regulatory frameworks nor were the
        restructuring proposals able to define reform strategies for half of the pilot agencies.
        As noted previously, project indicators were adjusted to keep expected results in line
        with project objectives.
    · 2002-2003. Due to the extreme deterioration in the economic, social and political
        conditions that led to the resignation in October 2003 of President Sánchez de
        Lozada, the project did not make any important advances within this timeframe.
    · 2004-2006. important advances were made during this period. The extremely difficult
        economic conditions generated incentives to improve public fiscal management. As
        the political system collapsed, its control over the public sector diminished, opening
        an opportunity for reform. Reforms in Customs and Internal Revenue Service, as well
        in human resources management throughout the public sector, advanced in good
        measure because they were pivotal to keeping control of fiscal policy.
    · 2006-2007. The newly- elected government decided to maintain the project alive until
        a new policy on institutional and public sector reforms was defined. The National
        Development Plan approved in 2006 highlighted that State transparency, efficiency
        and inclusiveness are key to pursuing the social, economic and political
        transformations espoused in the government's plan. The government's Institutional
        Revolution Program36 that was approved in 2007, proposes a set of reforms to public
        sector operations. Support to such reform initiatives is currently being provided by
        some donors and the Bank has expressed its commitment to support this program.

2.3. Monitoring and Evaluation

35.      The indicators faced methodological challenges, i.e.: a lack of baseline
measurements; mistakes in baseline definitions; and improper measurement techniques. A
particular problem in judging project outcomes stemmed from the lack of a system that
would permit ongoing tracking of civil servant turnover.

36.      Particularly in the case of the log frame indicators, but also to an extent with respect
to benchmarks, many indicators served no real purpose during the implementation process
or in the strategic thinking of the authorities, but instead served as formulaic justifications
of project progress.37 The indicators should have been updated as changes in project content
were adopted (for instance, the introduction of important actions to support SIGMA and the
judiciary). Absent such changes, project reporting becomes, to some degree, irrelevant.

2.4. Next Phase

37.      During the period of the second project extension, at mid 2007, the government
approved its new plan for institutional reform based in the underpinnings set in the 2006
National Development Plan. The Institutional Revolution Program proposes a set of
reforms in public agencies and institutions aimed to improve transparency, efficiency and
inclusion. The leadership of this plan was assigned to the Ministry of the Presidency and
has contributed to clarify government's objectives through and open technical dialogue.


SECTION 3:ASSESSMENT              OF  OUTCOMES

3.1. Relevance of Objectives, Design, and Implementation

38.      The original project development objective remains relevant for both the
government and the Bank. However, the implementation strategy ­based in project's
design- is no longer in line with the government's new strategy for institutional reform. It
implies that any follow-up operation will have to consider the differences stated by the new
government's Institutional Revolution Program. The last year of project implementation
was used by the government to define its own institutional reform strategy. A follow up
project may share the objectives of the IRP, while responding to the new government's
implementation strategy. The reasons for the unsatisfactory rating vis-a-vis the relevance of
objectives, design and implementation are discussed below.

39.      Commensurate with one of the key objectives expressed in the government's 2006
National Development Plan,38 one of the strategic areas singled out for support in the
Bank's 2006 Interim Strategy Note (ISN)            39  focuses on enhancing good governance and
transparency To this end, the ISN advocates preparation of a new project aimed at
supporting institutional issues intended to: (i) deepen reforms in tax and customs agencies

37For instance, while the SEDUCA indicator of speedier processing times has been formally fulfilled, a field
visit revealed a completely chaotic process. In reality, the important problem has not been solved.

39Interim Strategy Note for the Republic of Bolivia, August 3, 2006


                                                                                                          30

to improve efficiency and reduce corruption; (ii) increase transparency in the public
financial management, procurement, and civil service and public assets management; and
(iii) improve performance of selected public service delivery agencies.40

40.      However, the preliminary design of the government's plan for institutional reform
(The Institutional Revolution Program 2008-2010) differs from the project in terms of
overall design and implementation as follows:


     · The IRP's design was based on a series of horizontal reforms centered on the
         development of public management systems (merit-based civil service, results-
         oriented     management        operation,      strengthened       corruption    control   through
         improvements in procurement and bureaucratic simplification) that were to be
         implemented in selected agencies to improve efficiency and quality of service
         delivery.     These reforms should have facilitated private sector development in
         Bolivia. IRP analytical underpinnings were based on the prevalence of informal
         over formal rules in the operation of public management systems and lack of a
         professional civil service.
     · As mentioned above, the government's program shared the IRP's objectives of
         creating a transparent, efficient and accountable public administration. However, the
         government's program emphasized the need for a more inclusive public
         administration focused on service provision, and the creation of a State that
         promotes and participates in the national economy, as opposed to the state's
         regulatory role to promote private sector development as emphasized by the IRP.
     · The underpinnings of the government's program are not primarily based on
         strengthening transversal public management systems to be implemented in selected
         agencies. It is moreover focused on improving selected public sector areas (vertical
         reforms, in IRP's terms) via the implementation of specific activities41.
     · As regards public sector transparency, the government's program is not focused on
         financial, procurement, human resources and control management systems                          42.
         Instead it proposes the creation of a government's watch dog to discuss and evaluate
         public policies, the modernization of the official bulletin that publishes legislation;
         and the implementation of e-government tools in selected agencies43. In terms of
         delivery of public services, the program proposes the modernization of selected
         agencies that provide services to citizens, but the strategy to accomplish this has yet
         to be defined. Another important element of the program is the creation of a new
         regulatory system for public enterprises.

42 The 2006 policy notes, Bolivia: Por el Bienestar de Todos presents in its governance chapter "Towards a
Good Government" a set of alternatives to improve transparency and accountability in financial, procurement,
human resources and public assets management, aimed at strengthening the public management systems
currently operating in the Bolivian public sector that were the IRP's key focus.

                                                                                                          31

    · The program has some activities in line with the strengthening of public sector
         management systems, but they do not have the key role assigned by the IRP.
         Instead, improvements to SAFCO Law regulations and undertaking revisions of the
         Civil Service Statute to facilitate the incorporation of indigenous people to the
         public sector are the main activities proposed within the context of the
         Government's new program44. Furthermore, the program does not put forth an
         ambitious agenda to overhaul financial, procurement and control systems nor their
         information technology tools.45
    · IRP's design included the creation of incentives to introduce horizontal reforms in
         pilot agencies through the financing of organizational restructuring and salaries in
         line with market references. The government's program has yet to define the
         incentives that it will use to promote its reforms and overcome resistance from
         bureaucracies and vested interests.
    · The ISN highlighted several institutional risks that may adversely affect some
         project's advances of expected outcomes. The institutional capacity of the state,
         particularly of the Bank's counterpart ministries and decentralized institutions, was
         key to the design, implementation and monitoring of the project. The decision to
         reduce government salaries could trigger a flight of experienced civil servants. The
         state's capacity to enforce the rule of law, including the adoption of feasible and
         realistic measures to reduce corruption and improve access to justice, seems to be
         weakened.46The introduction of a new salary structure linked to a new organization
         and definition of public positions and the introduction of performance evaluations
         linked to a civil service career system--measures that could define incentives for
         public servants performance--are not part of the government's plan.47

41.      The relevance of the general objectives of the program and the project seems to be
align with the government's new Institutional Revolution Program. However the tactics of
the new government's program, including areas, approach and implementation mechanisms
for reform are different.

3.2. Achievement of Project/Program Development Objectives

42.      The project's overall development objective is to modernize the Borrower's public
administration to improve its effectiveness, efficiency and transparency in order to
strengthen the Borrower's ability to implement economic and social development programs
and service delivery that works toward poverty alleviation.

43.      Despite important advances in the implementation of some of the expected outputs,
only limited progress was made toward the development objectives of the project. Overall,
the project must be viewed as a disappointment vis-à-vis the initial high expectations it
gave rise to. However, it is important to recognize the gains made under this project: (i) in

44Ibid. Page 26.
45The 2006 policy notes, Bolivia: Por el Bienestar de Todos suggested prioritizing the strengthening of public
management systems to improve the management of public finances and increase public sector transparency
and accountability.
46ISN, page 32-33
47These are some of the main pending reforms of the IRP civil service component.


                                                                                                          32

comparison with other public sector reform projects; (ii) considering the unrealistically
high expectations generated through project design; and (iii) keeping in mind the difficult
economic, social and political conditions the project faced. As is explained below, the
achievement of project development objectives is rated as moderately unsatisfactory.


     · The most important gains appear to be in the vertical reforms introduced in three
         pilot agencies (tax, customs and roads agencies), as well in the nascent process of
         civil service reform and human resource management.
     · The six performance benchmarks, which were closely tracked during project
         supervision, indicate that project performance fell below expectations. Seven
         triggers were meant to provide the principal criterion for passage from the first (i.e.
         IRP) to the second phase of the ten-year reform program. Hence, the level of
         fulfillment has been modest.

44.     Performance-Oriented Management and Evaluation. The component's objectives
and results were: (i) the design and establishment of a performance-oriented evaluation
system for public sector organizations; (ii) establishment of the required normative
framework; and (iii) strengthening of the Borrower's capacity for the administration of this
system.48 The contribution of this component to the PDO is rated as unsatisfactory for the
following reasons:

    · Although the results-based monitoring system (SISER) and its normative
        framework were formally achieved, they fell significantly short of instituting a
        results-based budgeting system, as originally envisaged by the project.49 The system
        and its regulatory framework (DS 25410 Y 26255)50 were put in place at the
        beginning of 2002 and there is evidence of its operation in all the pilot agencies.
    · SISER was mainly used during the first years of the project for higher-level
        monitoring (for instance by ministers) and for the pilot agencies to produce their
        annual reports. However, its regulatory framework did not link the system with the
        budget process beyond the budget formulation stage to specify what should be done
        with the monitoring results. Consequently, the system did not influence the
        definition of the public budget or programs.
    · The component spent considerably more money to help install the integrated-
        financial-management system (SIGMA) in pilot agencies (US$2.9 million) than it
        did on SISER. SIGMA provided a financial management tool to almost all of the
        pilot agencies.

50Supreme Decree 26255 (July 20, 2001, www.clad.org.ve/fulltext/bo-ds26255.pdf) called for the creation of
the System for Tracking and Evaluating Results-Oriented Public Management (SISER) as a tool to track and
evaluate the results goals committed to by public institutions, such that these institutions generate timely and
transparent information on their performance, with the ultimate goal of promoting and verifying results-based
management.


                                                                                                             33

                                 Box 2: PHRD Grant JP TF 52116

  This grant was specifically aimed to support the Central Government's Integrated Financial
  Management System (SIGMA). The implementation of this system was a pre-condition for
  instituting reforms in the selected agencies. The activities which the grant supported were
  geared towards carrying out a capacity building exercise to ensure that the Recipient would
  effectively assume the sustainability and security of SIGMA by: (i) conducting an analysis to
  select an agency to operate and maintain SIGMA; and (ii) ensuring security of SIGMA to
  guarantee service to public entities, data transfer, and back-up systems. The Grant closed on
  May 30, 2007.

  Four assessments of the SIGMA were carried out under the grant. The terms of reference for
  these studies were carefully coordinated with the Inter-American Development Bank and the
  International Monetary Fund, as the results of these studies were of interest to all coordinating
  donors. Studies were valuable in that they encouraged discussion with other donors on the
  sustainability and direction of SIGMA. The results are being used in the planning of funding by
  current donors and some steps have been taken to arrange for the transfer of the system's
  management to the Ministry of Finance.           The government at the time concurred with the
  conclusions and analysis and made some headway during 2006 and 2007 to respond to some of
  the weaknesses detected by the reviews.          At the same time, the IDB made use of the
  recommendations and conclusions to restructure their own project (Improve Efficiency of Public
  Management) that was funding the expansion of SIGMA to other levels of government. The
  grant was expected to fund some of the recommendations of the reports with the objective of
  strengthening the sustainability and security of the system. However, due to the new
  governmental policies concerning consultant contracts these were not carried and the balance of
  the grant was refunded to the donor.

 · SISER made no important contribution to project development objectives due to its
    limited impact on government operations that led to the cancellation of the component
    in August 2005.      51  However, the expansion of SIGMA contributed to increased
    transparency and efficiency in the management of public sector expenditures.




51On January 9, 2008, via Supreme Decree 29003 (www.derechoteca.com/gacetabolivia/decreto-supremo-
29003-del-09-enero-2007.htm), the government closed SISER and created the Measuring and Information
Unit (Unidad de Medición e Información--UMI) within the General Directorate of Public Management, itself
within the Vice-Ministry of Governmental Coordination of the Ministry of the Presidency, which also has
under its charge the Measuring and Information System (Sistema de Medición e Información--SIMEDI).


                                                                                                    34

                                   Box 3: Government Evaluation on SISER

         In the view of the current administration,52 SISER did not achieve the expected results for the
         following reasons:
         · Prioritization of some POA activities at the expense of others through the use of highly
         subjective "results commitments".
         ·       Quantitative and individualized judgments of progress and compliance with results
         commitments.
         ·       Duplication of information sources (use of secondary as opposed to primary information)
         ·       Tracking and evaluation of institutional POA execution based on the degree of physical and
         budgetary execution of programs and projects (a focus that does not measure the impact of
         government actions).
         ·       Minimal improvement in public management, despite seven years of implementation and
         large amounts of resources invested.
         ·       Lack of institutional feedback and use of processed information.
         ·       Institutional tendency to create isolated and unintegrated tracking and measuring systems,
         disconnected to a single planning system.
         ·       Results-based public management (Law 1178 on Governmental Administration and
         Control) has a limited focus on the auditing of activities already executed



45.      National Integrity/Combating Corruption. The component's objectives were: (i) the
implementation of the normative framework of the Civil Servant Statute, including the
rights and obligations of civil servants, a merit-based civil service system, and a code of
ethics; (ii) disclosure of assets and income of the Borrower's officials through a
strengthened Sworn Statement of Assets and Income System in the Comptroller General's
Office53 (iii) denunciation and prosecution of corruption by strengthening the ability of the
offices of the Ombudsperson, Comptroller General, and Attorney General to investigate
and document corruption cases; (iv) streamlining bureaucratic procedures to reduce
discretion, speed processes, and improve services to citizens; (v) procurement system
reform; and (vi) citizen education campaign to gain support for the fight against
corruption.54 The contribution of this component to the PDO is rated as moderately
unsatisfactory because the gains made a modest contribution to the overall transparency
goals of the project:


    · One of the main accomplishments of this component was the establishment of
         Sworn Statements of Assets and Incomes System for public servants. However, the
         system is not directed to those employees in positions vulnerable to corruption, and

Coordination.
53On July 20, 2001, via Supreme Decree 26257 (www.cgr-djbr.gov.bo/decreto26257.pdf), regulations were
issued for the Declaration of Goods and Income System called for by the Civil Service Statute. This
established norms that regulate: when declarations of goods and income should be presented; their scope and
method of verification; their content; and the results of non-compliance. The regulations also govern the
powers that the Comptroller General (www.cgr.gov.bo) has in the application and transparency of the system.
The Sworn Declaration of Goods can be completed online at www.cgr-djbr.gov.bo), where it is also possible
to view the declaration of any public servant.

        there is no control over the veracity of statements. Likewise, the government has
        made little effort to date to use the system to prosecute public employees for
        corruption
    · The simplification of procedures in different public agencies has not been very
        successful because the entities and specific administrative procedures to be
        simplified were not chosen strategically, and streamlining was confused with use of
        information technology (National Migration Service) or speedier procedures (La
        Paz Departmental Education Authority). However, the transfer of the enterprise
        registry to the private sector constitutes a successful case of administrative
        simplification.
    · The component contributed to the creation of an Integral Anti-Corruption Plan
        currently co-lead by the judicial authorities and the offices of the Attorney General,
        Comptroller Office and the Ombudsperson. However, overall implementation of
        the plan implementation has been modest.
    · Other component results were the provision of new rules for public contracting of
        goods and services (SICOES) and the implementation of a training program of
        forensic audits in the Comptroller General's Office. However the procurement
        system remains weak55 and forensic audits have not been executed in any agency.
    · The component was cancelled in August 2005 because the government and donors
        agreed to finance the anti-corruption plan with a basket fund created by the donors,
        and due to the inability to implement other elements of the reform agenda.

46.     Civil Service Reform. The component's objective were to: (i) update the normative
framework required to implement the Civil Service Statute; (ii) strengthen the Borrower's
organizations governing the human resource system; (iii) conduct a comprehensive
diagnostic of the Borrower's human resources and establish a personnel database and
registries; and (iv) reform training systems. This component made substantial contributions
to the creation of a professional civil service as well to reduce political interference in the
hiring of public officials. The contribution of this component to the project development
objectives is rated as moderately satisfactory for the following reasons:


    · The legal and regulatory framework that laid the foundation for a merit-based civil
        service protected from political interference was approved in its entirety (Law 2027
        approved, October 27, 1999). The Superintendence of Civil Service (SCS), the main
        organization governing the system, has been performing its functions since 2000.
    · During the project's life, 27 percent of central government public employees (3,918
        from a total of 14,00056) were incorporated into the civil service regime following
        the requirements stated in the legal framework. The SCS implemented the process.

   · There is strong evidence that the regulatory processes to protect civil servants from
         any abusive or irregular decision worked properly. The PCU developed statistics to
         compare the number of staff incorporated into the civil service since 2001 with the
         number of personnel that subsequently retired, switched jobs in the government or
         left the service for any reason, and concluded that by July 2005 about 81 percent of
         these personnel remained in their jobs, a relatively low rotation rate. Likewise, SCS
         played a fundamental role in defending the rights of public servants. From 2001 to
         March 2006, for example, 517 complaints were resolved by the SCS and 80 percent
         of these resolutions were abided by the affected public agencies.Table 6:

     · This component also supported the design and implementation of a wage bill
           management system (the Biometric Registry of the Minister of Finance, approved
           by Executive Decree No. 28076). In 2006 almost all public workers from the
           central and regional governments and independent agencies, as well as the 350,000
           affiliates of the pension system managed by the Servicio Nacional del Sistema de
           Reparto (SENASIR), were incorporated into the new system. The first goal of the
           system was to improve overall management of the wage bill (salaries and pensions)
           and reduce fraud.57 The system is currently developing new modules aimed to
           provide tools for human resources management.58 Nevertheless, this component
           made little progress in reforming the training system of Bolivia's public sector,
           including areas such as change management, ethics                               59and formulating a
           government-wide salary policy and associated position classification.

47.        Organizational Restructuring. The component's objective was to carry out the
organizational restructuring of the pilot agencies, including: (i) organizational adjustments,
introduction of human resources and financial management systems, training and process
reengineering; (ii) adaptation of the agencies' normative framework related to their mission
and operations; and (iii) development of a professional civil service under the Civil Service
Statute. The reforms supported by this component seem to have been the most successful
element of the IRP contributing to the project development objectives. As is explained
below, this component is rated moderately satisfactory.



57The implementation of this registry was also one of the main recommendations of the wage bill chapter of
the Public Expenditure Review (2004), page 73.
58 A database including historical information of public employees since 1999 is under developed and will be
used for human resource management purposes.
59Under this component, the IRP financed a distance learning center which unfortunately has not been
utilized optimally and at present confronts problems of financial sustainability.

                                    · The project financed reforms in 18 agencies through the implementation of IRAs
                                          that provided financial support for organizational restructuring and salaries for
                                          public officials incorporated into the civil service regime. Six IRAs included
                                          comprehensive reforms in all the areas described as component objectives, while
                                          twelve were focused on more modest reforms, including selected organizational
                                          adjustments, implementation of SIGMA, and the development of a professional
                                          civil service60.
                                    · Of the six comprehensive IRAs, the reforms proved successful in the three services:
                                          three manifestly "failed" institutions--corrupt and inefficient--were turned around.
                                          The National Tax Service (SIN) reform appears to have been the most effective
                                          while the National Road Service (SNC) and the National Customs Service (ANB)
                                          made important advances modernizing their structures and operations, although the
                                          sustainability of their reforms still remains fragile. Collection in Tax and Customs
                                          Agencies increase and evasion was reduced during project's life (see Figures 5 and
                                          6).   The primary road network increased by 50%. The three ministries under
                                          comprehensive IRAs fell victim to political change and proved intrinsically more
                                          difficult to reform than the services.

     · The major reform thrust of the 12 remaining IRAs61 was to incorporate civil
                                servants and undertake some specific reforms, such as expanding the use of SIGMA
                                and creating the civil service biometric system. It was a half-hearted approach to
                                institutional strengthening and, at best, may have helped open the door for later
                                structural reform in some of the agencies.

48.                             Reform Management. The component's objective was to strengthen the PCU for the
purpose of project implementation. The PCU has been vulnerable to changes of authorities,
including ministerial counterparts for the project, which impacted the project's leadership,
commitment and advances. For the reasons noted below, the component is rated
moderately satisfactory in achieving development objectives.


     · During some periods of the project when political will for reform existed, the PCU
                                was able to support its implementation.
     · In terms of fiduciary management the PCU was able to maintain a satisfactory
                                standard.62
     · Through the life of the project the core personnel of the PCU were retained, helping
                                maintain the institutional memory of the project.

     3) The process of incorporation into the civil service started on June 19, 2001, once the Civil Servant
        Statute (Law 2027) became effective.
     4) Number corresponds to March 2006.
     5) The five IRAs evaluated as satisfactory in December 2005 were: Customs, National Road Service,
        National Tax Service, Ministry of Finance, and Superintendency of Civil Service.

3.4. Efficiency

50.     The total disbursed amount during project like for all its components was around
US$ 73 million (see table below). In the case of the incremental salaries paid to the civil
servants incorporated to the Civil Service under Component C, the financing funds from the
credit, trust funds were US$ 45 millions. The additional income obtained by the tax and
customs agencies during the project life and during the reform of these agencies was almost
US$ 1.1 billion, which are equivalent to $330 million if collections are adjusted by GDP
growth, import growth, inflation, and devaluation. This amount largely covers the reform
investments made by the project.

51.      Table 1 shows that the impact of the project on tax collection efficiency easily
covered the costs generated by salary increases, as explained below64:


    · Between 2000 and 2006, the adjusted, accumulated increase in collection (US$300
         million, (line 10) was 5 times more than the adjusted accumulated incremental
         salaries payments paid to finance civil servants under Component C (US$66.6 line
         4)65. The increased collection generated by the reformed ANB and SIN largely
         covers the cost of the incremental salary scheme generated by the project.
    · During 1999-2002, collection by tax and customs offices was constant. As of 2003,
         it began to increase significantly. This indicates that the project investments
         positively impacted the results of these agencies (line 5).
    · The incremental salaries financed by the project under Component C represent a
         very small portion of total spending on non-financial public sector personnel
         services (line 13). Therefore, the impact of the incremental salaries scheme in the
         fiscal balance is marginal.

3.4. Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

52.      The overall rating of the project is moderately unsatisfactory. Moreover, while
project components contributed to creating some "islands of efficiency" in the Bolivian
public administration, including in tax and customs administrations and in the Ministry of
Finance, overall the project failed to produce a comprehensive modernization of the central
government.

53.      The horizontal reform of the budgeting system (including the use of budgeting by
results and a medium-term budget framework) was meant to come from outside the project,
but failed to materialize. Process simplification was also intended to be a horizontal reform,
but was carried out on a small scale in an unsystematic way, and as a result had little
impact.

54.      With the important exception of the civil service reform, the horizontal-vertical
linkages may have been over-emphasized in project design (in the particular Bolivian
context at least). Apparent successes in achieving horizontal reforms (component outputs,




                                                                                                            43

as measured by the key performance indicators) did not lead to commensurate successes in
benchmarks (outcomes).

3.5. Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

55.     The project development objective was: "To modernize the Borrower's public
administration so as to improve its effectiveness, efficiency and transparency in order to
strengthen the Borrower's ability to implement economic and social programs and service
delivery that aim at poverty alleviation."

56.     The project has contributed to the reduction of poverty in two ways. First, the
institutional reform of the tax and customs agencies has resulted in significant increases of
revenue collections, generating more resources for the Treasury, reducing the fiscal
deficit66 and opening additional fiscal space for pro-poor investment in health, education,
basic services and infrastructure and pro-poor current expenditure for salary adjustments in
the health and education sectors.

SECTION 4:ASSESSMENT                OF  RISK    TO   DEVELOPMENT OUTCOME

57.      As discussed above, the economic, social and political conditions that took hold in
Bolivia negatively affected project implementation. However, fiscal constraints generated
incentives to promote the project agenda, particularly with regard to improving revenue
collection performance of tax and customs agencies, and the Ministry of Finance's ability
to manage the wage bill through improvements to civil service management systems. The
project's salaries scheme allowed the government to employ project funds to finance the
salaries of public employees incorporated into the civil service and contributed partially to
resolve fiscal imbalances. It is important to highlight that after the project's closing all the
public employees incorporated to the Civil Service are being paid by Bolivian Treasury
funds.

58.      Reforms in tax and customs administrations may be affected by the reduction of
public sector salaries, which could cause turnover in the technical teams in those agencies.
Information on the impact of the salaries reduction decision has been requested to the
government but it is not yet available. As well, the legal mechanism established to appoint
high-level official in these entities and other independent bodies are apparently not
followed.67

59.      Three agencies with comprehensive IRAs incorporated almost all their workers into
the civil service regime, and twelve agencies with minor reforms incorporated more than 50
percent of their civil servants. This resulted in salaries' category spending jumping from a
planned 39 percent of total cumulated project spending to 62 percent of actual spending by
the end of the project.

60.      Despite the positive results achieved in some project areas and the leading role of
the salary incentive, the sustainability of the salary schemes was questioned. Some
consider that salary supplements invite profligacy in wage-setting and unsustainable fiscal
management.68 On the other hand, one study suggests that improved revenue collection and
the savings generated by a better management of public expenditures guaranteed fiscal
sustainability (Annex 13: Xavier Nogales' Assessment).69 The IRP's salary supplement
scheme was not anchored in a government-wide salary structure that tried to balance the



67La Prensa, an important Bolivian newspaper, reported on December 2007 that 96% of the public positions
legally required to be filled through an institutional procedure--with participation of the executive and
Congress--have interim authorities appointed by the president. This includes the Customs Agency, the
Internal Revenue Service and the Central Bank.

need to attract qualified employees with the need to ensure affordability.70 Rationalization
of the wage bill is a pending reform.

61.      The most important outcomes of Component A have already been reversed: the
government decided to close SISER.71 The project objective of implementing a budget-by-
results system will depend on the government's decision to create a monitoring and
evaluation system in the Minister of Development Planning. However, there is no
information about the mechanisms the government is planning to use to link the M&E
system with the budget process, a weaknesses SISER also suffered.

5.1. Bank Performance

62.      Bank performance is rated moderately satisfactory. Despite all of the problems
faced during project implementation, the Bank team consistently responded to government
requests in a fast-changing environment. The Bank team provided: intense supervision (a
task manager was reallocated to Bolivia); strong technical advice to improve the
implementation of the main project's outcomes (providing international experience and
knowledge regarding all project components, as well technical inputs to project bidding
documents and terms of reference); and analytical support (studies on project areas, for
instance on the SAFCO Law, and study trips). The execution of an independent evaluation
was agreed with the Government, performed in January 2005 and informed a mid-term
review of the project72.

5.2. Borrower Performance

63.      Borrower performance is rated moderately unsatisfactory. Difficult political, social
and economic conditions prevailed during project implementation. Constant change of
authorities at many levels in the executive branch prevented the Borrower from defining a
clear policy on public sector reforms and furthermore negatively affected project
implementation.




70Although the agency-by-agency approach to raising salaries is not in itself wrong: the government cannot
afford across-the-board rises in public salaries and needs to decide the priorities for such increases.
71On January 9, 2008, via Supreme Decree 29003 (www.derechoteca.com/gacetabolivia/decreto-supremo-
29003-del-09-enero-2007.htm), the government closed SISER and created the Measuring and Information
Unit (Unidad de Medición e Información--UMI) within the General Directorate of Public Management, itself
within the Vice-Ministry of Governmental Coordination of the Ministry of the Presidency, which also has
under its charge the Measuring and Information System (Sistema de Medición e Información--SIMEDI).

SECTION 6: LESSONS LEARNED

64.      A political economic analysis of reforms was not undertaken as part of the project's
design, affecting project implementation. The project strategy relied squarely on the strong
leadership role of personalities, rather than placing the project within an institutionally
strong agency. This strategy collapsed with the change of government. Project
implementation improved dramatically when incentives for reform were identified and the
main stakeholders of reforms took the driver's seat. Fiscal constraints created incentives to
improve revenue collection, and the Ministry of Finance strongly supported reforms in
collection agencies and control of the payroll. The Ministry of Finance took the leadership
of the project and promoted reforms in Tax and Customs Agencies, as well on civil service
wage bill management.

65.      Neither the project nor its specific reform elements were "marketed" (in spite of
some budget for this) to those who might have been prepared to support it. First, specific
project-supported reforms--notably in the area of customs and taxes--were not discussed
with interested parties such as the private sector. Second, the project made little attempt at
"political communication", i.e. selling itself within government. Finally, the salary
supplement model may have created resentment.73

66.      The ambitious project agenda made the implementation of some reforms dependant
on other ones being carried out elsewhere, causing important shortfalls in project progress.
The IRP suffered from a major design flaw in its assumption that it could anchor
Component A (results-based management along with the pilot agency reforms), on
financial management reforms being carried out elsewhere (including the Bank-financed
ILACO project). Component A was meant to anchor results-based management, but could
not because the weak state of budget management could not provide a building block. The
budget management regulatory framework (SAFCO Law) and the implementation of the
SIGMA information system were not completely and adequately developed, preventing the
implementation of the results-based management system. Adequate development of
SAFCO and SIGMA was taken for granted and little thought was given to its application.

67.      Strong analytical work could have provided information about alternatives for
reform and reduced the expectations generated by the project's ambitious design.
Analytical work performed during project implementation demonstrated that the SAFCO
legal framework needed to be improved due to weak regulations and the prevalence of
informal practices in the budget process. The studies also showed that SIGMA has
important weaknesses. Had this information been available earlier, a more adequate
strategy to introduce a results-based management reform could have been designed for the
project. Strengthening the regulatory framework and information technology systems
should be guaranteed before introducing a results-based management system.


73In the early stage of implementation, the project made progress in setting up a network of change agents
that would link the various pilot agencies, but this effort ran out of steam. It is not easy to market public sector
reform projects. Unless specific and visible service improvements can be demonstrated, the general public is
unlikely to be moved by information about new management systems or newly-established civil servant
regimes. Marketing becomes all the more difficult when governments are politically unpopular.


                                                                                                                47

68.     The greatest impact of the IRP rests in its support of the three services, ANB
(customs), SIN (internal revenue), and SNC (roads) (Component D) that also made an
effective start to civil service reform (Component C). It is extraordinarily difficult to
compare the achievements (and failures) of the IRP to national reform efforts elsewhere,
because public sector reforms are "soft" reforms specific to different national environments
and difficult to categorize and quantify. Civil service reform was a partial success in terms
of project objectives, but substantially more of a success taking into account the dismal
record of civil service reform efforts in most developing countries.

69.     Vertical reforms in specific Bolivian agencies--"islands of reform"--succeeded as
in many other countries, but a characteristic particular to Bolivia was that these vertical
reforms were linked to some horizontal ones. The strength of Bolivia's approach has been
to anchor its vertical reforms in a common set of rules, specifically the rules controlling
political interference in the appointments of top managers and of civil servants. Under the
organizational (vertical) reforms attempted under the six comprehensive IRAs, agencies
graduate to privileges (such as higher salaries) when they cross hurdles (typically,
achieving minimum standards in administrative/control systems). The World Bank has also
supported such schemes in Thailand, Ecuador, and Nicaragua. Bolivia's project succeeded
for the services and mostly failed for the ministries. The Ecuadorian case had a similar
outcome for its ministries: reforms were also foiled by clientelistic politics. In these
schemes, reforms supporting free-standing agencies (such as ANB, SIN, and SNC) have
tended to fare much better, in Bolivia as in other countries. Very often, such agency
reforms have been carried out as "islands of reform", i.e. vertical reforms unlinked to
systemic horizontal reforms--Peru provided notable examples in the 1990s.

70.     By the very low standards of achievement set by other reform efforts, Bolivia's civil
service has done well to get as far as it has under the IRP. Civil service reform has proven
remarkably difficult in developing countries because public employment provides one of
the main currencies of politics; hence, reform requires fundamental political changes, not
technical fixes (see Shepherd, 2003). The Bolivian government did this reform first by
understanding the political nature of reform and doing its best to come to an agreement
with the political class on the main features of the reform, and second by implementing the
reform in selected agencies. Unsurprisingly, the ministries account for a small part of the
new corps of civil servants.

71.     Earlier in the project, the IRP succumbed to the very illness it was designed to cure
by using project funds to pay for consultants occupying line positions. This practice was,
correctly, abandoned, and the project strongly promoted the incorporation of civil servants
to line positions. Unfortunately, other donors and projects have continued with this
practice.

72.     Although the project has taken important initial steps toward instituting civil service
reform, the government still needs to address a range of issues. First, establishing a system
of competitive entry and providing protection to incumbents from political interference is
only the beginning of the reform process. These steps are necessary, but not sufficient, to
get individuals to perform more productively. The challenge is to create the structure of a
career (including arrangements for career development, performance evaluation, training,



                                                                                             48

and other incentives). Second, management of the civil service is still weak. The National
System for Personnel Administration (SNAP), located in the Ministry of Finance, remains
largely ineffective, and has not yet developed a system for grading posts.

73.      The experience of the ministries points to some design weaknesses of the IRA
model: the IRA contract provided its greatest rewards before results were achieved; its
design did not allow much variance to reflect differences between organizations; and the
IRA were designed by external consultants, with a relatively modest input from the agency.

74.      It may also be argued that managerial reforms in agencies are best driven by sector-
policy reforms. For the services, there were clear sectoral objectives such as tax collection
targets (ANB and SIN) or new policies for transparent contracting (SNC). Ministry reforms
appear to have been less driven by these kinds of service delivery imperatives. ANB may
still face problems of political interference and an inability to tackle the smuggling
problem, but smuggling is a national political issue that is in large part beyond the capacity
that the government has delegated to ANB.

75.      The significance of the incorporation of civil servants into the three ministries with
comprehensive IRAs is difficult to judge, but it seems that one of the main causes of its
failure could be attributed to continued political interference. First, the Ministry of
Education did not complete any incorporation of public employees to the Civil Service
regime. Second, entrants into the other two ministries experienced a higher rotation out of
their jobs than in other agencies (25 percent of those joining in 2001-04 had left by January
2005, compared to an average of 9 percent for all agencies). It is possible that this was the
result of the upheavals caused by the politically-inspired changes introduced by the new
government in 2002 (changes in ministry structures, changes in the scope of political
appointments).

76.      While the civil service reform has entered a workable policy trajectory that should
not be upset, it may also be argued that the IGR's proposal of mixing merit and politics in
some appointments could indicate a way forward in the ministries. It may be that the policy
model of tenured civil servants below the top three managerial levels in an agency could
have been improved. On the one hand, some might argue that a better way of
accommodating the cuoteo político in the ministries might have been to have a selection
process based on both merit and party-political criteria for designated top levels of civil
servants. On the other hand, it may be more appropriate to stress flexibility a little more and
tenure a little less in the services (along the lines of some executive agency systems in other
countries).

77.      The major reform thrust of the 12 minor IRAs was to incorporate civil servants, but
there were also elements of institutional strengthening, such as the implementation of
SIGMA or the simplification of bureaucratic procedures. It was a half-hearted approach to
institutional strengthening and, at best, may have helped open the door for later structural
reform in some of the agencies.

78.      The salary strategy supported the incorporation of public employees to the civil
service. The following lessons have been identified:



                                                                                              49

· These incorporations appear to have been most important and effective in the case of
     the three services. A large part of the depoliticization process in these agencies was to
     replace many existing personnel by new recruits through an open process of
     competitive entry.
· For most of the other agencies, including those with minor IRAs, incorporation did not
     experience either the success of the three services or the apparent failure of the three
     ministries. These tended to be more politically stable agencies, and the majority of the
     incorporations were through the grandfathering process granted to personnel already
     having served a certain time in their posts. Incorporation helps ensure the political
     stability of these agencies, but has not transformed them. However, this incorporation
     may have helped to keep technical staff in the Ministry of Finance.
· Donor funds (particularly credits) were used to supplement Treasury spending on
     salaries for the term of the project. Salary supplements invite profligacy in wage-setting
     and unsustainable fiscal management. They also create horizontal iniquities which
     distort labor markets. The agency-by-agency approach to raising salaries is not in itself
     wrong: the government cannot afford across-the-board rises in public salaries and needs
     to decide the priorities for such rises. High salaries can at best be justified for a small
     number of "elite" or "strategic" agencies (such as the revenue agencies). However, the
     IRP's salary supplement scheme was not anchored in a government-wide salary
     structure--despite the efforts made by the task team to promote the definition of a
     policy74--that balanced the need to attract good people with the need to ensure
     affordability.

79.       The national integrity (anti-corruption) component consisted in a number of discrete
actions not embedded in any systematic approach to corruption. The assets declaration
system helped a few of the agencies combat corruption. Process simplification achieved
little. It was carried out without a clear strategic sense of what needed doing. Developing a
policy of public information disclosure might have been a better path to follow.

80.       The indicators faced methodological problems: a lack of baseline measurements;
mistakes in baseline definitions; and a lack of proper measurements. A particular problem
in judging project outcomes was caused by the lack of a system for regular measurement of
rates of turnover among incorporated civil servants. Particularly with the logframe
indicators, but also to an extent with the benchmarks, many indicators played no real role
during the implementation process or in the strategic thinking of project implementers and
overseers, but have been used as formulaic justifications of project progress.75 The
indicators should have been updated as changes in project content occurred (for instance,
the introduction of important actions to support SIGMA and the judiciary). However,
indicators on implementation of SIGMA were incorporated in all the IRAs signed with the
agencies as conditions for project financing.


74A mission was organized to discuss this issue and help the government with the preparation of terms of
reference to hire experts for the preparation of this policy. Terms of Reference were prepared with Bank's
technical support for the preparation of the Public Posts Structure and Homologation, Regulations for a new
Salary Structure,
75For instance, while the SEDUCA indicator of speedier processing times has been formally fulfilled, a field
visit revealed a completely chaotic process. In reality, the important problem has not been solved.


                                                                                                          50

81.    There are some divergences of actual from planned expenditures (for instance, the
project spent on distance learning and on judicial reform). Such divergences sometimes
indicate a desirable flexibility. It is true that the IRP was a new lending instrument, an
Adaptable Program Credit (APC) that was meant to encourage flexibility. But it is not
evident that there was much strategic thinking behind these divergences, and the project
thus came to pick up new tasks with few results to show in these new areas. The unplanned
investments in SIGMA were probably the most useful of these divergences. It would have
been more appropriate to use the supervision process--in particular a mid-project
evaluation--to undertake a proper analysis and restructure the project as needed.

82.    The advances made in public sector reform in Bolivia should be continued. Some
conclusions can be extract from the lessons learnt during project implementation:

a. Positive results in Civil Service Reform should be expanded across all levels of
   governments and enhanced with the implementation of policies for a merit-based
   promotion system and a new structure of salaries.              Mechanisms to promote and
   facilitate access of indigenous people to the Civil Service ­a very important policy in
   the Government agenda- can be strengthened if the Civil Service reform continues in
   this direction.
b. Protecting advances in Tax and Customs Administration is important not only for fiscal
   reasons but for the lessons that could be applied to other agencies to be reformed.
c. The new role of the State proposed by the Government Plan in terms of efficient
   delivery of services, with a key role in the development of economy and with
   transparent operations requires strong management systems. This is a pending task
   which problems have been identified and highlight during project implementation.
d. An incremental and sequential agenda of reforms seems to be the adequate path for
   Bolivia. In the short term a set of reforms may follow these characteristics:
   · Reforms should address a government priority based in a broad political consensus.
   · Reforms should be narrowly defined, in order to avoid the dissipation of efforts.
   · Champions for each area or agency under reforms should be identified and take the
       leadership of reform.
   · As in the case of the IRP agencies reform should promote the strengthening, within
       the agency, of the civil service and other management systems.
   · Selected areas or agencies of reform should provide quick gains, visible results in
       the short term. Preferably these gains should be linked to services delivered to the
       public.
   · Areas or agencies selected for reform should be isolated so that external political
       events (i.e Constitutional Assembly, change of government authorities, etc.) do not
       affect their objectives or achievements.

83.    The Government has not sent the final report required by Section 1.01 of the Credit
Agreement. As a consequence the ICR was prepared on the basis of available information,
including Project Implementation Reports provided by the PCU until May 2006

84.    The ICR was sent for comments to the Borrower and donors. No written comment
about the content of the ICR was received by the Bank. The former implementing agency -
UT-PRI- just confirmed that they were not able to prepare their own evaluation report due
to delays occurred during the last months of project implementation caused by the transfer
of the project coordination unit.

                                 Evaluación de las sostenibilidad del IRP

Metodología

· Por el lado de los costos, para evaluar la sostenibilidad del proyecto es necesario
      considerar únicamente los costos recurrentes. En efecto, una vez concluido el proyecto
      y por un tiempo indefinido, el gobierno debe hacerse cargo del financiamiento de estos
      costos. Sin embargo, aunque pueden existir diferentes categorías de costos recurrentes
      generados por el proyecto, por diseño, el principal tiene relación con los salarios
      incrementales. En ese contexto, para estimar los costos recurrentes del proyecto se
      empleó la ejecución de salarios incrementales de las ARIS mayores y menores,
      considerando los costos devengados76 (Tabla 1, Fila 1 en flujos anuales y Fila 2 en
      términos acumulados). Para poder comparar adecuadamente con los beneficios, los
      costos fueron corregidos por la variación del tipo de cambio, convirtiéndolos a dólares
      al tipo de cambio promedio de 1999 (Filas 3 y 4).
· En lo que concierne a los beneficios del proyecto, éstos fueron estimados considerando
      la evolución en el tiempo de las recaudaciones de tributos por parte del SIN y de la
      ANB ­ excluyendo las recaudaciones del IEHD que se vieron afectadas por el
      congelamiento de precios de los hidrocarburos, el IDH y el ITF introducidos en los
      últimos años y los programas temporales (Fila 5).77 Para evitar un sesgo sistemático en
      favor del proyecto, las recaudaciones del SIN fueron corregidas por el crecimiento del
      PIB, las recaudaciones de la ANB fueron corregidas por el aumento de las
      importaciones y ambas fueron corregidas por la variación del tipo de cambio (Fila 6).
      A partir de estas cifras se estimó el incremento anual (Fila 7) y acumulado (Fila 8) de
      las recaudaciones nominales y el incremento anual (Fila 9) y acumulado (Fila 10) de
      las recaudaciones corregidas.
· Se calcularon las razones entre los incrementos de las recaudaciones corregidas y los
      salarios incrementales corregidos (Filas 11 en términos anuales y 12 en términos
      acumulados). Si esta razón es mayor al la unidad implica que los gastos realizado por
      el proyecto fueron superados por su impacto positivo sobre las recaudaciones78

Resultados

La Tabla 1 muestra que el impacto del proyecto sobre la eficiencia de las recaudaciones
supera ampliamente los costos generados por los salarios incrementales. Entre el 2000 y el
2006, el aumento de las recaudaciones corregidas acumuladas ($335 millones) fue 5 veces
mayor al costo generado por los salarios incrementales acumulados ($67 millones).


76El devengado es más apropiado, que el ejecutado, pues refleja la gestión en que se generó el costo, antes que la gestión
en que se lo canceló. Dicho esto, en este caso, la diferencia numérica entre ambos conceptos es pequeña y no afecta las
conclusiones.
77No se estima el impacto del proyecto sobre otras ARIS debido a limitaciones de información y a la amplitud de los
objetivos que persiguen estas instituciones hace difícil la estimación de dichos impactos
78Este análisis supone que el proyecto tiene una incidencia directa sobre la eficiencia tributaria y que no hay otro factor
que la afecte significativamente.


                                                                                                                       60

Considerando las cifras anuales se observa que el impacto de los salarios incrementales no
es constante. El 2000 las recaudaciones aumentaron 15 veces más que los salarios
incrementales. Sin embargo, esta razón luego se torna negativa para recuperarse
paulatinamente hasta el 2006, cuando el aumento corregido de las recaudaciones llega a ser
4 veces el gasto incremental en salarios. Esto puede estar ligado al rezago de las
intervenciones del proyecto sobre la eficiencia en las recaudaciones y a que la gestión pudo
haberse cambiado en el tiempo ­ debido a la escasez de los datos, no es factible efectuar un
análisis detallado de estas hipótesis. Empero, estos resultados corroboran que el proyecto
tuvo un impacto positivo sobre la eficiencia de las recaudaciones, justificando el proyecto.

Note: FTT, hydrocarbon taxes and temporary programs were excluded


Por otro lado la Fila 13 de la Tabla 1 muestra que los salarios incrementales son
relativamente pequeños respecto al gasto total en servicios personales del SPNF. En efecto,
los salarios incrementales llegan a un máximo del 2 por ciento del gasto en salarios del
SPNG, cayendo paulatinamente hasta un 0.6 por ciento el 2006 ­ esto se debe a las políticas
de reducción de salarios aplicadas desde el 2004 y el constante aumento del gasto en
servicios personales del SPNF. Lo argumentado muestra que el financiamiento del gasto en
