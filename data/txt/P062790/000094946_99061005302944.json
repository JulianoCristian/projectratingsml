        of the Bolivian administration in order to strengthen the\n            country's ability to implement its economic and social\n            development programs and thus combat poverty. There are five\n            project components. The first, the performance evaluation\n            component, adjusts the regulatory framework, designs and\n            launches management and evaluation systems, and builds the\n            capacity of the rector agencies. The second component,\n            builds national integrity by combating corruption through\n            reforming the legal framework, developing prevention\n            policies and mechanisms, setting up an ombudsman's\n            office, streamlining bureaucratic procedures, reforming the\n            procurement process, and increasing social communication,\n            particularly a massive citizen education program. The civil\n            service component implements the legal framework, develops\n            personnel systems, and builds the capacity of the rector\n            institutions. The fourth component, organizational reform,\n            restructures the pilot agencies, supports professional cadre\n            positions in the ministries, and reforms the budget. The\n            fifth component, reform management, funds the entity serving\n            as the project coordination unit."}, "docdt": "1999-05-20T00:00:00Z"}
