International Development Association (the Association) and the Republic of Bolivia 
(the Borrower), and the related Danish Grant Agreement dated December 22, 1999,

amended. In this letter, all the terms defined in the Development Credit Agreement and 
in the Bilateral Grant Agreements have the same meaning as therein set forth.
Pursuant to your request and our recent discussions on the subject, the 
Association hereby agrees to amend the Development Credit Agreement and the Bilateral 
Grant Agreements so as to reflect the transfer of the Project’s technical unit from 
the Vice Presidency of the Republic to the Ministry of the Presidency, to update the 
Performance Benchmarks for Fiscal Year 2001 and to reallocate part of the proceeds of 
the Credit and the related Trust Funds.
Consequently:

Section 1.02 (q) is amended to read as follows in its entirety:
"(q) ‘UT’ means the Technical Unit (Unidad Técnica) within the Vice 
Ministry of Government Coordination of the Borrower’s Ministry of the 
Presidency.".
2.
Any reference to "UTVP" is replaced by a reference to "UT".
3.
The table in Part A.1 of Schedule 1 is amended to read as set forth in 
Attachment I to this Letter.
4.
In the sixth row of the fourth column of the table in Schedule 4 the figure 
‘1,332’ is replaced by the figure ‘1,072’.
B.
The Bilateral Grant Agreements are amended as follows:
1.
Any reference to "UTVP" is replaced by a reference to "UT".
2.
The table in Section A.1 of the Schedule to the Danish Grant Agreement is

in the space provided below and returning the same to the undersigned. This amendment 
letter shall be executed in two counterparts, each of which shall be an original.
