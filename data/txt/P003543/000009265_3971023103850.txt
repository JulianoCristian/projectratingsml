IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
CHINA
INNER MONGOLIA LOCAL RAILWAY PROJECT
(LOAN 3060-CHA/CREDIT 2014-CHA)
PREFACE
This is the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) for the Inner Mongolia
Local Railway Project in China for which Loan 3060 for $70 million and Credit 2014 for
SDR 58.6 million ($80 million equivalent) were approved on May 12, 1989. The loan
and credit were closed on December 31, 1996. Final disbursement was made on
March 27, 1997. The credit was fully disbursed, but $0.76 million of the loan amount
was canceled.
The ICR was prepared by Mmes./Messrs. Udo Marggraf (Task Manager), Richard
Spero (Transport Economist) of the Infrastructure Operations Division, China and
Mongolia Department of the East Asia and Pacific Region, and Dawn Vermilya
(Financial Analyst, EA2EM), Anil Somani (Environmental Specialist, ASTEN), and Anis
Dani (Anthropologist-Resettlement, ASTHR). It was reviewed by Messrs. Richard
Scurfield, Chief, EA2IN and Yo Kimura, Project Adviser, EA2DR. The borrower's
implementation evaluation summary for the project is included as Appendix B to the
ICR.
The ICR, started before the project closing date, was based on material in the
project file and data provided by the Ministry of Railways (MOR). The Borrower
contributed to the preparation of the ICR with its views and the data requested, its own
evaluation, and comments on the draft ICR.

CHINA
INNER MONGOLIA LOCAL RAILWAY PROJECT
(LOAN 3060-CHA/CREDIT 2014-CHA)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Introduction and Project Objectives
1.    China's development, which accelerated after the Government adopted the open-
door policy in 1978, substantially increased the demand for railway transport. For this
reason, the Government has been aiming to expand railway capacity since the 1980s, in
order to sustain economic development. In 1984, the Bank became involved in the
railway subsector, with four projects effective by March 1989, to assist the Ministry of
Railways develop its national network. In order to expand line capacity to meet local
transport needs and foster regional development, the Government also encouraged the
development of "local railways," railways built and operated by local governments and
enterprises, typically with financial and management assistance from the State.
2.    The Inner Mongolia Local Railway Project reflected this priority. It had three
objectives:  (a) to provide low-cost, reliable freight and passenger transportation,
facilitating in particular the movement of coal and other products from western Inner
Mongolia to northeastern China; (b) to promote regional development; and (c) to support
formation of a local company to manage what became the longest locally-administered
railway in China. These objectives were consistent with the Government's development
approach and the Bank Group's assistance strategy for the sector.
Implementation Experience and Results
3.    The project's most important objective-to provide a transportation bridge for the
shipment of goods between western Inner Mongolia and northeastern China was
successfully met with the construction of the 945 km single-track Ji-Tong railway line.
According to the reevaluated economic internal rate of return (EIRR), the line was
completed with a slightly higher yield (19.0 percent) EIRR than calculated at appraisal
(17.9 percent), which is satisfactory (para. 42).
4.    With regard to the second objective of promoting regional development, the staff
appraisal report (SAR) anticipated benefits in the form of stimulating local industry and
animal husbandry production. While the SAR devoted considerable attention to this
objective, the economic benefits associated with regional development were
comparatively modest. The current assessment of the likelihood of achieving the original
development objectives recognized that the coal supply and demand patterns postulated
in the SAR have not materialized, although employment generated by the line has



- vi -
decreased unemployment in the project area. Therefore, the second project objective has
been only partially met.
5.    The third objective was to support the formation of a local company that would
manage what would become the longest local railway in China. This objective was
achieved with the creation of the Inner Mongolia Ji-Tong Railway Limited Liability
Company (JRLLC) on July 16, 1995. The company's performance, hence, has been
satisfactory.
6.    Project startup was postponed for about a year by the aftermath of the Tiananmen
incidents in May/June 1989. However, initial implementation proceeded with impressive
speed, raising expectations that the project could be completed within the original
implementation schedule. The project was carried out by the Inner Mongolia Local
Railway Company (IMLRC), an entity created for the construction of the new line.
Despite its inexperience with Bank procedures, implementation progress of the project
was generally satisfactory. Although some procurement problems arose, they were never
a major contributory factor to implementation delays. The postponed start and adverse
weather conditions contributed to about a two-year completion delay of the Ji-Tong line
compared to the original scope, which was too optimistic. Construction was completed in
October 1995, and operations on the Ji-Tong line began on December 1, 1995.
7.    Following the Borrower's decision not to purchase goods related to doubtful
procurement, the Bank agreed in October 1995 to expand the scope of the project by
financing digital telecommunications equipment to improve safety, substantially reduce
maintenance, and improve quality of operations. The new equipment will be installed by
December 1997. The telecommunications component was not included in the original
project, which was intended to build the line with the most basic technology in order to
minimize initial costs.
8.   In terms of US dollars, actual total costs were close to the appraisal estimate
despite the increase of the scope of some line component items. In terms of local
currency, however, total costs were 51 percent above appraisal estimates. The difference
between dollar and yuan costs was due to: (a) the devaluation of the yuan over the life of
the project from Y 3.76 per dollar to Y 8.32 per dollar; and (b) the impact of steep
domestic inflation on the cost of materials and additional inputs during the early 1 990s.
Summary of Findings, Future Operations, and Key Lessons Learned
9.    The EIRR for the project's physical investments is 19.0 percent compared to 17.9
percent estimated at appraisal (para. 42). In the first year of full operations, traffic
buildup has been faster than anticipated. One year after project completion, the railway
company's financial condition was satisfactory and better than expected at appraisal. It
can be expected that the applied tariff level will enable JRLLC to maintain its financial
health and self-finance its investment program if traffic on the railway develops as
expected or better, and operating costs increase as projected.  However, JRLLC's
assumption of the foreign exchange risk on IBRD/IDA costs it Y 50 to Y 60 million per



- vii -
year and limits its ability to weather increases in operating costs or downtums in traffic
volumes.  In sum, the project's outcome is rated as satisfactory, its institutional
development as substantial and its sustainability as likely (para. 65).
10.   At the end of JRLLC's first year of operation, the company developed a business
plan for 1997, which established operational and financial targets (based on a
conservative forecast for freight and passenger traffic). JRLLC also prepared a detailed
investment program from 1996 to 2003 that encompasses capacity expansion as well as
safety and other investments. The long-term financial analysis prepared for this ICR will
allow JRLLC's management to take corrective measures and to improve future annual
business plans. Intensive training in financial analysis, based on generally accepted
accounting principles, would further enhance JRLLC's capability to review investment
options and its own financial sustainability. In addition, JRLLC should prepare a long-
term operational plan so as to determine other investments that may be needed. JRLLC
should also consider technical assistance to clarify the roles and responsibilities of
JRLLC's management versus its owners (para. 66).
11.   The Bank's performance was somewhat mixed.  In general, identification,
preparation and appraisal of the project was satisfactory. As was consistent with the
practice in the 1980s, no project performance indicators were developed. Training could
also have been prepared in greater detail. Although well-defined in terms of persons, and
time, costs tumed out to be unrealistic (paras. 52 and 55).
12.   The project was adequately supervised through short, standard missions. Bank
involvement, however, was not always adequately concemed with detailed
implementation issues. The Bank's supervision should also have focused earlier on
environmental protection and the adequate development of JRLLC's financial skills. A
key issue affecting the short- and long-term financial performance of the Beneficiary
came to light only at the ICR preparation. For these reasons, supervision is rated
deficient in Table 1, Summary of Assessment (paras. 56 and 57).
13.   The Borrower's performance was satisfactory. The Beneficiary's administrative
performance was generally very good. The civil works were carried out according to
current MOR standards and are of good quality. There were only a few problems during
project implementation; although IMLRC, the newly created organization to implement
the project, had little institutional experience with Bank project appraisal and
procurement. The Beneficiary was outstandingly cooperative and provided a great
amount of information and data for this ICR complementing the Bank's project file
(paras. 58 and 60).
14.   The main lessons leamed from this project were (para. 67):
(a)    The SAR properly recognized that the volume of traffic that JRLLC
actually handles would be critical to its economic success and commercial
viability. Thus, the SAR placed great emphasis on the rate of traffic
growth relative to the engineering line capacity of the route, and the need



- viii -
to eliminate operating bottlenecks at off-line locations east of the route. It
was also designed to ensure that certain Dongsheng coal mines, whose
output was to be dedicated to the line, could be brought into production on
a timely basis. Vital as all of these physical elements are to the success of
JRLLC, it is important to acknowledge that, as a bridge railway, the
fortunes of the company are greatly dependent on its commercial
relationship with the national railway system. Specifically, this means that
JRLLC needs to be able to interchange enough traffic with the national
railway, and at appropriate price levels so that it can operate on a basis that
is both compensatory and competitive. In considering future railways
projects-especially those where substantial traffic exchanges are
involved-the Bank should devote particular attention to the commercial
aspects of these intrarailway relationships.
(b)   A second lesson stems from the first.  Perhaps the greatest potential
benefit of this project relates to the competition that JRLLC can foster vis-
a-vis the national railway, as both adopt more market-oriented pricing
environments.   As a low-cost, local railway, JRLLC  already has
demonstrated that it can attract some traffic from the parallel routes of the
national railways by virtue of its lower freight tariff.  When greater
flexibility is introduced into the railway regulatory regime, individual
carriers will seek to maximize their competitive advantage by operating in
a more cost-effective manner which, in turn, will stimulate more market-
responsive pricing of railway services. This competitive interplay not only
yields lower tariffs to shippers but enhanced economic benefits to the
society as a whole. Accordingly, in evaluating future railway investment
projects, the Bank should recognize the potential competitive dynamics
that such investments can promote.
(c)    The original intention at appraisal was to require the Government of Inner
Mongolia to bear the foreign exchange risk of the loan and credit. The
implementation agency's assumption of this risk instead will have a
negative effect on its ability to build up a cash reserve and protect against
unexpected increases in operating costs or reduced traffic volumes. The
change in onlending terms should have come to light before ICR
preparation. This suggests that supervision of projects should include a
thorough review of compliance with financing arrangements. In addition,
the financial performance of a project entity at the detail of the financial
analysis as given in the SAR, should be reestimated at about mid-term of
the implementation period.

INNER MONGOLIA LOCAL RAILWAY PROJECT
(LOAN 3060-CHA/CREDIT 2014-CHA)
PART I: PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION ASSESSMENT
A. PROJECT OBJECTIVES AND DESCRIPTION
1.    As with most other centrally planned economies, China's economy is transport-
intensive. The transport system, composed mainly of railways, highways, inland water
transport and coastal shipping, is concentrated along the eastern seaboard and serves
high-intensity freight traffic. Because of rapid economic growth-particularly after the
Government adopted an open-door policy in 1978-the demand for transport outpaced
the supply. Indeed, the network is one of the sparsest in the world, with respect to both
the area and population it serves, although the length of the railway more than doubled in
size while that of the highway system increased ninefold during 1952-83. Growth in rail
freight averaged 9 percent a year over this period, but slowed to around 4.5 percent a year
after 1978, as traffic saturated existing lines and rolling stock capacity. Thus, by 1983,
the railway could not meet transport demand. The Government was aware of these
shortcomings and focused on developing the transport sector and particularly, the
railway, which played a critical economic role in China by transporting coal, the main
energy source throughout the country.
2.    In 1984, the Bank became involved in the railway subsector, with four projects
effective by March 1989 to assist the Ministry of Railways (MOR) develop its national
network. In order to expand line capacity to meet local transport needs and foster
regional development, the Government also encouraged the development of "local
railways." These are railways built and operated by local governments and enterprises,
typically with financial and management assistance from the State.  This project,
approved in May 1989, had three objectives: (a) to provide low-cost, reliable freight and
passenger transportation, facilitating in particular the movement of coal and other
products from western Inner Mongolia to northeastern China; (b) to promote regional
development; and (c) to support formation of a local company to manage what became
the longest locally-administered railway in China.
3.    The project's three main components were designed to assist in the:
(a)   construction of the railway line;
(b)   acquisition and installation of operational equipment; and
(c)   recruitment and training of staff to operate the railway.



- 2 -
4.    Related components included land acquisition and resettlement. In parallel with
this project, the Government was to develop the Dongsheng coal field, the second-most
important coal deposit in China, with its own funding.
5.    Project objectives were realistic, clearly articulated and consistent with the
Government's goal and the Bank's assistance strategy to develop the railway subsector.
Planned investments towards the objectives were also appropriate. The project was
neither too complex nor risky, although somewhat optimistic with regard to
implementation scheduling.
B. ACHIEVEMENT OF PROJECT OBJECTIVES
6.    The project's objectives were substantially achieved, as indicated below.
Project Implementation
7.    Line Construction  and  Acquisition  and  Installation  of Operational
Equipment. The project's most important aim was providing a transportation bridge for
the shipment of goods between western Inner Mongolia and northeastern China. The
construction of the 945 km single-track Ji-Tong railway line successfully met the
objective of linking western Inner Mongolia with northeastern China. Work was
completed by October 1995, and operations began on December 1, 1995.
8.    Promotion of Regional Development. The second objective of the project
focused on promoting regional development. Noting that the Ji-Tong line would pass
through 12 counties and would affect a hinterland area as well, the staff appraisal report
(SAR) anticipated benefits in the form of stimulating local industry and animal husbandry
production.  While the SAR devoted considerable attention to this objective, the
economic benefits associated with regional development were comparatively modest. It
should be mentioned, however, that according to the Inner Mongolia Ji-Tong Railway
Limited Liability Company (JRLLC), recruitment of staff has played a significant role in
solving the unemployment problem along the new railway line, and increased income of
local people. Nevertheless, the second project objective has been only partially met.
9.    Institutional Development. The third objective involved the formation of a local
company that would manage what would become the longest local railway in China.
This objective was achieved with the creation of the Inner Mongolia Ji-Tong Railway
Limited Liability Company on July 16, 1995, which succeeded the project
implementation agency, the Inner Mongolia Local Railway Company (IMLRC). MOR
and the Government of Inner Mongolia (GIM) are the shareholders of the initial Y 800
million capital, with MOR having 52.5 percent and GIM 47.5 percent of ownership. The
ratio was based on the portion of funds provided by each partner towards the construction
costs. In 1997, accountants will determine the final value of the line assets at the time of
construction work acceptance. On this basis, the final share distribution between MOR
and GIM will be decided. The new railway company is managerially independent, but
works in close cooperation with MOR.



- 3 -
10.   There is a twofold significance to this objective. First, local railways which are
built and operated by local governments and enterprises, enjoy a greater degree of
financial and pricing freedom compared with the national railway carrier. In this respect,
therefore, the tariff levels of local railways may be higher or lower than those of the
national railways. Second, from a geographical perspective, most local railways are
shorter haul, "stub-end" lines. This, in turn, limits their ability to interchange traffic with
the national railways since their only connection with the national railways is at one end
of their local route. In this respect, Ji-Tong is somewhat unique in that as an overhead or
bridge railway (i.e., a transporter of through traffic that neither originates nor terminates
on JRLLC itself) it links with the national railways at both its eastern (Tongliao) and
western (Benhong) terminals. As such, for shippers in northeastern China, on the one
hand and those in western Inner Mongolia and beyond on the other, the Ji-Tong line
represents a shorter distance through railway option compared with the alternative of
routing traffic via Datong, Beijing, and Qinhuangdao. Taken together, the existence of
this routing alternative along with the comparative pricing flexibility accorded local
railway operators combine to create the potential for fostering true intrarailway
competition in China.
11.   Staffing. The staffing plan for 7,600 employees discussed during appraisal was
very tentative. By the end of 1996, JRLLC employed 9,004 staff including temporary
workers. About 400 of them were managers and supervisors. There were 1,300
employees provided by MOR, 4,447 trainees that were high-school graduates, and 550
local staff. In addition, JRLLC had contracted 708 experienced steam locomotive drivers
and locomotive maintenance mechanics in 1995 to help out for two years; and 1,999
temporary workers.
12.   Given the Chinese employment standards and practices, JRLLC pursued a
reasonable staffing policy, although it was under great pressure to accept staff hired by
GIM based on personal, family, or political connections, but lacking adequate
qualifications. The company intends to maintain the current number of staff as a
maximum, and will, therefore, replace about half of the temporary staff by the trainees,
when they join as graduates.
13.   Training. Since 1991, 4,710 staff have been trained; about 600 staff less than
envisioned at appraisal due to the downward revision of the total number of permanent
employees. All in all, 73 percent of all staff have been or are being trained for two years,
nearly 25 percent for one year, and the rest (2 percent) either for 1.5 or 2.5 years. By the
end of 1995, IMLRC had paid Y 5.55 million for training and estimates Y 1.1 million in
future training costs, which is substantially higher than the Y 1.4 million estimated at
appraisal, notwithstanding the fact that the trainees had to pay half of the costs. The
original estimate of training costs was unrealistically low. At that time, IMLRC was
mainly concerned with engineering issues, and, therefore, relied on the estimates
provided by the design institute, which assumed a limited budget. Even though inflation
was a contributing factor, tuition prices rose much faster than inflation. Training appears



- 4 -
to have been effective because the newly established JRLLC was able to handle a freight
traffic buildup faster than anticipated in its first year of full operations.
14.   Traffic Patterns. The understanding of the volume and mix of JRLLC's traffic is
important to an assessment of the extent to which the SAR objectives may have been
achieved. In this respect, various logistical and distributional problems outside JRLLC's
control have combined to depress the volume of coal that the company has been able to
transport. For 1996, the first full year of operations, JRLLC handled just over 1 million
tons of coal in overhead service-less than half of the 2.3 million tons projected in the
SAR. Similarly, in 1997, Ji-Tong through coal volume is estimated at about 1.5 million
tons or 37 percent of the nearly 4 million tons forecast for year 2 in the SAR.
15.   This experience shows just how dependent a bridge carrier, such as JRLLC, is
upon the traffic generated along lines with which it connects. When markets do not
develop as anticipated (or when connecting railways route traffic so as to avoid the
intermediate overhead route), the bridge carrier must find other sources of traffic to
compensate for these losses. In fact, by making use of the pricing flexibility accorded to
local railways, this is what JRLLC has been able to accomplish. Specifically, compared
to its nominal base freight rate of 10 fen per ton-kilometer (tkm), which applies to JRLLC
local traffic, a rate of only 8 fen per tkm has been instituted by JRLLC for through traffic
interchanging with the national railways. As a result of this 20 percent discount, JRLLC
has made its route more competitive and has succeeded in attracting a variety of both coal
and noncoal products.
16.   These developments have substantially altered the traffic composition of railway
compared to what was postulated in the SAR. For the first two years of operation, the
volume of through coal movements transported by JRLLC is well below SAR estimates.
Compensating for this coal deficit, however, are shipments of noncoal commodities (e.g.,
grain, chemicals, timber, etc.), which JRLLC forecasts will amount to more than 3.1
million tons by 1997. This is almost 50 percent greater than the traffic estimates
projected in the SAR. In addition, while the volume of JRLLC local traffic is
significantly higher than the levels presented in the SAR, this in large part is attributable
to coal which is expected to account for nearly half of local freight tonnage in 1997 (a
portion of this coal is quite similar to overhead bridge traffic because it is loaded at
stations at the west end of the Ji-Tong route and delivered off-line to destinations in the
northeast). At the same time, the 280,000 passengers which JRLLC estimates it will
carry in 1997 is well below the second-year figure of 860,000 persons projected in the
SAR; These local and passenger traffic categories are the most immediate indicators of
the regional development that could be stimulated by JRLLC operations. At best, the
results must be regarded as mixed.
C. IMPLEMENTATION RECORD AND MAJOR FACTORS AFFECTING THE PROJECT
17.   Implementation Schedule. The project was approved by the Board on May 12,
1989, and the loan/credit became effective on January 3, 1990. However, the State



- 5 -
Council did not approve construction of the new line until May 22, 1990. This delay
came as an aftermath of the Tiananmen incidents in May/June 1989, which affected most
investment projects, especially those which had not been started, such as the Ji-Tong line.
Meanwhile, IMLRC had been created as an entity for the construction of the new line. It
started the necessary procurement work well before obtaining the official green light and
was therefore able to sign contracts for the eastern section on May 26, 1990, and for the
western section on June 2, 1990. This decisive action enabled work to start on June 20 of
the same year on both end sections. The contracts for the three middle sections were
signed in September 1990, but work began only in April 1991, because earthworks could
not be carried out in Inner Mongolia's very cold winters.
18.   Although postponed for about a year by the Tiananmen incidents, from the start
implementation proceeded with impressive speed, raising expectations that the project
could be completed within the originally planned scope of time.  The SAR
implementation schedule was, however, optimistic particularly in light of IMLRC's lack
of experience with Bank requirements of procurement. In July and August 1993, heavy
rains (at one time 60 mm within 2 to 3 hours, while the annual average is 300 mm)
caused extensive damage to embankments and track beds estimated at Y 3 million (about
$0.5 million). Arrival of materials was interrupted for one month. All these, in
conjunction with the postponed start, contributed to about a two-year completion delay of
the Ji-Tong line's original scope of works. However, great efforts were made to make up
for the delays. During the winter of 1993-94, track laying continued despite the bitter
cold weather conditions. Construction was completed in October 1995, and operations
on the Ji-Tong line began on December 1, 1995.
19.   When remaining Bank funds became available (para. 26), IMLRC requested and
the Bank agreed in October 1995, to use about $2.8 million for digital
telecommunications equipment for 610 km of line to improve safety, substantially reduce
maintenance, and improve quality of operations. The new equipment will be installed by
December 1997. The telecommunications component was not included in the original
project because the principal design idea was to build the line with the most basic
technology available in order to minimize the initial outlays. In line with the concept that
improvements on the railway line would be made when justified and funds were
available, this component was added when funds materialized; it did not delay
implementation of the original project. Table 5 compares the actual construction time for
the main components to the estimate given in the SAR.
20.   Environmental Protection. During design and construction of the Ji-Tong line,
attention was paid to environmental protection. Environmental issues were built into the
project design and addressed in the SAR to protect the ecological balance. Y 48 million
funded from the construction budget were spent on a shelter belt along 400 km of railway
track in the semidesert region, which consists of newly planted grass and trees, fences,
sand and stone walls. In addition, three nurseries were also established under the project.
In July 1996, during the first supervision mission dealing with environmental protection,
it became apparent that independent environmental monitoring had not been carried out



- 6 -
during the construction of the Ji-Tong line. At that time, JRLLC agreed to engage the
local Environmental Protection Research Institute or another third party to monitor the
line and prepare a final report on the implementation of environmental measures during
the construction. This report was prepared recently. It outlines measures undertaken to
mitigate environmental concerns on the Ji-Tong line and the success of these measures.
In a separate letter, JRLLC informed the Bank about long-term monitoring measures to
guarantee the sustainability of the implemented environmental protection activities.
21.   Land Acquisition and Resettlement. Chinese land acquisition, resettlement and
compensation procedures have been followed substantially. At the request of the Bank's
senior management, and in response to discussions at the Board, this and other transport
projects in China were reviewed in 1994 to assure the Bank that resettlement activities
were well managed. It was recognized that the documentation for this project, which
started prior to 1992, was less complete than for more recent projects for which a baseline
survey and resettlement plan were prepared by the Borrower and agreed with the Bank as
a basis for supervision and implementation.  The Resettlement Review  Mission
confirmed that compensation for acquisition of grass or dry land, which is plentiful in
Inner Mongolia, was adequate to maintain the standards of living of the affected people.
However, 2,745 mu (183 hectares) of valuable irrigated land had also been acquired and
mistakenly been classified as dry land during the design of the project. Once reclassified,
the compensation rate for this category of land was increased, and living standards were
successfully restored.
22.   The scale of resettlement has been larger than originally envisaged. The amount
of land acquired was 113,617 mu (7,758 hectares), almost double the initial estimate,
while the number of houses acquired and persons relocated increased only marginally
(about 3 percent); 5,176 people were involved. There was an increase in the cost of land
acquisition by 26 percent, and in compensation for houses, relocation and other
resettlement costs by 76 percent. During construction, the alignment of the railway line
crossed existing roads at a few points leading to additional expenditure on these roads.
All additional requirements, combined with the slightly higher cost of compensation than
originally envisaged, increased land acquisition and resettlement costs from Y 30 million
to Y 45 million.
23.   Specifically, the project has: (a) minimized the adverse impact of resettlement by
avoiding populated areas through careful alignment of the railway line on land of
marginal use and placement of all 50 railway stations 1 to 3 km away from existing
settlements; (b) paid compensation for farmland, and ensured provision of replacement
land to project-affected families, with most of the funds invested in social and economic
development schemes for the village community; (c) ensured adequate compensation for
households relocated and improved the quality of homes, by building larger and better
houses than the previous ones; and (d) protected local livelihoods and living standards
and provided a newly established resettlement village with electricity and a primary
school as supplementary rehabilitation measures. In addition, the project has taken
measures to ensure the safety of people and animals and to enable safe crossing. Almost



- 7 -
400tkm of the track is fenced in, where it is exposed to livestock grazing on the
grasslands, to protect both the line and the numerous herds of livestock. IMLRC has also
constructed underpasses for vehicle traffic, villagers and livestock.
24.   The physical and financial aspects of resettlement, except the impact on
individuals and households, have been monitored internally by IMLRC, while the Inner
Mongolia Auditing Bureau supervised financial disbursements. Land acquisition and
compensation were to have been overseen as part of the social impact monitoring by the
University of Inner Mongolia. Although agreed at negotiations, independent monitoring
of the social impact was not carried out during project implementation. The University of
Inner Mongolia was commissioned to carry out an ex-post impact evaluation study, and
no major shortcomings in resettlement rehabilitation were discovered.
25.   Procurement.  Although IMLRC's management had little experience with
international procurement, procurement administration was relatively smooth. Progress
at the beginning was remarkable: only 30 months after implementation had started,
contracts for about 85 percent of the loan/credit amount were signed. The workload with
183 contracts was very heavy for such a small organization. In addition, the procurement
process involving numerous approvals outside IMLRC was cumbersome and time-
consuming. Nevertheless, at the end of 1992, the average time of 160 days between bid
opening and contract signing was much shorter than for any of the four railway projects
with MOR (250 days).
26.   The following examples, however, demonstrate the difficulties IMLRC faced. In
the early years of market reform, some local bidders refused to maintain the bid price.
All argued that prices for raw materials fluctuated too much to enter into fixed price
commitments through national competitive bidding contracts. Cancellation and rebidding
for concrete sleepers, for example, led to a delivery delay of six months. In 1993, it
became clear that contracts totaling $10.3 million would not be signed, or made effective,
by contractors due to steep price increases for the goods on the market since bid opening.
In another case, a domestic bid for jeeps with a price twice the lowest responsive foreign
bid had to be proposed for award of contract by IMLRC because of the Chinese
Government's embargo of "luxury" vehicles. The Bank did not concur with the proposal.
In April 1993, about one year later, IMLRC informed the Bank that the bid was canceled.
A third example is a misleading bid evaluation by the tendering company in Beijing,
which led to an intensive investigation in 1995. The Bank came to the conclusion that the
contract had been awarded despite the fact that the bid was nonresponsive in respect to an
important mandatory requirement. The Bank pointed out to the Borrower that allowing
the supplier to complete delivery in accordance with the contract would be regarded as
misprocurement, while offering to accept rebidding subject to specific conditions. In the
end, the Borrower decided not to purchase the goods and paid compensation of $200,000
to the firm with which it had concluded the contract. Most of the savings realized from
not purchasing these goods were reallocated to a new telecommunications component
(para. 19).

27.   Project and Financing Costs. Initially, the project was supported by a loan of
$70 million and a SDR 58.6 million credit, equivalent to $80 million at the time of Board
presentation. A recalculation of the credit part of the project established the total credit
and loan amount as about $151 million (Table 8c).
28.   At the end of 1994, the remaining loan funds were assessed. Three major changes
had occurred during implementation of the project: (a) due to depreciation of the US
dollar against the SDR, the credit amount expressed in US dollars had increased; (b)
some contracts were not fully delivered; and (c) the amount in US dollars required to pay
contracts expressed in yuan was lower than registered at contract signing because of
exchange rate variations. Following the Borrower's decision not to purchase goods
related to problematic procurement (para. 26), the Bank permitted the use of the $2.8
million loan balance for the purchase of additional digital telecommunication equipment
for 610 km of line to improve safety and quality of operations.
29.   The following table shows a comparison of appraisal estimates and actuals:
Y million                             $ million
Appraisal             %               Appraisal          % Change
Estimate   Actual   Change            Estimate   Actual
Project         1,364.1   2,037.8    +49                335.0    331.2      -1.2
Interest          55.3     104.0    +88                  14.9      13.6     -8.6
Total Investment  1,419.4   2,141.8    +51              349.9    344.8      -1.5
30.   In terms of US dollars, actual total costs were close to the appraisal estimate
despite the increase of the scope of some project items. Without the additional quantities,
total costs would have been about 5 percent lower in dollar terms. In terms of local
currency, however, total costs were 51 percent above appraisal estimates. The difference
between dollar and yuan costs was due to: (a) the devaluation of the yuan over the life of
the project from Y 3.76 per dollar to Y 8.32 per dollar; and (b) the impact of steep
domestic inflation on the cost of materials and additional inputs during the early 1990s.
For example, the one-year delay in beginning construction works pushed back the
implementation period into the higher inflation years.
31.   Financial Performance. The financial analysis of IMLRC (which became a
limited liability company-JRLLC-in July 1995) focuses on the elements likely to
assure a sound financial position for a new company beginning operations. Foreign
exchange risk allocation, scale of investment program, tariff levels, traffic volume, and
operating costs levels are regarded as the factors critically affecting the financial position
of JRLLC, and are explored in the financial analysis. Projected income, balance sheet,
flow of funds statements, and debt service schedules over an eight-year horizon
beginning in 1996 are presented in Annex 1, Tables I to 16. Operations on the Ji-Tong
line began on December 1, 1995. Actual annual financial data are, therefore, only



- 9 -
available for 1996 and first-quarter 1997. For the financial projections for the years 1997
to 2003, operating costs have been based on 1996 and 1997 actuals.
32.   A key issue affecting the short- and long-term financial performance of JRLLC
and their ability to build up a cash reserve to cushion against unexpected events was
where responsibility for the foreign exchange risk on the IBRD/IDA borrowings belongs.
The original intention at appraisal was to require GIM to bear the foreign exchange risk
of the loan and credit because of its significant foreign exchange earnings from the sale of
anthracite and animal products and JRLLC's total lack of foreign exchange earnings. A
Bank investigation in April 1997, however, found no records to indicate that the Bank/
Association rejected the subsidiary loan agreements' allocation of the foreign exchange
risk to IMLRC, even though this contradicted the SAR. The effects of the decision to
place the foreign exchange risk burden on the company are analyzed in the sensitivity
analysis below. The foreign exchange costs are about Y 50 to 60 million per year.
33.   Freight traffic in 1996 surpassed SAR expectations for the first year of full
operation. In 1996, JRLLC handled 5.0 million tons (4.1 million tons were projected in
the SAR) and it expects to transport 6.1 million tons in 1997 (less than the SAR estimate
of 7.2 million tons). Of these amounts, an overwhelming proportion-75 percent-
represents bridge or overhead volume (i.e., traffic that both originates and terminates off-
line). JRLLC's management expects that freight traffic will increase by 11 to 4 percent
per year, which is substantially more conservative than the SAR forecast. The same
applies to passenger traffic, which is now forecast to remain at only a quarter of the
appraisal assumption.
34.   The base case analysis adopts the conservative JRLLC traffic forecast for the
period 1998 to 2003, the same traffic levels as in the economic analysis, a reduced
investment program consistent with the project scope, and, moreover, assumes that
JRLLC will bear the foreign exchange risk on the IBRD/IDA borrowings.  Three
variations explore the sensitivity of JRLLC's financial projections to:  (a) JRLLC
implementing its full-scale investment program, (b) GIM bearing the foreign exchange
costs of its IBRD/IDA borrowings, and (c) a 20 percent increase in working expenses and
JRLLC's ability to mitigate this with tariff increases.
35.   The SAR states that as a new company, JRLLC should start off on a sound
financial footing and monitor closely its current and projected financial performance.
Therefore, a financial covenant was agreed during negotiations, stating that JRLLC will
take all measures necessary, including proposing tariff increases, to cover all operating
costs from revenue and to achieve a debt service coverage ratio of 1.5 within the first
three years of operations.
36.   At negotiations, it was also agreed that the operating ratio, return on assets,
current ratio, debt to capital ratio, debt service coverage ratio and self-financing ratio
would be computed by JRLLC based on an eight-year financial projection, one year
before operations begin in order to establish indicators for monitoring operational



- 10-
performance. Although they were clearly defined in an annex to the negotiation minutes,
JRLLC did not calculate the ratios with the exception of the operating ratio apparently
due to the lack of experience until joint efforts were made during a June 1996 Bank
supervision mission.
37.    Key performance measures in the financial analysis are the debt service coverage
ratio and self-financing ratio, defined in this case as the annual available cash flow and
accumulated resources as a percentage of the three-year average investment program
(averaging the prior, current and following year capital investments). This last ratio is
particularly important because JRLLC has emphasized its desire to use retained earnings
for future investments.

analysis.

39.    Under the base case (Scenario I above), the income statement in 1996 (Annex 1,
Table 1) shows positive net operating revenue, but after payment of interest, JRLLC
posted a negative net surplus. To cover its working capital requirements JRLLC took out
a Y 25 million short-term loan in 1996 (Annex 1, Table 4). If JRLLC significantly
reduces its investment program as shown in the base case, JRLLC's financial
performance after 1997 looks very strong. Not only does JRLLC meet covenanted debt
service requirements after 1997, but it can self-finance all of its investments and build up
a large cash reserve.
40.    The three cases under the sensitivity analysis demonstrate that the company is
sensitive to both changes in its investment program and foreign exchange risk. However,
JRLLC's finances are most sensitive to changes in operating costs. In Scenario II, if
JRLLC implements its full-scale investment program as planned it will still be able to
self-finance the investments, however, this will erode its return on assets to levels which
only cover inflation and it would not be able to remain profitable in the event higher than
expected operating costs or reduced traffic volumes arise. In Scenario III, if GIM were to
bear the foreign exchange costs, JRLLC would be able to self-finance its full investment
program and build up a healthy cash reserve; financial ratios would be even stronger.



- 12-
41.   In Scenario IV, even though JRLLC implements a reduced investment program
(as in the base case), the 20 percent annual increase in working expenses renders JRLLC
unprofitable after 1998 and none of its financial indicators is acceptable. To return to
profitability, JRLLC would either need to: (a) raise tariffs from 8.8 fen per tkm to 12 fen
per tkm gradually over a three-year period commencing in 1999, or, (b) have GIM
assume foreign exchange costs commencing in 1998 and raise tariffs to 10 fen in 1999.
Raising tariff levels, however, would not be an easy solution, and only plausible under
the right conditions. It would be a sensitive marketing problem that depends on the
movement of MOR's pricing policy. Conversely, if higher traffic volumes than JRLLC's
conservative estimates emerge, then the profitability of the company will improve
substantially.
42.   Economic Reevaluation.  Based on the economic reevaluation presented in
Annex 2, the project's estimated net present value (NPV) amounts to nearly Y 4.6 billion
in 1994 prices and the EIRR is 19.0 percent. This rate of return, somewhat higher than
the SAR figure of 17.9 percent, is satisfactory.
43.   The major reason for the increase in the EIRR relates to the adjusted mix of
freight traffic handled over the project line. In the SAR, benefits were calculated on the
assumption that by the second year of operation, about half of the railway's freight traffic
(3.9 million tons out of a total of 7.2 million tons) would be comprised of coal-
primarily mined in the Dongsheng fields and transported to consumers in Jilin province.
Estimates compiled by JRLLC, however, indicate that coal volume is likely to account
for only 2. 2 million tons in 1997-just over a third of total freight traffic. On the other
hand, noncoal tonnage is expected to be much higher than anticipated in the SAR: in its
second year of operation, JRLLC expects to haul over 3.1 million tons of noncoal through
traffic, nearly half again as much as the comparable SAR figure. Compared to coal, most
noncoal commodities (grain, chemicals, etc.)-even allowing for a higher complementary
development cost-have a higher net value added benefit than coal. Accordingly, the
shift in the traffic mix is the major factor contributing to the improved EIRR reported
here.
D. PROJECT SUSTAINABILITY
44.   From  an economic perspective, sustainability is assessed in terms of the
sensitivity of the project's EIRR to changes in benefit and cost assumptions. Since the
volume, mix, and value of projected freight traffic demand are the primary factors
influencing the EIRR calculation, these factors are the focus of the sensitivity analyses.
45.   In accordance with the JRLLC's own traffic forecast, the EIRR is predicated on
freight tonnage increasing at various annual rates: 1998-2000, 10.0 percent; 2001, 8.0
percent, 2002, 5.0 percent, and 2003, 4 percent. No growth in the later years of the
forecast time frame is assumed.' Reducing the freight traffic growth rate by a third
Though a comparatively minor element, the estimate for passenger travel (also taken from JRLLC's own
projections) increases at 40,000-50,000 persons per year from 1998-2003 and is constant thereafter.



- 13 -
lowered the estimated EIRR by less than one percentage point, to 18.8 percent.
Consequently, diminishing the volume of freight traffic has a relatively modest impact on
project sustainability from an economic point of view.
46.   Apart from the overall total amount of freight, the EIRR also is a function of the
proportional mix of coal and noncoal traffic. As noted above, the value-added benefits
(as well as the related complementary development costs) for noncoal products are higher
than those for coal. To be conservative, however, the base case forecast here postulates
that beginning in 1998 the lower valued coal will have equal prominence with noncoal
traffic with each accounting for 37.5 percent of total JRLLC freight tonnage (the
remaining 25 percent being associated with local traffic). In the sensitivity test, this mix
is altered such that the coal share rises to 50 percent and the noncoal proportion declines
to 25 percent. This shift in the traffic mix has the effect of lowering the EIRR by just
under one percentage point, to 18.7 percent.
47.   The value added for both coal and noncoal products is a function of the border
price of coal. A decline in this international price would reduce the value added margin
(without any countervailing cost savings in domestic production and distribution). The
base case estimate utilizes the average coal border price for 1994. Although this price has
risen substantially (in 1995, an increase of 7.4 percent was recorded), a third sensitivity
test nonetheless postulates a 10 percent reduction in this figure from its 1994 level.
Under these conditions, the EIRR falls to 16.0 percent.
48.   To test the sensitivity of the project to revised complementary cost assumptions,
the development outlays associated with both coal and noncoal traffic were increased by
20 percent, respectively. In this instance, the EIRR falls to 17.3 percent.
49.   Since all of these alternative EIRR outcomes are acceptable, the project should be
judged as satisfactory from the standpoint of economic sustainability.
50.   With respect to JRLLC's financial viability, the approved tariff level will enable
JRLLC to maintain its financial health if traffic on the railway line develops as expected
and operating costs increase as projected. The operating ratios will be acceptable from
1997 onwards. The debt service coverage ratio minimum is attained after 1997 and
remains acceptable thereafter. JRLLC is able to fully self-finance its investment program
under most circumstances. No additional short-term or long-term loans would be
required to support JRLLC's operations. JRLLC's financial sustainability could be
further improved by (a) limiting its investment program to priority investments only,
(b) raising tariffs, as feasible, or, (c) convincing GIM to take over the foreign exchange
risks on debt service.
51.   There is considerable uncertainty regarding the level of operating costs five years
away, given that many prices which are presently controlled may be permitted to rise.
However, in the future, fixed operating costs (which account for more than 50 percent of
operating costs) will only increase according to inflation, while variable costs will
increase both due to inflation and as traffic increases. Therefore, it is expected that



- 14-
average unit costs for the line will decrease over time as traffic volumes increase. Hence,
the line should be able to maintain a sustainable financial status as long as tariffs keep
pace with inflation and unit costs of inputs do not increase significantly faster than
inflation. If the current tariffs prove to be too low, JRLLC has the option of raising
freight tariffs. The degree to which it could raise its tariffs depends on the combined
effect of (a) its shorter transportation distance (vis-a-vis MOR routes), (b) the prevailing
all-in tariff on the MOR routes, and (c) MOR's strategic will to continue to send through
traffic to the Ji-Tong line at a higher tariff level.  Based purely on economic
considerations, JRLLC should be able to raise its tariffs to at least the existing levels on
the longer MOR routes. Passenger tariffs should not become a problem because
passenger traffic is estimated conservatively and contributes only marginally to JRLLC's
financial results, and almost all passenger traffic starts and ends on the Ji-Tong railway.
In addition, given the potential for trade between Inner Mongolia and the northeast, it
appears that JRLLC, if it can improve some of its intemal line capacity constraints, has
conservatively estimated its traffic expansion and higher traffic volumes will likely
develop. There is, therefore, every reason to assume that JRLLC will remain financially
viable during the projection period.
E. BANK PERFORMANCE
52.   The project was consistent with the Government's objective, which was to
develop local railways and to promote regional economic development. In general,
identification of the component, preparation and appraisal of the project were satisfactory.
As was consistent with the practice in the 1980s, no project performance indicators were
developed.
53.   The project's most important objective was to provide a transportation bridge for
the shipment of goods between western Inner Mongolia and northeastern China. At
appraisal, coal was expected to be the main commodity carried by the new (bridge-) line.
The objective was achieved, however, more due to the ability of MOR to deliver coal to
the Ji-Tong line than with the development of the mines themselves. The significance of
coal did not turn out as great as anticipated. Goods actually transported are more noncoal
than coal.
54.   At appraisal, the development of the Dongsheng coal fields was viewed as
instrumental in achieving the second project objective, to promote regional development.
The volume of text in the SAR devoted to regional development by far outweighs the
significance of benefits attributed to the matter. As it turned out, the ability of the line to
operate does not depend on the coal market scenario.
55.   Training of staff could have been prepared in greater detail. Although well
defined in terms of persons, and time, the SAR did not elaborate sufficiently on the
choice and content of the various kinds of training. Training costs turned out to be
unrealistic, which raises the question of the adequacy of the Bank's appraisal. In
addition, more attention should have been given to the final version of the SAR to ensure



- 15 -
that the published set of numbers both in the statistical tables and in the text were
internally consistent.
56.   A key issue affecting the short- and long-term financial performance of JRLLC
was addressed as late as the ICR completion mission (para. 29). Although the SAR (para.
4.19) and the Memorandum of the President (MOP) of the same date, in para. 10, clearly
state: "GIM will further onlend the loan and credit to IMLRC under the same terms and
conditions, with two exceptions: first the foreign exchange risk will remain with GIM;
and ...." (the wording is quoted from the MOP, the italics were added), it is surprising to
note that there is nothing on file to indicate why the Bank agreed to a substantial policy
change when accepting the onlending agreement required for the loan and credit
effectiveness. In that agreement, IMLRC bore the foreign exchange risk. Furthermore,
the important Relending Loan Agreement between GIM and IMLRC dated November 22,
1989, can nowhere be found in Bank files except in the Legal Department's collection of
documents. For this and the reasons given in paras. 55 and 57, supervision is rated
deficient in Table 1, Summary of Assessment.
57.   Although the project was adequately supervised through short, standard missions,
Bank involvement was not always adequate during implementation.  The Bank's
supervision should also have focused on environmental protection and the adequate
development of JRLLC's financial skills at a far earlier stage of project implementation,
not at a time close to project completion.  Even though at the time of project
effectiveness, resettlement did not play the role it does now, it would have been of great
advantage if social impact monitors had been appointed and trained in the methodology
of social analysis and impact monitoring, at an early stage. In addition, resettlement
action should have been preceded by a socioeconomic baseline study against which social
impacts could have been measured.
F. BORROWER PERFORMANCE
58.   IMLRC's administrative performance was generally very good. The civil works
were carried out according to current MOR standards and are of good quality. There
were only a few problems during project implementation, although the newly created
organization had little institutional experience with Bank project appraisal and
procurement. An issue was caused by a misleading bid evaluation that led to an intensive
investigation in the Bank. In the end, the Borrower decided not to purchase the goods
and paid compensation of $200,000 to the firm with which it had concluded the contract.
Although environmental protection measures had been taken during the line construction,
a monitoring program to measure their long-term sustainability should have been
developed much earlier, not at the end of the of construction works. Also, the scale of
resettlement has been larger than originally envisaged. The amount of land acquired was
almost double the initial estimate, while the number of houses acquired and persons
relocated increased only marginally.
59.   Implementation reporting was regular until the project's completion.  Some
deficiencies were offset by extensive information provided during supervision missions.



- 16-
60.   JRLLC was outstandingly cooperative and helped prepare information for this
ICR. The company provided a great amount of data to complement those available in the
Bank's project file, which produced a more comprehensive picture of project
implementation.
61.   The credit agreement provided that the Borrower would cause MOR to provide
adequate investments to upgrade the railway line connecting with the Ji-Tong line. This
covenant was not complied with insofar as MOR has no formal plans to provide
investments to upgrade two lines perceived at appraisal to become bottlenecks. The
national railways, however, have incurred congestion problems at locations west and east
of the Ji-Tong line. Between Baotou and Benhong (the western JRLLC-national railways
interchange point), the Hohhot Administration has experienced a shortage of both diesel
locomotives and freight wagons for loading coal. At the same time, there have been
severe congestion problems at the eastern JRLLC-national railways interchange point.
Here, the Tongliao South marshaling yard, which handles both JRLLC business as well
as traffic for the national railways has proven to be inadequate.  The shortage of
locomotives and freight wagons was resolved during 1996, while extending the
marshaling yard is still under way.
G. ASSESSMENT OF OUTCOME
62.   Project implementation is rated as satisfactory. The project had three particular
objectives. Of these, by far the most important was the aim of providing a transportation
bridge for the shipment of goods between western Inner Mongolia and northeastern
China. The construction of the 945 km single-track line successfully met this objective.
63.   The project also focused on promoting regional development. In this context, the
staff appraisal report anticipated benefits in the form of stimulating local industry and
animal husbandry production along the Ji-Tong line and from an impact on an hinterland
area. While an assessment of the likelihood of achieving these original development
objectives recognized that the coal supply and demand patterns postulated in the SAR
have not been realized, the economic benefits associated with regional development were
comparatively modest. However, recruitment of staff for JRLLC reportedly has played a
significant role in alleviating unemployment along the new railway line, and the
increased income of local people. Nevertheless, the second project objective has been
only partially met.
64.   A third project objective was institutional in nature. It was achieved with the
creation of the Inner Mongolia Ji-Tong Railway Limited Liability Company.
Technically, JRLLC appears to be well managed. However, its management autonomy is
limited by its unique circumstances-MOR is not only a majority stakeholder in JRLLC,
but it is also JRLLC's single largest customer (in that MOR decides how much traffic to
divert to JRLLC). Therefore, JRLLC's ability to independently raise tariffs, hire staff and
finance its own capital investments may be limited since it affects MOR in two
competing aspects.



- 17-
65.   The EIRR for the project's physical investments is 19.0 percent compared to 17.9
percent estimated at appraisal. One year after project completion, the railway company's
financial condition was satisfactory and better than expected at appraisal. It can be
expected that the applied tariff level will enable JRLLC to maintain its financial health if
traffic on the railway develops as expected or better and operating costs increase as
projected. However, JRLLC's assumption of the foreign exchange risk on IBRD/IDA
borrowings will limit its capacity to build up a cash reserve to cushion unexpected
increases in operating costs or drops in traffic volumes. With regard to environmental
concerns on the Ji-Tong line, JRLLC has developed long-term monitoring measures to
guarantee the sustainability of the implemented environmental protection activities. In
sum, the project's outcome is rated as satisfactory, its institutional development as
substantial and its sustainability as likely.
H. FUTURE OPERATION
66.   At the end of JRLLC's first year of operation, the company developed a business
plan 1997, which established operational and financial targets based on a conservative
forecast for freight and passenger traffic. This type of short-term planning was adopted
from MOR's practice. JRLLC also prepared a detailed investment program for the period
1996-2003 (Annex 1, para. 10) that encompasses capacity expansion as well as safety and
other investments. The long-term financial analysis prepared for this ICR will allow
JRLLC's management to take corrective measures and to improve future annual business
plans. Intensive training in financial analysis, based on generally accepted accounting
principles, would further enhance JRLLC's capability to review investment options and
its financial sustainability. JRLLC should also invest in computers for its own financial
operations. In addition, JRLLC should prepare a long-term operational plan so as to
determine other investments that may be needed. JRLLC should also consider technical
assistance in institutional building, which should in part clarify the roles and
responsibilities of JRLLC's management versus its owners, which appears still
thoroughly entwined (para. 62).
I. KEY LESSONS LEARNED
67.   This project, which was different from the four earlier ones, was quite simple and
helped fund a specific investment.  Problems arose during implementation with
procurement, which were mainly related to inexperience in the early years of market
reform in China. The main lessons learned were as follows:
(a)   The SAR properly recognized that the volume of traffic which JRLLC
actually handles would be critical to its economic success and commercial
viability. Thus, the SAR placed great emphasis on the rate of traffic
growth relative to the engineering line capacity of the route (see SAR,
page 11, para. 4.9 and Annex 6, page 43, para. 2), and the need to
eliminate operating bottlenecks at off-line locations east of the route (see
SAR, page 17, paras. 4.30-4.33 and page 29, para. 7.4). It was also
designed to ensure that certain Dongsheng coal mines, whose output was



- 18 -
to be dedicated to the line, could be brought into production on a timely
basis (see SAR, pages 16-17, paras. 4.27-4.29 and page 28, para. 7.1).
Vital as all of these physical elements are to the success of the JRLLC, it
is important to acknowledge that, as a bridge railway, the fortunes of the
company are greatly dependent on its commercial relationship with the
national railway system. Specifically, this means that JRLLC needs to be
able to interchange enough traffic with the national railway in such
volumes and at appropriate price levels that will permit it to operate on a
basis that is both compensatory and competitive. In considering future
railways projects-especially those where substantial traffic exchanges are
involved-the Bank should devote particular attention to the commercial
aspects of these intrarailway relationships.
(b)   A second lesson stems from the first.  Perhaps the greatest potential
benefit of this project relates to the competition which JRLLC can foster
vis-a-vis the national railway, as both adopt more market-oriented pricing
environments.   As a low-cost, local railway, JRLLC  already has
demonstrated that it can attract some traffic from the parallel routes of the
national railways by virtue of its lower freight tariff.  When greater
flexibility is introduced into the railway regulatory regime, individual
carriers will seek to maximize their competitive advantage by operating in
a more cost-effective manner which, in turn, will stimulate more market-
responsive pricing of railway services. This competitive interplay not only
yields lower tariffs to shippers but enhanced economic benefits to the
society as a whole. Accordingly, in evaluating future railway investment
projects, the Bank should recognize the potential competitive dynamics
that such investments can promote.
(c)    The original intention at appraisal was to require the Government of Inner
Mongolia to bear the foreign exchange risk of the loan and credit. The
implementation agency's assumption of this risk instead will have a
negative effect on its ability to build up a cash reserve and protect against
unexpected increases in operating costs or reduced traffic volumes. The
change in onlending terms should have come to light before ICR
preparation. This suggests that supervision of projects should include a
thorough review of compliance with financing arrangements. In addition,
the financial performance of a project entity at the detail of the financial
analysis as given in the SAR, should be reestimated at about mid-term of
the implementation period.

in itself is correct. The components do not add up to the total. The origin of GIM's
contribution of Y 449.6 million cannot be traced from other calculations; using the SAR
exchange rate of Y 3.712 to $1 as was done with the other components; the $102.1 million
amount should be equivalent to Y 379.0 million. It should also be noted that the Yuan
investment costs given in SAR Table 4.1 mainly but not always relate to their $ equivalent at
an exchange rate of Y 3.80 to $1 instead of Y 3.712; the interest during construction,
however, uses the Y 3.712 exchange rate.

APPENDIX A: ICR COMPLETION MISSION'S AIDE-
MEMOIRE
April 2, 1997
A World Bank mission comprising Mr. U. Marggraf and Mrs. D. Vermilya visited
the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region of China as a postcompletion mission for the
Inner Mongolia Local Railway Project to seek from management of the Ji-Tong Railway
Limited Liability Company (JRLLC) updated information on traffic and financial data for
the years 1996 to 2003. The mission also discussed the completeness and accuracy of the
draft Implementation Completion Report ICR for the Inner Mongolia Local Railway
Project. Mr. Chen Juemin from the Resident Mission in China (RMC) provided
substantial assistance to both the mission and JRLLC. This aide-memoire records major
points of discussion and understanding reached. The mission wishes to express its thanks
to JRLLC for its excellent cooperation, detailed information provided, and the courtesies
extended.
The mission discussed with JRLLC their updated traffic and corporate financial
and traffic projections from 1996 to 2003 containing the 1996 actuals sent to the Bank on
March 11, 1997. During the review, the mission noted that the debt servicing schedule as
forecasted by JRLLC was much higher than that calculated by the mission based on the
debt repayment terms stated in the onlending agreement between MOF and the
Government of Inner Mongolia (GIM). In addition, it became apparent that JRLLC was
making its debt payments to GIM in yuan using the current Yuan/$ exchange rate
(Y 8.31$1.0). The mission pointed out that the company should not bear the foreign
exchange risk as it was projecting based on its interpretation of the onlending agreement
between MOF and GIM. Therefore, the mission revised the financial projections using
the exchange rates applicable at the time of appraisal (Y 3.712/$1.0 and SDR 1.0/$1.36)
as shown in the SAR, and further made changes to bring the projections in line with
international accounting standards. JRLLC stated that the debt service assumptions
should be made based on relevant domestic regulations. A set of tables reflecting the
above has been provided to JRLLC.  The mission will recommend that Bank
management engage MOF to investigate the foreign exchange risk issue.
The mission reminded JRLLC that an audit of its 1996 railway operations would
be due at World Bank headquarters by June 30, 1997. The mission recommends that the
accounts be audited by an internationally recognized auditing firm in order to assist the
company to upgrade its accounts to international standards.
JRLLC agreed that it will update its Report on Completion of Ji'ning-Tongliao
Railway Project in Inner Mongolia-the Borrower's contribution to the ICR, which was

APPENDIX B: BORROWER'S CONTRIBUTION TO THE ICR
REPORT ON COMPLETION OF JI'NING-TONGLIAO RAILWAY PROJECT IN INNER
MONGOLIA
1. PROJECT OBJECTIVES
1.1   Project objectives have been reached.  And generally objectives of Inner
Mongolia autonomous government to develop economy for the regions along the line
have been coordinated.
The project aims at linking the economy of east part and west part of Inner Mongolia,
developing economy of the regions along the line, transporting coal from east to west,
and connecting railway networks of the Northeast and the Northwest.  After its
completion, its initial (in the first five years) traffic would reach 7 million tonnes, and
long-range traffic 17 million tonnes.
After preliminary acceptance test the project began to achieve revenue service on
December 1, 1995. Under the ardent support of the ministry of railways (MOR), in 1996
the line carried 5.04 million tonnes of freight traffic. The first year of operation achieved
72% of the initial traffic volume of 7 million tonnes, which was fascinating in the
transportation history of Chinese railways.
By the end of 1996 and with one year's operation, the project objectives for Ji-Tong Line
was preliminarily met. In 1996's traffic carried, 1.52 million tonnes of traffic came to
coal, which was one third of the total traffic. This was a good beginning, although east
bound coal volume was not the majority of the total traffic because restrictions from the
national railways had to be solved gradually. It was estimated that by the first half of
1997 the east bound coal traffic would rise significantly and meet its expected amount.
By the way, 1995 saw the annual output of 16.4 million tonnes in Dongsheng coal mine,
which could ensure sufficient supply for the initial objective of transporting 5 million
tonnes of coal on Ji'ning-Tongliao line. And goods handled along the line amounted to
1.151 million tonnes, which was 22.8% of the total volume and in a certain degree
stimulated the local economy. With the railway putting into operation, the line would
play greater role in the region.
1.2   Generally, economy along the line developed at the same time as the line was put
into operation. In order to develop local economy along Ji'ning--Tongliao line, at the
beginning of 1993, headed by planning committee, Inner Mongolia autonomous
government set out to investigate and plan for how to carry out local economic work, and
held discussion meetings and seminars twice in 1995 and 1996. As the line opened to



- 32 -                      Appendix B
traffic, development of local economy has begun. Following a report, the development
mainly covers:
a.    At the time as the line being constructed, those local businesses beyond
the freight line constructed 10 sidings by means of self-construction and self-use.
In 1996, considerable part of traffic input and output along the line was handled
on these sidings;
b.    Ulan cement plant, 30 km north of Benhong station which is the west
terminal of Ji'ning--Tongliao line, has design capacity of 700,000 tonnes of high
level cement. All enabling work was completed by the end of 1995 and
construction started in the spring of 1996. It was expected to put into service by
the end of 1997. The main part of its products will be transported to the central
and east part of Inner Mongolia, with a small portion left for the west part itself,
c.    Huanggangliang tin iron mine, over 50 km northeast of Yuzhoudi station,
has proved reserve of 100 million tonnes. The ministry of metallurgy has
planned to exploit iron ore for year, which has not been realized due to lack of
railway transportation. After the railway was constructed, the first phase project
of the mine was put into operation in August, 1996, turning out 200,000 tonnes of
iron ore and 100,000 tonnes of fined ore annually. The second phase, increasing
output of 200,000 tonnes of iron ore and 100,000 tonnes of fined ore, is now
under construction and will be put into operation by the end of 1997 or at the
beginning of 1998;
d.    Ke'erqin oil field is now constructing crude oil handling siding at Sharinai
station, and large quantity of crude oil will be shipped out;
e.    Proposed Daban power plant (first phase output of 1.2 million kW using
West Mongolia coal, then the planned 2.4 million kW) has been reported to the
State by Liaoning and Inner Mongolia, to be listed in the "ninth-five-year plan";
f.    Linxi copper mine and Balinzuoqi lead-zinc mine are now being expanded
in large scale, and nonferrous metal base has entered the enabling stage in full
swing; and
g.    Farming and animal husbandry product manufacturing and reserve
exploitation in Qixian and other townships along the line, have developed into a
new stage as the railway line being put into operation.
1.3   Proper project investment. The project construction was based closely on the
principle that "concentrating on the core to ensure the completion of priorities" and the
requirements of the national economic structure reform. Adopt open tendering for project
engineering and material and equipment procurement and select suitable construction
companies and suppliers through strict evaluation. Construct the line in conformity with
design to ensure quality and guarantee the operation safety of facilities, and in principle



- 33 -                         Appendix B
do not handle affairs of social function. Guarantee in all out the investment for material
and equipment and minimize expenses.   And squeeze the timetable to  shorten
construction duration as much as possible. Generally speaking, the project had less
investment, early output and maximum profit.

Note: 1. In original budget estimate, signaling equipment would use old arm signals replaced
from the national railways; however, in construction, brand new arm signals are
generally used.
2. The building expenses, totaling RMB 148.87 million, consist of survey and design
expense RMB 24.24 million, administrative fee RMB 29.50 million of the owner,
integration testing fee RMB 48.16 million, RMB 36.85 million for greening and desert
control, RMB 10.12 million for insurance, disaster response and supplementary projects,
as well as the payment for building contractors.
3. Other expenses consist of interest commitment of the World Bank loan RMB 180,730,
interest of domestic loan RMB 1,760,000 and adjustment tax of domestic investment
RMB 400,000. They are not included in the original budget estimate proposed to the
World Bank, which had been thought to be covered by Inner Mongolia finance, and not
changed until in 1993 in the reviewed estimate they were paid by investment means.
1.4.   In  1989, the budget estimate proposed  to the World Bank amounted  to
RMB 1,232.74 million covered by the World Bank loan, a equivalent of RMB 557.00
million and domestic investment of RMB 676.00 million. Twice adjustments have been
made due to domestic inflation and variation of exchange rate, therefore the final estimate
amounts to RMB 2,120.35 million, composed of the World Bank loan, a equivalent of
RMB 894.03 million and domestic investment of RMB 1,226.32 million. The reviewed
estimate was added RMB 887.61 million over the original one, up 72%, in which the
World Bank loan increased a equivalent of RMB 337.03 million due to change of
exchange rate, up 60.5%, and domestic fund increased RMB 550.32 million, up 81.4%.



- 34 -                     Appendix B
The increase involved these incomparable factors, i.e. other expenses of RMB 182.89
million which was not included in the original estimate, but actually used; newly added
projects valuing RMB 58.70 million; and integration testing of RMB 48.16 million. The
updated estimate increased only RMB 597.86 million over the original one after allowing
for the above three factors, up 48.5%, which was far lower than the domestic inflation
index in the construction period, and moreover lower than the increase rate of the
reviewed estimate of other railways at the same period.
1.5.  Now compare the final estimate with the original one, taking 48.5% as the
average increase rate. It shows that the increase rate of investment on materials and
equipment exceeds the average rate. The expenses of land acquisition and resettlement
involve lots of changing factors, but its increase rate was lower than the average. And
many measures were taken to reduce building expenses, such as:
a.   transportation of building materials from  unloading station to the
construction site by means of self-organized trucks reduced transportation fee,
related management fee and indirect expenses;
b.    In the twice estimate adjustments, building expenses were not changed
generally, especially such two items as other engineering expenses (compensation
for winter construction, compensation for construction at windy and dusty area,
compensation for construction in rain season and expenses for construction site
formation) and temporary engineering fee, included in indirect expenses, so that
original estimate was RMB 95.23 million and actually only RMB 62.19 million
was appreciated to the construction contractors, reducing RMB 33.05 million; and
C.    Except items procured through tendering, other materials and equipment
were purchased through internal channels to cut management fee and indirect fee
of construction contractors.
The increase rate of building expense is 25.03% only, much lower than the average rate,
and only up 17.03% after allowing for the integration testing fee of RMB 48.16 million
excluded in the original estimate.
1.6.  In construction of the domestic railways, including Bao-shen line and Da-zhun
line in Inner Mongolia, expense of land resumption reach more or less 10% of the total
investment of railway construction, and in some cases they are so high that it closes to
20%. However, thanks to the great support from every level of government in Inner
Mongolia and local people along the line, the expense of land resumption of Ji'ning-
Tongliao line amounts to 2.12% of the total investment, which was unique in the country.
1.7.  The investment on Ji'ning-Tongliao line was small, due to holding on the
principle of construction of Ji'ning-Tongliao line, implementing the philosophy of the
State economic reform and controlling strictly the increase of expenses. As for the
increase on investment, availability of materials and equipment expenses were secured,
building fee was confined and thanks to the support of local government and the public



- 35 -                    Appendix B
the expenses of land resumption was minimized. In a word, the investment on Ji'ning-
Tongliao railway project was very rational.
2. ACHIEVEMENT OF OBJECTIVES
It is always the objectives of construction and operation to serve for and promote
economy development.
2.1.  After Ji'ning-Tongliao line achieved revenue service, its primary goal has been to
provide rapid, safe and low-fare transportation service for passenger and freight traffic.
On the line are mainly running through trains with little classification operation. Without
much delay in marshaling yard, the traffic between Northeast and Northwest can travel in
shorter time than on other lines.
Safety is vital to railway operation. The company set "safe production" as the priority of
all work to secure the railway operation.
In terms of reasonable pricing for the objective of providing low cost transportation, after
many discussions the company determined that not only self economic benefit but the
shippers' economy should be considered to help to participate in the competition under
the market economy. With this principle, the fare system of the line was determined after
approval of the company's report.  The fare is set not according to category of
commodities, and the base price per tkm is RMB 0.10 and can be fluctuated 20%. At
present lower fare is executed, that is, the through traffic per tkm is charged RMB 0.08,
and the self-operated traffic per tkm RMB 0.10. Taking coal as an example, under
current pricing system, traveling by the original route specified by the national railways
from Ji'ning, via Shacheng, Fengtai, Shuangqiao, Longhua, Chifeng, to Tongliao,
totaling 1,344 km, the goods will be charged RMB 91.56, whereas by Ji'ning-Tongliao
line from Ji'ning, via Benhong and Tongbei, to Tongliao, totaling 994 km, RMB 85.70
will be charged, shortening 350 km in distance and reducing RMB 5.86 in tariff.
Shenyang is the dividing point in the second traffic diversion which was implemented in
June. Calculation on this basis shows that by the original route of the national railways
from Ji'ning, via Fengtai and Shanhaiguan to Shenyang, totaling 1,313 km, the charge is
RMB 90.66; while by Ji'ning-Tongliao line from Ji'ning, via Benhong and Tongliao, to
Shenyang, totaling 1,3 10 km, the charge is RMB 100.40, 3 km in distance shortened with
charge up RMB 9.74. From the above comparison, by route of Ji'ning-Tongliao to Jilin,
Heilongjiang and east of Inner Mongolia, both the trip and the fare are cut, and to south
or east of Shenyang, the fare rises a bit. Compared with other lines, by Ji'ning-Tongliao
line, the through traffic per tkm amounts costs RMB 0.08, much lower than such national
lines as Datong-Qinhuangdao, RMB 0.108 and Tong-Huo, RMB 0.109, Bao-Shen of
Shenhua company, RMB 0.12 and Da-Zhun of Zhunger coal mine, RMB 0.10, and even
more lower than local railway fares ranging from RMB 0.12 to RMB 0.16.



- 36 -                     Appendix B
2.2.  A spur to local economic boom.
Around this objective, the company has finished a large quantity of work from the
beginning of railway construction. In construction tendering, the bidding companies
were made clear that except the ends of bridge, subgrade earthwork, culverts and
residential buildings would be constructed at the offered price by local labors organized
by local authorities, in a certain degree, from which Qixian can benefit. Railway
operation staff are composed of some backbones transferred from the national railways, a
number of new workers recruited from the local county--Qixian, and logistic
administrative staff transferred from sectors outside railway, taking positions after
training. The recruitment has played a significant role in solving unemployment problem
of Qixian and increased incomes of local people. After the line achieved revenue service,
annually over a thousand seasonal workers are needed mainly for track maintenance and
employed in situ. At the same time of track construction, it was approved to connect ten
enterprise sidings with the line to spur local economic development, which has never
happened in other railway lines. From the beginning of its operation, the railway
company set out to transport local coal to the east by means of company-owned cars,
which stimulates the exploitation of coal in the west as well as supplies low price coal to
local people. In a certain degree, the line promotes the economic development of Inner
Mongolia region.
Cordial service and reasonable fare must bring development of local economy, especially
farming and animal husbandry product manufacturing and reserve exploitation.
a.    A self analysis report from Balinzuoqi Aluminum-zinc mine shows that its
annual output of fined ore is 75,000 tonnes, annual reduction on transport and
defect expenses is more than RMB 9 million when transported by way of Ji'ning-
Tongliao line replacing the original means of being transported by truck to
Chifeng then interchanged by trains;
b.    As for commercial coal supplied for local people (lump coal of Datong),
before the open of Ji'ning-Tongliao line, the coal price is RMB 370 per tonne;
after its open, RMB 220-240 per tonne, down RMB 140 per tonne. If consuming
100,000 tonnes annually, RMB 14 million will be saved in purchasing coal;
c.   In the 1970s and 80s, metallurgical departments had planned to exploit
Huanggangliang tin-iron mine, it was not achieved until the railway was open;
and
d.    Ferrous and non-ferrous reserves along the line will be exploited in large
scale and then transported outside, and the farming and animal husbandry product
manufacturing will be developed to a new stage with the open of the railway.
In a word, gradually the objective to spur the local economic development will be
realized.



- 37 -                     Appendix B
2.3.  During the enabling and construction period for Ji'ning-Tongliao line, board of
directors was organized by Inner Mongolia autonomous government and MOR, under
which Inner Mongolia local railway corporation was established, facilitated by offices
responsible respectively for administrative affairs, planning, financing, construction
technology, material supply, construction supervision and personnel, and three steering
committees, which has taken fully responsibility to project enabling activities and
construction. When the railway was near completion, in order to meet the requirements
of revenue service and the "corporation act" issued by the State, after negotiation between
MOR and Inner Mongolia government, in May, 1995 Inner Mongolia railway liability
company limited and its board of directors were established. And in July, 1995 the
company, in charge of railway operation, was formally open, overtaking all staff and
assets of the original Inner Mongolia local railway corporation to prepare for open to
traffic. The company set up offices for administration, permanent way, locomotive,
rolling stock, signaling & communication, transportation, planning, financing,
construction technology & supervision, personnel & labor wages, chief engineer and
safety inspection, material supply, and sales subsidiary and logistic & hygiene subsidiary.
At the same time, on the line two agencies were established at Baqi and Daban as well as
12 specialized technical depots. Over 1,200 staff were transferred from the national
railway and over 500 from the local sectors, more than 4,000 personnel were recruited
and have taken their position after training, and over 500 national railway personnel were
employed. Altogether there are more than 6,200 personnel.
A self contained economic entity has been established, independent in management,
assuming sole responsibility for profit or loss, self constrained and self developing. Its
operation is under uniform control of MOR for transportation linkage. Agreements
signed with other railway administrations and sub-administrations are used to handle
expenses settlement. And it is capable of undertaking designed initial traffic. In 1996,
traffic carried had amounted to 5.04 million tonnes.

3.3.    During  railway  construction, under the  firm   leadership  of the  company, each
project was  basically  completed  on  time  and  quality  was  guaranteed, and  railway
construction was accomplished on schedule. With the leadership and vigorous support of



- 40 -                    Appendix B
Inner Mongolia government and MOR, the company carried out work in accordance with
policy decisions made by board of directors. At the beginning of construction, leadership
to construction technology division and to construction supervision division was
strengthened, chief engineer and assistant chief engineer were provided, and help from
national railways and different local departments was asked to provide engineering
technical people specialized in lines, bridges & tunnels, tracks, signaling &
communication, water supply, civil engineering and so on. These technical people were
transferred here from their original posts if they can be, or were engaged or invited for a
period of time if vice versa to enhance engineering technical capability and to guarantee
engineering technical quality and charge on inspection. At the same time, 3 construction
command offices were established along the line. Each command office was then divided
into several engineering supervision groups, for example, 5 engineering supervision
groups were set up respectively under command offices for east and west sections, and as
for command office for middle section, because of complicated line situation,
concentration of most high bridges and all tunnels in this section and short distance of
administration (150 km of railway and 120 km of highway), 12 supervision engineers
were mustered in the command office for uniform actions under the leadership of
supervision section. The main tasks of command offices were to proceed engineering
supervision, and at the same time to coordinate the relationship between local
government and construction companies and to help solve problems of construction
companies in daily life. In order to facilitate work, command offices and supervision
groups were all equipped with transport tools such as automobiles which played a
remarkable role to guarantee construction time and engineering technical quality. The
Company also carried out two major inspections of engineering quality every year to
ensure engineering quality.

3.5.   Six international invitations for bids were carried out from  March, 1991 to
October, 1996, with procurement cost of USD 121.623 million, and four domestic
invitations for bids were carried out, with procurement cost of USD 19.663 million.
Direct procurement cost was USD 9 million.
3.6.   Tracks were laid in east and west sections in parallel in August of 1991, with total
length of 403 km. Since the concrete sleeper factory which was awarded with the contract
failed to supply products in time (actually not able to manufacture), with approval of
World Bank, a domestic limited competent invitation for bids was carried out, and in
consequence, 523,071 sleepers were procured with procurement cost of USD 4.666
million, and track laying plan of that year were realized.
3.7.   According to procurement plan, procurement should be completed by  1995.
World Bank had approved the awarded bidder for 150T cranes in the fifth bid, and
duplicate of the contract had been submitted to World Bank; however, 4 months later,
after supplier had completed manufacturing and delivered the products to the port of
embarkation, the World Bank brought forth objections and disapproved the awarded



- 42 -                      Appendix B
bidder as supplier; therefore, (1) our company had to be responsible for a large amount of
work for termination of the contract and a big economic loss for compensation of USD
200,000; and (2) procurement time was prolonged by one year with the result that our
company had to spend more manpower and material resource.
3.8.  Actual status of procurement was quite different from assessment on the whole.
The reason was World Bank assessed the price of rails for construction at international
price of USD 450/t of that time, but during actual bidding, domestic bidder bade and won
the bid at domestic price of USD 300/t, and as a result, procurement cost of rails was
saved greatly (Assessed cost was USD 48 million, but actual cost was only USD 32.82
million, and almost USD 16 million was saved). Therefore, the World Bank agreed to
increase World Bank loan for equipment.
3.9.  Engineering Expenses
Besides World Bank loan, the completion of the project on schedule also gave credit to
punctual availability of domestic funds based on reviewed budget estimate and yearly
plan.

Notes: 1.   In order to guarantee proper operation of railways, MOR and Inner
Mongolia government reached another agreement to invest initial current capital of
RMB 25 million yuan respectively. MOR had appropriated RMB 25 million yuan in
1995, but RMB 25 million yuan of Inner Mongolia was not available yet.
2.    During railway construction, according to actual status of railway construction
and domestic price fluctuation, two reviews of budget estimate of investment were
carried out, with a increase of RMB 887,350 yuan, of which RMB 33,703 yuan caused by
change of domestic exchange rate of World Bank loan, and RMB 550,320 yuan because
of domestic increase.
3.    Actually available funds of World Bank loan amounted to an equivalent of
RMB 931,340 yuan, RMB 37,310 yuan more than funds of RMB 894,030 yuan
determined by reviewed budget estimate. Because of the problems of construction
company in settlement of account, projects were not determined, and the increased part of
funds were not put into engineering project yet and needed to be arranged.



- 43 -                          Appendix B
Although two budget estimate reviews were carried out for the construction of Ji'ning-
Tongliao line, its investment was low compared with other domestic railway construction
within the corresponding period from the view of reviewed budget estimate. That was
not only because construction conditions were not so difficult, but also because of strong
support of Inner Mongolia governments of each level and of local people along the line,
and because of great effort and efficient work management of leaders and employees of
construction companies.

Notes: 1.      Other engineering  cost for construction  companies were  additional
expenses for construction in winter time, in windy and dusty area and in rainy season, and
for construction site formation.
2.     Actual amount of other cost: (1) expenses for relocation of construction sections
of construction companies, subsidy to transport of food staff for constructors, labor and
hygiene care expenses, interest expenses of construction companies, increased expenses
of short distance railway transportation and profit, altogether RMB 125,682,000 yuan; (2)
subsidy of RMB 18.051 million yuan for capacity expansion of power supply; (3)
RMB 48.16 million yuan for joint test run; (4) RMB 10.125 million yuan for insurance
and disaster compensation.



- 44 -                    Appendix B
Actual engineering cost was RMB 887.61 million yuan more than assessment, and main
reasons for that were as follows:
1.    The following items were added: a rescue train of RMB 7.8 million yuan, track
circuits of RMB 5.46 million yuan, power supply of RMB 4.5 million yuan at place
where there was no power station, one section of material factory of RMB 8.245 million
yuan, one section of ballast factory of RMB 10.391 million yuan, 20000 m2 of employee
residential area of RMB 17.36 million yuan, three sections of epidemic prevention station
of RMB 8.805 million yuan, and altogether RMB 62.56 million yuan.
2.   In order to prevent railway foundation from being blown away by wind or being
buried by sand, cost of RMB 46.85 million yuan for sand-control and afforestation was
added to plant trees and grass and to build snow wall and fences.
3.   Interest of World Bank loan during construction was paid by an investment of
RMB 185.73 yuan instead of being paid for by Inner Mongolia financial department as it
used to be.
4.    Ten more locomotives were added, from planned 82 to 92; 302 more gondolas
were added, from originally planned 178 to present 480; altogether RMB 55 million
yuan.
5.    More offices and residential houses of 28000 m  were built and procured in
Huhhot area with RMB 36.06 million yuan.
6.    180 km of power supply through line of RMB 16 million yuan was added in no
power supply area to guarantee power supply for safe operation of signaling.
7.    There was no cost for joint test run in original budget estimate, but actually it cost
RMB 48.16 million yuan.
8.    120 more automobiles of various kinds of RMB 11.3 million yuan for freight and
passenger transportation were procured to meet the needs of operation.
9.    Expenses caused by the change of quantity of engineering amounted to RMB
133.294 million yuan, and RMB 60.394 million yuan was overspent compared with
engineering quantity contingency in original budget estimate.
10.   RMB 15 million yuan more was added for land acquisition and relocation.
11.  Increase of design and management cost was RMB 20.2 million yuan.
12.   Engineering insurance and disaster compensation cost was RMB 10.125 million
yuan.



- 45 -                              Appendix B
13.    Domestic  price  fluctuation  of every  year  during  construction  resulted  in
RMB 613.71 million yuan. RMB 349.46 million yuan was overspent except price
contingency of RMB 264.24 million yuan in original budget estimate.
14.    RMB  33.47 million yuan was saved in other engineering cost and temporary
engineering cost.
15.    RMB 4.244 million yuan more was added for personnel training mainly because
new sections were set up by the company, and there were no classroom or teachers, and
new trainees had to be entrusted to existing schools of national railways for training with
relatively high training cost. Although new trainees bore 50% of training cost besides
their board expenses, still RMB 4.244 million yuan more training cost was added.

Personnel establishment of the company were 8,567 people for short-term  transport
volume (7 million t). In order to meet the requirement of operation, not only graduated
trainees were on duty, but also a backbone team of 1,250 people was transferred in from
national railways, and 538 people from local enterprises, altogether 5,975 people. And
566 people from national railways were engaged, and 1,700 casual labors (including
seasonal labors) were hired for line modification in July and August or as cook for some

department. Engaged personnel from national railways were retired technical backbones.
After trained personnel became experienced through practice, the number of employee
were reduced gradually. Most casual labors were seasonal labors, and number of them
was large in railway modification season from May to October every year, and small
from November to April of the second year. Therefore, present number of company
personnel can meet the requirement of present transport volume.
4. PROJECT SUSTAINABILITY
4.1.  Areas along the line are economically backward, but along with the start of
railway operation, economic development will be remarkable: (1). Processing industry of
side products of agriculture and animal husbandry industry, one of the mainstays in Inner
Mongolia area will develop rapidly; (2). Development of metal and non-metal mineral
industry along the line will enter a new stage; (3). Capacity of power supply along the
line will increase greatly, and future of economic development is very promising.
Transport volume along the line in 1996 was 1 .15 million tonnes. Transport volume of
1997 will be 1.46 million tonnes. Economic development along the line will lead to large
transport volume of Ji'ning-Tongliao line.
4.2.  First diverting meeting for Ji'ning-Tongliao line was held by MOR in October,
1995, with the result that freight between Tongliao and northeast area, and between area
to the north of Siping and northwest area is transported on Ji'ning-Tongliao line. The
second diverting meeting was held in May, 1996, with the result that diverting point was
changed to Shenyang from June, and freight between area to the north of Shenyang and
northwest area (Huhhot, Lanzhou and Urumqi Railway Administrations) is transported on
Ji'ning-Tongliao line. Coordination meeting for diverting of freight transportation was
held in August of 1996. Through above mentioned work by MOR, freight diverted to
Ji'ning-Tongliao line amounts to 350000-400000t per month. At present, manufacturing
amount of Dongsheng Coal Field in west Inner Mongolia depends on transport capacity.
In latter half of 1996, 150,000-200,000t coal was transported from west to east every
month, and 2.20 million tonnes of coal is expected to be transported in 1997. Later, with
the development of transport, coal transport volume from west to east will increase in fast
speed. The future of total transport volume of Ji'ning-Tongliao line is very promising.
4.3.  Although the year of 1996 is the first operation year of Ji'ning-Tongliao line,
operation income of that year was RMB 350 million yuan, able to guarantee regular
operation expenditure. It is expected to pay interest of World Bank loan of the year
basically as well as to guarantee regular operation expenditure in the year of 1997, and in
1998, it is expected to be able to pay principal and interest of World Bank loan of the
year. In 2000, financial capacity of the company can afford expanded reproduction.
4.4.  There is still a lot of work for Ji'ning-Tongliao line to do to develop from short-
term transport volume of 7,000,000t to long-term one of 17,000,000 t. 51 more stations
will be built, more tracks will be built in existing 50 stations, the length of passing tracks
of stations and length of platforms will be extended, foundation of more than 400 km will



- 47 -                     Appendix B
be widened, semi-mechanization and mechanization of track maintenance will be
realized, some sections will be modified, lamp indication of signaling will be realized,
program control of communication will be realized, power supply through line for the
whole line will be built, diesel locomotive will be adopted gradually, ability of inspection
and repair of rolling stock will be strengthened, more buildings will be built, and with the
development of science and technology, personnel need training and new knowledge
shall be learned; to calculate in terms of present price, about RMB 1.3-1.4 billion yuan
has to be invested. These work does not request investment once and for all as
construction of a new railway does, instead, work will be done step by step with the
increase of transport volume. During the first 4 years of railway operation, depreciation
charge of more than RMB 100 million yuan will be obtained every year for gradual
modification year by year, from the 5th to the 10th year of railway operation, RMB 200
million yuan including depreciation charge will be invested every year for large-scale
upgrading, and in the 10th year of railway operation, long-term transport volume of
17,000,000 t will be realized without any problems.
5. BANK PERFORMANCE
5.1.  Initiative, carefulness and sincerity of World Bank staff put in their work of
project establishment, pre-assessment, assessment, negotiation and signing of loan
agreement show their conscientiousness not only for World Bank but also for the project.
Deep and careful study on feasibility of the project was carried out, and careful and
painstaking study on and comparison with other alternative transport means and
alignments of the line were undertook. Field investigation and research of origin and
sales place of main goods to be transported, and of social impact and environmental
protection were performed. Requirement about investment and production capacity of
Dongsheng Coal Field was brought forth, materials for construction and equipment
procurement were reviewed carefully, and deep discussion about domestic supplementary
funds was undertook, requesting a guarantee for domestic supplementary funds. These
work played an important role in promoting the completion of the project on schedule.
After Loan Agreement took effect, the World Bank cooperated actively in material and
equipment procurement and in appliance for supplementary payment to guarantee the
completion of construction on schedule. Two inspections per year are very helpful to us,
calling our attention to some special items, so that we are able to take measures to solve
problems in time.
5.2.  Through preparation and implementation of the project by the World Bank, we
feel it is necessary to discuss the following three points.
* Preparation time for the project is too long. It took three years from the
project establishment to effecting of loan, and altogether it was four years
including the time for domestic permit applying. The procedure is correct,
which should not be simplified or cut down, but it can be squeezed in shorter
time. If time is shortened to two years from project establishment to effecting
of loan, it will be very beneficial to project cost and to project arrangement.



- 48 -                     Appendix B
*  Complicated and long time procurement procedure is disadvantageous to
project construction.  It took more than eight months from bulletin of
invitation for bids for project procurement being carried on newspaper to
arrival of materials and equipment, and submission to the World Bank for
review had to be carried out many times. If Loan Agreement of the project
took effect in November of 1989, construction was opened formally in June of
1990, and contract of material procurement (steel, timber cement, etc. needed
urgently for construction) was signed in March of 1991, products would begin
to arrive in June of 1991. Therefore, we had to do part of procurement with
domestic funds first, and materials of construction companies had to be used
first. And it is worth discussing whether to shorten procurement time to
guarantee material supply for construction.
*  For the fifth invitation for bids of the project, all the procedures were carried
out in a regular way, but four months after submission of the contract and
approval by the World Bank (Supplier had completed equipment
manufacturing and delivered the products to port of embarkation.), a sudden
telex announced that the contract was not invalid, and we had to negotiate
with supplier and indemnify USD 200,000, which brought unnecessary loss to
the project and increased project construction cost.
6. BORROWER PERFORMANCE
6.1.  Leadership of government of borrower is correct. Policy decisions of board of
directors of borrower are prompt, leadership of borrower companies is strong, personnel
are conscientious, and construction team awarded with the contract is qualified. Before
Loan Agreement took effect, with a small number of personnel, paper materials for pre-
assessment, assessment and negotiation were prepared punctually and carefully,
preparation for land acquisition was performed efficiently, bid evaluation of survey
design was undertaken, and after survey design company was appointed, preliminary
measurement and design, and final measurement and construction design were carried out
in a cooperative way that all the design was completed by the end of 1988, including all
construction drawings. On the basis of all these work, bidding for construction was
invited, contract was awarded subsequent to evaluation, and permit of the government for
construction was applied promptly afterwards. When the Loan Agreement began to take
effect, report was submitted to relevant governmental departments to obtain permit for
construction as soon as possible, negotiation with construction companies was
undertaken, construction contract and subcontract were signed, material procurement at
the beginning of construction and material procurement with World Bank loan through
bidding were arranged, and at the same time land acquisition and relocation were carried
out. The State issued permit for construction in May of 1990, and construction was
started formally in June of 1990. In addition to large amount of supply of construction
materials, yearly construction plan was made in time, construction management people
were organized on time to guarantee charge on quality supervision and inspection of
construction, to coordinate the relationship among each side, and to take punctual



- 49 -                     Appendix B
measures to solve problems encountered. Command offices were set up on construction
site, and what's more, during construction, most people of the company went to
construction site during golden construction period of each year, mostly from May to
October. Leading members of the company spent five months on average every year in
construction site in promoting inspection and instruction, in coordinating work among
each side, and in solving various problems encountered in time.  Endeavor and
conscientiousness put into the work played an important role in promoting the completion
of railway construction on schedule.
6.2.  After preparation and beginning of construction, there were two main problems
which delayed the start of construction and prolonged construction time to some extent.
*  Loan for this project was approved by the board of directors of World Bank on
May 12, 1989, Loan Agreement was signed in September and took effect in
November, and construction should be started in April of 1990; however
certain procedures were required to obtain domestic permit for construction,
and check and approval in previous years usually were carried out in latter half
of the year, therefore, although the company submitted the report to apply for
start of construction at the beginning of 1990 in the second half of 1989,
because of above mentioned reasons, the report was not approved in time.
However the leaders of the company reported three times to relevant
governmental departments, stating reasons and benefits of starting
constructions, and State made an exception in approving the start of
construction on May 22, 1990. Although construction companies were urged
to be ready for formal construction on June 20, start of construction was still
delayed by two months resulting in prolonged construction time.
*  Track laying of 151 km in the middle section of the line-from Haoluku to
Linxi should be completed by the end of 1993.  However, because
arrangements and construction measures were not carried out properly by the
construction company-the fourth division of the l 3th Engineering Bureau of
MOR, and also because the section was located in very cold area and
characterized by large number of high bridges and complicated radius of
curve, only 70 km of track laying was completed by December. the laying of
the remained 80 km  of tracks would be more difficult.  Construction
companies suggested that track laying was stopped for that year and would
resume from April of the next year. Leading members of the company held
meeting at site and carried out investigation and study again and again for this
issue, and concluded that track laying in very cold winter time was really
difficult, but stop of track laying would prolong the whole construction time
by one year with the result of enormous loss. Therefore, the company decided
to assist construction company in undertaking properly various technical and
winter construction work, for example, machinery and constructors were kept
out of cold and quilts and clothing were provided, and great attention was paid
to board and lodging of constructors, and especially, when self-equipped



- 50 -                     Appendix B
generator of bridge erector failed because of coldness, transformer connecting
with local high tension wires was installed on automobile to supply power
through cables to bridge erector. The construction team was touched by these
effort and determined to continue track laying and bridge erecting in spite of
bitter coldness. Although whole construction time was affected, track laying
of the whole section was completed finally on May 4, 1994, and the whole
line was connected through.
7. ASSESSMENT OF OUTCOME
The implementation of this project is successful, and evaluation of leaders of the State is:
cost-efficient investment (average cost is RMB 2.2 million yuan per kilometer), short
time (it took more than five years from start of construction to opening of operation of
railway of 945 km in very cold area), and good quality. The goal of construction has
been reached, and Ji'ning-Tongliao Line has become continental bridge connecting
northeast, North China and northwest of China. "West coal transported to east" has been
started, beginning to promote and bring along economic development along the line. To
summarize, the construction goal of project of Ji'ning-Tongliao is fundamentally realized,
and a promising prospect is expected.



- 51-                     ANNEX I
ANNEX 1: FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
1.    The evaluation of the Inner Mongolia Ji-Tong Railway Limited Liability
Company's (JRLLC's) actual financial performance to date and projections through 2003
is presented below. Figures in parenthesis show actual numbers stated in the SAR or the
assumptions made in 1988/89.
Introduction
2.    Although Inner Mongolia Local Railway Corporation (IMLRC) had been
established legally by the time of appraisal, it was not operational as an enterprise, except
for an office to oversee construction until July 1995, when a limited liability company
(JRLLC) was established. JRLLC's core staff was paid and its expenses met by advances
from GIM and MOR. Accordingly, the SAR financial analysis was prospective and
focused on the elements which were judged as likely to assure a sound financial position
for this new company once it began operations in 1995 (1993). JRLLC was seen as
having the opportunity to use its relative autonomy and favorable demand prospects to
build a financially strong and efficiently managed company.
Capitalization
3.    The contributions by GIM  and MOR to the total investment in the project
represent their equity shares in JRLLC. Thus, JRLLC was capitalized initially at about
Y 1,226.3 (810) million, although the business license records paid-in capital of Y 800
million with MOR having 52.5 percent and GIM 47.5 percent of ownership. The ratio
was established on the portion of funds provided by each partner towards the construction
costs. By the third-quarter of 1997, accountants will determine the final value of the line
assets at the time of acceptance and record resulting changes in the equity valuation. On
this basis, the final share distribution between MOR and GIM will be decided. In
addition, GIM financed interest during construction and debt service during the first full
year of JRLLC's operation. This healthy equity contribution provided strong capital for
the company and has left it with a low debt to capital ratio. No dividend distributions are
planned. The financial backing by GIM and MOR was indicative of the priority placed
on this project because of the anticipated economic benefits in respect of coal transport
and development of regional economic activities and trade.
Traffic
4.    The Ji-Tong line was built for an initial capacity of 7 million tons per year in each
direction. In the first year of full operations, traffic buildup has been faster than
anticipated and capacity utilization is currently about 60 percent. However, JRLLC's
current traffic volume forecast is between 25 and 48 percent lower for freight traffic and



- 52-                        ANNEX 1
85 and 90 percent lower for passenger traffic than forecasted in the SAR. In addition,
JRLLC's current annual growth rate projections are lower than originally expected,
ranging between 11 percent and 4 percent (15 percent) over the projection period,
primarily due to line capacity constraints. JRLLC intends to incrementally expand
capacity based on demonstrated demand. Given the potential for trade between Inner
Mongolia and the northeast, it appears that JRLLC, if it can clear up some of its line
capacity constraints, has conservatively estimated its traffic expansion and higher traffic
volumes will likely develop.
Tariffs
5.    As a local railway, the provincial price bureau has given JRLLC the authority to
set freight tariffs within a range of 10 fen/tkm plus/minus 20 percent for movements over
its route. JRLLC uses the flexibility and has set the tariff to 8.0 (3) fen/tkm for goods
including coal which are shipped from or to destinations outside the Ji-Tong line; and
10 fen/tkm for traffic using only the new line. The current average freight tariff is
8.8 fen/tkm representing rates which were established for different classes of traffic and
lengths of haul. The freight tariff is substantially lower than the 10.85 fen/tkm tariff in
effect on the alternative Datong-Qinhuangdao line (the Da-Qin line tariff includes a
4.0 fen/tkm electrification surcharge as well a 1.0 fen/tkm "new lines" surcharge).
JRLLC is of the view that its ability to provide a lower overall transport price to shippers
due to the shorter line distance between western Inier Mongolia to northeastern China
has been a major factor in attracting overhead traffic to the line. Passenger tariffs are set
according to the type of seats and berth and average 8.8 (2) fen/pkm.
6.    Current average tariff rates for freight and passenger transportation are adequate
to achieve the financial targets laid out in the SAR, particularly if passenger and freight
volumes grow at planned or better levels. Even if future traffic volumes do not
materialize or operating expenses increase above planned levels, JRLLC has the option to
decrease its planned investment program (para. 10), which is more ambitious than
envisioned in the SAR, and still remain profitable. In addition JRLLC has the option to
increase tariffs. The degree to which it could raise its tariffs depends on the combined
effect of (a) its shorter transportation distance (vis-a-vis MOR routes), (b) the prevailing
all-in tariff on the MOR routes, and (c) MOR's strategic will to continue to send through
traffic to the Ji-Tong line at a higher tariff level.  Based purely on economic
considerations, JRLLC should be able to raise its tariffs to at least the existing levels on
the longer MOR routes. Passenger tariffs should not become a problem because
passenger traffic is estimated conservatively and contributes only marginally to JRLLC's
financial results, and almost all passenger traffic starts and ends on the Ji-Tong railway,
giving JRLLC more autonomy on the setting of tariffs.
Taxes
7.    JRLLC pays a 3 (3) percent consumer tax and an additional 0.3 percent education
and city tax on its gross sales revenue to GIM. However, the consumer tax is fully



- 53 -                     ANNEX 1
rebated to JRLLC in exchange for increased GIM equity in the company. Local railway
companies are exempt from income, VAT and other local taxes on profit.
Operating Expenses
8.    Operating expenses (salaries, materials, fuel, etc.) have a strong effect on the
company's financial health. JRLLC management have expressed their plan to curb
materials, office and other costs in 1997 while at the same time increasing passenger
revenue through better on-train inspection of tickets and collection of revenue. JRLLC
still carries a heavy social burden in that it continues to hire staff beyond its operating
requirements due to political and social pressures, and bears heavy pension and medical
costs for its retired staff (as shown in the large administrative and other expenses line
item on its income statement). On January 1, 1997, JRLLC signed a labor contract which
obliges both management and staff to meet performance criteria, and provides them with
a 15 percent salary increase. The combination of additional labor hires and a salary
increase causes the expected wages expense on the income statement to jump by 25
percent from 1996 to 1997. Given these hiring policies, social burdens and reliance on
MOR for most of its traffic volumes (and hence reliance on their demands), JRLLC will
have little possibility to control two of their largest fixed expense accounts-wages and
salaries and administrative expenses-at levels below the expected domestic inflation
rates.
9.    Operations on the Ji-Tong line began on December 1, 1995. Actual annual
financial data are, therefore, only available for 1996. For the financial projections for the
years 1997 to 2003 discussed below, operating costs have been based on 1996 and first
quarter 1997 actuals. The estimates have been corroborated by line-item forecasts of the
principal cost elements (labor, materials, fuel, and administration) prepared by JRLLC.
Beginning in year 1998 onward, the following annual growth rates have been assumed for
JRLLC's expenses: wages-8 percent; materials and maintenance-5 percent; fuel and
power-12 percent; and administration and other-8 percent. All expenses, except
materials and maintenance are expected to outpace the general domestic inflation rate of
5.5 percent.  With regard to depreciation, JRLLC uses a 4.5 percent composite
depreciation rate, which is close to the average for depreciation charges in MOR (5
percent). All (half) of the depreciation charge goes to the depreciation fund, a portion of
which can be used annually for capital expansion and line upgrading; there is no separate
provision for major repairs as was earlier envisioned.
Capital Investments
10.   JRLLC's Board of Directors has approved a multiyear investment plan which
encompasses not only investments necessary to meet planned traffic volumes, as
envisioned in the SAR, but also safety, employee housing, and other railroad upgrading
investments. JRLLC intends to use retained earnings as far as possible to fund these
investments. It is critical, therefore, that the company's tariff level is sufficient not only
to generate a margin over operating costs, but also to ensure a reasonable self-financing



- 54-                      ANNEX 1
capability.  JRLLC estimates that its railway expansion, upgrading and additional
investments would require about Y 1.3 to Y 1.4 billion from 1996 to 2005. Prior to 2003,
JRLLC has designed a capital investment program valued at about Y 1.04 billion (in
current terms) to undertake the following fixed asset investments:
(a)   Widening of railway embankments:  is an investment to upgrade the
quality of the line to meet government standards. Approximately 500 km
of the railway embankment in the desert would be widened from 5.7 m to
6.7 mn. Widening the embankments would cause no disruption to railway
operations during construction.  This investment, which equates to
$30,000 (in 1997 dollars) per kilometer of track upgraded, is outside the
scope of the original project (Y 151.0 million).
(b)   Building housing for employees: originally, JRLLC expected to build
housing for 500, it now expects to build housing for 4,000 staff. JRLLC
stated that they expect to build 20,000 to 30,000 square meters of housing
per year for the next several years. At this rate, the investment costs
quoted would mean a construction cost per square meter of about $120 (in
1997 dollars). This investment is outside the scope of the original project
(Y 219.7 million).
(c)   Construction of sidings: is required to expand capacity to 17 million tons
per day by 2007. JRLLC estimates that 101 sidings would need to be
constructed. 55 sidings would be constructed by 2003 and an additional
46 from 2004 to 2007. This would amount to an average of about
$100,000 per siding (in 1997 dollars). Building sidings is part of the
original project scope (Y 52.3 million).
(d)   Purchase of steam locomotives: is required to fulfill traffic forecasts.
Second-hand locomotives purchased earlier are only able to transport
2,300 tons each on average vs. the 2,800 tons they were designed to
achieve. As a result, JRLLC plans to buy an additional 8 second-hand
steam locomotives from MOR and an additional 10 diesel locomotives
from 1998 to 2003 (Y 164.6 million).
(e)   Construction of a 10 kV power transmission line: is planned so that
signaling, telecommunications and employee housing can all be hooked up
to electricity. JRLLC sees this as a necessary safety investment which
would improve the quality of the signaling (signaling is currently
mechanical).  This investment is outside the original project scope
(Y 116.3 million).
(f)    Construction of flyovers: is seen by JRLLC as a safety investment. They
plan to construct 15 to 16 flyovers. This amounts to about $36,000 (in
1997 dollars) per flyover. Flyovers are outside the original project scope
(Y 5.8 million).



- 55 -                      ANNEX 1
(g)   Purchase of maintenance cars: is planned by JRLLC and is necessary to
extend the life of the railway assets to their maximum  life.  This
investment is outside the scope of the original project (Y 13.4 million).
(h)   The new communications system: is the communications equipment and
its installation only. This equipment purchase is part of the revised project
scope and provides for state-of-the-art digital communications (Y 18.9
million).
(i)    Open wire replacement of telephone system:  is a complementary
investment to (h). Underground cables would be laid and linked to the
above mentioned digital communications system (Y 7.6 million).
(1)   JRLLC's other investments: are investment allocation in their corporate
budget which can be used for emergency, unforeseen or low priority
investments. The funding level of this investment category is the balance
of JRLLC's planned investments [items (a) to (i)] and their estimated
ability to take on new investment each year. In 1997, some of JRLLC's
other investments will include (i)  conversion of mud platforms to
concrete, (ii) grassification and landscaping along the railway, (iii) flood
prevention along a segment of the track, (iv) purchase of track
maintenance equipment (tamping machines, etc.), (v) purchase of trucks,
(vi) purchase of electrical power generators, etc. These investments are
outside the scope of the project (Y 289.2 million).
11.   At the present time, the investments to expand capacity-from 6.8 million tons to
10.6 million tons-began in 1996 (1997) and continue through 2003 (1999). The roughly
estimated cost for this expansion includes investment items (c) and (d), above, and
including price escalation, is valued at Y 272 million over the eight-year period. Because
the expected investment cost per ton of capacity increase (3.8 million tons) is smaller
than that of the original investment in the Ji-Tong line (Y 2.8 billion for 6.8 million tons),
the return and profitability realized from this incremental investment should be
considerably higher than those of the original investment. Thus, if traffic demand grows
at the level anticipated or higher, the incremental investment should boost the return of
the project as a whole as well as JRLLC's profitability. If traffic does not materialize as
quickly as expected, however, the investment in expanded capacity will be postponed,
thus reducing the downside risk to GIM and JRLLC. JRLLC's capacity related
investments amount to only 26 percent of their total 1996 to 2003 investment program.
This gives JRLLC considerable leeway to reduce its investment program if financial
performance begins to decline. Reduced levels of capital investment are considered in
the financial scenarios below.
Debt Service and Foreign Exchange Risk Obligation
12.   Interest during construction (including commitment fees) was paid by GIM and
was considered a noninterest-bearing loan to JRLLC, which has already been repaid to



- 56 -                      ANNEX 1
GIM  through JRLLC's cash flow.  GIM  has also paid interest and debt service
obligations for JRLLC during its first full year of operation to assure sufficient working
capital for the company. The principal debt obligation is the Bank Group loan and credit
which JRLLC/GIM began to service in 1994.
13.   Since the Yuan/US dollar exchange rate has been adjusted significantly since
1989, from Y 3.714/$1.0 to Y 8.3/$1.0, the decision on the allocation of the foreign
exchange risk was a determining factor in the ability of JRLLC to meet its financial
covenants in the short and long run. The original intention of the SAR was to require
GIM to bear the foreign exchange risk of the loan and credit because of its significant
foreign exchange earnings from the sale of anthracite and animal husbandry goods and all
of JRLLC's income is in RMB. A Bank investigation in April 1997, however, came to
the conclusion that in reviewing, and accepting, the evidences of fulfillment of the
conditions of effectiveness, there is nothing on file to indicate that the Bank/Association
rejected the way the subsidiary loan agreements allocate the foreign exchange risk
between the central government, GIM and IMLRC, even though on their face they differ
from what was set forth in the SAR. The effects of the decision to place the foreign
exchange risk burden on the company are analyzed in the sensitivity analysis below.
Financial Forecast Sensitivity Analysis
14.   While tariff levels, traffic volume and the level of operating costs are critical
factors affecting the financial position of JRLLC (as assumed in the SAR) the size of
JRLLC's investment program and the issue of foreign exchange liability on the Bank loan
and IDA credit are also major factors. These factors are explored in the financial
analysis. Projected income, balance sheet and flow of funds statements over an eight-
year horizon beginning in 1996 (1993), as well as supporting debt service schedules for
the Bank Group loan and credit, short-term loans and advances from GIM are presented
in Tables 1 to 16 to this Annex. Four scenarios are based on the following assumptions:
(a)    Scenario I: is the base case and assumes that (i) JRLLC undertakes only
capacity related investments and those investments within the project
scope, i.e., investment items (c), (d), (h) and (i) (para. 10); (ii) JRLLC
itself bears the foreign exchange risk associated with loan and credit
repayment; (iii) JRLLC's traffic forecast which anticipates annual growth
in total freight and passenger tonnage between 11 percent to 4 percent
from 1998 to 2003; and (iv) JRLLC's tariffs remain unchanged at 8.8 (2.0)
fen/tkm for freight and 8.8 (2.0) fenlpkm for passenger traffic.
(b)   Scenario II: assumes the base case, except that JRLLC undertakes their
full investment program (para. 10). This case vis-a-vis the base case
compares JRLLC's ability to self-finance its future investment projects.
(c)    Scenario III:  assumes  (i) JRLLC undertakes their full investment
program; (ii) GIM bears the foreign exchange risk associated with loan
and credit repayment, as was the intent of the SAR (para. 13);



-57-                         ANNEX1
(iii) JRLLC's traffic forecast; and (iv) no change in tariffs. This case vis-
a-vis Scenario II highlights the effect that the decision on who should bear
the foreign exchange risk of the project has on the financial performance
of JRLLC.
(d)    Scenario IV:  assumes the base case, except that working expenses
increase by 20 percent annually (instead of levels assumed in paras. 8 and
9). Separately, the level of tariff increases required to offset working
expense increases will be presented. This will measure the effects of
increases in operating expenses on JRLLC's financial performance, and
consequently their ability to respond with a tariff increase.
15.   The key performance measures in the financial analysis are: (a) the debt service
financial covenant, which stipulates that a debt service coverage of 1.5 must be achieved
within the first three years of operation; (b) the operating ratio covenant, which stipulates
that tariffs will be set to cover all operating costs from revenues; and (c) the annual self-
financing ratio, defined in this case as the annual available cash flow and accumulated
resources as a percentage of the three-year average investment program (averaging the
prior-, current- and following-year capital investments). This last ratio is particularly
important because JRLLC has emphasized its desire to use retained earnings for future
investments. Raising tariff levels would not necessarily be an easy solution to JRLLC's
financing shortfalls, so the analysis assumes that if internally generated funds are
insufficient, the balance will be borrowed on a short-term basis at a projected rate of
10.08 (7) percent per year. Debt service then includes service of the Bank Group loan
and credit, the advances from GIM given as loans and any additional short-term and long-
term borrowing to support the capital investments and working capital requirements of
JRLLC.
16.   The results of each scenario are summarized below and in the following table on
page 59:
(a)    Scenario I: With the significantly reduced investment program, JRLLC's
financial performance looks very strong.  Not only does it meet
covenanted debt service coverage requirements by 1998, it can self-
finance all of its investments and build up a large cash reserve. Moreover,
after 1999, return on assets outpaces expected domestic inflation (5.5
percent) and operating ratios are acceptable.
(b)    Scenario II: Even if JRLLC undertakes its full-scale investment program
as planned, its financial performance is acceptable and it can fully self-
finance its investment program. JRLLC's operating ratio is acceptable,
although somewhat high after 1999 and its return on assets only achieves a
level which meets expected domestic inflation. Debt service coverage is
acceptable by 1998.



- 58 -                    ANNEX 1
(c)   Scenario III: If GIM takes on the foreign exchange risk for JRLLC as
agreed in the SAR (but not in the legal agreements) starting in 1998,
JRLLC's debt coverage will more than double and their cashflow will
grow. Self-financing capacity will increase but since it is already over 100
percent, this is not a critical factor.
(d)   Scenario IV: JRLLC is very sensitive to changes in operating expenses.
Even if JRLLC undertakes its minimum investment program (base case),
if working expenses (not including depreciation) grow by 20 percent per
year, JRLLC will reach unacceptable operating ratios by 1999, return on
assets turns negative, debt service coverage requirements are not adequate
after 1999, and JRLLC would have to borrow more than Y 250 million to
finance its investment program and significant income losses.
To counteract the increase in working expenses, JRLLC would either to (a) raise tariffs
from 8.8 fen/tkm (and pkm) to 12 fen/tkm (and pkm) gradually over a three-year period
commencing in 1999, or, (b) have GIM assume foreign exchange costs commencing in
1998 and raise tariffs to 10 fen/tkm (and plkm).
17.  In sum, JRLLC's financial performance can be expected to remain good so long
as operating costs do not jump significantly or traffic volumes drop significantly. It is
highly recommended that JRLLC review its investment program and scale it down by as
much as 50 percent (only undertaking priority investments) so that it can build up a cash
reserve to help cushion against unexpected operating shortfalls or reduced traffic
volumes.

ANNEX 2: ECONOMIC REEVALUATION OF THE
INNER MONGOLIA LOCAL RAILWAY PROJECT
Introduction
1.    As presented in the SAR, the project had three discrete objectives. Of these, by
far the most important was the aim of providing a transportation bridge for the shipment
of goods between western Inner Mongolia and northeastern China. While it was
anticipated that in this capacity the railway would handle a number of different
commodity movements, coal was clearly envisioned to be the most significant. As stated
in the SAR: "The line will literally open up a market for Inner Mongolia's coal by giving
it direct access to Jilin province, a domestic coal importer; about 80 percent of the
eastbound traffic is expected to be dedicated to coal haulage."'
2.    A second project objective was institutional in nature involving the formation of a
local company that would manage what would become the longest local railway in
China.2 There is a twofold significance to this objective. First, local railways which are
built and operated by local governments and enterprises, enjoy a greater degree of
financial and pricing freedom compared with the national railway carrier. In this respect,
therefore, the tariff levels of local railways may be higher or lower than those of the
national railways. Second, from a geographical perspective, most local railways are
shorter haul, "stub-end" lines. This, in turn, limits their ability to interchange traffic with
the national railways since their only connection with the national railways is at one end
of their local route. In this respect, Ji-Tong is somewhat unique in that as an overhead or
bridge railway it links with the national railways at both its eastern (Tongliao) and
western (Benhong) terminals. As such, for shippers in northeastern China, on the one
hand and those in western Inner Mongolia and beyond on the other, the Ji-Tong line
represents a shorter distance through railway option compared with the alternative of
routing traffic via Datong, Beijing, and Qinhuangdao. Taken together, the existence of
this routing alternative along with the comparative pricing flexibility accorded local
railway operators combine to create the potential for fostering true intrarailway
competition in China. This potential clearly was envisioned in the SAR: "When the Ji-
Tong line is open to traffic, shippers of these products [timber and other commodities]

in western Inner Mongolia." SAR, para. 3.6. See also SAR, Annex 4.

who are free to choose will compare the total tariffs of freight transport via the Ji-Tong
line and the existing route before deciding which route to select."3
3.    Finally, the third objective of the project focused on promoting regional
development. Noting that the Ji-Tong line would pass through 12 counties and should
impact on an hinterland area as well, the SAR anticipated benefits in the form of
stimulating local industry and animal husbandry production.4 While the SAR devoted
considerable attention to this objective, the economic benefits associated with regional
development were comparatively modest.  Thus, local industry production only
accounted for less than 1988 Y 1.6 billion in benefits or about 7 percent of the project
total. Similarly, the benefits attributable to animal husbandry amounted to 1988 Y 1.4
billion or 6.5 percent of the project benefits as a whole.5
4.    Based largely on information obtained during the Supervision Missions conducted
in July 1996 and March 1997 (hereafter referred to as the 1996 Mission and 1997
Mission, respectively), it is possible to provide a contemporary assessment of the
likelihood of achieving these original objectives. To begin with, the coal supply and
demand patterns postulated in the SAR have not been realized. Instead of obtaining coal
from the Dongsheng fields as had been anticipated, users in Jilin province have continued
to rely on their traditional sources in Heilongjiang province. At the same time, though,
the development of the Dongsheng reserves has proceeded on schedule. As of 1995,
Dongsheng production approximated 16.4 million tons and by 2000, it is expected that
output will reach 29 million tons.
5.    Nonetheless, due to a series of logistical and distribution problems, little of this
output has been transported via the Ji-Tong route. Of the 16 million tons produced in
1995, for example, it is estimated that about half (7-8 million tons) has been stockpiled in
ground storage at the mine head. Of the remaining 8 million tons of Dongsheng
production, about 4 million tons were transported to Qinhuangdao via alternative national
railway routes (Datong-Beijing-Qinhuangdao and the heavy haul Da-Qin line), while
another 4 million tons were being moved by truck from the mines to local consumption
sites.
6.    In addition, the national railways have incurred congestion problems at locations
west and east of the Ji-Tong route. Between Baotou and Benhong (the western JRLLC-
national railways interchange point), the Hohhot Administration has experienced a
shortage of both diesel locomotives and freight wagons for loading coal. At the same
time, there have been severe congestion problems at the eastern JRLLC-national railways
interchange point. Here, the Tongliao South marshaling yard, which handles both JRLLC
business as well as traffic for the national railways has proven to be inadequate.

5  SAR, Table 5.2.



-78 -                       ANNEX2
7.    In the short term, these factors have depressed the volume of coal which JRLLC is
expected to transport. For 1996, the first full year of operations, JRLLC handled just
over I million tons of coal in overhead service-less than half of the 2.3 million tons
projected in the SAR. Similarly, in 1997, Ji-Tong through coal volume is estimated at
about 1.5 million tons or 37 percent of the nearly 4 million tons forecast for year 2 in the
SAR.6
8.    This experience demonstrates how dependent a bridge carrier such as JRLLC is
upon the traffic which its connections can make available to it. When markets do not
develop as anticipated (or when connecting railways route traffic so as to avoid the
intermediate overhead route), the bridge carrier must find other sources of traffic to
compensate for these losses. By making use of the pricing flexibility accorded to local
railways, this, in fact, is what JRLLC has been able to accomplish. Specifically,
compared to its nominal base freight rate of 10 fen per tkm, which applies to JRLLC local
traffic, a rate of only 8 fen per tkm has been instituted by JRLLC for through traffic
interchanged with the national railways. As a result of this 20 percent discount, JRLLC
has made its route more competitive and thereby succeeded in attracting a variety of both
coal and noncoal products.
9.    These developments have substantially altered the traffic composition of the
railway compared to what had been postulated in the SAR. As reflected in Table 1, for
the first two years of operation, the volume of through coal movements transported by
JRLLC is well below SAR estimates. Compensating for this coal deficit, however, are
shipments of noncoal commodities (e.g., grain, chemicals, timber, etc.) which JRLLC
forecasts will amount to more than 3.1 million tons by 1997. This is almost half again
the comparable figures as projected in the SAR. From the standpoint of the economic
analysis of the project, this shift in the mix of JRLLC through traffic is significant
because the relatively higher value added associated with noncoal products provides more
in the way of economic benefits for through traffic than had been anticipated in the SAR.
10.   Also reported in Table 1 are the volumes of local freight traffic and total
passenger business (both local and through). As can be seen, while the volume of JRLLC
local traffic is significantly higher than the levels presented in the SAR, this in large part
is attributable to coal which is expected to account for nearly half of local freight tonnage
in 1997 (a portion of this coal is quite similar to overhead bridge traffic because it is
loaded at stations at the west end of the Ji-Tong route and delivered off-line to
destinations in the northeast). At the same time, the 280,000 passengers which JRLLC
estimates it will carry in 1997 is well below the second-year figure of 860,000 persons
projected in the SAR.  These local and passenger traffic categories are the most
immediate indicators of the regional development that could be stimulated by JRLLC
operations. At best, the results must be regarded as mixed, suggesting that the regional
6   Data supplied to the 1996 and 1997 missions and SAR, Table 5.1.



- 79 -                      ANNEX2
benefits properly assignable to the line cannot be expected to provide more than a
minimal contribution to the overall economic assessment.
11.   Taken as a whole, two factors play the most significant role in reevaluating the
economic merit of this project. From a cost standpoint, it is important to recognize that
construction of the line has required eight years to complete rather than the six years
anticipated in the SAR. As detailed below, this elongated time frame, in turn, has
resulted in a substantial 21 percent increase in project costs. Furthermore, the lengthier
construction schedule also has delayed the onset of project benefits by two years. From
the perspective of both costs and benefits, therefore, the extra time required to place the
line in service has had the effect of reducing the project's net present value stream and its
economic rate of return.
12.   With respect to the benefits themselves, it is also apparent that the economic
worth of this project primarily rests on the volume and mix of the railway's through
traffic. Accordingly, in deriving these estimates, the analysis here begins with the
forecasts provided by JRLLC (these figures, along with the comparable data from the
SAR, are presented in Table 2). While the JRLLC freight volume estimates for 1996 and
1997 are segregated into through and local traffic categories for 1996 and 1997 (see Table
1), no such classification was available for other years in the forecast period. In line with
the 1996 and 1997 experience, though, it is assumed here that 75 percent of the total
projected tonnage represents through traffic and the remaining 25 percent is local
business. In the base case, it is further assumed that from 1998 onward, half of the
through traffic consists of coal and noncoal commodities, respectively (this assumption
confers a higher proportion of through traffic to coal than is anticipated in the 1996 and
1997 period). In the absence of any longer-term projections, the JRLLC estimates for the
year 2003 were assumed to be constant for the remaining years in the analysis.
13.   Based on these predicates, and utilizing a discount rate of 12 percent, the net
present value (NPV) of the project is Y 4.6 billion in 1994 prices and the economic rate
of return (EIRR) is 19.0 percent. By comparison, the EIRR calculated in the SAR was
17.9 percent.
Direct Project Costs
14.   On a financial basis, total direct project outlays amounted to Y 2.8 billion (see
Table A below). Local costs by year in Yuan were furnished by JRLLC, while the annual
US dollar amount of foreign costs-including both the IBRD loan and the IDA credit-
were converted into Yuan at the appropriate annual exchange rate. These figures were
then transformed into constant 1994 Yuan using the annual overall Gross Domestic
Product deflator for local costs and the annual Imports of Goods and Nonfactor Services
deflator for foreign costs, respectively.

15.   Direct project economic costs were derived from the financial costs by shadow
pricing the labor cost component of local costs. Based on data supplied by JRLLC, 63
percent of local costs were associated with labor outlays. This amount (about Y 949.5
million, 1994 prices) was shadow priced at a rate of 1.6 reflecting the factor employed in
Railways VII.7 Nonlabor local costs were not shadow priced. Inclusive of foreign costs,
total direct project outlays expressed on an economic cost basis as shown in the
accompanying Table are equal to just over Y 3.3 billion.
16.   By restating the economic costs of the SAR in 1994 Yuan, it is possible to
compare the direct project costs of the ICR and SAR. The results are shown in Table B
below. The annual economic costs presented in the SAR were apportioned into local and
foreign components on the basis of the ratios derived from the SAR's financial cost data.
Employing the overall Gross Domestic Product deflator and the Import for Goods and
Nonfactor Services deflator, respectively, these outlays were converted into constant
1994 Yuan. Largely due to the additional two year construction period noted earlier, the
ICR direct project cost figure of Y 3,357 million in 1994 prices is 21 percent higher than
the comparable 1994 Y 2,774 million derived from the SAR.

Complementary Capital Costs
17.    Several types of complementary capital outlays should be included in the overall
cost stream of the project. These include the investment costs associated with providing
new production capacity for both coal and noncoal traffic that could be transported by
JRLLC, a portion of the investment related to the new Tongliao South marshaling yard at
the eastern terminus of the Ji-Tong line, and an allowance for additional capital outlays to
accommodate future traffic growth. Each of these is shown in Table 3 and is discussed in
more detail below.
*   New  Production Capacity Investment Costs.  In the SAR, the economic
cost of developing new production capacity for both coal and noncoal
commodities was estimated. Based on a weighted average of central and local
mines, the investment outlay for new coal mine capacity was equal to Y 167
per ton on an economic cost basis, while the comparable figure for other
products was Y 620 per ton.8 In the ICR, these costs have been revalued from
1988 to 1994 levels by application of the GDP deflator. Expressed in 1994
prices, these unit investment costs are Y 294 per ton for coal and Y 1,092 per
ton for noncoal commodities.
JRLLC's projections which was provided to the 1996 mission, indicate that
the volume of coal traffic expected to be handled over the line is far lower
than estimated in the SAR. As a consequence, based on the available data for
1996 and 1997, the bulk of the line's through traffic (75 percent of the total
freight tonnage moving over the route) is anticipated to be comprised of
noncoal business. For the period beyond 1997, the commodity mix of through
traffic is uncertain.   Under these conditions, therefore, the present ICR
analysis has assumed that as of 1998, half of the through traffic will be
comprised of new coal volume, while the remaining half will be accounted for
by noncoal products.9 Complementary investment costs reflecting this amount
of new coal and noncoal production capacity have been calculated based on
the unit prices outlined above. For the complementary cost of the local traffic
assumed to be originating or terminating on line, the unit cost of new coal
investment (Y 294) has been used.
8   SAR, Annex 6, para. 4.
9   In conjunction with these estimates, it was assumed that 10 million tons of new production capacity (5 million
for coal, 5 million for noncoal products) would be developed. In addition to the through traffic, another 1.5
million tons of new production capacity is associated with the development of local traffic. Taken together, the
11.5 million tons in new production capacity approximates the total volume of traffic that the project line could
accommodate if (allowing for a modest volume of passenger traffic) it operated at its initial full capacity of 13.1
million tons. To derive initial line capacity, JRLLC personnel advised the 1996 mission that the net volume of
the average train was equal to 1,800 tons. The existing route can handle 20 trains or 36,000 tons per day. On an
annual basis, this amounts to 13.1 million tons. Notwithstanding some confusion on this matter in prior
Supervision Reports, this estimate accords with the initial figure provided in the SAR. There it was indicated
that "the new line would have an initial capacity of 7 million tons per year (Mtpy) in each direction...." (SAR,
para. 4.9, emphasis supplied. See also, Annex 6, para 2.)



- 82 -                     ANNEX2
All of these new production capacity costs have been spread equally over the
five-year period, 1991-95.
*  Tongliao South Marshaling Yard.  During the 1996 mission, JRLLC
personnel indicated that the congestion experienced at the eastern terminus of
the Ji-Tong route was expected to be relieved upon completion of the new
Tongliao South marshaling yard. Construction of this Y 500 million facility
commenced in 1994 and was scheduled to be completed by the end of 1996.
Since the ability of the Ji-Tong route to operate at capacity is contingent upon
use of Tongliao South, it is appropriate to treat this investment as a
complementary cost of the project. Because non-Ji-Tong railway traffic will
also utilize the new yard, only half of the Y 500 million investment has been
incorporated into the analysis for the three-year period, 1994-96.
*  Additional Railway Capital. Upon opening, the Ji-Tong line was equipped
entirely with 82 steam locomotives obtained on a second-hand basis from
MOR. While JRLLC has indicated that it could operate at full capacity with
steam traction, it is likely to purchase some diesel units in 1999 at an
estimated economic cost of Y 4 million per locomotive. While the number
and timing of future purchases is contingent upon available funds, the present
analysis has included a complementary cost of Y 60 million in 1999 to reflect
the replacement of the first 15 steam locomotives obtained by JRLLC with
diesel-powered equipment.  Further replacements of this scale are also
assumed for the years 2002 and 2005.
To accommodate the projected growth in passenger operations, the analysis
assumes that a total of 10 additional coaches will be obtained, five in 1997 and
1999, respectively, at a unit cost of Y 600,000-an average of the unit prices
paid by JRLLC for its initial hard-berth and hard-seat passenger equipment.
JRLLC anticipates spending about Y 46 million to construct additional
sidings. This expenditure, expressed in 1994 prices, also is included as a
complementary cost over the 1996-2003 period.
Project Benefits
18.   The benefits stemming from the project fall into two basic categories: the value
added to the economy from the new production (and incremental passenger movement)
made possible by the additional transport capacity of the Ji-Tong route, and the transport
cost savings associated with steam traction versus the higher costs of electric operations
on alternative railway routes (see Table 3).
* Valued Added. The value added benefits were separately calculated for coal
and noncoal traffic.  For coal, the city of Siping-situated close to the
boundary between Jilin and Liaoning provinces and a representative
consumption point for Ji-Tong through traffic was selected. The economic



- 83 -                              ANNEX2
value added of coal, then, is the difference between the price of international
and Dongsheng coal delivered to Siping.
To establish the international border price, the average 1994 figure for low-
sulfur, low-ash, 12,000 Btu/pound thermal coal on the international market
was obtained from the Bank's Commodity Price Data Base. This amount
($36.48 per metric ton) was converted to Y 314.5 at the 1994 rate of
Y 8.62/$1. Assuming import at Qinhuangdao and allowing for onward
railway delivery, the value of this coal at Siping amounted to Y 289.7 per ton
in 1994.10
As for the delivered price of Dongsheng coal, the starting point is the cost of
production. According to the SAR, the economic cost at the mine-mouth in
1988  was Y 18 per ton."   Whether this figure  includes the  fixed  cost
component or represents only the direct cost of production is not clear, but it is
conservatively assumed here that only the direct cost is included. Based on
the 1.25 fixed cost/direct cost ratio indicated in Railways VI,'2 the fixed cost
of Dongsheng coal is estimated at 1988 Y 22.5 per ton and the total
production cost at 1988 Y 40.5 per ton. Converted into 1994 prices, this is
equivalent to Y 71.3 per ton. Transportation costs from the mine to Siping via
the Ji-Tong route are equal to Y 60.4 per ton.'3 The sum of the production and
transport costs of Dongsheng coal, therefore, amount to Y 131.7 per ton
(Y 71.3 plus Y 60.4). Accordingly, the value added benefit is Y 158 per ton-
the difference between the delivery adjusted border price of Y 289.7 per ton
and the Y 131.7 per ton price of Dongsheng coal transported via the Ji-Tong
route.
10   The railway distance from Qinhuangdao to Siping is 590 km. According to MOR, the average cost of diesel
traction in 1994 was equal to Y 0.036 per tkm. Thus, the line-haul cost for this traffic amounts to Y 21.2 per ton.
Loading and unloading costs were estimated in the SAR at Y I per ton in 1988 prices, respectively. Using the
GDP deflator, these loading and unloading costs together are equivalent to Y 3.6 per ton in 1994 prices. The
total transport costs from Qinhuangdao to Siping, therefore, amount to Y 24.8 per ton in 1994 prices.
l SAR, Annex 6, para. 12.
12   SAR, Railways VI, Report No. 11 357-CHA, Supplementary Volume, Working Paper No. 22, Table 2.
3   In the SAR, the cost of haulage from the mine head to the railway was Y 3 per ton in 1988 prices, while the on-
road/off-road marshaling costs were Y 2 per ton in 1988 prices. Restated with the use of the GDP deflator, these
costs total to Y 8.8 per ton in 1994 prices. Linehaul diesel operating costs from Baotou to Benhong (360 km at
Y 0.036 per tkm) in 1994 prices are equal to Y 13 per ton, the linehaul steam operating costs from Benhong to
Tongliao (945 km at Y 0.032 per tkm) and from Tongliao to Siping (207 km at Y 0.032 per tkm) amount to
Y 36.8 per ton in 1994 prices. The SAR unloading cost at Siping (Y I per ton in 1988 prices) at the 1994 price
level is Y 1.8 per ton.



- 84 -                               ANNEX2
For noncoal traffic, the value added benefit in the SAR was estimated at
Y 222 per ton in 1988 prices or 5.04 times the value added for coal.'4  Using
this relationship, the value added benefit for noncoal through traffic in the ICR
is Y 797 per ton in 1994 prices. With regard to the freight volume originating
and terminating on line, the Y 158 per ton established for coal was utilized.
*   Operating  Cost Savings.   With  the  completion  of this project, a  less
circuitous and hence less expensive railway line exists for through traffic
moving between western Inner Mongolia and the northeastern provinces of
China. From Jining in the west to Siping in the east, for example, the routing
via JRLLC is 1,190 km or about 200 km shorter than the alternative via
Datong and Qinhuangdao.'5 In addition, the bulk of the Ji-Tong route is
operated with steam traction (Benhong-Siping) while the routes via Datong
and Qinhuangdao primarily utilize higher-cost electric locomotives."6 Taken
together, the lower cost and shorter distance Ji-Tong route is 28 percent less
expensive and results in a savings of Y 16.46 per ton. This amount is
allocated as a benefit to all through traffic projected to traverse the line prior
to diesel locomotive replacements, to 80 percent of through traffic for the
period 1999-2001, to 60 percent of through traffic for the years 2002-2004,
and to 40 percent of through traffic thereafter.
D   Passenger  Benefits.    In  1996, personal travel over the  Ji-Tong  route
amounted to 193,000 passengers. Projections provided to the 1997 mission
estimate that the passenger traffic will approximate 280,000 in 1997, and
increase at 40,000 to 50,000 per year through the year 2003. In accordance
with the SAR methodology, the analysis here assumes that in traffic
equivalent terms one passenger carried by a saturated railway line displaces
4   SAR, Annex 6, paras. 12-13. In the SAR this value added estimate was derived from limited data available for
certain industries including cement, marble, copper, steel, iron, and zinc and applied to local industry traffic. For
through traffic, coal was assumed to account for 90 percent of eastbound traffic and timber was estimated to
represent 94 percent of westbound volume, for which no value added benefit was calculated. See SAR, Annex 6,
para. 7 and para. 12. Based on current JRLLC estimates, these proportions are overstated. For 1997, JRLLC
projects that less than a third of eastbound through traffic will consist of coal, while only 20 percent of
westbound through tonnage will be accounted for by timber.
15   Specifically, the 1,190 km distance via Ji-Tong is composed of these segments: Jining-Benhong (38 km-
diesel), Benhong-Tongliao (945 km-steam) and Tongliao-Siping (207 km-steam). The altemative route is
equal to 1,387 km and includes Jining-Datong (127 km-diesel), Datong-Qinhuangdao (682 km via Beijing and
658 km via the new heavy-haul route or an average of 670 km-electric), and Qinhuangdao-Siping (590 km-
diesel).
16   Based on data supplied by MOR, the average 1994 unit operating cost of steam traction was Y 0.032 per tkm,
while the comparable figures for diesel locomotives was Y 0.036 per tkm, and Y 0.044 per tkm for electric units.
To calculate the transport savings, these unit costs were applied to the distances reported in the prior footnote for
all through traffic assumed to be handled in 1998 and, reflecting increasing dieselization, to 80 percent of
through traffic (1999-2001), to 60 percent of through traffic (2002-2004), and to 40 percent of through traffic
thereafter.

about 1 ton of freight traffic."' Utilizing the value added derived for coal, the
passenger benefit is calculated on the basis of Y 158 per passenger annually.
Economic Rate of Return and Sensitivity Analysis
19.   For the economic reevaluation, net benefits are calculated for the 24-year period
1989-2012 to derive estimates of NPV and EIRR (a discount rate of 12 percent was used).
As reported in Table 3, the estimated NPV is just under Y 4.6 billion in 1994 prices and
the EIRR is 19.0 percent. By comparison, the EIRR in the SAR was 17.9 percent.'8
20.   Adjustments were made in four of the base case assumptions in order to test the
sensitivity of these results. Three of these related to the valuation of benefits, while the
fourth concemed the calculation of the major complementary cost component (see Table
C below).

Reduce Annual Rates of Growth in Freight Traffic by 1/3  4,426       18.8
Shift Through Traffic Mix to 2/3 Coal; 1/3 Noncoal     3,659         18.7
Reduce Coal Border Price by 10%                        2,428         16.0
Increase Development Costs by 20%                       3,749        17.3
*  Traffic Growth. The base case analysis adopts the JRLLC traffic forecast
which anticipates annual growth rates of about 10 percent from 1998 to 2000,
and somewhat smaller increases in subsequent years (8 percent in 2001, 5
percent in 2002, 4 percent in 2003; no growth in the latter years of the
estimate period was postulated). When these assumptions were adjusted
downward by a third for each respective year, the NPV fell to Y 4.4 billion in
1994 prices and the EIRR declined to 18.8 percent.
*  Traffic Mix. Coal and noncoal tonnage comprise 37.5 percent, respectively,
of total freight traffic in the base case (local traffic accounts for the remaining
25 percent).  Since the value added benefits (as well as the associated
development costs) of noncoal production are assumed to be higher than
those for coal, the sensitivity test altered the volume proportions such that coal

IS  SAR, Table 5.2.



- 86 -                      ANNEX2
constitutes 50 percent of total freight traffic, while the noncoal share is
reduced to 25 percent. Under these conditions, the NPV amounts to 1994
Y 3.7 billion and the EIRR is equivalent to 18.7 percent.
*  Coal Border Price. As an input to the coal value added calculation, the base
case assumes that the border price of coal in 1994 was equal to Y 314.5 per
ton. Although international coal prices subsequently are higher (a 7.4 percent
increase was recorded in 1995, for example), this sensitivity test postulates a
reduction in the 1994 price of 10 percent. rhis results in a NPV of 1994 Y 2.4
billion and an EIRR of 16.0 percent.
*  Development Costs. The sensitivity of the complementary costs of coal and
noncoal development was tested by increasing these values by 20 percent.
This adjustment yielded a NPV of 1994 Y 3.7 billion and an EIRR of 17.3
percent.
Taken as a whole, therefore, none of these adjustments produced unacceptable NPV and
EIRR results.
