In\n            addition, related industrial skills will be enhanced, and a\n            systematic tracking program will be instituted to analyze\n            common criteria initiatives. Within the strategic context,\n            the project will contribute widely to broad-based growth and\n            poverty reduction, through the expansion of financial\n            inter-mediation to small-scale rural and urban clients. The\n            project components will include: 1) formulation and approval\n            of a national micro-finance policy, to endorse international\n            best practices, and direct the Government's activity in\n            the sector, diffusing inappropriate political interference;\n            2) design of legal, regulatory, and, supervisory frameworks,\n            focusing on institutional strengthening. Recommendations for\n            revisions in the law and regulations will be developed, for\n            final review by stakeholders; 3) preparation of operational\n            guidelines, covering: banking; cooperative financial\n            institutions; non-governmental organizations; and, capacity\n            building initiatives; 4) institutional strengthening of the\n            Bank of Tanzania, to improve coordination,\n            monitoring/evaluation of micro-finance activities, and\n            develop its Cooperative Department; and, 5) technical\n            workshops/conferences, to enhance micro-finance knowledge\n            and skills."}, "docdt": "1999-08-04T00:00:00Z"}
