KYRGYZ REPUBLIC
FINANCIAL SECTOR TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROJECT
PART I. THE FINANCIAL SECTOR
1.  Before 1991, the Kyrgyz financial system was a regional component of the Soviet financial system
which mobilized and allocated resources according to the decisions of the Soviet government in Moscow.
In June 1991, the first set of financial sector reforms was introduced with the establishment of a two-tier
banking system with the National Bank of the Kyrgyz Republic (NBK), the central bank, created under
the supervision of Parliament. Since then, the NBK has gradually assumed broader, more traditional
central bank powers through the enactment of a comprehensive Central Bank Law and a Commercial
Banking Law in 1992, the introduction of the national currency in 1993, and the development of a full
range of indirect monetary policy instruments. There are now weekly foreign exchange sales by the NBK
to the interbank market, regular treasury bill auctions, and credit auctions.
2.  At present, the Kyrgyz financial system consists of NBK, 17 commercial banks and a savings bank.
The "Big Four" specialized banks (Agroprombank, AKB Kyrgyzstan, Promstroibank and Elbank)
dominate the financial system, accounting for over 80% of the banking system's assets. Though money
and capital markets are underdeveloped, there are also a number of non-bank financial institutions. These
include 17 investment funds, 30 insurance companies, a stock exchange (KSE), a Coupon (privatization)
Trading Center (CTC), and three pension funds.
3. The commercial banking system is dominated by the Big Four commercial banks which are
insolvent. Other weaknesses in the banking system include a low level of capitalization, an inadequate
accounting system, deficient communication and payment systems, a lack of adequate banking skills at
all operational levels, and the ill effects of the directed credit policy followed in the past which is
reflected in the poor quality of the banks' loan portfolios. The adverse economic conditions of the past
few years have led to a further deterioration in banks' portfolios and exacerbated their problems.
4.  Because of the systemic deficiencies in the financial system, the formal financial sector in the Kyrgyz
Republic has not been an effective vehicle for mobilizing financial resources and allocating these to their
most efficient uses. The M2/GDP ratio at 12% indicates the low level of savings and financial
intermediation. Incentives for financial savings by the private sector have been undermined by lack of
confidence in the financial system and, until recently, by substantially negative real interest rates. Despite
these disincentives however, the private sector has been generating (small) positive savings while the
Government at large, including state-owned enterprises, has been the biggest dissaver (i.e., overall net
borrower).
5.  An efficient financial sector, with an effective banking system at its core, is essential to support and
foster the Kyrgyz Republic's stabilization and structural adjustment efforts. The Government's objective
is to develop and deepen the financial system, restore public confidence, and to establish, over the



- 2 -
medium term, an efficient system of resource mobilization and allocation which would become
increasingly more liberal and market-oriented and offer a greater variety of instruments to both borrowers
and savers.
6. The reforms required to achieve these longer-term goals will need to be phased over a number of
years, given the emerging nature of key financial institutions in the Kyrgyz Republic and the limited
implementation capacity of the country. Immediate reforms required to facilitate the deepening and
diversification of the financial system include: refining the enabling policy and regulatory environment;
resolving the problems engendered by the insolvency of the country's four largest commercial banks, the
most pressing of which is the poor quality of these bank's portfolios; enhancing and developing skills
in the banking sector and, more specifically, strengthening the regulatory and supervisory capabilities
within the NBK; and fostering development of nascent non-bank financial institutions. The growth and
viability of the financial system also depends heavily on the growth and viability of the real sectors. The
types of financial services and products needed by the real sectors, and the availability of bankable
opportunities in the economy as a whole, will largely determine the growth of financial services in the
future.
7.  A number of multilateral and bilateral organizations have already provided technical assistance in
several areas. These include: drafting banking and securities laws; preparing a new Chart of Accounts;
assistance to NBK in bank supervision, monetary analysis, and the reorganization of its Cash and Foreign
departments; assistance to commercial banks in accounting, operational policies and procedures, credit
investigation and appraisal, trade financing and the development of a credit reporting system; automation
of the clearing house; and "specialized" audits of the four largest commercial banks by international
auditors. While this partial assistance has been useful, a more coordinated and comprehensive approach
is required.
8.  The principal objectives of the Reform Program to be supported by the proposed FINSAC are: (i)
to improve the enabling policy and regulatory environment for the development of a sound, competitive
and market-oriented banking system, by eliminating policy-induced barriers to competition, efficiency and
profitability and by strengthening prudential laws and regulations, accounting and auditing, and payments
and settlements systems; (ii) to liquidate or restructure the four dominant insolvent specialized banks, and
assist with the establishment of a competitive and efficient private banking system which is both sound
and capable of providing a broader range of financial services to borrowers and savers; (iii) to help
collect part of the non-performing loans extended by these banks, and thus accelerate enterprise
restructuring or liquidation in the process; and, (iv) to promote the development and growth of emerging
non-bank financial institutions.
PART II. THE PROJECT
Project Objectives and Description
9. The objective of the Technical Assistance Program (TAP) is to facilitate the implementation of the
policy and institutional reforms envisaged under FINSAC by strengthening the capabilities of the key
financial and regulatory institutions, assisting in the establishment of new, temporary institutions that will
effect the restructuring/liquidation of major banks, extending the new accounting infrastructure, and
training bank personnel.
10. Implementation of the reform program envisaged under FINSAC would require massive technical
assistance from abroad as the local capacity for carrying out these reforms is limited due to lack of



- 3 -
exposure of the Kyrgyz authorities to a market oriented sector. Assistance available to the Kyrgyz
Republic from other donors is limited. Without IDA funding for the programs and activities not covered
by other donors, it would not be possible to transform the sector into a well-functioning and efficient
financial system capable of meeting the evolving requirements of a market-oriented economy. The main
institutions and areas which will receive technical assistance under the TAP are described below.
11. Proposed Technical Assistance. The proposed technical assistance program was designed after a
comprehensive review of the overall needs of the sector. It identifies key areas which are important for
this initial stage in the development of a healthy financial sector. The major areas requiring assistance
under the proposed TAP are described below.
Assistance to the National Bank of the Kyrgyz Republic
12. The National Bank of the Kyrgyz Republic has appropriately been the major beneficiary of recent
technical assistance from bilateral and international donors, but further strengthening in several areas is
needed. The following areas have been identified for additional assistance under the proposed FINSAC-
supported reform program.
(a)   Overall reform of the Financial Sector. The Chairman (Governor) of NBK needs the
services of a Senior Bank Adviser to: (i) assist with the implementation and coordination of the
FINSAC reform program, which is wide-ranging and would need expert monitoring of progress;
and (ii) advise NBK management on policy and operational issues, as they evolve during the course
of program implementation. Initially, the adviser will be funded by the Project Preparation Facility
to assist the Chairman in carrying out some preparatory work for the Financial Sector Reform
Project. When PPF funding for this assignment ends, this credit will provide the financing for its
continuation.
(b)   Bank Supervision. Although the Bank Supervision Department of NBK, given the short
period of its operation, is performing very well, its skills in both on-site examination and off-site
monitoring need to be further strengthened. While a US AID-funded adviser is presently assisting
the Department, it is important to provide the department with an adviser with extensive bank
examination experience for another 12-18 months, particularly to train on-site supervision staff on
the job, by guiding examiner teams through some actual examinations, and to monitor the problem
banks.
(c)   Implementation of the new chart of accounts. The new chart of accounts, consistent with
international practice, is about to be completed. Associated accounting rules and procedures are
being developed, along with software, to permit parallel runs between the old and new accounts.
NBK would need the services of two specialists to implement the new chart of accounts, prepare
new reporting formats and standards, manuals for practitioners, pilot tests and staff training. Similar
assistance would later be needed by all other banks. The NBK could make the services of these
specialists available to other banks, as needed.
(d)   Bank restructuring and liquidation. NBK needs the services of a bank adviser with
experience in branch systems to (i) complete the analysis of the branch network of the
Agroprombank which has been initiated by an international consulting firm and (ii) assist in the
rationalization, merger, and preparation for sale of selected branches of this bank. Later, the
consultant would advise NBK on branch rationalization issues in other banks, including Elbank.



-4 -
(e)   Payment and clearing systems. The current payment and clearing systems in the Kyrgyz
Republic are inefficient, cumbersome and inappropriate for a modem banking system. Both
immediate and long-term improvements are needed to reduce inter-enterprise arrears, facilitate
liquidity management, minimize the float in the system by requiring banks to maintain lesser
settlement reserves, promote cross-border flows, and instill confidence in the banking system. A
number of initiatives have been taken during the last few years, on an interim basis, to reform the
payment system. These include various studies performed by the IMF, EBRD, Bank of Japan, and
the Japanese International Cooperation Agency (JICA). Some of the refinements recommended in
these studies have been or are being introduced, while a large number still remain to be
implemented. The JICA-financed specialists have recomrmended both short-term improvements as
well as a detailed long-term feasibility and functionality study of the payment system. The total cost
estimates, including hardware and application software, however, are still the subject of discussion
between the Kyrgyz Government and the Japanese authorities, but it is understood that most of the
expertise and equipment, software etc. will be financed by the Japanese authorities.
(f)   Mortgage financing. At present, facilities for mortgage financing in the Kyrgyz Republic
are virtually non-existent. The NBK needs the services of a consultant to study the situation and
identify opportunities for creating mechanisms for mortgage financing.
(g)   Financial legislation. NBK also needs the services of a lawyer for a short period to assist
with the finalization of various financial legislation.
Bank Restructuring and Liquidation
13. Under the proposed reform program, Elbank and Agroprombank are slated for liquidation. NBK
has already applied to a court for Elbank's liquidation and is working out a scheme to pay off household
deposits. The position of Agroprombank is somewhat different. While it is also insolvent and will be
liquidated, it has a network of 52 branches, which in the past provided rural finance and otherwise acted
as Government agents for subsidy payments.  NBK and the government are keen that, before
Agroprombank's liquidation, a specialist in branch systems advise NBK on the rationalization and
disposition of its branch network with particular attention given to possibly using some of them to provide
services to rural communities.
14. Two other large banks, Promstroi Bank and AKB Kyrgyzstan Bank, which are also in financial
difficulties, are in the process of being recapitalized. They have been advised to increase capital from
"negative" to "positive", or at least to "zero" level by March 31, 1997. If they are unable to achieve
this, they will be liquidated. These banks urgently need an adviser to provide policy and operational
advice to management on credit policies, advice on financial restructuring and help to attract domestic
and/or foreign investors.
Debt Recovery and Resolution
15. As an integral part of the financial sector reform progran, the NBK has established Debt Resolution
Agency (DEBRA) as an agency under its control to act as receiver on its behalf, to take over, and to
dispose of the assets and liabilities of banks. It will also have a Debt Recovery Unit that will take title
and control of the non-performing loan portfolios of the insolvent banks with a view to seeking their
recovery and ultimate resolution. Initially, DEBRA will handle the liquidation of Agroprombank and
Elbank, but during its tenure it may be called upon to manage the liquidation of other banks which
encounter difficulties in the new market environment. DEBRA will need the services of two experts for
at least two years each for the following tasks: (i) to help organize DEBRA, establish its operating



procedures, and to manage the asset sales and liquidation process; and (ii) to coordinate work-out teams
and manage the recovery of outstanding balances in the non-performing loan portfolios of the intervened
banks.
Central Registry for Pledges
16. In order to implement the Law on Pledge which will be submitted to Parliament in 1996, a central
registry for pledges will be established within the Ministry of Justice. Eventually, this registry will be
extended to the district level to ensure national coverage. To aid the Ministry of Justice in this effort,
the provision of computer hardware, software and training is envisaged.
Training
17. Among the many challenges the Kyrgyz commercial banks face are the. switching over to modem
banking practices and methods and the upgrading of the skills of their staff. At present, technical skills
in most areas of modem banking either do not exist or are thinly distributed. The areas where skill
upgrading is most needed include, inter alia, strategic planning, credit analysis and risk management,
international trade finance, asset and liability management and the new legal environment which will
govern banking operations. Over the last four years, sporadic training efforts have been made by the
Kyrgyz banks by deputing their staff to foreign banks and to regional training centers in Almaty and
Tashkent. These arrangements are inadequate to meet the training needs of the nearly 4,000 commercial
bank staff in the country. There is a need for a Bankers' Training Institute in Bishkek to conduct courses
on a regular basis in various areas of interest to banks. Establishing an institute will require the
commitment of and regular funding from NBK and the commercial banks in the country. To start with,
technical assistance would be necessary to organize the Institute, develop curricula, establish a library,
provide equipment and teaching materials, and provide short-term consultants to run specialized courses
and train local trainers. The proposed institute would require the services of: (i) a commercial banker
experienced in training for about one year; (ii) short-term consultants to conduct courses over the next
two years; and (iii) two full-time teachers specialized in Business legislation of "Civil Code tradition"
countries, to provide training to lawyers in the new laws on corporation, banking, bankruptcy, pledge,
mortgages, etc.. To assist in the training of lawyers, a database containing a comprehensive collection
of all legal, official texts and major case law will be created. A principal objective of this database
system is to disseminate this information collection nationwide via a computer "station" network, with
hard copy back-ups available. Two legal publishers exist with the capability to provide this back-up.
Non-bank Financial Institutions (NBFIs)
18. While the State Agency for Securities has been given substantial responsibilities for regulating and
supervising capital markets and NBFIs, it still lacks adequate authority, technical capacity, personnel,
training facilities, equipment and budget. Under the reform program, SAS would be transformed into
the executive arm of the proposed Securities Commission, with adequate resources and authority for the
enforcement of securities law and regulations. In addition, the SAS would undertake supervisory
responsibility for investment funds, which are currently under the purview of the State Property Fund.
Under the proposed reform program, new laws on insurance companies and pension funds are envisaged.
With these developments, SAS will acquire considerable regulatory responsibilities for the execution of
which it needs to develop capability now. For these purposes, SAS will need: (a) an adviser to provide
guidance and training to enhance its implementation and enforcement capabilities; and (b) an adviser to
review existing pension fund schemes and to design new schemes for government consideration. The
Ministry of Finance, as the leading arm of the government responsible for non-bank financial institutions
(NBFIs), would need the services of: (a) two advisers, one to advise on the overall development of



-6 -
NBFIs, with special emphasis on the securities market, the other to provide guidance in developing a
market for insurance services; and (b) a lawyer to assist in the drafting of new legislation on insurance
and pension funds and to improve existing legislation on leasing.
Public Debt Instruments and Securities
19. In addition to assistance in developing NBFIs and capital markets, the government needs assistance
in developing its own capabilities in the areas of public debt instruments and government securities. The
credit will finance an adviser to the MOF who will provide advice, guidance and policy strategies for the
development and deepening of government debt instruments and securities in the Kyrgyz Republic.
Rural Finance
20. Draft legislation/regulations for the development of rural credit unions and cooperatives wil be
needed very soon. This would require the services of an experienced lawyer for the MOF/Ministry of
Agriculture.
Project Costs
21. The project is estimated to cost US$7.34 million, of which US$7.26 million would be in foreign
currency and the equivalent of US$0.08 million in local currency. Total project costs include those
associated with IDA, other donor financing, and local costs. Costs include the services of advisers,
consultants, equipment, software, support and counterpart staff, books and ancillary supplies. IDA and
other donor agencies would finance 100 percent of the foreign exchange costs. Local costs would be in
the form of support services and seconded staff and would be provided by the beneficiary agencies. The
Project Preparation Facility (PPF) of US$0.07 million would be re-financed under the proposed TA
project. Detailed project costs are provided as Attachment 1 in Annex I.
Financing Plan
22. Total project costs of US$7.34 million would be financed as follows: IDA US$3.4 million; other
donors (Japan, USAID, TACIS, Finland, ADB, and TICA) US$3.86 million; and local institutions and
government US$0.08 million. A detailed financing plan is provided as Attachment 2 in Annex I.
PART III. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION ARRANGEMENTS
Project Implementation
23. NBK has established a FINSAC Monitoring Unit (FMU) which will have responsibility for
monitoring implementation of policy reforms under FINSAC and for managing and administering the
TAP. This will be headed by a senior NBK official; the Senior Bank Adviser (SBA) to the Chairman
of NBK will work closely with this unit and, with authorization from the Chairman, will coordinate the
work of the various experts appointed under TAP and also other technical assistance activities in the
financial sector, and submit periodic progress reports to the Chairman and, through him, to IDA on
implementation of the Reform Program.



-7 -
Procurement
24. All procurement, within the framework of FINSAC TA Programn, will be carried out by FMU, but
disbursement of IDA funds will be administered through the PMU, already established in the Ministry
of Finance under the PESAC and utilized by APEAC operations. Procurement of all goods and services
would follow World Bank guidelines (Guidelines for Procurement under IBRD Loans and Credits,
published by the Bank in January 1995, and revised in January 1996). Selection of consultants for
Technical Assistance would follow World Bank guidelines (Use of Consultants by Bank Borrowers and
by the Bank as Executing Agency, August 1981). Most goods are expected to cost less than $100,000
and will be procured following International Shopping. Equipment expected to cost less than US$50,000
will be procured following local shopping. Equipment purchases are expected to include computers,
software, fax machines, phones, photocopiers and other office-related equipment. Consultants will be
selected from short-listed candidates acceptable to the Bank and based on review of qualifications and past
performance. All documents relating to selection of consultants will be subject to prior review of the
Bank. Preparatory activities financed under the PPF include assistance on agreed upon steps required
before Board Presentation, including advice on the initiation of bank liquidation and restructuring
procedures, the establishment of a debt resolution agency (DEBRA), and coordination and policy advice
to the Chairman of the NBK. The Summary of Proposed Procurement Arrangements is presented as
Attachment 3 in Annex I.
Disbursement
25. The disbursement of IDA funds will be administered through the Project Management Unit (PMU)
already established in the MOF under PESAC and utilized by the APEAC operations. It will monitor
and control the proposed use of IDA funds. The estimated schedule of disbursements is given in
Attachment 3 of Annex I. Disbursements are expected to be completed within four years from the date
of effectiveness.
26. The project would finance the following categories of expenditures:
Category           |   Amount          Percentage of Expenditures To Be
(US Dollars)                Financed
100% of foreign expenditures; 100% of
local expenditures (ex-factory cost) and
1. Goods                        1,529,000    95% of local expenditures for other items
procured locally.
2.  Consultants' Services       1,170,000     100%
3.  Refunding of Project         700000
Preparation Advance
[          TOTAL                 3,399,000
27. Special Account. To facilitate timely project implementation, the Borrower would establish,
maintain and operate, under conditions acceptable to the Bank, a Special Account in US dollars in a bank.



-8 -
During the early stage of the project, the initial allocation of the Special Account would be limited to
US$250,000. However, when the aggregate disbursement under the Credit has reached the level of SDR
1.0 million, the initial allocation may be increased up to the authorized allocation of US$500,000 by
submitting the relevant Application for Withdrawal. Replenishment applications should be submitted at
least every three months, and must include reconciled bank statements as well as other appropriate
supporting documents.
28. Statement of Expenditures (SOEs).  Disbursements would be made against Statement of
Expenditures for contracts for goods and services up to US$100,000 equivalent for which detailed
documents evidencing expenditures will be reviewed by the Project Management Unit (PMU) and made
available for the required audit as well as to Bank supervision missions. Disbursements against contracts
for goods and services exceeding US$100,000 equivalent would be made against normal documentation.
29. The project completion date would be June 30, 2001.
Project Accounting, Financial Reporting and Auditing
30. Accounting. The PMU would be responsible for the appropriate accounting of the funds provided
by IDA under the Credit, for reporting on the use of these funds and for ensuring timely submission of
audits of the financial statements or reports to IDA.
31. The PMU would establish an accounting system to provide information on the proper receipt and
use of funds furnished in accordance with the Credit Agreement. Accounting for all Special Account
transactions and all other project accounts will be maintained in accordance with practices and standards
satisfactory to the Association, with the objective of timely and accurate accounting of all transactions
under the Credit.
32. Financial Reporting. Financial reporting for the Credit would comprise a statement of receipts and
payments for the reporting period from the beginning of the program. Reporting would be in accordance
with disbursements classified and reported under the expenditure categories agreed to by the Borrower
and specified in the Credit Agreement. The PMU would submit quarterly progress reports. A Project
Completion Report would be submitted to the Association by the PMU promptly after the conclusion of
project activity, and in any event not later than 6 months after the Credit closing date.
33. Auditing. A condition of the Credit would be that the financial statements and reports on the
proceeds are audited in accordance with internationally accepted standards by independent auditors
acceptable to the Association.
PART IV. BENEFITS AND RISKS
Benefits
34. The project would provide financing for critically needed technical assistance to implement the
reforms in the financial sector as part of the Kyrgyz Republic's stabilization and structural adjustment
efforts. It would help the evolution of a healthy and efficient financial sector through refining the
enabling policy and regulatory environment, resolving the problems of the country's four financially-
troubled/insolvent commercial banks, developing and enhancing skills in the banking sector, and
strengthening the supervisory and regulatory capabilities of the central bank. While these reforms will
be phased over a number of years, their immediate impact would be the restoration of public confidence



- 9 -
in the system and a laying of the groundwork for an efficient system of resource mobilization and
allocation.
Risks
35. The major project risks relate to timely availability of well qualified and experienced technical
assistance personnel to launch the ambitious reform program, particularly within the budget allocations.
Another risk is the absorptive capacity of the concerned Kyrgyz institutions and the ability of the
counterparts to carry on the reform program after the expatriates have left. These concerns are mitigated
by the fact that the government is highly committed to carrying out structural and sectoral reforms and
IDA's experience of project implementation in the country has been very good.

help to draft any legal instruments which may improve the use of leasing; (ii) deal with issues related to
the finalization and implementation of the draft Law on Pledge, and especially the conception of the new

the development of private commercial banking activity); (iii) finalize and implement, from NBK's side,
a revised Banking Law and a revised Bankruptcy Law that are to be enacted under the support of the IDA
FINSAC project; and (iv) propose whatever other legal instruments may prove necessary to build a

KYRGYZ REPUBLIC
FINANCIAL SECTOR TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROJECT
SPEcIALLST IN NON-BANK FINANCIAL INsTrrITmoNs
INCLUDING INVESTMENT FUNDS
TO ADVISE THE MINSTRY OF FINANCE
TERMS OF REFERENCE
Background and Issues
1.           The development of the an efficient network of non-bank financial institutions, to work
together with an operating capital market sector, is an important and fundamental part of the Kyrgyz
government's program to achieve an efficient, sustainable and market-oriented financial sector. A key to
the transformation of the Kyrgyz economy will be the role of the NBFIs in their support of the
development of the capital markets as both a facilitator of the privatization process and as an investment
source for new securities. Currently the securities market is in an early stage of development, however,
it is envisioned that the supply of securities will increase rapidly in the near future and the NBFIs must
be developed as well if they are to be available as an important source of savings to absorb these new
issues.
2.           In mature market economies, a system of NBFI operations such as insurance companies,
pensions funds, and investment funds are able to mobilize large amounts of medium and long term
savings for investment. These companies, in both the public and private sectors, are commonly considered
to be contractual savings institutions which can greatly stimulate the capital markets in which they invest.
As the fledgling Kyrgyz capital markets begin to gain in both size and strength, the NBFIs will play an
increasingly important role. The existing investment funds, insurance companies and the evolving private
sector and government pension funds all require a high level of technical assistance to strengthen their
operations and enhance their development.
3 .          In the case of the Kyrgyz Republic the current uncertain legal status and poor operational
efficiencies of the NBFIs, as well as the weak regulatory environment in which the existing NBFIs
operate, will all require adjustment. It is envisioned that technical assistance will be needed to strengthen
the performance of each of the following NBFI type operations:
Investment Funds. There are currently some 17 different investment funds operating in the
Kyrgyz Republic, of which 4 account for over 85% of the total assets managed. The funds issue
shares to the public for cash, or in exchange for privatization coupons and use these coupons to
purchase shares directly in newly privatized enterprises. By mid-1995 however, the vast majority
of the coupons issued had not been invested and many of the funds are in a very poor financial
position; to the extent that their future operations are threatened. The fund's problems are a result
of a number of diverse factors, including but not limited to:
i.    the limited scope for attracting cash in exchange for shares;
ii.   the 25% limit on any fund's investment in any enterprise;
iii.    many cases of poor fund management, and;
iv.    a lack of prudential regulations and supervision;



- 33 -
v.     a shortage of investable savings in the economy.
Fund managers need training in accounting, asset/liability management, enterprise governance,
and basic management techniques. There is widespread evidence that these funds have been
paying dividends in excess of earned income, probably from the fear that investors will make a
run to sell their fund shares if their (often unrealistic) dividend expectations are not met.
Insurance Companies. The Kyrgyz republic's insurance sector has the potential for playing a
very major role in the financial markets, As the industry evolves away from its traditional, and
loss incurring, base of credit insurance and into the fields of property, accident, life and medical
policies; the potential for the accumulation of investable funds seems assured. However, it is
imperative that the industry shift its accounting systems towards internationally accepted practices.
Additional constraints to immediate financial market investment by insurance companies include
rapid changes in the nature and maturity of insurance company liabilities and the lack of
transparent market values of investments. The industry requires several fundamental adjustments
in the areas of accounting practices, prudential supervision, reserve requirements, transfer of
skills and technology from foreign insurers, and the easing of restrictive regulations regarding
limits on where companies can invest and where they must place their reserves.
Pension Funds. To date pension fund operations in the Kyrgyz Republic are marginal with only
two private funds offering services to private sector enterprises. A few of the large formerly
state-owned enterprises have formed internal pension fund schemes but they appear to be largely
underfunded, As yet the government employees funds are not managed on any coordinated or
centralized basis. There is a government managed social security system which requires
mandatory contributions from employees earning wages above a minimum level. The future
contribution of pension funds a savings contributors into the capital markets will depend on a
number of factors including:
i.     a change in public policy regarding pension funds;
ii.    the development of prudential regulations on pension funds;
iii.   new tax laws regarding investments by pension funds;
iv.    the degree to which mandatory pension funds become required;
v.    the development of a centralized public social security system, and;
vi.    new incentives to develop private pension fund operations versus individual
employer funds without regulation.
It is necessary at this stage of the development of pension funds to review the fundamental nature
and future of the pension fund system through technical assistance. The nest step would be the
development of coordinated policies, a new Law on Pension Funds, and the drafting of prudential
regulations on pension fund operations.
4.            The State Agency for Securities (SAS) is a small agency under the Ministry of Finance
with responsibilities for regulating and supervising capital markets and the NBFIs. Currently this agency
is incapable of undertaking its assigned tasks due to shortages in personnel, facilities, training, budget,
and adequate authority. It is envisioned that this agency will become a focal point for capital market and
NBFI development and that these shortcomings will be corrected. The SAS should be upgraded through
the creation of an inter-Ministry Board of Directors and eventually evolve into a permanent Securities
Commission with both regulatory and enforcement powers over the capital markets and the NBFIs.



- 34 -
Objectives
5.            The Ministry of Finance will be responsible for the development of the NBFIs, the design
