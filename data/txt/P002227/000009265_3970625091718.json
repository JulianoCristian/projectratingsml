investment/planning process by financing sector/subsector\n            studies and feasibility studies for development projects. It\n            seeks to help the Government (i) better define its\n            development objectives and determine appropriate strategies\n            to achieve them; (ii) continue to improve the quality of\n            projects submitted for outside financing; and (iii)\n            strengthen local project preparation capabilities. To this\n            end, the project consists of (a) assistance to carry out\n            sectoral and preinvestment studies; (b) training of selected\n            staff in (i) the preparation, implementation and monitoring\n            of a rolling Public Investment Program and (ii) project\n            preparation and appraisal; (c) completion of the\n            installation of a Documentation Center; and (d) logistical\n            support related to the above. The project will result in\n            preparation of sector strategies, production of a portfolio\n            of well prepared projects ready for submission to financing\n            sources and avoidance of unviable investments."}, "docdt": "1987-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
