Project for Africa is to\n            increase the knowledge in the Nile Basin on agricultural\n            issues for support of economically viable agriculture that\n            uses basin water resources in a sustainable and efficient\n            manner. Some of the negative impacts and their mitigation\n            measures are as follows: 1) the conservation of natural\n            habitat is essential for long-term sustainable development.\n            The Bank supports, and expects borrowers to apply, a\n            precautionary approach to natural resources management to\n            ensure opportunities for environmentally sustainable\n            development; 2) pests are controlled through integrated pest\n            management (IPM) approaches, such as biological control,\n            cultural practices, and the development and use of crop\n            varieties resistant or tolerant to the pest. The Bank may\n            finance the purchase of pesticides when their use is\n            justified under an IPM approach; 3) the Bank supports the\n            preservation of cultural properties which includes sites\n            with archaeological, paleontological, historical, religious\n            or unique natural values. It seeks to avoid impacts on such\n            sites; and 4) Bank financed new dams must be designed and\n            built under the supervision of competent professionals. Dams\n            over 15m in height are of concern particularly if there is a\n            large flood handling requirement or the dam is in a zone of\n            high seismicity and/or where foundations and other design\n            features are complex."}, "docdt": "2009-08-21T00:00:00Z"}
