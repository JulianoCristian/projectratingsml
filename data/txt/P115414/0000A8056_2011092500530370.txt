                         A mid-term review was conducted in July 2011. That mission found that RATP is on track for completed all expected outputs prior to the projects October 2012 closing date; however,
                         the mission also noted that RATP and NELSAP Management must keep a firm handle on project delivery to ensure timely delivery as an extension of the closing date is not possible.
