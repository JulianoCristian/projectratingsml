                         NELSAP Regional Agricultural Trade and Productivity Project (RATP) is a regional technical assistance grant to the Nile Basin Initiative (NBI) Nile Equatorial Lakes Subsidiary Action
                         Program (NELSAP). The RATP has procured all major studies to be accomplished under the project and they are at various stages of implementation.

                         An implementation review mission was conducted in June 2012. That mission found that RATP is on track for completing all expected outputs before the planned October 2012
                         closing date. NELSAP and the NBI have requested a two month extension for the project closing date to December 31, 2012 in order to fully disseminate project outputs (the
                         Agricultural Model will only be delivered in October 2012). Both the mission and the Bank's Nile Team endorse this proposal.
