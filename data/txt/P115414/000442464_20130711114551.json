Some lessons learned included: for regional\n            projects that require intensive engagement of the Bank team\n            with a large number of diverse stakeholders from different\n            countries, it is crucially important to ensure continuity\n            during the transition from preparation to project\n            implementation. Failure to do so may result in negative\n            effects on the implementation readiness conditions and rapid\n            project take-off due to possible loss of institutional\n            memory and working relationships between the Bank and the\n            client, which are crucial for the efficient implementation\n            of such operations. The project design should include a\n            well-articulated exit strategy, additional time and\n            resources to ensure uptake and sustainable use of the\n            development outcomes. This is particularly important in a\n            project with significant technical component like the\n            agricultural model and Decision Support System (DSS), as\n            these require not only time for design and implementation,\n            but also user training and modification based on real-world\n            use. Both the Bank and the client countries will greatly\n            benefit from a clear strategy and firm institutional\n            arrangements to: (a) integrate regional projects into\n            country partnership strategies of the countries of the\n            region; (b) ensure linkages between the regional projects\n            and country specific projects funded by the Bank during\n            planning and implementation; (c) provide cross support from\n            Bank's various sector management units for the design\n            and implementation supervision of multi sectoral Technical\n            Assistance (TA) projects; and (d) ensure uptake and\n            integrate knowledge produced by the regional TA projects in\n            the design and implementation supervision of country\n            specific operations, led by the same Sector Management Units\n            (SMU) or other SMUs. This is a strategic management issue\n            for the Bank. This project has demonstrated the merits and\n            benefits of engaging major private sector stakeholders in\n            generating and adopting knowledge and tools that would\n            influence water resources planning and management in a river\n            basin context. It also has demonstrated the use of the\n            concept of virtual water in understanding social and\n            economic implications of allocation of basin water for\n            agriculture and agriculture trade across the basin."}, "docdt": "2013-06-27T00:00:00Z"}
