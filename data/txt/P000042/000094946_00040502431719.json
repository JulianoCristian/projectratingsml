However, sustainability seems unlikely, for it\n            depends on solving two basic conditions - the ongoing war,\n            and macroeconomic imbalances - to allow increased budget\n            allocations for the education sector. Lessons drawn form the\n            project, re-enforce that basic levels of quality education\n            systems will be sustained, as long as Government assures a\n            minimum allocation for education expenditures. Nonetheless,\n            sound decisions were taken by the Government to create\n            motivated teamwork, such as making the Ministry of\n            Education's Department of Planning, responsible for the\n            implementation of the project, creating a sense of\n            ownership, even under stressful circumstances. Furthermore,\n            the government negotiated with the teacher's union, a\n            policy to attract, and retain qualified educational staff,\n            though unfortunately, this policy needs to be enforced, and,\n            the role of the National Institute for Educational Research\n            and Development, in the production of learning materials,\n            needs to be revisited, allowing instead, the efficacy of\n            experienced teachers, in adapting foreign learning\n            materials. Given the country's weak institutional\n            capacity, the two-way demonstration model, targeting quality\n            improvement, and accessibility, was reasonable in that\n            experience was gained by implementation of the model itself."}, "docdt": "2000-03-16T00:00:00Z"}
