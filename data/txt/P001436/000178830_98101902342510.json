{"cdata!": "The Petroleum Exploration Project aims\n            at attracting oil companies to take oil exploration permits\n            in Liberia, where no exploration has taken place since 1972.\n            Studies conducted recently have concluded that\n            Liberia's petroleum potential remains to be\n            established; both seismic studies and the analysis of the\n            samples of the four wells that were drilled indicate the\n            possibility of finding hydrocarbons. The project consists\n            of: (i) a new seismic survey of Liberia's offshore, the\n            computer processing, interpretation and integration of the\n            new data; (ii) consulting services for the promotion,\n            auction and negotiation of new exploration permits; (iii)\n            technical assistance for energy planning; and (iv) technical\n            assistance to the Bureau of Hydrocarbon of the Ministry of\n            Lands and Mines. The project does not face any major risks.\n            The financial exposure of the Government is likely to be\n            greatly diminished through the sale of a report on\n            Liberia's offshore prospects to oil companies. There is\n            already a significant industry interest in the report."}, "docdt": "1980-09-30T00:00:00Z"}
