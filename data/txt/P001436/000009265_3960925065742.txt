PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
LI3ERIA
Petroleum Exploration Promotion Proiect (Loan 1907-LBR)
and Petroleum Sector Technical Assistance (Credit 1580-LBR)
PREFACE
On October 7, 1980, the Board approved a US$5,000,000 loan (Loan
1907-LBR) to finance a petroleum exploration promotion project, aimed
mainly at evaluating the hydrocarbon potential of the Liberian Sedimentary
Basins. The project was satisfactorily implemented, since it resulted in
two petroleum exploration contracts, under which the o4l company Amoco
drilled three exploration wells. However, approximately one-third of the
available acreage remained unleased. The Government requested a
continuation of IDA assistance in its promotional efforts to attract
experienced companies to carry out exploration of this acreage. The Bank
agreed to this request, and on April 11, 1985, the Board approved to that
effect a SDR 2.7 million credit (Credit 1580-LBR). In addition to the
assistance in further promotional efforts, the project included the funding
of a study of (i) the Liberian Petroleum Refining Company (LPRC)
reorganization and (ii) the supply, storage and distribution sector. This
second project did not meet all its objectives, since on June 1, 1987, it
was abandoned, due to the Government's arrears on debt service payments to
the Bank. This project completion report covers both Loan 1907 and Credit
1580. The closing date of Ln. 1907 was extended for four successive
periods up to June 30, 1987. It was almost fully disbursed. Ar
undisbursed balance of US$95,800 was cancelled. An amount of US$997,477
had been disbursed under the Credit-1580, when all disbursements under Bank
projects in Liberia were suspended. In August 1988, the Bank cancelled the
US$2,525,993.12 remaining under the credit.
This Project Completion Report was prepared by the Africa
Technical Department, Industry and Energy Division (APTIE), and was based
on information obtained during supervision and from the appraisal,
President's and supervision reports, as well as other documents in the
Project files. The Borrower submitted a final Completion Report containing
its views on the project implementation and supplied additional data for
the Project Completion Report.
This PCR was read by the Operations Evaluation Department (OED).
The draft PCR was sent to the Borrower on July 28, 1989, for comments by
September 15, 1989, but none were received.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
LIBERIA
Petroleum Exploration Promotion Project (Loan 1907-LBR)
and Petroleum Sector Technical Assistance (Credit 1580-LBR)
HIGHLIGHTS
Background
i.       Well-endowed in forestry resources, disposing of an installed
hydroelectric capacity of 68 MW, with a further underdeveloped potential of
750 MW, the Republic of Liberia has no hydrocarbon production of its own.
Oil imports account for 202 of total imports.
ii.      Within the frame of the conventional concession regime of the 1969
Petroleum Act, four oil companies carried out offshore exploration
operations including seismic surveys and the drilling of four wells.
Although the results were negative, there was some indication that
commercial oil could 1.  discovered in this basin.
Project Preparation
iii.     The Government was anxious to rekindle petroleum exploration
activities in the country and requested the assistance of the Bank to that
effect. Having verified that this assistance would be within the scope of
its operation in the country, the Bank agreed to this request. The Loan
Agreement under review became effective on January 9, 1981, for an amount
of US$5 million. The implementing agency was the Ministry of Lands, Mines
and Energy (MLME).
iv.      The components of the project were:
(i) the shooting of a 2500 km marine seismic survey;
(ii) preparing a geological evaluation for the report geared at the
promotion of exploration offshore by oil companies;
(iii) assistance in energy planning; and
(iv) training and equipment for MLME.
During the third extension period of the project, the Bank agreed
with the MLME, that the US$76,000 remaining under the loan would be



vii
utilized to participate to the funding of a pre-fabricated office and
storage building.
Project Implementation
Promotion
v.       Based on competitive bids, the contract for the seismic survey was
awarded to the Compagnie Generale de Geophysique (C.G.G.) of France, which
carried out the seismic survey in 1981. Jean Claude Ferrand and Associates
(JCF), selected out a list of six consulting companies to prepare the
promotion, incorporated the seismic results into a geological study of
Liberian offshore sedimentary basins, which was presented to the oil
industry during seminars held in March/April 1982. Concurrently, the firm
Duncan, Allen and Mitchell, of the U.S., had revised the petroleum
legislation, with the introduction of a production sharing regime, with the
government's share escalating with contractor's rate of return.
vi.      As a result of the seminars, Amoco signed successively two
petroleum exploration agreements with the Government, which was assisted in
this negotiation by the firm Mac Lachlan of the U.S. Amoco shot an
extensive seismic survey and drilled three wells. No oil was discovered.
However, oil shows, good reservoirs, and source-rocks identified through
these wells, indicate the possible existence of hydrocarbon accumulation.
vii.     The company Atlantic Resources Limited (ARL) selected out of a
list of three consulting companies, assisted the Government in monitoring
Amoco's activities.
viii.    The possible existence of commercial oil in the free acreage led
IDA to agree to the Government's request to finance a new petroleum
exploration project with an IDA credit. The corresponding credit agreement
was approved on April 11, 1985 (Cr 1580-LBR), and became effective on
January 17, 1986.
ix.      The main objectives of this second energy project (Petroleum
Sector Technical Assistance) was the promotion of free acreage for
exploration, including acquisition of about 1000 km of new seismic data.
However, the appraisal mission had found other serious problems in the
sector, e.g. Liberia's refinery had by that time been shut in through
shortage of working capital and certain technical problems. Supply of
petroleum products was being assured by the refining company (L.P.R.C.),
which had little experience in procurement. L.P.R.C. inexperience in
petroleum products procurement, together with other management practices,
led to an annual loss for the Government which was estimated by the Bank to
be at least US$13 million a year. A study of the reorganization of the
petroleum products supply, storage and distribution was therefore included
in the project.



viii
X.       Atlantic Resources Ltd. (ARL) assisted the Government in selecting
the geophysical contractor to carry out the seismic survey on a speculative
basis. As a result of an evaluation of the proposals received from three
companies, the contract was awarded to Digicon. The company agreed to
finance 702 of the cost of the survey. The survey was carried out, with
the acquisition of 1040 km of seismic lines, in the fall of 1984, i.e.,
before the credit was signed.
xi.      ARL updated the geological study of the Liberian offshore basins,
as prepared by J.C.F., through the incorporation in the report of the
results of the exploration program carried out by Amoco. This revised
geological study was presented to the oil industry 'n Barcarena, Portugal,
on November 7-8, 1985. The promotional presentation did not meet a big
success. Only six oil companies attended the meeting. No report was sold,
and no petroleum exploration proposal was presented.
xii.     In 1986, Amoco relinquished most of their acreage at the closing
date of their contract. They obtained from the Government a 3-year
extension of the contract, for one block, with no technical commitments.
Under the terms of the extension, the company is paying a rental to the
Government.
xiii.    Comments on the implementation of the projects:
A.  Both projects were interrupted twice due to uncleared arrears to
the Bank, for 10 and 9 months respectively (February to October,
1985 and February to September 1986). Eventually, as the
Government remained delinquent on its debt service to the Bank,
all loans and credits to Liberia were suspended on June 1, 1987,
and have yet to be Leinstated.
B.  These suspensions of disbursements affected mainly the second
petroleum project (credit 1580-LBR). While the hydrocarbon
exploration component of the project was implemented, at least
partially, owing to the willingness of Digicon and ARL to carry
out their work at their own risk during the disbursements
suspension periods, no progress was registered regarding LPRC
mismanagement, in spite of the Bank's insistence, with a resulting
high cost to the Government in terms of foregone revenues, and to
the economy as a whole in terms of exercise cost of petroleum
products.
C.  Four one-year extensions were granted by the Bank to the Loan
1907-LBR, on the following grounds: (a) necessary monitoring of
oil companies' activities which extended to 1986; (b) as ML14E had
initially concentrated its effort towards getting the technical
and legal work off the ground, the training program was only
carried out from 1984 to 1987; and (c) the procurement of the new



ix
building for MLME took longer than anticipated, and in spite of
these four extensions, the procurement of the building was not yet
completed when the disbursements under both projects were
definitely suspended.
D.  Following the success of the first promotional seminars, in 1982,
J.C. Ferrand was substituted by another exploration consultant
company, Atlantic Resource, Limited (A.R.L.), of Portugal; this
substitution was (i) probably premature and (ii) carried out in a
way which raised doubt on the procedure followed, and, possibly on
the Bank's procurement supervision. In retrospect, the change
from J.C. Ferrand to A.R.L. has been detrimental to the overall
success of the project.
E. Judging from the history of the projects under review, it would
have been advisable, at the outset of the first project, to hire
an experienced resident exploration advisor, independent from the
consulting firms involved in the implementation of the projects.
Such a resident advisor could have fruitfully assisted the MLME in
supervising the work of both exploration consultants JCF and ARL,
and in hiring the successor to JCF at the appropriate moment,
under acceptable procedures.



PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
LIBERIA
Petroleum Exploration Promotion Project (Loan 1907-LBR)
and Petroleum Sector Tecbnical Assistance (Credit 1580-LBR)
I. INTRODUCTION
A. Background
With a population of about 1.7 million, average per capita GNP in
Liberia in 1979 was estimated at US$500. This average value conceals the
high disparity between the traditional agriculture (per capita GNP of about
US$160 per annum) and the modern sector consisting mainly of (i) iron-ore
mines, (ii) rubber plantations, and (iii) forestry concessions (per capita
GNP of about US$1,620 per annum).
The objectives of Bank Group operations in Liberia are: (i) to
help Liberians develop their own resources, (ii) to support policies and
programs leading to a broader distribution of the benefits of economic
growth, (iii) to help the Government in broadening the economic base and in
overcoming infrastructure constraints to growth, and (iv) to assist the
Government in mobilizing development resources from other external
agencies.
Within the frame of this policy, the Bank Group had made, at the
start of the project under review, 19 loans for projects in Liberia
totalling US$130.7 million and has granted eight IDA credit totalling US$44
million. The Bank Group's assistance had been for roads, agriculture,
rural development, power, education, water supply and ports, but had never
addressed hydrocarbon-related issues.
The only significant indigeneous energy resource in Liberia is
hydro-electric power. Installed hydroelectric capacity amounts to 68 MW,
or about 24? of the total generating capacity in Liberia. Ultimate
hydroelectric generation potential was estimated at 750 MW.
Liberia is also well-endowed in forestry resources since about
half of the land is covered by forests. Wood and charcoal are therefore
important sources of energy, both in urban and rural areas, although no
data had so far been gathered on quantities used.
B. Petroleum Sector
Until 1982, petroleum products were produced at the Government's
refinery in Monrovia under the management of its wholly-owned Liberian



-2-
Petroleum Refining Company (LPRC). The refinery was closed at the
beginning of 1983, because of shortages of working capital. As a result of
certain operating problems, the LPRC remains in charge of the supply and
storage of the 11,000 barrels of petroleum products per day currently
needed by the country. All upstream activities come under the Bureau of
Hydrocarbons of the Ministry of Lands and Mines.
Almost all of the sedimentary basins of Liberia are located
offshore. Exploration activities carried out in this area during the 19609
sixties and early 1970s by Union Carbide, Chevron, Frontier and Syracuse
Oil, Ltd., confirmed the presence of a thick sedimentary section offshore.
Certain positive elements have been established, such as existence of
structural and stratigraphic traps, the presence of reservoir sands,
together with suitably mature source rocks. Following their disappointing
results, the companies concluded in 1972 that only subcommercial fields
were likely to exist in Liberia. Petroleum activities in the country were
governed by the 1969 Petroleum Act, which set up a concession regime
(royalty at 12.5Z and an income tax rate at 50Z), not in line with current
practices.
C. Proiect's Genesis
Several companies had expressed interest in taking exploration
permits in Liberia, without offering attractive conditions. As a result,
the Government approached the Bank in early 1978 to request assistance in
attracting foreign investments in petroleum exploration at conditions
favourable to the country including exploration drilling commitments.
Following the Bank's agreement, a petroleum exploration promotion project
was prepared and approved by the Board on October 7, 1980. Such a project
was consistent with the Bank's first objective in Liberia to assist
Liberians in developing their own resources.
The total amount of the credit was US$6 million, out of which
US$5 million was to be financed by IDA, and US$1 million by the Government
of Liberia.
The project was geared to reinterpreting and reprocessing the
results of past exploration to assess the presence of previously undetected
exploration conceptual plays, and present these results to oil companies.
It included a 2,500 KM seismic survey, where prospects appeared likely but
insufficient data were available. The Bureau of Hydrocarbons was to be
provided technical assistance for energy planning, training and equipment.
Three successive PPF advances, granted respectively on June 1,
1979, February 14, 1980, and July 18, 1980 respesctively, totaled to
US$900,000 and, paved the way to the project. The work program, carried
out by an exploration consultant, was developed logically, without
discontinuity from the outset of the first advance until the termination of
the consultant contract in May 1988. Consequently, this audit of the
project need not differentiate between the work implemented under the PPF
from that done during the credit itself.

II. PROJECT IMPLEEMETATION
A. Petroleum Exploration Promotion
1.       If the general opinion of the oil industry that only subcommercial
oil fields were likely to exist in Liberia was to be proven incorrect, and
the presence of commercially exploitable reserves was to be estaiblished, it
was necessary to develop a new understanding of the processes w'nich could
have led to commercial oil accumulation in the deep water as well as on the
shelf. In order to reach this objective, and upon a call for bids sent to
six companies, the MLME contracted the firm J.C. Ferrand, (J.C.F.] of
Houston. The work-program of J.C.F. included (i) retrieval from the oil
companies of all Liberian Petroleum Exploration Data, (ii) assistance to
the Ministry in the implementation of a new seismic survey, (iii)
definition of the exploration methods necessary to enhance and supplement
the existing data, and assistance to MLME in carrying out the recommended
special studies (iv) preparation of a geological report, integrating all
available data, and including the outline of the exploration plays existing
in Liberian Sedimentary Basins, and (v) presentation of this report to the
oil industry during promotional seminars.
2.       JCF concentrated its efforts initially on retrieving from the oil
companies (Union Carbide, Chevron, Frontier, and Syracuse Oil Ltd.) the
data available from the earlier surveys (seismic data and four exploration
wells), including magnetic tapes of seismic data, together with well
samples. This exercise, carried out after a seven-year interruption of oil
company exploration activities in Liberia, required a considerable amount
of effort and time. Eventually, all existing data were recovered.
3.       The seismic survey included in the project was geared to (i)
completion of the investigation on the shelf, so that no significant area
of interest be left undetected; (ii) to better define the main prospective
areas; and (iii) integrate the surveys previously carried out. J.C.F.
assisted the Ministry in the implementation of the seismic survey. Upon a
call for bids to ten geophysical companies, the Compagnie Generale de
Geophysique (C.G.G.), of France was selected to carry out this survey,
which was successfully completed in May 1981. The total program covered
approximately 2,500 kilometers of lines. The acquired data were processed
by C.G.G., and interpreted by J.C.F.
4.       Having evaluated the exploration data recovered from oil
companies, J.C.F. set up a program of special studies, to assess the
hydrocarbon potential. The Ministry and IDA agreed on the proposed work
program. JCF subcontracted, through direct negotiation, the following
studies to outside experts:
(a) A landsat imagery study, with digital enhancement of the data,
aimed at determining whether the major alignments and fracture
zones detected on the basement geological map, could be projected
into the offshore. This study was carried out by Aeroservice, of
Houston, Texas.



-4-
(b) Behrendt and Waterson, of the U.S., were commissioned to Implement
a detailed analysis of electrical logs in the four wells, to
detect possible prospective zones, define sand-shales unit, and
identify synthetic seismogram. The results were useful in (i)
assessing petroleum geology parameters such as reservoirs porosity
and fluid contents, and seals; and ('i) tying seismic
interpretation to well data.
(c) Robertson Research was appointed to perform the following studies:
(1)   Geochemical analyses of well samples to assess the
potential of the Jurassic and the Cretaceous. A poor
hydrocarbon potential was found for the Jurassic, while the
Cretaceous displayed a very good potential.
(ii)   Biostratigraphy and Paleoenvironmental studies were needed
because of conflicting evidence in the data concerning the
age of certain formations in the offshore wells and the
onshore outcrops. The results improved the reliability of
the stratigraphic scale without resolving all the issues.
Ciii) Laboratory analyses of selected cores and samples from
certain wells for petrographic information of certain
formations. The results were usefully integrated with
electrical logs analyses.
Cd)  GSI was commissioned to carry out sophisticated reprocessing of
selected lines involving velocity analyses, filtering and
migration process. The seismic sections were significantly
improved, which resulted in the better resolution of key seismic
horizons and intervals.
(e)  A specific reprocessing displaying the acoustic impedance was
carried out by CGG through their patented VFLOG process. It was
hoped that this type of reprocessing would provide information
regarding the facies change between points of well control. The
results are unreliable due to (i) the overall quality of seismic
data and (ii) lack of well ties.
5.       Most of the special studies recommended by J.C.F., and implemented
under their supervision, were very useful in enhancing the quality of the
exploration data. However, a few of these studies were not strictly
necessary. (i) Given the fairly advanced technical knowledge of the area
at the time, a landsat study, aimed at determining the possible projection
of alignments detected on the basement map into the offshore, was mainly of
an academic interest. (ii) The factors which resulted in the poor results
of the acoustic impedance reprocessing were known from the start.
6.       J.C.F. integrated all available data, including the results of the
special studies, in to a geological regional report. This report is
excellent. Its scientific bases and its format meet the expectations of



the oil companies. In particular, the conceptual plays are presented, on
standard forms, in a manner readily utilizable by oil companies.
B. Petroleum Legislation
7.       A modern petroleum law was prepared by the law firm of Duncan,
Allen and Mitchell (D.A.M.) of the United States. JCF and DAM prepared a
model contract based on the new law.
8.       The principal features of the model contract are as followst for
the shelf area, the initial exploration period will not exceed three years,
with a possibility for two further periods of two years each. For deep
water areas, the initial exploration period shall not exceed four years,
and subsequent periods, three years. 30Z of the license area will be
relinquished at the end of the initial and of the second exploration
periods.
9.       The fiscal regime includes a 12.5Z royalty, an oil-sharing
arrangement, with Government's share escalating with contractor's pre-tax
rate of return, with a 30? limit, and a 50 income tax on the contractor's
share. The income tax is structured to satisfy U.S. requirements on
foreign tax credits. The model contract allows all of the production, net
of the Government's royalties, to be allocated to the recovery of
exploration and development costs. During the production period, the
contractor shall be free to export and dispose of hydrocarbons owned by
him.
10.      This petroleum legislation and the model contracts were fully
satisfactory for the early 1980s. They should now be adjusted, however, in
view of the changed conditons of today's market. The following
enhancements are recommended: (i) tightening of the accounting procedure,
which is inadequate for a contract based on the companies' rate of return;
(ii) no financial commitments should be associated with technical
obligations; (iii) the maximum Government share should be reduced to 15? or
20?, and the reimbursement to the contractor for the Government's carried
share should bear interest; (iv) the production license should be more.
clearly defined; and (v) the final say on exploration program and budget
should be clearly left to the company, with adequate safeguard against
unreasonable behavior of the operator.
11.      The block strategy was conceived to create an even distribution of
the potential of the offshore area, taking into consideration shelf, rise,
scope, and deep water. This arrangement included 5 shelf blocks and 4 deep
water blocks, each block including a well defined prospective area.
C. Promotional Seminars
12.      The JCF regional study, and the prepared petroleum legislation
were presented to oil companies during petroleum exploration seminars held
respectively in Monrovia and Houston on March 31, and April 21, 1982.
About 100 persons, representing 39 oil companies, attended the seminars.
The following companies bought part or all of the promotional documents:



-6 -
Price paid in USS
AGIP                              350.000
AMOCO                             350,000
CHEVRON                            50,000
MARATHON                          100.000
ELF                                50,000
This US$900,000 Government revenue was deposited in a New York
Bank account.
D. Activities of Oil Companies
13.      As a result of the promotion, the oil company Amoco entered into a
petroleumlexploration/production contract, signed on April 19, 1983,
concerning the four blocks Hl, S1, H4 and S3 (see map attached as Annex 1).
The agreement called for Amoco to shoot about 3,500 km of seismic lines and
drill at least two wells. On October 4, 1984, Amoco completed their
acreage with a second petroleum exploration/production contract, covering
the blocks H3 and S2, with the further commitnent to drill two wells.
During the negotiations with Amoco, the Ministry was assisted by the firm
Mac Lachlan Inc., of the United States, and, for all exploration issues, by
J.C.F.
14.      The project has thus been successful.  After the JCF contract
expired on May 31, 1983, the Ministry decided to bid for a new exploration
consulting firm, to assist it ir. completing the project (monitoring of
Amoco's work program, training and procurement of equipment). Upon a call
for bids sent to three companies, Petroconsultants S.A., of Switzerland,
Cambrian, of the United States, and Atlantic Resources, of Portugal, the
later company was awarded the contract.
15.      Amoco implemented most of their contractual work program.  In
1983, a 5,000 km seismic survey was shot. In 198411985, Amoco drillpa the
three following exploration wells:
Well Slll was spudded on October 22, 1984, and abandoned as a dry
hole at a total depth of 13,575 fteet. Good quality reservoirs
were found in the marine top section of the Lower Cretaceous and
source potential were good in the Cretaceous.
Well S311 was spudded on January 8, 1985, and abandoned dry, at a
total depth of 9,972 feet. A thin (4 ft.) oil bearing portion was
found in the Upper Cretaceous.
Well H3/1 was spudded on October 3, 1985, and abandoned dry at the
total depth of 9,889 feet. Traces of oil in noncommercial
quantities were observed in the Lower Cretaceous.



-7-
E. Second Petroleum Proiect
16.      The results obtained led Amoco to conclude that, regarding the
lead they had been exploring, although source-rocks, reservoirs and seals
are abundant and of good quality, there had been an improper timing between
hydrocarbon expulsion and trap creation. Amoco requested the Government to
be exempted from the drilling of the fourth contractual well. On June 19,
1986, the Government granted to the company, a three year extension, for
one block only, and with no commitments other than rentas payments.
17.      In the meantime, as early as 1983, while Amoco was still holding
approximately two-thirds of the Liberian Sedimentary Basins, the Government
requested the Association to grant a credit, aiming at promoting to the oil
industry the remaining free portion of the basins. The Bank agreed to this
request, and an IDA mission visited Monrovia on the week August 14 to 17,
1989 to appraise this second petroleum project.
18.      The Government's exploration consultants had concluded that the
conceptual plays existing in the Amoco blocks should also exist in the free
acreage. They had also recommended to acquire new seismic data
[approximately 800 km of lines] in blocks H5 and S4, and to reprocess
previously acquired seismic data on block H2 using newer techniques.
19.      Furthermore, the appraisal mission identified the needs of the
Liberian Petroleum Refining Company [LPRC] for assistance. Since the
refinery was closed at the beginning of 1983, LPRC had been in charge of
petroleum products procurement. LPRC staff had little experience in this
field, however, and frequently procured items at a price above the market
price and on an untimely basis. This weakness, together with other
mismanagement practices, led to substantial additional and avoidable cost
burden to the Government and to the economy as a whole, which the mission
evaluated at approximately US$13 million. To address this issue, the
mission recommended that the proposed project would include a study of the
petroleum products supply and storage problems.
20.      The objectives of this second project addressing petroleum issues
were defined in accordance with the above-mentioned findings and
recommendations. They included:
(a)     Institutional support to MLME;
(b)     Promotion of free offshore acreage for petroleum exploration
purposes, including acquisition of about 1,000 km of new
seismic data;
(c)     Promotion of onshore sedimentary basins, including gravity
survey and geochemical analyses; and
(d)    A study to determine means of participation by the private
sector in the procurement and supply of petroleum products in
Liberia, and feasibility studies for the storage of petroleum
products.



- 8 -
21.   The new Credit, denominated "Petroleum Sector Technical Assistance
(Cr 1580-LBR) was approved by the Board on April 9, 1985, for an amount of
SDR 2.7 million. Due to a suspension of disbursements which lasted until
October 1, 1985, the Credit was only declared effective on January 17,
1986.
F. Digicon Seismic Survey
22.   As a result of consultations held with three seismic companies, the
MLME commissioned the geophysical company Digicon to carry out the seismic
survey. This selection was based on (i) cost considerations, (ii)
availability of the seismic vessel; (iii) harmonization with Amoco seismic
data which had been acquired by the same contractor; and (iv) Digicon's
acceptance to enter in a semi-speculative survey contract, according to
which the company would bear 70? of the cost, with the understanding that
it would recoup its participation from the revenues to be derived from the
sale of acquired data to oil companies. The seismic survey included 1,040
km of lines. Acquired data were processed by Digicon.
23.   ARL was retained by the Ministry as its exploration consultants.  ARL
initially concentrated its efforts in interpreting the newly acquired
seismic data. Next, it integrated into a new geological report, (i) the
J.C.F. Report, (ii) geological conclusions drawn from Amoco's seismic
surveys exploration wells and (iii) their own interpretation of seismic
data acquired by Digicon.
G. Amoco Position Regarding a New Promotion
24.   Amoco had previously expressed their anxiety that the central
offshore in Liberia should not remain open while Amoco was planning to
drill. At that time they were trying to put together a group that would
negotiate a contract over this central area, with the understanding that
they would be a non-operator minority partner. When they learned about the
Ministry's intentions to promote the free acreage to the oil industry, they
proposed to cooperate with the Ministry's efforts, which the Ministry
accepted. Unfortunately, Amoco did not have any success in this exercise.
25.   Upon a suggestion presented by IDA, the block strategy was modified.
According to the new design, the blocks were of an approximately equal
acreage, the limits between them are trending perpendicular to the coasw
line, and each block offers a whole set of water depth and conceptual
plays.
H. Exploration Consultant's Work Program
26.   After updating the hydrocarbon potential evaluation, ARL prepared a
Geological Synthesis Report. A provisioaal draft of this promotional
report was given to a Bank team which visited ARL just five days before the
presentation of the finalized version to the international oil companies.
This team found that the results from both geophysical and geological
studies were not satisfactorily put together and recommended that the



consultant make the necessary corrections. Given the time-frame, it is
doubtful that these modifications were included in the final version.
Despite reiterated requests from the Association, the consultant never
forwarded a revised report to Washington.
27.   ARL presented its evaluation of the hydrocarbon potential of offshore
Liberian Basins during a petroleum exploration promotion seminar which was
held in Lisbon on November 7-8, 1985. The promotion was a failure, since,
in addition to Amoco representatives, only six oil companies attended the
seminar, signifying the scarce interest of the oil industry in the Liberian
Basins. A combination of many factors may account for this lack of
success; (i) the depressed situation of the international petroleum sector,
(ii) the unsuitable location of the seminar, (iii) the previous
presentation of the same acreage to many oil companies by Amoco (iv) the
negative results of wells recently drilled by Amoco, and (v) the high
quality of JCF report, which could be easily updated by any oil company by
crossing off the play explored by Amoco. The promotional seminar did not
result in the sale of a single report, nor in any proposal from an oil
company for any kind of petroleum exploration contract.
28.   As already mentioned, (see paragraph 29 above) in 1986 Amoco
requested an extension on part of its acreage, with no corresponding
technical commitments. In order to assist them in negotiating an agreement
with Amoco, the Ministry request A.R.L. to (i) formulate recommendations
with regard to this issue, and (ii) to carry out an evaluation of the
hydrocarbon potential of Amoco blocks. The initial A.R.L. recommendation,
made without previous consultation with IDA, was to let Amoco to pull out
of the area. The Ministry selected the wisest solution to keep Amoco on a
limited acreage.
29.   An IDA technical panel reviewed the consultant's evaluation of the
potential of Amoco blocks, together with the company's proposed work
program for 1987. These documents were found poorly formatted and with
weak technical support. These findings, together with the reservations
aroused by the geological report (see paragraph 39 above) prompted an IDA
team to visit the consultant's headquarters. The mission found that
inadequate work had been accomplished, at least since the promotional
seminars, and recommended to the ministry (i) to request a corresponding
readjustment of the consultant's invoicing, and (ii) to issue a call for
bids to select a new exploration consultant. While the consultant's
invoices were eventually readjusted (see paragraph 46 below), the Ministry,
through a letter dated March 2, 1987 confirmed their trust in A.R.L.
I.  Training
30.   The implementation of the first project (Loan 1970-LBR), concentrated
on the preparation of promotion and devoted little time to the design of a
training program. One geologist received on-the-job training in 1979-1980,
and was sent to study at the Texas Institute of Technology, where he
obtained an M.Sc. in Sedimentology. During the second project, A.R.L.
organized and supervised the training program, which Amoco cofinanced under



- 10 -
",eir petroleum exploration contract. Five Ministry staff members received
un-the-job training in ARL offices, and two others graduated from United
States universities. The Ministry, however, considers that a well-defined
training program, implemented independently of participating companies
whether serving as consuitants or licensees for the project, could have
significantly improved the results of the training component of the credit.
J. Building and Equipment
31. In 1986, the company 'Movex, of Lisbon, was selected to provide and
erect the pre-fabricated office and storage building.  The contractual cost
was US$200,000. This amount was to be funded partly from the remaining
funds under the first project, and under the category 4 of the second one.
IDA reminded the MLME that applications related to this downpayment should
be supported with invoices and a certified copy of a Bank letter of
guarantee for the sum advanced to the Government. The foundation was
prepared by the Ministry, the pre-fabricated materials were ready to be
shipped. Because the required documents were not received by IDA before
the disbursements under the credit was suspended the pre-fabricated
building was never erected. The equipment purchased included only office
supplies such as copying machines, printing outfit, binding system, and the
magnetometer bought in 1981, for the preparation of the seismic survey
carried out by C.G.G.
K. Accounting Audit
32.      The project accounts were satisfactorily maintained, and the
Ministry was, during the implementation of both projects, able to provide
IDA with any information regarding the accounts. The audit of the projects
accounts, however, which should have been prepared by the General Auditing
Service of the Government, was never carried out due to the workload of
that unit. The Ministry had agreed to hire an independent international
audit firm when the project ended prematurely.
L. Costs and Disbursements
33.      The expenditures to be financed under the Loan 1907-LIB should
have been funded respectively at 80S and 202 by the Bank Group and the
Government. Due to foreign exchange constraints, the Government requested,
on two occasions, that the Bank disburse 1002 of various foreign costs
(seismic survey, interpretation, consultant's services), with the
understanding that the Government's share would increase in the following
years. Eventually, the Government's expenditures consisted of:

The bulk of the disbursements (72Z) was made to meet J.C. Ferrand's
invoices. These invoices included payments made to subcontractors, and
various expenditures, such as training, promotion, organization, travel
costs, etc., according to the following breakdown:
Fees - Internal Cost          1,170,430.60
Payments to Subcontractor       726,152.96
Expenditures                  1,611,847.04
The initial amount allocated under Credit 1580-LBR was SDR 2,700,000.
Since the credit was suspended, and then cancelled, the allocated amount
was only partially disbursed. The following table shows disbursement per

Two further points may be made regarding disbursements:
(i) The Ministry informed us that revenues obtained from the sales of
promotional documents (see para. 25 above), had been mainly used



- 12 -
to finance further training, business travels and the purchase of
office equipment;
(ii)  For various reasons (unjustified invoices, contractual over-
expenditures, illegitimate in view of the weak quality of the
technical documents presented), the MLME declined to pay their
second exploration consultant a sum of US$332,400 out of an
invoices amount of US$1,095,100.
M. Procurement
34.      The projects under review included (i) consultant's services, (ii)
contractors to carry out seismic surveys, and (iii) office building and
equipment.
(i) Consultant's Services
(a) In Spring of 1979, the Ministry sent a call for bids to six
international companies, in order to prepare and organize the
first petroleum exploration seminar (J.F.C., Technoprojekt,
Beicip, Bell and Murphy and Associates, KLM Aerocarto, and
Pexcon International). Upon a bid evaluation carried out
according to Bank's guidelines, the MLME awarded the contract
to J.C.F. (MLME's letter dated May 4, 1979).
(b) The MLME initially relied on J.C.F. to revise the petroleum
law and prepare a model contract. After some delay, MLME
realized that J.C.F.'s assistance in the matter needed to be
complemented by the service of specialists in hydrocarbon
legislation and in petroleum contract negotiation. Taking
into consideration the time constraints, the Association
agreed to the selection of these consultants through direct
negotiation. The firm Duncan, Allen and Mitchell of the
U.S., was commissioned to revise the petroleum legislation,
and the consultant Mac Lachlan was commisssioned to assist
the Government in negotiating with oil companies.
(c) In February 1981, the following consultants were invited to
bid to implement the pricing study: William G. Matthews, of
Canada; Booz, Allen and Hamilton, of Maryland, USA; Energy
Institute of Albotus Platz, of West Germany; Transenerg, of
France; and Energy Development International, of Washington,
D.C. This latter was awarded the contract as a result of a
proposals evaluation conducted in conformity with Bank's
guidelines.
Cd) In April 1983, the Ministry elected not to extend J.C.F.'s
contract beyond its termination date and called for bids from
a shortlist of exploration consultants to complete the
exploration work program. This list included the following
companies: Atlantic Resources, Ltd. (ARL), of Portugal;



- 13 -
Petroconsultants S.A. (PSA), of Switzerland; and Cambrian
International Corporation, of USA (Aide Memoire dated August
S, 1983). Cambrian was later discarded because of its
inexperience in similar projects, and particularly in Africa.
The competition was thus limited to two companies. This
loosening of MLME's vigilance coincided with weak procurement
supervision on IDA's part.
(ii) Geophysical Companies
(a) First Seismic Survey
Although ten companies had been prequalified, only four
presented proposals. Those included: Western Geophysical,
of USA; Compagnie General de Geophysique (CGG), of France;
Geophysical Company (GECO), of Norway; and GSI, of USA. The
latter did not conform to procedures for submissions and was
disqualified. Proposals evaluation was based on (i)
technical specificati.ons for the survey, (ii) contractor's
experience in West Africa, (iii) qualification of field
personnel, and (iv) timing of the survey. As a result of
this evaluation, and with IDA's agreement, the contract was
awarded to CGG.
(b) Second Seismic Survey
As a result of the evaluation of the proposals received from
three companies, CGG, Western and Digicon, the latter was
selected on the basis of technical and cost consideration.
Digicon was terminating a contract for Amoco in Liberia, and
the Government saw several technical advantages in using the
same seismic boat: (i) seismic parameters were well tested in
the area, and (ii) a coherence between Amoco's data and
newly-acquired data would be obtained. Furthermore, Digicon
agreed to finance 70Z of the program (semi-speculative
contract). The Government acquired 1,040 km of seismic lines
at the low cost of US$200 per kilometer.
(c) Building and Equipment
i.  Prefabricated Building
As a result of the evaluation of bids received from four
suppliers, and upon IDA's agreement, the company Movex
was selected to provide the prefabricated building
materials. For reasons discussed in para. 45 above, this
material was never shipped to Monrovia, and the building
was never erected.
ii. Office equipment for a total amount for US$7,450 was
purchased through ARL, upon the evaluation of quotations



- 14 -
received from three or four suppliers in Portugal.
N. Comments on the Implementation of the Project
(a)  Absorbed by other priorities, the HLME delayed the procurement of
office equipment and the implementation of the training program.
Furthermore, Amoco's contract and technical commitments
necessitated IDA's assistance in monitoring the company's
activities. In order to complete the corresponding component of
the project, four successive one-year extensions were granted by
the Bank under Loan 1907.
(b) While the first project lasted longer than expected, the second
was prematurely suspended, as were all Bank credits to Liberia,
due to arrears of the Government in honoring their debts service.
Several components of the second project were never implemented:
(i) Erection of the MLME prefabricated office building.
(ii) Petroleum exploration promotion of the onshore basin.
(iii) Study of the petroleum products supply and distribution issues.
(iv) Privatization of L.P.R.C.
Cc) As already mentioned (see para. 38 above), through two successive
amendments to the Loan 1907-LBR Agreement, the structure of the
payment of Government's share was modified.  Due to foreign
exchange constraints, the Government did not finance most of its
share of the costs in hard currency. Instead, it claimed USAID's
funding of the Energy Assistance Study, and Amoco-financed
training, as counting toward its agreed participation in the
funding of the project.
(d) Following the success of the first promotional seminars in 1987,
J.F. Ferrand could have very well monitored the activities of an
oil company which had been attracted through Ferrand's report, and
would have been more suited to carrying a program which it had
recommended. Consequently, it does not seem to have been so
urgent to substitute JCF for another consultant. If necessary,
this substitution may have coincided with the outset of the second
project.
0. Evaluation of the Performance of the Borrower
35.      The Ministry implemented the project in a suitable manner.  MLME
staff demonstrated a keen interest in carrying out their exploration task.
They provided adequate support to the consulting firms involved in the
implementation of the different components of the project. In most cases,
MLME was vigilant in applying the procedures to select consultants or
contractors. The Government, however, did not always cooperate closely
with IDA's effort to address the LPRC management issues.



- 15 -
P. Evaluation of the Performance of Consultants
36.  (a) J.C. Ferrand
J.C.F. performed efficiently. Detailed and accurate reports
published between August 1979 and October 1980 on an evaluation of
the sedimentary basins of Liberia, as well as services rendered,
attest to the company's competence. The geological synthesis
report provided by J.C.F. is of high quality. However, J.C.F.
displayed a certain prodigality in setting up the program of
special studies which was aimed at improving and complementing the
initial data base (see paras. 17 and 18 above). In a general
manner, J.C.F.'s services were good. but expensive. The firm is
still active in Houston, even though the nature of its activities
has partially changed. It holds production leases in the U.S.,
and exploration leases in France. J.C.F. would now consider only
sizable consulting jobs.
(b) Atlantic Resources
Until the second prometion seminar, held on November 7-8, 1985,
the consultant performed acceptable work, albeit with some flaws
in their regional geological report. Thereafter, the quality of
their work gradually deteriorated. As was learned later on, this
decline in the quality of ARC's technical work was the prelude to
the ARL's disappearance from the market. The consultant's
performance on financial matters was not satisfactory. Expenses
exceeded the contractual amount without obtaining prior approval
from Borrower, and staff time spent on specific tasks was
overstated.
(c) Duncan, Allen and Mitchell
This consultant worked quite efficiently. Although having been
called on short notice, they produced the new petroleum law
according to schedule. The petroleum law is satisfactory. It
should be improved, however, and be adapted to the present status
of the oil market (see para. 23 above).
(d) Mac Lachlan
This consultant proved efficient in assisting the Ministry in
negotiating the Amoco contract, which included the commitment to
drill four wells.
(e) Energy Development International (EDI)
EDI conducted - on schedule - a very good assessment on schedule
of the petroleum pricing structure in Liberia. Their
recommendations, however, were too general to be useful to the
Ministry.



- 16 -
Q. Evaluation of Bank's Performance
37.      During the implementation of the first project, IDA effectively
assisted the Government in (i) getting the technical work off the ground,
and getting the exploration activities going, (ii) preparing a hydrocarbon
legislation, a model contract, and a bidding strategy, (iii) supervising
the petroleum pricing study, and (iv) ensuring a close cooperation between
EDI and Oak Ridge National Laboratories, which implemented the energy
assessment financed by USAID (see para. 40 below). The relationship with
the Borrower was usually very good. IDA did not perceive in time, however,
the progressive deterioration of AVL.'e services, and, as a result, did not
intensify its control of the consultanc' F performance. Furthermore, IDA
was not vigilant regarding conformity to the Bank's procurement guidelines.
38.      Finally, the Ministry has regretted that while the MLME team
responsible for the implementation of the projects had always remained the
same, there had been too many successive Bank interlocutors for the same
projects.
TII. ENERGY ASSESSMENT STUDY
39.      In 1980, the Government created the National Energy Committee
(N.E.C.), since it recognized the need for improved analytic capability and
coordination in energy planning. NEC is an interagency body composed of
several ministries and energy related parastatals, whose principal
objective is to review energy sector policy and integrated planning. The
NEC played a useful role in (i) reviewing energy policy proposals under
consideration by various Government agencies; (ii) developing
recommendations, such as for fundamental reforms of the power system
serving Liberian rural areas, and (iii) serving as an information center
for the private sector. The experience acquired during recent years,
however, has led the Bank to recommend that the NEC be transformed into a
well-staffed and well-equipped energy and planning division of energy that
would have advisory relationship role to the Economic and Financial
Management Committee, which is the highest Government decision making body.
40.      The Bank's initially contemplated energy planning assistance
encompassed all aspects of energy policy and planning. As USAID financed a
full-scale energy assessment for Liberia, iDA's project was scaled down to
a study of petroleum pricing. This study was entrusted to Energy
Development International (EDI), of the U.S., while the USAID-financed
study was carried out by Oak Ridge National Laboratories of the U.S.
During the course of their studies, the two consulting companies cooperated
closely. EDI's report gives a good analysis of the petroleum products
prices structure and outlines pricing principles, but it does not recommend
any definitive set of prices. Current petroleum products prices are
appropriate to encourage conservation and to generate revenues for the
Government. The main results of the USAID-financed energy assessment
project are given in the Annex of this PCR.



- 17 -
IV. PETROLEUK PRODUCTS SUPPLY AND STORAGE
41.      Although petroleum products may be imported by other operators,
the Liberian Petroleum Refining Company (LPRC), holds a de-facto monopoly
on imports for the domestic market. In 1986, LPRC operations took the
following charactericticss
(i) Petroleum products are procured at prices considerably above
international levels;
(ii) Consumers pay a high price, since prices were not adjusted
downward when the international prices declined in 1986;
(iii) The increased margin of revenue and most of the excise taxes paid
by distribution companies to LPRC are not transferred to the
treasury.
IDA estimated that in 1986, US$40 to $50 million in revenue were
foregone. This loss in Government revenue represented an increase from
1980 due to a sharp decrease of the international prices of petroleum
products which had not been transferred to the retail market.
42.      In 1986, the Government embarked in direct negotiations with
private companies to take over LPRC's role. Several small companies were
attracted by the substantial potential benefits. The proposed contracts
were generally disadvantageous for the Government. In early 1987, IDA
stepped in to prevent the signature of unacceptable contracts with several
of these firms.
43.      The objectives of the second project included the hiring of a
consultant to study the petroleum products supply and storage issues, and
make recommendations to improve the process. The following three companies
submitted proposals: Arthur D. Little, Skaarup Oil, and Coopers and
Lybrand in association with Petroleum Economics Ltd. IDA suggested to MLME
through a telex dated October 30, 1986 to include in the terms of
reference, assistance to the Government in the privatization of the LPRC.
When the credit was stopped, the Ministry had not yet reacted.
V. CONCLUSION
44.      While the second project was abandoned in the early stages, the
first petroleum exploration project was successful:
(a) The petroleum exploration of the sedimentary basins was started
again, and the data resulting from the drilling of three wells and
the acquisition of 5,000 km of seismic lines led to an improved
geological knowledge of the area.
(b) A group of knowledgeable technicians in petroleum exploration was
established within the Ministry, which had been without such a
base of knowledge prior to the project.



- 18 -
45.      The Implementation of the project would have been improveds
(a) by hiring a resident independent part-time exploration advisor,
who could have supervised closely the consultant's selection,
technical work, and invoicing;
(b) by closer IDA supervision, which could have avoided the inadequate
implementation of several components of the projects, and unduly
high costs for the Borrower.
46.      If and when the World Bank resumes lending to Liberia, it will be
urgent to assist the MLHE again in:
(a) privatizing the L.P.R.C., and improving the management of the
petroleum products supply and storage, in order to stop the
Government's financial haemorrage;
(b) rekindling the interest of the oil industry in the petroleum
exploration of the Liberian basins, since past exploration work
indicates that commercial oil accumulation may exist in the area;
and
(c) further strengthening of MLME's technical capabilities.

LIBERIA
Petroleum Exploration Promotion Prolect (Loan 1907-LUR)
and Petroleum Sector Technical Assistance (Credit 1580-LBR)
Project Cowpletion Report
USAID financed and executed the Energy Assessment Project and IDA
played no role. The summarized results of the study, as drafted by the
Ministry in their version of the Project Completion Report, are given
herebelow.
ENERGY PLANNING STUDY
RESULTS AND RELATED DOCUMENTS
As a contribution to the energy planning study of Liberia, the
U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) agreed to fund a one-year
project to provide energy planning assistance to the Government of Liberia.
This assistance involved both direct help in conducting a National Energy
Assessment and professional developmental support to upgrade the energy
planning capability of the Government of Liberia's (GOL) agencies and
staff.
In response, the National Energy Committee (NEC) and the USAID
consultants, in an Integrated Energy workshop held in Buchanan, Grand Bassa
County, recommended that a number of specific actions be taken government
on the following programs:
I. Energy Use/Demand Management
1.   Institute a program of mandatory reduction in electricity
consumption in government offices during periods of officially
declared emergency, with incentives for compliance and penalties
for waste.
2.   Institute an ongoing program of correcting obvious waste of
electricity in government offices with incentives for compliance
and penalties for waste.



- 21 -
3.   Allocate realistic electricity budgets to GOL agencies and make
electricity bill expenditures part of an agency's discretionary
budget.
II. Private Section Energy Demand Management
LEC should totally revamp its metering, billing and collection
system to ensure that bills are accurate and that all customers
are billed and their bills paid.
III. Encourage Increased Use of Energy Resources
1.   Conduct a pre-investment ana.Lysis of the Bong Mining Company's
(BMC) use of wood for Iron Ore processing.
2.   Provide information and technical assistance to hydropower in
place of petroleum fuels whenever this can be done economically.
IV. Increase Security of Supply for Liquid Fuels
1.   Expand petroleum product handling and storage facilities.
2.   Permit and encourage diversification of oil importation agents and
storage facility ownership.
V. Improvements in Reliability and Efficient of LEC's Central
Central Grid Electric Thermal Power Generation
1.   Acquire additional slow-speed diesel generators.
2.   Strengthen the maintenance and managerial supervision/support
systems for the slow-speed diesels and increase operator
accountability.
VI. Upgrade Hydroelectric Reliability and Output for the LEC Central Grid
1.   Rehabilitate the only existing turbine at Mt. Coffee.
2.   Add a fifth generating unit to Mt. Coffee.
3.   Institute a strengthened maintenance and management
support/supervision program at Mt. Coffee with the aim of ensuring
the lowest long run costs and greatest long run reliability for
the plant's generating capacity.
4.   Seek funds to construct a water storage reservoir upstream from
Mt. Coffee to increase dry season St. Paul River flow and
subsequent hydroelectric output from the Mt. Coffee plant.



- 22 -
VII. ADpropriate Generating Technologies for Rural Electric Powers
1.   Conduct a detailed resource evaluation/feasibility study for
hydroelectric power sites to serve the Gbarnga region.
2.   Conduct a feasibility study for a wood fire power plant to serve a
rural town.
3.   Institute an experiment with fast going wood species for possible
use in a wood energy plantation to serve a wood demand as well.
VIII. Energy Planning Agency
1.   Strengthen one existing agency or create a new one to play a major
role in integrated national energy planning in Liberia and connect
this agency with a high-level decision-making body of the GOL.
2.   Several possibilities exist for this agency:
a) Strengthen and expand the Department of Energy in the Ministry
of Lands, Mines and Energy (MLM&E).
b) Strengthen and expand the utilities selection withir. the
Ministry of Planning and Economic Affairs (MPEA).
c) Create and independent National Energy Commission.
