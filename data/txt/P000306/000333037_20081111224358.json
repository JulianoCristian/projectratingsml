satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was low\n            or negligible, the Bank performance was satisfactory, and\n            the Borrower performance was highly satisfactory. Some\n            lessons learned included: an urban water sector reform to\n            improve sector performance without financing investments is\n            prone to failure. Changes in operational performance,\n            improving commercial and financial efficiency to restore\n            financial equilibrium could not take place without more\n            people getting access to water and the improvement of the\n            service for current customers. Investments financing is\n            critical for any reform package to address production\n            capacity constraints, limited water distribution networks\n            and high technical losses that many water utilities in\n            developing countries are facing to properly deliver their\n            services. The Burkina Faso urban water sector reform was\n            accompanied by an important investment program which\n            resulted in doubling the water production capacity in\n            Ouagadougou and expanding water distribution networks by 30\n            percent. This full implementation of this investment program\n            was essential to the successful reform that took place in\n            Burkina Faso. In that respect, the financial model that was\n            developed at the onset of the project has been a powerful\n            tool to optimize investments and assess required operational\n            efficiency gains consistent with the financial equilibrium\n            of the sector and socially acceptable tariffs."}, "docdt": "2008-06-01T00:00:00Z"}
