furnished to the Association, the Borrower shall, promptly upon notice from the 
Association, (A) provide such additional evidence as the Association may request; or

the Association into the Special Account shall be made until the Borrower has provided 
such evidence or made such deposit or refund, as the case may be. 
 
(b)

outstanding in the Special Account will not be required to cover further payments for 
eligible expenditures, the Borrower shall, promptly upon notice from the Association, 
refund to the Association such outstanding amount.
