to the\n            implementation of the Ouagadougou Water Supply Project. The\n            conclusions are global, taking both stages, prior to\n            construction, and, post implementation of the project. The\n            environmental physical and biological concerns, include\n            negative effects on crops, as well as on certain animal\n            species. Nonetheless, these are expected to be temporary\n            impacts, whereas aquaculture will benefit positively.\n            Regarding the socioeconomic front, negative effects are\n            considered, namely, due to resettlement. Public health\n            however, is expected to benefit due to water improvements.\n            The proposed mitigation measures are: 1) adequate water\n            control through simulation models, optimizing water usage,\n            at the same time, diminishing the possibility of flood risks\n            during the reservoir construction; 2) creation of a special\n            fund which will financially contribute to the negative tax\n            liabilities, and/or tariff losses in water consumption; 3)\n            adequate specifications and construction work control,\n            through the installation of alarm devices, thus preventing\n            reservoir breaching risks; and 4) public health awareness,\n            through food aid coordination, particularly to affected\n            families. Further measures are recommended for disease\n            control. A two year period, prior to resettlement, is\n            recommended for rendering new lands for normal production at\n            resettlement time."}, "docdt": "2000-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
