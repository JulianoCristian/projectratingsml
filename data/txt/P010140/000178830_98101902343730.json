availability and reliability of the public road passenger\n            transportation services throughout the country; (ii)\n            introduce improved maintenance standards,thereby improving\n            fuel efficiency; (iii) improve the financial condition of\n            SLCTB and the Regional Transport Boards (RTBs); and (iv)\n            progressively reduce and by 1983 eliminate government\n            subsidies for public bus operations. the Project includes\n            the following components: (a) restoration and improvement of\n            SLCTB unit and parts exchange and overhaul facilities; (b)\n            purchase of bus chassis, materials and assembly of buses;\n            (c) improvement of bus maintenance facilities and practices\n            in RTBs; (d) low cost traffic engineering measures designed\n            to improve bus flows on roads; and (e) technical assistance\n            and training for the execution of the project and\n            institution building. The major organizational risks have\n            been minimized by satisfactory arrangements to manage the\n            industrial activities of SLCTB."}, "docdt": "1980-02-29T00:00:00Z"}
