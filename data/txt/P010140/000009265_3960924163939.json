   Sri Lanka was achieved. The International Development\n            Association (IDA) contributed to the policy reforms that the\n            government undertook to revitalize the sector as a whole,\n            and to road passenger service in particular. As a result,\n            many restrictions which eliminated private bus operators in\n            the past were removed which freed then to provide much\n            needed passenger service in competition with the Regional\n            Transport Boards (RTB)'s. There were doubts regarding\n            whether or not the complexity, the size, and the scope of\n            the project would have permitted a timely completion\n            considering that both the Sri Lanka Central Transport Board\n            (SLCTB), and the RTB's were only a few months old.\n            While RTB had hardly completed moving into their newly\n            established headquarters, and branch offices in the regions,\n            they were asked to execute various components of a complex\n            project. The staff lacked the experience and/or\n            understanding required to achieve the objectives. The\n            project demonstrates the complexities and inefficiencies of\n            a series of public sector agencies operating bus fleets and\n            emphasized the constant need for attention to appropriate\n            technical specifications in fleets; to proper pricing policy\n            and the need to control operating costs. These lessons were\n            derived from the project but will only be sustained with a\n            continued commitment to sound management principles."}, "docdt": "1989-08-07T00:00:00Z"}
