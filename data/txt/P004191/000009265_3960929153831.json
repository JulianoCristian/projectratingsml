Highway Improvement Project supports\n            rehabilitation of a key section of the country's main\n            north-south road artery.  The project road from Namkading to\n            Savannakhet forms part of the link between the\n            agriculturally-rich southern part of the country and the\n            poorer, northern provinces, and serves as a corridor for\n            export-import traffic.  The road, which is the remaining\n            section of the Vientiane-Savannakhet road to be improved, is\n            now severely deteriorated and passable only during the\n            seven-month dry season and even then with difficulty. The\n            project will also assist the Ministry of Communication,\n            Transport, Post and Construction (MCTPC) to begin restoring\n            the capacity of the road network by supporting a study for\n            the establishment of an effective maintenance system as well\n            as emergency spot improvements of key road sections.\n            Institutionally, the project will help strengthen\n            MCTPC's transport planning capacity and human\n            resources.  The project will finance:  (a) rehabilitation\n            and bituminous surfacing of the Namkading-Savannakhet road,\n            including replacement of six bridges and rehabilitation of\n            40 bridges; (b) the provision of equipment, materials and\n            supplies for spot improvements; (c) technical assistance for\n            project implementation, preparation of the maintenance study\n            and future roads projects, and transport planning and policy\n            development; and (d) degree courses and short-term training\n            for MCTPC staff."}, "docdt": "1991-02-12T00:00:00Z"}
