for the Highway Improvement\n            Project for Laos are as follows: overall outcome of the\n            project was rated satisfactory, and the performance of the\n            Bank and the Borrower was also rated as satisfactory. Some\n            of the lessons learned from the project are: a) careful\n            attention must be paid to detailed engineering design and to\n            realistic cost estimates; b) for an efficient and effective\n            maintenance management system, the planning, budgeting\n            implementation and evaluation must be integrated, and\n            responsibilities clearly defined for Ministry of\n            Communication, Transport, Post and Construction (MCTPC)\n            headquarters and for regional offices, provincial and\n            district level administrations; c) to increase the\n            effectiveness of technical assistance assignments and the\n            transfer of skills to local nationals, consultants should\n            prepare and implement a Skill Transfer Action Plan, and the\n            Government should assign appropriate counterpart staff at\n            the beginning of the project and avoid turnover; and d)\n            considering the local institutional constraints, the\n            development of a modem and efficient maintenance\n            organization will take much longer than normally\n            anticipated, therefore expectations under any individual\n            project must be realistic."}, "docdt": "1997-12-01T00:00:00Z"}
