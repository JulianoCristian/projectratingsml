Forestry Project for India are to assist the government in\n            arresting the retrograde trend in forest cover development\n            and improving forest productivity in an environmentally and\n            socially sustainable manner as well as to help improve the\n            standard of living of the surrounding rural communities\n            (including tribal people). The first of three project\n            components strengthens sector management by strengthening\n            policy reform as well as institutional and human resource\n            development; introduces a forest management information\n            system; and supports project management. The second\n            component strengthens forest management by improving\n            management of natural forests including those that are\n            degraded and management of industrial plantations;\n            introduces improved quality of planting stock and adapted\n            research; strengthens support for homestead forestry and\n            associated activities; and introduces an improved fire\n            management system. To strengthen biodiversity conservation,\n            the third component establishes a state-wide strategic\n            approach; strengthens sustainability of the protected area\n            (PA) system; improves scientific knowledge and public\n            support; and expands village ecodevelopment."}, "docdt": "1998-02-20T00:00:00Z"}
