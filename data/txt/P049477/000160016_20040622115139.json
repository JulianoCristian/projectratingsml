RESOURCES/INSTITUTIONS SPECIALIST", "versiontyp": "Final", "abstracts": {"cdata!": "Project ratings are as follows: Project\n            outcome is satisfactory, sustainability is likely,\n            institutional development impact is substantial, Bank\n            performance is satisfactory, and Borrower performance is\n            satisfactory. These are some key lessons learned: 1) A\n            project management cell with competent and long-term staff,\n            as was the case with KFP, is a fundamental element in\n            achieving successful outcomes for a project. 2) A holistic\n            approach to forestry sector development that links various\n            elements within the sector provides a realistic and\n            effective approach to achieving development. 3)\n            Site-specific, bottom up planning provides not only a more\n            realistic approach to forest and plantation management, but\n            also engenders a greater sense of involvement and\n            responsibility amongst divisional and field staff. 4) A four\n            years' project is too short a time frame for forestry.\n            Though the project was appraised as two-stage project for\n            four and five years' period, only first stage was\n            approved leaving a follow up operation uncertain as proved\n            later. 5) Projects must be given sufficient time for\n            completion, especially those in forestry that have well\n            known and inherent start-up problems. 6) Early and\n            transparent agreements on policy reforms and the immediate\n            establishment of institutional strengthening are key to\n            underpinning successful project implementation and\n            sustainability. 7) Community participation, if established\n            on a sustainable basis with adequate and equitably\n            distributed benefits is a highly effective and efficient\n            means of ensuring protection of natural forests from fire\n            and biotic influences, and managing fragile ecosystems. 8)\n            The establishment of well-managed community institutions\n            creates empowerment for the community and develops self-help\n            groups that can attract other development support from\n            external partners. 9) The conflict between wildlife and\n            farmers needs to be addressed: effective conservation of\n            wildlife increases destruction of crops and property in\n            lands adjacent to protected areas. 10) While initial\n            progress has been made in promoting participatory approaches\n            to biodiversity conservation, monitoring and sustainability\n            should be given serious consideration in any similar future effort."}, "docdt": "2004-06-04T00:00:00Z"}
