would assist the Government\n            in establishing three vocational training centers (VTCs)\n            which would be the forerunners of a number of additional\n            VTCs to be constructed in other parts of the country to\n            train urgently needed skilled and semi-skilled workers in\n            the industrial, agricultural and commercial sectors. The\n            project consists of the construction of an industrial, an\n            agricultural and a commercial training center, and the\n            procurement of furniture and equipment. Technical assistance\n            comprising fellowships for instructors and directors of the\n            institutions would be financed with funds obtained by the\n            Government through bilateral agreements. At full\n            development, the annual output from the project institutions\n            would be about 500 skilled workers."}, "docdt": "1978-11-30T00:00:00Z"}
