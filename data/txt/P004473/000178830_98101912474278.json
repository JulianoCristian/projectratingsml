have satisfactory rainfall\n            but no access to major irrigation systems. The project would\n            also support and reinforce other ongoing investments in\n            Iloilo under the national programs to increase their impact\n            on agricultural productivity, and assist in preparations for\n            the extension of multiple cropping technology to other\n            provinces. It provides for increasing agricultural\n            production, improving marketing and extension, training\n            support staff and community members and strengthening\n            existing institutions responsible for project\n            implementation. The project would also provide for the\n            construction of a grains storage and shipment facility and\n            water impounding facilities, programs for improving\n            nutrition through the control of anemia and diarrhea, and\n            consultant services for the preparation of future similar\n            projects in Mindanao. Approximately 40,000 farm families and\n            5,000 landless laborers' families, or a total of about\n            27,000 people, would benefit directly from increased\n            production and employment resulting from the project."}, "docdt": "1980-02-29T00:00:00Z"}
