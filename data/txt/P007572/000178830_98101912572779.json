expand production of grain sorghum\n            on an additional l64,500 ha presently uncultivated.\n            Implementation would be carried out over a six-year period\n            and would benefit some l7,l00 families, including the 8,200\n            families to be settled under the land reform program. In\n            addition, the project includes a study for future\n            development of grain movement and storage and a feasibility\n            study for a second stage rainfed development project in an\n            area south of San Fernando. The project is not expected to\n            have any harmful effects on the environment. Although\n            opening up new lands and creating open areas may have some\n            effect on the biological life in Tamaulipas, over 22,500 ha\n            in the proposed project area are to be retained as a\n            wildlife reserve."}, "docdt": "1982-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
