While the Bank performance is overall, rated\n            satisfactory, given a highly satisfactory\n            quality-at-entrance, and project supervision assessment, the\n            overall Borrower performance can be rated as unsatisfactory,\n            due to remaining challenges, such as the need to restore the\n            creditworthiness of the utilities, and accelerate\n            operational, and commercial improvements of the power\n            sector, including privatization. Lessons focus around two\n            aspects: 1) the utilization of the Adaptable Program Lending\n            (APL) instrument, as a powerful lending instrument in\n            dealing with complex reforms, and long execution periods, in\n            highly volatile environments. However, and although\n            addressed in the Project Appraisal Document risk analysis,\n            political factors specifically affected implementation,\n            factored by the lending approach which does not lead to a\n            situation where conflict may resolve through the application\n            of remedies, nor a scaling down of the project objectives:\n            seemingly the project was overloaded with ambitious\n            objectives, and some covenants were linked to milestones for\n            the subsequent operation. It is suggested financial\n            covenants need to be addressed, and be given less\n            prominence; and, 2) the design, and implementation of a\n            reform program, stipulating political support for reforms,\n            and ownership are indispensable to sustain a reform process;\n            dynamics of reform is essential, as is managing the\n            transition of reforms; and, revenue enhancement, does\n            demonstrate that state-owned distribution companies can\n            reduce losses, contain theft, and trigger governance."}, "docdt": "2001-06-27T00:00:00Z"}
