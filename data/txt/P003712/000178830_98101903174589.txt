INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION
OF THE
PRESIDENT

INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPIENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RBOOJNENDATIONI OF THE PRESIDENT TO THE
EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED DT1OPMENT
CREDIT TO THE REPUBLIC OF INDCNESIA FOR A THIRD
IRRIGATION REHiABILITATION PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
credit in an amount in various currencies equivalent to US$14.5 million to
the Republic of Indonesia for a third irrigation rehabilitation project.
PART I - HISTORICAL
2.        The project was prepared by consultants retained under the First
Irrigation Rehabilitation Project (Credit 127-IND) and following a request
for a credit by the Government in March 1970 was appraised in March/April 1970.
3.        Negotiations for the proposed credit were held in Washington,
from September 29 to October 6, 1970. The Borrower was represented by
Mr. Sujono, Director General, Water Resources Development in the Ministry
of Public Works and Electric Power; Mr. Sumarman, Secretary General, Ministry
of the Interior; Mr. Setyohadi, General Manager (PROSIDA); Mr. Saleh Affif,
Bappenas; and Nr. Atmono Surjo, Minister-Counsellor (Economic); and Mr. Adian
Silalahi, EIbassy of Indonesia.
4.        If approved, this would be the Association's third credit for
irrigation rehabilitation in Indonesia and would bring the total number of
credits to Indonesia to thirteen. The first irrigation rehabilitation credit,
signed in September 1968, was for the rehabilitation of about 200,000 ha in
run-of-the-river gravity systems generally siilar to, and in two cases
adjoining, the systems included in the present project. The second, signed
in June 1970, was for the rehabilitation and completion of the 253,000 ha
system which draws its water supply from the Djatiluhur reservoir in Central
Java. Because the reservoir would have several purposes, development of the
area has been entrusted to an autonomous authority.
5.        The following is a summary statement of Development Credits to
Indonesia to date, with disbursements as of September 30, 1970:

6.        The status of disbursements is described in my report and
recommendation for an Education Project of October 13 (P-864) scheduled
for consideration by the Executive Directors on October 27, 1970. Later
in the fiscal year, I expect to present to the Executive Directors
proposed credits for a tea estates development project, a rice seeds
production project and a second highway project.
PART II - DESCRIPTION OF THE PROPOSED CREDIT
7.
Borrower         Republic of Indonesia
Amount           In various currencies equivalent to US$1h.5 million
Purpose          The rehabilitation of three irrigation systems to provide
for sustained irrigated agriculture on an area of about
200,000 ha.
Amortization     In 50 years, including a 10 year period of grace, through
semi-annual instalments of 1/2 of one per cent from
December 1, 1980 through June 1, 1990 and 1-1/2 per cent
from December 1, 1990 till June 1, 2020.
Service Charge   3/4 of one per cent.
Estimated
Economic Rate
of Return        Between 25 and 37 per cent.
PART III - THE PROJECT
8.        A detailed description of the project is given in the attached
appraisal report entitled "Irrigation Rehabilitation Project III - Indonesia"
(PA-57a dated October 20, 1970). The project comprises the rehabilitation
of three irrigation systems, one each in Central Java, W4est Java, and South
Sulawesi with a total area of about 200,000 hectares. The project was
prepared by consultants retained under the First Irrigation Rehabilitation
Project (Credit No. 127-ID) and, like that project, would be carried out by
Projek Irigasi IDA (PROSIDA), an executive body created by the Ministry of
Public lWorks and Electric Power under the Director General of ntater Resources
Development to carry out IDA-financed irrigation rehabilitation projects.
The first project is making good progress with half of the Credit disbursed
by September 30, 1970. The proposed project would continue the work of
restoring Indonesia's irrigation systems wyith a view to assuring their
sustained and effective operation and maintenance.
9.        Total project cost is estimated at $29.1 million.  The foreign
exchange cost of consulting services, management assistance, equipment and
materials is estimated at only $4.9 million, or 17 per cent of the total, but
I propose that the Association finance 50 per cent of the total. As I noted
in my report and recommendation to you regarding the second irrigation



rehabilitation project (P-830/1970), it is not feasible at this stage
of Indonesials economic recovery for external lenders to cover Indonesia's
large resource gap only by financing the import component of projects.
Through a commendable tax effort the Government expects to increase its
revenues during the current fiscal year by 46% over those collected last
year and to increase its contribution to the development budget by about
40o% to the equivalent of $100 million. But this would still represent
only 22 per cent of planned development expenditures, So far as this
particular project is concerned, it like other irrigation rehabilitation
projects in developing countries, has a very law foreign exchange component;
yet it promises to yield a high economic rate of return and to make an
important contribution to the Governmentfs drive toachieve self sufficiency
in food. In these special circumstances I consider some financing of local
currency expenditures on the project to be appropriate and justified.
10.       The rehabilitation consists of the repair and construction of
barrages, weirs, and minor canal structures; desilting and clearing of
primary and secondary canals; repairs to canal side-slopes and embankments;
construction of step landings on canal banks to control access for domestic
purposes; the improvement and construction of drainage canals and structures;
repair and construction c surface roads and inspection canals along primary
and secondary canals; construction of new canals, drains, structures and
inspection paths on limited extension areas, and the construction of the first
50 m of each tertiary canal with structures. Farmers traditionally supply
their labor free to construct and maintain these canals. In the event that
they fail to do so in reasonable time, agreement was reached that the Govern-
ment will cause all tertiary canals to be completed within 12 months after
the first 50 m of such canals have been completed by PROSIDA.
ll.       Together with the first irrigation rehabilitation project,
PROSIDA would have to administer the rehabilitation of 400,000 ha - abcut
one million acres - or double the area it is presently handling under the
first project. Consultants would be employed to assist PROSIDA in the
detailed planning, design and construction of project works. In agreement
with the Association PROSIDA's management has been considerably strengthened.
In addition, retention of three expatriates to advise PROSIDAts management on
construction and contracts, operation and maintenance and staff training,
and administration and finance would be a condition of effectiveness. With
these additions to its management PROSIDA should be capable of executing
both the first and the proposed project. However, the speed with which
the new personnel can be trained and integrated in the existing organization
will determine when further responsibilities can be assumed by PROSIDJA. New
projects will therefore be taken on by PROSIDA only after the Association
is satisfied that this would not adversely affect the implementation of the
first irrigation rehabilitation project and the third one now proposed.
12.       Agreement has also been reached during negotiations on the
staffing of, and equipment for, the organizations which will operate and
maintain the irrigation systems. These organizations will be established
under the Public Works Department of each province and operation, and
maintenance equipment and vehicles to be procured under the proposed credit
will be turned over to them by PROSIDA on completion of rehabilitation of
the systems.



- 4 -
13.       Equipment, vehicles and imported materials required for the
project would be procured through international competitive bidding. Local
assemblers will be free to participate in bidding for vehicles. Since, under
a Decree of the 1inister of Finance, imports financed by project aid are
free of customs duty, bid comparison would be based on c.i.f. cost for the
foreign-bidder and ex-factory cost for the local assembler, plus domestic
freight, insurance and other costs of delivery to site in each case.
14.       The Borrower is obligated to follow the Association's guidelines
for procurement in tendering civil works contracts. However, the civil works
included in the project are widely scattered and labor intensive by nature,
and it is considered most unlikely that foreign contractors would be interested
in bidding, even though works would be grouped into as large contracts as
practicable. The Borrnwer has therefore been exempted from the requirement
to solicit bids internationally, though foreign contractors would be free to
participate in the local bidding if they wished to do so.
15.       Land taxes in Indonesia are based on a land classification
which results in higher rates on irrigated land. Because of this dif-
ferential, farmers in irrigation systems were, in theory, contributing to
the cost of operation and maintenance, However, the funds so collected
have been used for other purposes. The present need for rehabilitation
arises because of an almost total lack of necessary expenditure on operation
and maintenance over the past thirty years. In future, operation and
maintenance costs will be recovered directly through a charge on irrigable
land in areas which have been rehabilitated. The province will collect the
charges and apply the funds to the cost of operation and maintenance. The
collection of charges will begin one year after the rehabilitation of each
irrigation system, and charges sufficient to cover the full costs of operation
and maintenance are to be collected two years after completion. The Govern-
ment has agreed to take the measures necessary to cover any shortfall.
16.       Under the first irrigation rehabilitation project, beneficiaries
were expected to make a substantial contribution to the cost of operation and
maintenance. Since two of the systems to be rehabilitated under the proposed
credit are adjacent to two systems rehabilitated under the first project, the
Government and the Association agreed during negotiations to eliminate any
differential treatment through an amendment to the Development Credit Agree-
ment 127-TND introducing the same covenant for the collection of water charges
that has been agreed under the proposed credit. A supplemental letter to that
effect is being circulated with the credit documents. The legislation
introducing these charges will be a matter of consultation between the
Government and the Association.
17.       The ability of the farmers, especially of the smallholdery to pay
charges for water, and the internal rate of return on-the project, depend
on the adequacy of the price for agricultural produce, specifically for rice,
paid to the farmers. The Government's rice price stabilization policy was
fully discussed with the Government and a statement of the present policy and
price levels was incorporated in a supplemental letter which was attached to
my report and recormendation regarding the PUSRI Fertilizer Project (Credit No.
193-IND). The Association has received a representation from the Government
that in making the proposed credit, it can rely'on the statements made on the
rice price stabilization program in that letter.



18.       The rate of return on the project as a whole would lie between
25% and 37% depending on other inputs such as fertilizer, pesticides and
extension services, which the Government has agreed to provide.   With these
inputs fully utilized, the increase in rice production would replace about
one-third of Indonesiafs present rice imports, and annual foreign exchange
savings would exceed total project cost once the project is fully developed,
as expected, in 1976. Under the proposed credit agreement, the Government
will establish a system to monitor the economic benefits of the project.
PART IV - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
19.       The draft Development Credit Agreement between the Republic of
Indonesia and the Association, a draft of the supplemental letter referred
to in paragraph 16 above, the Recommendation of the Committee referred to
in Article V Section 1 (c) of the Articles of Agreement of the Association
and the text of a draft Resolution approving the proposed credit are being
distributed to the Executive Directors separately.
20,       The draft Development Credit Agreement is in the usual form
for this type of project.
PART V - THE EC0NOPTY
21.       The last full report on the economic position and prospects of
Indonesia (EAP-lOa) was issued on NJovember 1i, 1969; a special report,
"Current Investment Activity in Indonesia" (EAP-lha) was issued on March 27,
1970. A basic data sheet is annexed to this document. An up-to-date
assessment of Indonesia's present economic situation and prospects can be
found in my Report and Recommendation for an Education Project (P-864)
dated October 13, 1970.
PART VI - CONPLIANCE WITH ARTICLES OF AGRF=N-NT
22.       I am satisfied that the proposed Development Credit would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART VII - REC012lIENDATION
23.       I recommend that the EKecutive Directors approve the proposed
Development Credit and the proposed amendment of the Development Credit
Agreement (Irrigation Rehabilitation Project) dated September 6, 1968
between the Republic of Indonesia and the Association,
