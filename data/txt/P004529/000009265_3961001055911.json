The project will:\n            (a) provide investment and seasonal production credit to\n            support private agricultural/rural investments to increase\n            production, incomes, and employment; (b) induce financial\n            institutions to attend the credit needs of the rural areas\n            more efficiently, and to facilitate better access to\n            commercial, saving, and rural banks in rurals areas; and (c)\n            enhance the access of rural borrowers to formal credit\n            sources.  The project will provide a second stage of support\n            to the Agricultural Loan Fund (ALF) rediscounting facility.\n            Enhancing the operations of financial institutions in rural\n            areas will be achieved through further liberalization of\n            banking policies concerning opening new branches in rural\n            areas, adjusting the current limit on maximum shareholding\n            by single investors in a distressed rural bank to enable the\n            mobilization of the additional required capital, and\n            inducing banks in good standing to invest in rural banks\n            with an equity deficiency.  Enhancing farmer access to\n            formal credit sources will be carried out through the\n            strengthening of two existing insurance/guarantee\n            institutions; training of cooperative staff; and designing\n            and implementing pilot/experimental projects to develop new\n            and efficient credit delivery systems and technical\n            assistance to rural areas."}, "docdt": "1991-05-30T00:00:00Z"}
