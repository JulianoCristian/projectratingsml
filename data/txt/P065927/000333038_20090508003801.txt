F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
The project is closely linked to the macroeconomic program and the on-going IMF
program; it also supports the preparatory work for the upcoming HIPC, and it is a follow-
on to the Privatization and Private Sector Technical Assistance Credit (PETA, Cr. 2882-
CM).



                                                ii

  The project supports the Government's efforts to grow out of poverty through private
sector led growth and financial reform, together with a heightened emphasis on poverty
alleviation. It thus accentuates the need for greater competitiveness of the Cameroonian
economy and more effective policies and programs to deliver public services to the least
privileged groups in society. The key development objectives are to: (a) improve business
environment and competitiveness through privatization and effective public/partnership
with the view to increase private investment; and (b) strengthen the poverty alleviation
focus in GOC's economic management.

1.      Project Context, Development Objectives and Design
1.1     Context at Appraisal

1.      Affected by pronounced terms of trade volatility in the early 1980s, an appreciation of the
exchange rate, and an inadequate fiscal policy, Cameroon fell into a long recession in 1985-94.
Starting in 1988, the Government implemented a series of economic and structural reforms
focusing on price liberalization and on reforms of the coffee and cocoa sectors, the main
agricultural products. In spite of an improved economic environment resulting from the
devaluation of the CFA Franc in 1994, and of considerable international support, including that of
the World Bank, the reform program was implemented haphazardly and did not attain its
objectives. A new Government was appointed in September 1996, with the mandate of
introducing a reform program focused among others, on economic liberalization and improving
public finances.

2.      At the time the Credit for Public-Private Partnership for Growth and Poverty Reduction
(PPPGPR) was approved in 1998, encouraging progress had been made in the reform process.
The divestiture program had resulted in the sale of the banks and the electricity company, and
new legal/regulatory frameworks aimed at introducing competition were introduced in electricity,
telecommunications, post, energy, water and transport. A program had been adopted for the Port
of Douala aimed at reducing transit times and costs, and expected to lead to the creation of
public/private partnerships for the management of the ports and the transfer of all port-related
industrial and commercial activities to private operators. Road maintenance of the priority
network was being transferred to private companies. In the financial sector, the commercial bank
restructuring program had been successful with all large banks profitable and meeting regional
prudential requirements. The sale of the agro-industries, public utilities and most other
Government-owned infrastructure companies had been started.

3.      Government policy was articulated in its Letter of Development Policy prepared in 1998
in connection with the Third Structural Adjustment Credit SAC-III (Cr. 3102) and a Policy
Framework Paper prepared jointly by the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
and the Government.       The Government strategy aimed at encouraging private sector-led
accelerated growth while alleviating poverty and improving access to social services.
Specifically, it aimed to strengthen the competitiveness of the economy; consolidate the private
and public sectors complementarities by focusing Government activities on defining and
implementing policies; and improving the distribution of the benefits of growth. The program
focused on privatization, the financial sector and the framework for improving competitiveness.
The PPPGRP supported the implementation of the adjustment program supported by SAC III
approved in 1998. The project was also closely linked to the program supported by the Enhanced
Structural Adjustment Facility approved by the IMF Board in August 1997. It also supported the
preparatory work for the upcoming Highly Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) (approved in
September 2000).

4.      The project was consistent with the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) discussions of
1998 and the draft for the proposed June 2000 CAS update. The strategy outlined in both these
documents indicates that International Development Association (IDA) support would focus on
two objectives: (a) completion of the on-going reform program including further restructuring the
economy to consolidate the benefits of the 1994 devaluation; creating a climate favorable to
private sector development and improving competitiveness so as to set the stage for faster growth;




                                                1

and alleviating poverty; and (b) use of the enhanced HIPC initiative to support second generation
reforms (governance, social sectors and poverty reduction) more rapidly and effectively.

5.       The PPPGRP was important not only to help the Government achieve its objectives under
the SAC-III, but was also viewed as a tool to shift towards economic management which would
put poverty reduction at the center of the Poverty Reduction Strategy of the Government (PRSP).
The Project Appraisal Document (PAD) noted that many of the actions supported under the
project targeted the less privileged, particularly measures in the financial sector (pension reform
and micro-finance). A series of surveys and a poverty monitoring system to be carried out under
the project were to build the information base and enhance the analysis of the roots of poverty in
Cameroon with a view of putting poverty alleviation at the core of decision-making and
integrating it into economic and sector policy and the design of efficient delivery systems for
services at the central and local levels.


1.2      Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as
         approved)

6.       The project is closely linked to the macroeconomic program and the on-going IMF
program; it also supports the preparatory work for the upcoming HIPC, and it is a follow-up to
the Privatization and Private Sector Technical Assistance Credit (PETA, Cr. 2882-CM).           The
project supports the Government's efforts to grow out of poverty through private sector led
growth and financial reform, together with a heightened emphasis on poverty alleviation. It thus
accentuates the need for greater competitiveness of the Cameroonian economy and more effective
policies and programs to deliver public services to the least privileged groups in society. The key
development objectives are to: (a) improve business environment and competitiveness through
privatization and effective public/partnership with the view to increase private investment; and
(b) strengthen the poverty alleviation focus in Government of Cameroon (GOC's) economic
management.


1.3      Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key
Indicators, and reasons/justification

7.       The project objective was not revised. In December 2004, following the mid-term review
of July 11, 2003 and March 2004, the program was adjusted to reduce the number of activities to
be carried out.    The indicators were modified in internal documents (starting in the 2005
Implementation Status and Results Report (ISRs)), but not formally revised.           In 2006, the
activities were changed. The indicators were not substantially changed from those introduced in
2005.

1.4      Main Beneficiaries

8.       The PAD noted that project beneficiaries would be the working adult population which
would benefit from increased employment in the private sector and in privatized companies, and
employees of state-owned companies who would benefit through share purchase plans and new
labor contracts which typically accompany privatization. In the medium term, project activities
would benefit the poor through analytical work to underpin pro-poor policies and the reforms in
microfinance regulations and the social security system.

1.5      Original Components (as approved)

9.       The original components as spelled out in the PAD are given below.            The Credit
Agreement explicitly provided for modification to the components, as agreed by the Government
and the World Bank from time to time to achieve the objectives of the project. This allowed for
the project description to be adjusted without requiring approval of the World Bank's Board.
Annex 2 contains the project outputs.

10.      The project will include three mutually-reinforcing components designed to improve
competitiveness and afford the poor greater access to services.

I.       Enhanced competitiveness. This component has three sets of activities:

(A)      Continuing support for privatization of public enterprises including: the main cotton
company (and attracting new investors to the sector); port-related industrial and commercial
activities; air transport companies and infrastructure; the petroleum product storage facility; the
public works' equipment company. It will include an assessment of the role of the National
Investment Company (SNI) as a potentially efficient private sector development tool, as well as
the sale of its holdings in 33 companies. It will also assist the National Petroleum Company
(SNH) to refocus on its core business. Lastly, it will launch IPOs for the formerly state owned
companies to support Government's objective of encouraging significant local participation;

(B)      Institutional support to strengthen: (a) the new regulatory agencies and committees
(telecommunications, electricity, railways, water, and air transport); (b) the Privatization
Technical Unit's capacity to provide advice and support for concessions and contracting-out of
public activities at the national and local levels and promote pilot public/private partnerships in
infrastructure and other areas; and (c) the organization and management of the Water
Development Account, the Universal Service Fund (telecommunications) and the Rural
Electrification Agency; and

(C)      Support the Competitiveness Committee, help it define and implement an action plan to
facilitate increases in firm-level productivity and streamline business regulations with a view to
reducing transaction costs, including the introduction of arbitration mechanisms, pending reforms
in the judicial branch of Government.

II.      The financial sector. This component aims to deepen the financial sector reform and
address the remaining gaps; it will seek to help:

(A)      implement the Government's reform program for the modernization of the pension
system, including breaking Caisse Nationale de Securité Sociale (CNPS) into three separate
activities (family allowances, workers' compensation and pensions), to be managed privately;

(B)      Implement the regulations applicable to micro-credit finance institutions to ensure that
they became efficient savings institutions and encourage investment through proper use of their
resources;

(C)      Refocus the Société Nationale de Recouvrement des Créances (SRC) as a for-profit debt
collection agency (factoring);




                                                 3

(D)     Restructure the postal savings office and checking banks in the absence of commercial
banks outside urban areas; and

(E)     Support the establishment of a financial market to foster long term debt and equity
financing.

III.    Partnership for poverty reduction. This component will support the creation of a
poverty alleviation unit attached to the Comité Technique de Suivi des Programmes Economiques
(CTS), in the Ministry of Finance to:

(A)     Establish a baseline for poverty through household surveys and constitution of a
database; and coordinate with civil society and other beneficiaries to monitor poverty in the
country on a regular basis; and

(B)     Help implement the Government's poverty alleviation strategy by introducing pro-active
measures aimed at placing poverty alleviation at the core of economic management decisions.

IV.     Other. The project will also: (a) finance an Administrative and Financial Unit put in place
in order to deal with all financial management and procurement issues; and (b) refinance
advances under the Project Preparation Facility (Number Q1650 for US$0.75 million).

1.6     Revised Components

The project components were not formally revised. However, the project was cut back and a
number of activities were not continued after the 2004 mid-term review (see paragraph below).

1.7     Other significant changes

The priority of activities was changed in 2004 and 2006.

11.     The 2004 revisions entailed the reallocation of funds and the documentation notes that
the changes were intended to take into account the observations in the 2002 Quality of
Supervision Report of the Quality Assurance Group (QAG) which noted the broad scope of the
project. The Closing Date was extended by two years. A matrix detailing the components that
would be retained and which would be dropped was attached to the memorandum requesting the
authorization to extend the closing date and reallocate proceeds and shared with the Government
(Memorandum of December 4, 2004 on the Extension of the Closing Date and Reallocation of
Funds for IDA Credit 3359-CM).

I.      The Competitiveness Component was scaled down as follows:

        (a)      The privatization subcomponent was narrowed down.

        (i)      Support would be: (i) continued for divestiture work on the water (SNEC), and
        telecommunications (CAMTEL) companies and the definition of programs of the
        Cameroon Development Corporation (CDC); and (ii) provided for post privatization
        activities of the electricity company (SNEC) which was facing supply problems related to
        the drought and delayed investments owing to financial difficulties in the investor group.




                                                 4

        (ii)     No further work on the cotton (SODECOTON), petroleum distribution (SCDF)
        and airline (CAMAIR) companies was programmed, as further assistance was contingent
        of Government decisions on complex sectoral/political issues.

        (iii)    The divestiture of commercial and industrial activities in the Port of Duala had
        been completed and no further support was required under the project; the same was true
        of the railway company.

        (b)      The agenda for the regulatory subcomponent was also cut back. The following
        activities were retained: (i) support of electricity regulator; (ii) analytical/regulatory work
        on public private partnerships (PPP) and private provision of infrastructure; (iii) support
        to the Rural Electrification Agency.

        (c) Changes were also introduced to the Competitiveness Committee subcomponent. The
        project would not continue financing the salaries and would only finance specific studies.

II.     No further support was envisaged for the Finance Component. Work on microfinance
had been completed and the analytical work to underpin social security and postal bank reforms
carried out. Further work entailed political decisions and therefore none was programmed.

III.    The scope of the Partnership for Poverty Reduction Component was not changed.

12.     In 2006, a second extension and reallocation of funds was authorized to enable the
project to support the objectives of the CAS Interim Strategy Note. The extension focused on
support for the private sector strategy (growth poles; improve ranking in business development
indicators) and completing the transactions in water, and telecommunications, and updating the
analytical framework for the cotton and petroleum distribution companies which had been
suspended in 2004. The privatization/liquidation of the national airline was also to be supported,
although this never materialized as the Government recruited International Finance Corporation
(IFC) to provide advisory services. Additional studies relating to the social security reform were
also added though no actual work was carried out. (Memorandum of December 22, 2006, on the
Extension of the Closing Date and Reallocation of Funds).


2.      Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes
2.1     Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

13.     The project was part of a group of interventions by the World Bank, the IMF and other
donors which sought to support the Government advance reforms aimed at increased economic
liberalization and macroeconomic stability. The project objectives were extremely broad and
innovative. It encompassed both growth and poverty issues, which both gave it flexibility to
address issues as they arose, but made implementation monitoring difficult. This view was
expressed by the QAG in its 2002 Quality of Supervision Assessment. In the Financial Sector,
the project covered activities, such as social security reform, which were not included in SAC III.

14.     Despite its broad scope which involved a number of agencies, the project had a sound
implementation arrangement in the country which worked adequately. The administrative aspects
of the project were handled by an administrative unit located in the Ministry of Finance and
Economy. The project was overseen by a Technical Committee (Comité Technique de Suivi).
Actual execution was carried out by the technical agencies. A system to carry out monitoring and



                                                  5

evaluation was not put in place, but this was not unusual for projects prepared at the time. The
breath of the project would have required the appraisal team to put in place well structured
systems to manage uncertainty, including planning, budgeting and monitoring systems which
were absent in this project. The project was based on considerable analytical work on private
sector issues and privatization carried out in the second half of the nineties, and was a follow-up
to another technical assistance project (Privatization and Private Sector Technical Assistance
Project of 1996) which was closed in 2000 and had a satisfactory outcome. The appraisal team
included specialists from the sectors addressed in the project.

15.      The design of the project built on the experience learned with the first generation reform
programs in Africa that macroeconomic reforms do not always assure a supply response.
Experience with adjustment and technical assistance operations demonstrated that the
harmonization of interventions helps ensure results. The project also drew from experiences on
the time required to bring about societal change, and noted that the project approached reform by
taking into account that Cameroonians had          been responsive in many fronts but that the
magnitude of changes planned simply required time to mature. The project also drew from best
practices developed in building partnerships, and the action plan was designed by the
Competitiveness Committee which was formed during the preparation of the project and included
heavy private sector participation and reflected bottlenecks to be addressed. The project noted
that it was being put in place three years after the Government had begun to implement important
reforms, including the privatization of the banking and electricity sectors. The project required
intensive supervision which was not anticipated in the Project Appraisal Document.

16.      The appraisal team identified critical risks including the inability of the Government to
introduce the needed measures to ensure divestiture given prevailing rents and that the
Government acted with limited commitment and did not introduce poverty reduction in its
economic decisions. The team did not explicitly note potential difficulties with the electricity
privatization, but this is not surprising as the new arrangements had just been put in place at the
time of appraisal. In the end, the risk relating to the inability of Government to proceed with
divestiture materialized although there was little that the project team could have done to mitigate
it, short of not providing assistance which was not an option as the divestiture program was
linked to SAC-III. In the end, the project was in fact helpful in advancing the divestiture dialogue
as the World Bank shifted from requiring sale of assets to newer approaches, and in helping
address difficulties following the electricity privatization. The fear that poverty issues would not
be taken into account did not materialize, and considerable analytical work was carried out early
in the project implementation period which helped underpin the dialogue on poverty issues. The
indicators were overly ambitious and detailed, which was not unusual for projects approved in
this period.

17.      The project was in line with the Country Assistance Strategy of 1998 (CAS discussion of
March 1998) and of the draft of a CAS Update programmed for 2000. The project was not only
intented to help achieve the objectives under SAC-III, but help put poverty reduction at the center
of the program. The project objectives remain valid: the Interim Strategy of November 2006
confirms the priority of fostering private sector and infrastructure development, and strengthening
PRSP implementation.


1.2      Implementation

18.      Project implementation lasted eight years and has been an important World Bank
instrument to articulate the dialogue in several areas, including telecommunications. The Credit's



                                                  6

closing date was extended twice for a total of four years. The period during implementation saw
important changes in Government policy. First, the Government's view towards privatization
changed substantially early during project implementation. This was partly in response to internal
pressures, but experience with the electricity concession and the growing concern over the limits
of infrastructure privatization in the African context also played a role. The World Bank views
towards divestiture also changed substantially during implementation. Second, the Government
began including poverty dimension in its policies. Lastly, partially triggered by the analytical
work done for the Investment Climate Assessments (ICAs), the Government has moved over the
past three years towards the view that Cameroon needs to increase its competitiveness position so
that it is more attractive for private investment. Because of its design, the project adapted to the
Government's changing priorities.

19.      The project was developed at a time of considerable optimism with respect to the
privatization agenda, following successful divestiture program in the late 1990's. However, early
during implementation it became apparent that the ambitious privatization agenda of SAC-III
which focused on the utilities would be more difficult than envisaged. Supervision reports note
that measures that the Government had been able to take with respect to electricity could not be
implemented for the water and the telecommunication companies. In late 2001, the Government
requested a reduction in the scope of the privatization component. The project scope was reduced
following the July 2003 and March 2004 mid-term review.

20.      The progress of the project towards achieving its development objective was deemed
unsatisfactory in 2002 at a time when a scaling down of the project was envisaged.
Implementation progress was rated unsatisfactory in 2004. The project has been rated moderately
satisfactory for both development outcome and implementation progress since 2005.

21.      The Quality Assurance Group carried out a Supervision Assessment in 2002 and rated
supervision a 3 or marginally unsatisfactory. The report noted that supervision was uneven:
supervision for the financial sector and poverty components seemed satisfactory whereas that for
privatization activities suffered from "the changing approaches under SAC-III". The report noted
that "...the "grab bag" nature of the project made it flexible to respond to changing needs but also
open to potential sloppiness in following appropriate fiduciary standards." In the review, the
QAG team judged the project design at entry sound and the project ready for implementation The
QAG review coincided with a change in task teams in the World Bank; the team appointed in
December 2002 conducted the mid-term review which took into account some of the changes
recommended by the QAG team, although the project objective was never formally revised.


2.3      Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

22.      The Project Appraisal Document contained mostly output indicators such as the number
of privatizations, which was the practice at the time the project was approved. The indicators
were detailed and ambitious. The QAG review noted that there was "no evidence of file that (i)
Key Performance Indicators (KPI) have been used to monitor and evaluate project performance;
nor (ii) necessary efforts to improve M&E are being undertaken".

23.      During the mid-term review some modifications to the indicators were made and
reflected in the 2005 ISRs. The changes were never formalized. A monitoring system for the
project was never put in place, although indicators recording improvement in service delivery of
the utilities were added in 2006 but not on any of the other activities. These were monitored by
the project administrative unit. In 2007, studies were commissioned on the impact of privatization



                                                  7

and on competitiveness which are helpful in evaluating the project outcomes and setting the base
for further dialogue with the Government.



2.4     Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

24.     The project suffered from organization problems at the outset. A procurement
review was carried out in 2002 and the author of this Implementation Completion and
Results Report (ICR) has been informed that it concluded that there had been no
impropriety in the handling of procurement on the part of the Government or the World
Bank. After the change in project management in 2002, financial management reports
have been prepared in a timely manner without major weaknesses, and the accounting
and project record information required for the preparation of this ICR was readily
available. The audit reports were submitted in a timely manner and the recommendations
taken into account by the project administrative unit.


2.5     Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

25.     The Privatization Committee and the Competitiveness Committees (the latter created
under the project) will continue operations. It is expected that the Competitiveness Committee
will play a role in the implementation of a Proposed Competitiveness Value Chains which will
extend work initiated under the project. The Energy Sector Development Project, approved in
June 2008, continues the support for the electricity regulatory agency and the rural electrification
company initiated under the PPPGRP. A regional telecommunications project is also under
preparation and will continue the dialogue on telecommunications initiated under this project.
The Government project team included capable staff in procurement, accounting and overall
project administration; two have already been contracted in other Government projects.


3.      Assessment of Outcomes
3.1     Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

26.     The objective of the project, which aimed to provide technical input for reforms in the
areas of competitiveness through divestiture and improved sector regulation; continue financial
sector reform and begin laying the foundation for poverty reduction strategy, remain important
today. The project was consistent with the CAS discussions of 1998 and the draft for the
proposed June 2000 CAS updates, and is in line with the objectives of the 2006 Interim Strategy
Note. The project components were in line with objectives. The arrangements to implement the
project in Cameroon were appropriate, as they left the execution of technical aspects to the
agencies charged with the respective components, and included a strong team to handle the
administrative aspects of the project. The project scope was very broad, and would have required
more than average supervision and coordination on the part of the World Bank.




                                                8

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

The project outcome is rated moderately unsatisfactory.

27.     This project has been a World Bank instrument to articulate the dialogue in a wide range
of areas and has achieved results in this regard, including a change in approach to privatization
and private provision of infrastructure. It has been one of the longest standing projects in the
Cameroonian portfolio, with two extensions to show that the project was serving a useful purpose
in the country dialogue. The project development objectives were very broad ­ to improve
business environment and competitiveness through privatization and effective public/private
partnership with the view to increase private investment; and to strengthen the poverty alleviation
focus in GOC's economic management and these were never revised. Despite important progress
in furthering these objectives, there is insufficient evidence to judge the project outcome
satisfactory. Indicators to monitor the progress of project activities in furthering these objectives
were not put in place.

28.     There is no data which would demonstrate an improved investment climate over the life
of the project (the first business indicators data was collected in 2005). Data suggests that foreign
investment has increased over the life of the project, although it is not possible to link this
increase to specific activities under the project. In the area of competitiveness, the project
supported analytical work which contributed to Government action. The work carried out led to
the sale of commercial and industrial assets in the Port of Douala. The tea company was
privatized with technical support from the project. This led to increased production, employment
and investment. On the basis of studies carried out under the project, it was determined that the
concession arrangements for the banana subsidiary were satisfactory, and the SAC-III
requirement that the company be privatized was not pursued (discussed in the Implementation
Completion and Results Report for SAC-III. In addition, studies financed under the study have
helped identify the labor plans that need to be put in place for the divestiture other subsidiaries.
CDC is the single largest employer in the English speaking southern Cameroon and Government
reports note that difficulties associated with selling these companies was not understood at the
time of the appraisal of SAC-III/PPPCRSP.

29.     The project also provided the technical support for the divestiture of SNEC, the water
company, which was completed in 2007, and for which outcomes cannot yet be measured. The
project also financed work on the divestiture of CAMTEL, and contributed to its improved
operations and service as reflected in increased investment and reduced prices of services.
Divestiture was not achieved, and improvements in sector efficiency have been the result of
increased competition with the private sector with the privatization of CAMTEL mobile and the
licensing of a second mobile operator, and telephone rates remain among the highest in the
region.   The project financed the first comprehensive analytical work on the impact of
privatization which should help define future interventions. With respect to SNEL, the power
company, the project financed studies which were preconditions for the concession agreement
and in addition provided technical assistance to renegotiate the concession agreement in 2008.

30.     The project also supported work needed to create the legal framework for private
participation in infrastructure, and the first such project, the Kribi Gas Development Corporation,
which is well advanced. The project, much larger than was anticipated at the time of appraisal,
should entail investments of US$300 million, to increase the installed generating capacity by 150
MW which is roughly equal to about one quarter of the existing capacity. It also helped
strengthen the electricity regulatory agency and the rural electricity company. It provided training
to ARSEL which has increased its capacity to monitor the concession arrangements. In addition,


                                                   9

it financed the rural electrification map which is being used to program investments in the rural
areas, and a census of autonomous electricity producers which will permit negotiations with these
producers to increase supply in the rural areas.

31.     The project supported the establishment of the Competitiveness Committee, which is now
being used as a vehicle for advancing the private sector development agenda. A study on
competitiveness and a Private Sector Strategy prepared under the project should help advance this
agenda.

32.     The project provided necessary inputs in introducing the poverty agenda (some US$4
million spent). It financed the household survey and consultative process which led to the
preparation and approval of the first PRSP in Cameroon in 2003, and subsequently, it supported
the establishment of a system designed to track poverty-related public expenditures. Studies
carried out are listed in Annex 2.

3.3     Efficiency

33.     As in most technical assistance projects, the benefits of the project are difficult to
quantify. The impact on poverty of such activities as the analytical work, the extensive consensus
building seminars, and establishment of a database which contributed to move Government
policy towards a more pro-poor agenda and to Cameroon's first PRSP, are indirect, and cannot be
readily measured.      Equally, the impact of the work carried out to strengthen and license
microfinance institutions cannot be readily quantified.

34.     A study on the socioeconomic benefits of privatization commissioned by the
Competitiveness Committee and financed under the project was completed in June 2008. Except
for SNEL, the study covered enterprises which were not supported by the project. However, its
conclusions are of a general nature. The study noted that the most important benefit related to the
fiscal impact resulting from the sale of assets and a reduction of subsidies and increasing taxes.
Industrial enterprises have increased production, investment and employment. In the
telecommunications sector, the operational and financial performance of the privatized mobile
operator improved. In the case of electricity, the benefits to the economy have been slower than
expected; the electricity company benefits have been slow to materialize, but the company has
now begun meeting its investment targets which is reflected in increased generating capacity.


3.4     Justification of Overall Outcome Rating (Combining relevance, achievement of
        PDOs, and efficiency)

Rating: moderately unsatisfactory

35.     Despite its relevance, probable contributions to efficiency and to meeting its original
objectives, the project outcome is rated moderately unsatisfactory.

36.     The project has been a major World Bank instrument to articulate the dialogue in a wide
range of areas including infrastructure, private provision of infrastructure, and more recently
investment climate and has achieved results in this regard. The project objectives while very
broad were in line with CAS objectives and remain valid today. The project design allowed for
needed flexibility at a time when there was a growing mistrust of privatization following the
results of the divestiture of the electricity company. The project financed the technical assistance
required in a broad range of activities and in so doing facilitated reforms and helped advance the


                                                  10

discussions in such areas as divestiture, and private participation in infrastructure. It also provided
timely support in the implementation and modification of the electricity concession agreement,
and more recently on the agenda for reform of the business environment. There are no sufficient
measurable outcomes to justify a satisfactory rating.

3.5      Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a)      Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

37.      The impact on poverty, gender and social development of the support for the PRSP is
indirect. Assistance to the CDC should contribute to formulating a development program which
takes into account the specificities of the region where it operates and thus contribute directly to
poverty and social development.         Improved monitoring and performance of microfinance
institutions will directly help the poor, who are the main clients of these institutions. Equally,
improvements in the rural electrification company which will doubtlessly expand the rural
electrification networks will also benefit the poor.

(b)      Institutional Change/Strengthening

38.      The project supported the establishment and early years of operation of the
Competitiveness Committee. The Committee has gained importance with the Government's
increased interest in introducing reforms aimed at improving the investment climate, and is
expected to play a role in the proposed Growth Pole Project. The project provided support for the
establishment of the rural electrification company, and the electricity and telecommunications
regulatory agencies in their early years. It was also important in establishing the legal framework
for private-public partnerships and private provision of infrastructure. The project also provided
timely support for the revisions required in the electricity concession arrangements (AES
SONEL).

39.      While the Government was not prepared to move forward with some of the reforms
proposed under technical assistance provided under the project for social security and postal
services, the assistance provided contributed to improved operations of these institutions. Lack of
political commitment probably thwarted impact of the assistance provided for CAMTEL, and the
small amount provided for CAMAIR. In the case of CAMTEL, the PPPGRP report prepared by
the project unit noted that assistance in the early 1990's helped improve its operations.

(c)      Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

40.      The project served as a vehicle to finance activities supporting the increased public
private dialogue that started after 2005 and spurred by the Investment Climate Assessments. It
also provided a vehicle for discussion on the electricity crisis in the early period of the project.

4.       Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Substantial

41.      The risk to the outcome under some project components is likely to be moderate (e.g. tea
privatization), but the rating overall is substantial. The sustainability of institutions associated
with the project such as the privatization commission and the competitiveness committee are an
open question. Progress made in the tea sector divestiture is not likely to be reversed, and there is
an expectation that the water sector divestiture will be successful even though there is always a
possibility that there will be temporary setbacks in the implementation of licensing arrangements
such as the water agreement. Other privatization activities have not advanced sufficiently to be
able to determine their eventual sustainability.

42.      Activities in the project set a process in motion to strengthen the electricity and
telecommunications institutions as well as the rural electricity agency that is likely to continue.
Activities in microfinance are also irreversible, and the sector is now increasingly regulated and
supervised by the regional banking commission. Work on poverty is not reversible as it has been
providing analytical framework for the initiation of the poverty reduction strategy of the
Government.


5.       Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
5.1      Bank Performance

(a)      Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: moderately satisfactory.

43.      The project was designed to provide technical support to a reform agenda which had been
agreed with the Government. The appraisal contained considerable analytical information. The
project was very broad and the documentation provided the flexibility to change the project
content. However, this would have required complementary features such as well structured
systems to manage the uncertainty (planning, budgeting, and monitoring) and notably criteria for
the selection of the activities to be financed during implementation.        Potential issues were
identified, although it would have been difficult to mitigate given the problems in the policy
dialogue that emerged.      The flexibility of the project enabled the World Bank to provide
assistance for problem situations such as electricity. It also enabled the Bank to use it for policy
dialogue, such as telecommunications, at a time when there were no other vehicles. In hindsight,
the project needed to have built in greater controls, but the nature of the Bank supervision work
that followed would have been difficult to foresee in the late 1990's. QAG did not carry out a
quality at entry assessment. However, in its assessment the QAG team judged the project design
at entry sound and the project ready for implementation at approval.

(b)      Quality of Supervision
(including of fiduciary and safeguards policies)

Rating: unsatisfactory




                                                12

44.     The project was broad and loosely defined and would have required discipline in
supervision. The task manager who appraised the project and was highly regarded in the country
was last involved at effectiveness in December 2000.

45.     Supervision was uneven, although less intense than it is typical for IDA projects.
Supervision in the last year of the project was largely satisfactory, but this does not compensate
for the problems in the early years of implementation. The project was managed by six task
managers although the last two were charged with the project in the last year of implementation.
At project startup, a sector specialist who was posted in Cameroon supervised his component, and
granted non objections for other components, but was not formally the task manager. QAG
reports noted that supervision in this early period was carried out by sector specialists following
up on the SAC-III conditions, which in itself was acceptable, but that there was a lack of
coordination of project activities. The first Task Manger visited Cameroon in 2002. The records
show that between 2002 and December 2007, field visits averaged a little more than one a year
which is insufficient. Supervisions by sector specialists do not appear in the project records.
Reporting was insufficient, and not all field missions prepared aide memoires: during 2002-2007;
about one aide memoire was prepared per year (including the July 2003 and March 2004 mid-
term report). After 2002, the teams generally included sector specialists, following a
recommendation of the QAG assessment on the need for improved coordination of the sector
specialists, particularly infrastructure.

46.     The Mid-Term review process lasted between March and November 2004 (when the
Aide Memoire for the mid-term was prepared). The amendment reallocating proceeds and
extending the closing date was finalized in December 2004. The project should have been
restructured at mid-term review, given the extent of the reduction in the scope of the project.
Also, in hindsight, it would have been preferable to narrow the project objective, as suggested in
the QAG supervision assessment. Lastly, there was a need to introduce planning budgeting,
monitoring systems to follow up implementation. The reluctance to restructure the project was
probably linked to budgetary considerations as restructuring exercises are staff intensive and thus
costly. There is also some evidence that World Bank staff was discouraged by the slow progress
of key Government decisions. The legal documents did provide for the possibility of changing
the project description, but a formal restructuring of the project including changes of indicators
would have helped clarify the changes for both the Government and the World Bank.

47.     With respect to the substance of the Mid-term review, the decision to stop support for
privatizations which had strong political dimension was correct. On the other hand, the decision
to reduce support for the regulatory agencies, particularly the telecommunications agency,
delayed necessary work on the regulatory field. The activities to be carried out in the last two
years of the project as spelled out in the 2006 Closing Date documentation was ambitions, given
the experience.

48.     The completion report of the SAC-III notes that during the Mid-Term review period there
were substantial delays in obtaining non-objections; this is confirmed by World Bank staff who
was involved in the project at the time.

49.     Despite supervision problems outlined above, the World Bank teams responded flexibly
to the changing needs of the Government's program, for instance in addressing the energy crisis,
and in providing inputs for the private sector strategy. With the emergence of problems with the
energy sector early in the project, the PPPRCP was a vehicle for discussion of the sector.




                                                 13

50.      The project is associated with the failure of the CAMAIR transaction when in fact it had
little involvement in it. In the mid-term review it was explicitly left out because of its political
dimensions. In 2006 the possibility was left open but in fact the assistance never materialized as
IFC was recruited to assist with privatization.

51.      The quality of Supervision was rated by the Quality Assurance Group in 2002 as a 3
marginally unsatisfactory (discussed above)

(c)      Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Rating: unsatisfactory

52.      The project had a flexible design that served the country well but would have required
greater specificity on the criteria for selecting activities to be financed under project. World Bank
supervision was unsatisfactory; the project should have been restructured to provide the necessary
clarity in objectives, content and procedures. Given the importance of supervision to the overall
outcome, the overall performance of the World Bank is rated unsatisfactory.


5.2      Borrower Performance

(a)      Government Performance

Rating: unsatisfactory

53.      The lack of Government commitment to key other reforms, discussed below, explains the
rating. The Government's support for the introduction of the poverty agenda in Government
programs as well as its tacit support to some improvements in the regulatory framework for
electricity contributed the project objectives.

54.      While the Government indicated a commitment to increasing competitiveness, the reality
was that support for some key measures, particularly those relating to privatization was not
forceful. The Government began to open to dialogue with the private sector in the past two years
with the creation of consultative groups with the private sector and increase dialogue on
improving the environment for private sector operations. The lukewarm support in the early years
of the project to the competiveness agenda was reflected in a limited program of the
Competitiveness Committee, which only began to promote its agenda in the recent past. In
privatization, the attitude remains lukewarm, and key enterprises such as CAMTEL remain
inexplicably under public control.       The cautious attitude seemed to encourage anti- reform
officials to delay implementation efforts. The Government was also slow in forging consensus on
planned reforms with critical constituency groups. This view is similar to that expressed in the
SAC-III completion report.

(b)      Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

Rating: moderately satisfactory

55.      The performance of the Government implementation agency, the CTS, is moderately
satisfactory.   The role of the CTS in this project was largely administrative, and the
administrative unit in CTS performed its functions in a satisfactory manner. The rating is
lowered because the committee itself seems to have moved slowly in taking required actions,


                                                   14

such as the dissemination of key reports. In general, the agencies implementing the respective
activities carried them out in a satisfactory manner, although implementation was hampered by
the unwillingness of the Government to take key decisions.               The performance of the
Competitiveness Committee reflected the lack of Government commitment to its agenda.

(c)      Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

Rating: unsatisfactory.

The judgment is based on the role of Government actions in the project as discussed above.


6.       Lessons Learned

56.      Technical Assistance projects with a broad scope can be useful in addressing
changing requirements of sectoral policy reform programs, but require structured systems
and procedures to manage the uncertainty of the original definition and skilled supervision.
The project scope could be adapted as the policies of the Government and the Word Bank
changed. For instance, the project was able to support changing approaches to privatization; the
electricity sector reform at the beginning of the project and studies to help define Government
policy on private sector towards the end of the project.         Broadly defined projects require
structured systems such as planning, budgeting and monitoring such as annual reviews of
programs should be incorporated in legally binding implementation arrangements. Skilled and
consistent supervision is also required

57.      Technical assistance projects are rarely adequate vehicles for policy dialogue.
Technical assistance operations can support broad reforms but their objectives cannot be defined
in the same way as the program it supports. This needs to be explicitly stated in the project
documents.

58.      A concise articulation of expected outcomes translated into monitoring indicators is
important for project success. There was an understanding early in the project by both the
Government and the World Bank that the scope of the project was too broad and ambitious.
Project activities were cut back but measurable outcomes were never formally revised, which
contributed to the sense that the project lacked direction. The need for clear articulation of
outcomes is true for all projects, but is particularly important for broadly defined projects which
cover more than one sector or specialization. A formal review and revision of indicators should
be built into the legal documentation of the project. With increased focus on outcomes, appraisal
documents now have more appropriate indicators at the outset, but the problem persists during the
implementation of both old and new projects.

59.      Realistic scheduling contributes to the success of the project.        The scheduling of
activities was very optimistic but these were not modified despite recommendations of the QAG
to this end.

60.      A serious commitment by the World Bank to supervision is important. Insufficient
and inadequate supervision, particularly of the privatization component, contributed to poor
results. The project had about one field visits a year on average which is low, even taking into
account that there was staff in the field office at some points who could follow the project (in the
first two years and six months at the end of the project). The problems with the supervision of this



                                                  15

project were not only related to budgets, but it is likely that adequate budgets would have
permitted better supervision of the privatization work.       Also, adequate budgets may have
encouraged staff to formally restructure the project, which is time consuming and costly. For
projects with multiple components requiring multiple specialist inputs, the Task Manager could
reside in the country.

61.      The indicator of bringing public enterprises to the point of sale does not
normally reflect progress in privatization. This indicator was introduced in early
privatization programs when it was believed that the World Bank could not include the
actual privatization as an indicator/requirement.         In fact, the notion of bringing an
enterprise to the point of sale is a relevant indicator only in the case that there are no
buyers after a bidding process.

62.      A project should be restructured when the design needs adjustments or when
conditions have changed. In the case of this project, it became clear early on that Government
priorities had changed; it should also have been clear that the planning/budgeting arrangements
for the project were too loose.

63.      This project confirms broader lessons learned from the implementation of World Bank
projects in general. These are consistent with the conclusions of a study conducted by the sector
unit to evaluate the recent performance of Private Sector and Finance Projects.

64.      Sustained Government commitment is key to successful reform. The divestiture of
CAMTEL was delayed partly because of insufficient Government commitment. On the other
hand, the increased focus on poverty starting in 2001-2002 was the result of the Government's
willingness to address poverty issues.

65.      Adequate Monitoring and Evaluation system should be set up early in project
implementation. The key performance indicators that were defined appeared to be excessive in
number and in many cases called for data that was not readily available. The staff team to carry
out the monitoring was never defined.

Annex 2.         Outputs by Component

I.       Enhanced competitiveness

A.       Support for privatization of public enterprises

Project output indicators were that four companies were brought to the point of sale and the
commercial and industrial activities of the port of Douala be privatized. The transaction for the
privatization of the operations of the water company operations was completed in December 2007
and the tea companies of CDC sold. CAMTEL and CAMAIR were brought to the point of sale,
but not privatized, in large measure because the Government was not ready to proceed with the
divestiture of these companies. The divestiture of the commercial and industrial activities of the
Port of Douala was completed.

Outcomes defined after the mid-term review included the reduction of the cost of international
telecommunications and increased services. As noted elsewhere in the report, sale of the tea
company did increase output, investment and employment, while the liberalization of the
telecommunications sector contributed to improved services and reduced prices and the
privatization of the electricity sector probably halted the deterioration of the sector. The project
provided support for the following:

Cameroon Development Corporation (CDC)

The project financed studies which helped gain a better understanding of the issues associated
with CDC and helped achieve the divestiture objectives of the SAC. CDC is the single largest
employer in the English-speaking province in southern Cameroon.             The SAL objective of
privatizing the production companies in CDC was partially met, with the privatization of the tea
company. This led to an increase in planted surface, yield and production. It also contributed to
increased employment and contract farming. The banana company was not sold, but was under a
management contract with Del Monte. This arrangement has also led to a significant increase in
production efficiency. The SAC completion report and the mid-term review of the PPPRCP
noted that the specificity of the situation relating to the banana company where CDC had a
production agreement with DELMONTE was not fully understood in the preparation of the SAC;

Studies and work financed under the project included assistance for the initial divestitures. In
2001 the following studies/technical assistance was carried out: a diagnostic study of CDC; an
assessment of the tea subsidiary; and an inventory of plantations and production of all
subsidiaries. In 2004, an evaluation of the prospects for the privatization of CDC companies
which had not yet been privatized; a diagnostic and an assessment of the contract between CDC
and DELMONTE. The work carried out under the project was directly related to the sale of the
three CDC companies. In 2007-2008, a social plan for the remaining enterprises and an analysis
of taxation issues was carried out. These studies update information on remaining plantations,
that the lands that could be transferred to the population. It also provided an estimate of the costs
of staff reduction plans where required.

Cameroon Cotton Company (SODECOTON)

At mid-term, support for the cotton company, SODECOTON, was suspended as the there was
considerable work required to proceed with the sector reform and the Government was not ready


                                                 18

to proceed with the work at the time. In the last year of the project, a technical, financial and
operational audit was carried out as input for the reform of the cotton sector.

Electricity (SNEL)

The transaction to privatize through concession of the state-owned vertically integrated power
utility was substantially completed when the PPPRCP became effective, and the project was not
expected to provide support for the company. The project financed the audit of audit of SONEL
accounts as of June 30, 2001 and the assessment of the privatization transaction in 2002. In
addition, under the regulation component (below) the project financed advisory services to revise
the concession in 2008.

SNEC (Water) US$920,000

The project was associated with the privatization of the water company since the outset. An
unsuccessful attempt at outright privatization had been made in the nineties, and consulting
services for the evaluation of the offer by Société Lyonnaise des Eaux was financed under the
project in 2001. Starting in 2005, the project supported a privatization advisor which assisted the
Government in defining a new divestiture plan and led to the signature of lease contract with a
consortium led by ONEP of Morocco, and the establishment of the new patrimony company
CAMWATER.

CAMTEL

The project financed the preparation and implementation of a business plan in 2003-05. The
audit of CAMTEL accounts carried out at the time was used to settle the Government accounts
with CAMTEL. A report prepared by the PPRCRP Administrative Unit notes that under the
business plan CAMTEL increased collections and subscribers. The project also financed a
privatization advisor which helped define and implement a privatization strategy for CAMTEL.
One technically-qualified offer was received in 2007 but the government did not finalize the
transaction. The Government decided to consider options, including using a leasing arrangement
similar to that used for the water company, which might not be appropriate for
telecommunications. The Government also intends to license another mobile operator. Two
mobile operators were licensed in 2001 (one taking over the operations of the CAMTEL mobile
company) which contributed to increased service and reduced costs for telephone services during
the project period. In spite of progress, rates are high compared to other African countries
because of the lack of competition between the two mobile operators and the continued control by
CAMTEL of some services. Follow-up work on CAMTEL will be carried out under the Regional
Telecommunications Project which is under preparation.

CAMAIR (Airline).

In 2002, a diagnostic study to reinitiate the privatization process of CAMAIR was carried out
under the project which provided alternative approaches to privatization. The mid-term review
team excluded CAMAIR from the project as its privatization prospects were low given its
political dimension. The Government requested that the privatization of CAMAIR be included in
the project in 2006 (it was not among the enterprises considered at appraisal). In the end, the
Government appointed IFC to advice on privatization. This led to the preliminary selection of a
buyer but the transaction was not completed.




                                                 19

SCNP (Petroleum Distribution Company).

A preparatory study for the privatization of the Petroleum Distribution Company (SCNP) was
carried out and a privatization strategy spelled out in 2002-2003, but this activity was stopped at
Mid-Term review, as the Government did not take a decision to proceed. The study permitted the
revision of decrees relating to the regulation and liberalization of the sector, including regulations
related to the management of strategic stocks and on access to storage facilities.

Port of Douala

The project provided initial support to the transfer of activities to the private sector. The project
financed a study which defined the modalities for transfer of port activities to the private sector
and the conditions for implementation. The concession/sale of industrial and commercial
activities, including the ice plant, towing and the container terminal were concluded in 2004. No
further support was envisaged under the project. Operations in the port have improved during the
project period although these cannot be attributed solely to the divestiture program financed
under the PPPCRP. The port reforms had important benefits. The Completion report for the SAC
III pointed to increased performance in the port (the length of stay in ports has changed as follows
between 1999 and 2006:

                 1999             2005
Imports:         23-25 days       7 days
Exports:         5-7 days         2 days


The project also supported the port reform and assistance for customs. In the ports, it financed
studies to strengthen the information system which contributed to the reduction of transit time for
merchandise and the one stop wind in the port and an information system for the whole port
platform. On customs, the project also financed technical assistance for customs, which
contributed to the finalization adoption of statutes for the staff of the ports and the finalization of
legislation on international regulations on costs of imported goods data systems and other reforms
needed for the customs reform. (Financed under the competitiveness committee component)

(b)      Support to new regulatory agencies and the Privatization Technical Unit

The PAD listed a broad variety of institutions which could have been supported under the project;
the mid-term review narrowed the agencies to: (a) the electricity and telecommunications
regulatory agencies; (b) the Privatization Technical Unit to improve its capacity to provide
support for concessions and contracting-out of public activities and promote pilot public/private
partnerships; and (c) strengthening the Rural Electrification Agency.

Technical Commission on Privatization and Liquidation; Electricity and Telecommunications
Regulation

Activities supported under the project helped strengthen ARSEL and ART and train their staff.
Work under the project also helped in defining the scope of activities of each sector institution.
The project helped establish the legal and regulatory framework for non-concession utility
producers. At the present time the first private provision of infrastructure project, the Kribi Gas
project, is expected to be operational soon.




                                                 20

The project helped strengthen ARSEL, the electricity regulatory body, in the execution of its
mandate (concession oversight, consumer protection etc). Studies were carried out to help
determine the functions of sector institutions, particularly the rural electrification agency and an
audit of electricity consumption in the public sector with a view to increasing efficiency of use.
In addition, technical assistance was provided on the separation of accounts of the electricity
company into generation, transmission and distribution (a concession obligation Technical
assistance was also provided to assist in the renegotiation of the AES SONEL concession, and
preconditions for the concession including an inventory of AES SONEL assets and a separation
of assets in AES SONEL (08). About 12 senior staff of ARSEL was trained abroad under the
project which helped increase competencies in the institution

In addition, the project financed a rural electrification map which will serve to program
investments in the rural areas. It also financed a census of autonomous electricity producers
which will permit negotiations with these producers to increase supply particularly in the rural
areas.

With respect to ART, the telecommunications commission, early in the project technical
assistance to ART was provided as a continuation to work under the Private Sector Development
and Privatization project in 2001. Also, 12 ART senior staff was trained abroad between 2002
and 2005 and a seminar for consumers was carried out in 2007. Support for ART was suspended
after the mid-term as the Bank team concluded that the agency had sufficient funds to finance its
own training and technical assistance.

The project supported the Privatization Commission in the definition of the framework for public-
private partnerships and in the implementation of the first such partnership in Cameroon, the
Kribi Power Development Corporation (KPDC).

The assistance in 2003 included

    · a study to determine the organizational arrangements for the provision of electricity
        services without using a concession arrangement
    · the preparation of IPP sample contract documents.
    · an inventory of autonomous energy producers

In 2007-2008, the project supported:

    · an audit of the gas price destined to the Kribi power station
    · technical assistance of an experienced legal advisor during negotiations of a contract
        amendment;
    · a review of the Legal and regulatory framework of the KPDC (Kribi)


The Privatization Commission commissioned a study financed udder the project which includes
an analysis of the impact of privatization on employment, output and government revenues. It
also provides comments on the factors contributing to outcomes and lessons learned, including
the role of public-private partnerships. The study also provides recommendations on CAMTEL
and CAMAIR. The privatization study which has been distributed within Government should
serve as the basis for further discussions with donors, if these decide to continue support the
privatization agenda.

AER (Rural Electrification Agency)

The project provided substantial assistance to strengthening of AER throughout the project
period, including technical assistance and training for staff. Specifically, in 2002\2003, the
project supported assistance to strengthen the organizational structure and trained staff. It also
assisted in the preparation of an investment plan for the sector and with the creation of the Rural
Electrification Fund which is in the process of being established. The project funded a seminar on
the development of rural electrification in Cameroon; the preparation of a rural electrification
map, and an inventory of SME in the Cameroon electricity sector. Activities under the project set
the basis for the continued Bank support for AER which is being provided under the Energy
Sector Project approved in 2008.

(c)     Support to the Competitiveness Committee

The Competitiveness Committee was established in connection with the project with the objective
of helping define and implement an action plan to facilitate increases in firm-level productivity
and streamline business regulations with a view to reducing transaction costs. The committee
helped define the project scope, but subsequently had a slow start, probably reflecting the
Government ambivalence towards increased private participation in economic activity. At mid-
term review, the Bank decided to suspend the financing the Committee staff as it felt the
committee was not fulfilling its functions, and to focus on financing specific studies that needed
to be carried out. In 2002, the Committee sponsored a seminar on reforms for the private sector.
Key studies were launched in 2007-2008 to assist the Government in defining new options on
restarting the PSD agenda. This coincided with the Government steps to improve the business
environment, including the establishment of the organization of the Cameroon Business Form
with the IFC and the Prime Minister's Investment Council.

A private sector development strategy and a study on factor costs should directly help in defining
the agenda and a study on the impact of privatization in Cameroon. A separate study on the
identification of new value-added chains was incorporated within the larger PSP strategy work
under way. These studies should provide input in the preparation of the proposed Growth Poles
Project.

II      The Financial Sector

This component aimed to deepen the financial sector reform which had made substantial progress
in the nineties and address the remaining gaps following substantial reforms in the nineties.
Work on the financial sector was largely suspended at the mid term review. The assessment at the
time was that most of the critical studies to underpin reforms notably in the social security system
and the postal savings bank (neither included in SACIII) had been carried out and that further
work required government decisions. In the case of microfinance, the objectives of the
component had been achieved.

Social Security Reform

Analytical work carried out in 2001-03 outlined a reform program for social security system but
Government was not ready to move forward with these reforms at the time. Work carried out in
2001 included studies/analytical work on: (a) treasury and liquidity issues; (b) the legal structure;
(c) extension of the social security system to the informal sector; (d) actuarial; (d) the state in the
social security system and systems for transition form one system to the other; and (e) health
insurance were carried out in 2001. In 2002 a study on asset valuation and an ILO support on


                                                 22

records were carried out. A last study on the benefits for public sector staff were carried out in
2003. With financing from the project, the ILO prepared a list of beneficiaries, which led to the
reduction of some 20,000 beneficiaries and costs of US$1.6 million dollars per year.


Microfinance

The project permitted to expand financial sector reforms to microfinance. The project supported
the collection and analysis and of the financial statements of microfinance institutions in
Cameroon; provided training and information on the regional regulations on microfinance (five
staff in the Ministry of Finance Trained). It also provided support to microfinance institutions
with problems notably NISCAM. An inventory of 714 microfinance institutions was carried out
of which 368 were licensed; 205 closed and 508 not licensed to operate. This enabled the
licensing of qualified institutions in the early period of the project.

Postal Savings

Consultants were recruited to prepare financial statements; put in place a new organizational
structure and improvements in the information system.

III.     Partnership for Poverty Reduction.

A key objective of the project was to introduce the poverty dimension into economic policy
making and to a large extent the project accomplished this objective early on.

The project financed a household survey which built into it the gathering of poverty data; the
analysis of the data in 2002-2003 which provided inputs for Cameroon's first PRSP. In addition
the project supported the establishment of systems to monitor public expenditures and on the
satisfaction of beneficiaries on health and education public investment, and subsequently a survey
on employment on the informal sector informal employment. The data base generated by these
surveys will continue to contribute to the definition of poverty alleviation programs.

The project also supported consultations on the PRSP, which was a requirement for HIPC
eligibility.  In addition, the project financed a study on judicial reform in Cameroon, essential
for private sector investment, and defined an action program including reinforcement of the
judiciary; fight against corruption; improvement in application of laws; decisions and sanctions;
(improvements in working conditions.          The project also supported training of staff in the
judiciaries.

Studies financed included:
    · Agriculture and Poverty Reduction
    · Industry and Services and Poverty Reduction
    · Study on private sector and poverty reduction
    · Seminar on national network in fight against poverty
    · PRSP consultations
    · Private sector health services

Annex 3.        Economic and Financial Analysis
(including assumptions in the analysis)

The study covered three agro-industrial enterprises, rubber, palm oil and sugar, and four
infrastructure enterprises, two mobile telecommunications operators; the electric power
and the railways.      The study noted that significant benefits accrued as a result of
privatization but that these were less than in other countries. The most important benefit
related to the fiscal impact (privatization proceeds totaled US$240 million). In addition,
privatization reduced the fiscal impact of state enterprises, by reducing subsidies and
increasing taxes (US$600 million collected between 2003 and 2006. Even if at the outset
the Government implemented a major retrenchment program (40 percent of the total
number of employees from privatized enterprises privatization made it possible to
maintain employment in all enterprises; agro-industrial enterprises kept the pre-
privatization levels of employment). The palm oil and sugar companies are now hiring.
Privatization also led to an improvement in the working conditions for those that
remained in the state enterprises as real wages increased and social contributions and
social benefits were paid.       Overall, the operational and financial performance of
privatized enterprises improved, especially in the case of mobile phone companies. In
the case of electricity the benefits were much slower than expected.
