1. 
Country and Sector Background 
 
The 
Programme National de Lutte contre le SIDA (PNLS)
 was established in 1989. A 
Multisectoral National AIDS Coordinating Committee (NAC) was established in 2002 under the 
Prime Minister chairmanship.  The NAC created the National HIV/AIDS Executive Secretariat 
(NAES) which is located within the Ministry of Health (MSAS). A UN Theme Group on AIDS 
was formed under the chairmanship of WHO, and a technical committee was created to address 
specific aspects of a national strategy using as a framework the UNGASS.
 
2. 
Government’s Initial Response to HIV/AIDS 
 
The national program had a weak beginning but attitudes changed from 1999 to the present. The 
Government's response to the unfolding HIV/AIDS situation has been to focus primarily on its 
medical and health aspects under the leadership of the MSAS and PNLS. HIV drew limited 
attention from the national leadership because it was a taboo subject, there were virtually no 
visible signs that HIV/AIDS existed, and the widely held notion was that the national culture and 
behavior shielded the country from the epidemics.  Under the leadership of the PNLS, with 
Page  2
WHO support and encouragement, an advocacy effort was launched to sensitize opinion makers. 
As a result, religious leaders became increasingly receptive to reaching out to their constituents 
with a message of tolerance for those infected, and recognition of the need to educate the 
population on the risks, and means to avoid its transmission. "Stop SIDA" was developed by an 
Imam.4.0. 
 
Community involvement proved fundamental for an effective campaign. Community, civil 
society, and private sector activities were needed to support prevention as well as care of those 
infected and affected. Such efforts helped empower communities at different levels to heighten 
the level of awareness of the general population, fight discrimination against individuals infected 
and/or affected by the HIV virus, and be an incentive for individuals to seek prevention and care 
services when needed. Strong emphasis was placed on counseling of both patients and families. 
 
3. 
Rationale for Bank Involvement 
HIV prevalence rate in Mauritania is still low (below 1%) in the general population, but the 
current data (UNAIDS 2006) indicate that the epidemic is evolving. 
Mauritania’s government 
budget alone would not be sufficient to prevent the spread of the pandemic.  Further, if numerous 
donors are involved, their financial contribution remains modest.  With project activities aiming 
at building structures and capacities for prevention and treatment of HIV infections, the project 
contributes - together with other interventions - to an improvement of the situation. 
4.  Rationale for project restructuring 
The project was designed during a period when the Bank was the principal financier resulting in 
a
rather detailed project design which left little room for adaptation to the current situation in the 
country.  Also, data collection and reporting situation were very poor at the time and did not 
permit targeting. Therefore, without changing the core activities of the project, the Government 
proposed a simplified project design better targeting high-risk and vulnerable groups, while at 
the same time continuing efforts at targeting the general population. The four project components 
are maintained; while the sub-components are reduced from 16 to 9.  Also, the initial PDO 
(
to 
maintain the level of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection that causes the acquired 
immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) below the prevalence rate of 1 percent and reduce opportunistic 
infections
)
is recognized as unrealistic due to inclusion of HIV prevalence for several specific 
target groups. The KPIs are not realistic and need to be adapted to the changed PDO.  To support 
implementation of the simplified Project reallocation of funds is needed to drop the activities that 
are not longer appropriate to achieve the project outcomes. 
 
5. Objective 
The revised Project Development Objective is
 
to increase the coverage and utilization of HIV 
prevention services, of medical treatment and social care, especially for high risk and vulnerable 
populations. 
 
6. Description 
 
The Project has the following parts:

8. Implementation 
 
Agreements have been signed with eight line ministries for activities that focused on 
sensitization and distribution of contraceptives. The Ministry of Defense has introduced 
systematic testing of all new recruits. Also, with regards to the health sector response, the project 
has financed eight sentinel sites covering the majority of the country. An ambulatory treatment 
center was created thanks to a partnership among the Government, IDA, the French cooperation 
and French Red Cross. Furthermore, a center for prevention of Mother-To-Child- Transmission 
was opened based on collaboration among the Government, IDA, UNICEF, and AWARE. The 
project has also financed the establishment of three voluntary testing centers as well as for 
distribution of contraceptives. The Civil Society response has been important, and a private 
sector Coalition of Mauritanian Enterprises for HIV/AIDS control has been set up with the 
support of the project.  Progress has been made to improve the M&E capacity with the 
identification of the need to institute a bio-behavioral surveillance survey for HIV, the 
development of the TOR for the study and the initiation of the study which is now in progress 
(with GAMET support).
 
9. Sustainability 
Page  6
The sustainability of the program will largely depend on the degree to which: (i) the present 
high-level commitment to fight the disease is maintained over time; (b) the coordinated 
multisector participatory approach is fully owned and appreciated by all stakeholders; (c) 
national HIV/AIDS mechanisms put in place are performing effectively; (d) key sectors engage 
in the fight against HIV/AIDS; and (e) efforts to inform all Mauritanians and change behavior 
are successful.  As a result of this diagnosis, the project is focusing on: (i) capacity-building; (ii) 
demand-driven processes; (iii) ownership and accountability; (iv) communication strategies; and 
(v) M&E. 
 
With respect to financial sustainability, the Mauritanian fight against HIV/AIDS will require 
external financial support for an extended period and especially at community level.  
 
10. Lessons Learned from Past Operations in the Country/Sector 
 
Key lessons learned and incorporated in the project design are: 
·
HIV/AIDS effort must be multisectoral and focused on development, focus that 
should be reflected by leadership; 
·
A
multisectoral oversight body at the highest government level is needed; and 
·
Outsourced key management functions will improve procurement, efficiency, 
timeliness of funds transfer and other fiduciary tasks.
