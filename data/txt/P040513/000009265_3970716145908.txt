INTROODUCTION
The road improvement program for poverty alleviation (RIPA) is an integral part of Henan II
Highway Project. The first batch of such projects involve 31 road segments included in 12
systems distributed in 10 poverty counties in 5 cities and prefectures of Henan Province. See
Table 1 for brief descriptions and Map 1 for locations of these projects.
These segments are small in size and at low grades. Out of the 31 segments, 5 (with a grand
length of 80 km) are to be newly constructed, while the rest 26 segments (with a total length
of 766 km) are upgrading of existing roads. The total cost of these segments is estimated at
301.05 million RMB.
Since these road segments are large in number and most of them are upgrading of existing
roads, the sectoral environmental assessment approach is proposed to be applied.
In line with project descriptions and field surveys, these projects are classified into two
categories, namely,
Category A projects: those which may have potentially significant environmental
impacts. This category includes new road construction, upgrading of existing roads
with substantial widening and land acquisition, and other road upgrading projects
passing through environmentally special ares such as natural reserves, sanatoriums,
historical sites and cultural relics.
Category B projects: those which are not expected to have significant environmental
impacts. This category includes widening, improving and upgrading of existing roads
without substantial land acquisition and relocation.
For Category A projects, both EIAs and EAPs are required, but Category B projects only need
EAPs.
As screened and identified, the first batch RIPA projects under Henan II Highway Project are
classified as shown in Table 2.
Laws/regulations and standards related to the first batch RIPA roads under Henan II Highway
Project are as follows:
Laws and Reoulations
(a)   Environmental Protection Law of the People's Republic of China (PRC);
(b)   Air Pollution Control Law of PRC;
(c)   Water Pollution Control Law of PRC;
(d)   Noise Control Regulation of PRC;
(e)   Cultural Relics Preservbaion Law of PRC;

(f)   Land Management Law of PRC;
(g)   Environmental Protection Management Measures for Construction Projects (NEPA
document No. 003, 1986);
(h)   Environmental Protection Management Measures for Transportation Construction
Projects (MOC document No. 17, 1990);
(i)   Regulations on Environmental Protection of Construction Projects in Henan Province.
Environmental Standards
As agreed by the local environmental protection agencies, environmental standards applied to
the EIA of RIPA projects are as follows:
(a)   Class II standards of Atmospheric Air Quality Standards (GB3095-82);
(b)   Class IV standards of (Class II standards for schools and hospitals) of Noise Standards
for Urban Areas (GB3096-93); and
(c)   Class IV standards of Surface Water Quality Standards (GPt3838-88).

1,          ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASESSMENI OF CATEGORY A PROJECTS
(IncludIng 5 Road Seaments In a Systems)
1.1         Project Description
1.1.1       7# Road System
This system includes altogether 2 Category A projects, namely, 7-2# and 7-#, which are
distributed in Shongxian County of Luoyang City.
1.1.1.1     Location and Alignment
7-2# Segment {Baihe-Baiyunshen): Starting at Tianqiaogou in the southwest part of Shongxian
County, this road goes southwest along the Baihe River for 9 km to reach the Baihe River, and
then it stretches 16 km before it ends at Baiyunshan close to Tudimiaogou. The total length
is 25 km.
7-2# Segment (Muzhijia-Chantang): The start point is at Muzhijie Xiang which is located at
k44 + 050 of the road from Luhun reservo.r to Checun Village. Going southwest along the
Chantang River to pass by Getashang, Shimen and Hengchunao, this segment covers 18 km
before it ends at Chantang Village.
1.1.1.2     Main Technical Indices and Work Quantities
The main technical and work quantities of 7-2# and 7-3# segments included in 7# system are
as delineated in Table 1-1-1.
7-2 segment is partly upgrading of existing road. Its newly constructed part will be based on
the existing non-all-weather earth subgrade which will be widened to 6.5 m. Also, the surface
condition will be improved for the earth road to be turned into an all-weather segment. As a
matter of fact, this segment is just as a new project.
As for 7-3# segment, there exists a subgrade which is only 3 m wide. As a simple path, the
existing road makes it impossible for vehicles to pass on in case of rainy days. Also, there is
adequate provision of bridges and culverts. This proposed project involves widening the
subgrade to 6.5 m, additional provision of bridges/culverts and improvement of the road
surface. In this way, it will turn an all-weather road. This segment is also considered as a new
project.
7-2# segment includes 9 km along the Baihe River, while 7-3# segment goes along the
Chantang River at its full length of 18 km.
The design life span of both 7-2# and 7-3# segments is 15 years.
1.1.1.3     Construction Schedule
Preparation works of both 7-2# and 7-3# segments will be completed by the year of 1995.
Both segments, started in early 1995, will be completed to be open to traffic in late 1996.

1.1.2       14# Road System
This system consists of 14-2# and 14-3# segmP:its both of which are Category A projects and
are located in Mianchi County.
1.1.2.1     Location and Alignment
14-2# Segment (Tianchi-Hongyang): Starting at Tianchi Xiang which lies in the southeast of
Mianchi County, it leads northeast to pass across the Jianhe River and Long-Hai railway, then
it trends north to and at Hongyang Xiang in the east of the county which it connects national
road No. 310. The total length is 12 krr.
14-3# Segment (Tianchi-Yima): Covering a total length of 10 km, it starts at Tianchi Xialig,
links 14-4# segment (Category A project) and then and ends at the south part of Yima City.

1.2         Brief Description of Physloenvironmental and Socioeconomic Situation
1.2.1       Physioenvironment
1.2.1.1     7# Road System
Both 7-2# and 7-3# segments included in 7# system are Category A projects, with the former
being located in the south part and the latter in the middle of Shongshan County. The former
goes 9 km along river banks and then 16 km in mountain areas, while the latter accompanies
river banks at its full length of 1 8 km.
Being in the western mountain area of Henan Province, Shongshan County is between the
north foot of the Mount Funiu and its branches Fangshan and Xionger. It falls within the
continental monsoon climatic zone with 4 distinct seasons. This county enjoys abundant
mineral resources such as gold, phosphorous, potassium, lead, copper, bolognian stone and
fluorite which are of super quality and large deposits. The local eco-environmental is good,
with forests distributed in extensive areas which cover 44.4% of the total land area. There
are many plant species, including some famous and valuable Chinese medical herbs. There live
some wildlife in mountain areas.
1.2.1.2     14# Road System
This system includes 2 segments, namely, 14-2# and 14-3#, which are both Category A
projects distributed in pediment hillyland areas of Mianchi County.
Located in the west part of Henan Province, Mianchi County is adjacent to the Yellow River
in the north. The Taihang Mountain stands in the north, with an average elevation about 600
m and a maximum of 1462 m at the summit of Shaoshan. The south part is broken county at
an elevation ranging from 200 to 600 m. The weather here is temperate continental monsoon
with 4 distinct seasons. But it is relatively dry and drought-prone. The annual average
temperature and precipitation is separately 1 2.3°C and 704 mm, with a frost-free period of
220 days in the year.
Both segments passes through loess broken country with poor eco-environment and lower
vegetation coverage. So the soil here is erosion-prone. Coal is the predominating mineral
deposit, with many mines distributed here. Most of the plants are common species which do
not have high ecological requirements. Large wildlife has not been found recently. The Yellow
River and Jianhe FRiver are the major rivers passing through the county.

1.2.1.3    21 # Road System
21-2# segment included in 21 # system is a Category A project located in the northeast part
of Xinchuan County in low mountains.
Xinchuan County is in the southwest tip of Henan Province. High mountains are distributed
in northwest and southwest parts of the county at an average elevation about 1000 m. The
southeast part is in broken country. This county happens to be the inundation area of the
Danjiangkou reservoir. The tailwater of this reservoir reaches the southwest part of the
county. The weather is also temperate continental monsoon with 4 distinct seasons. The
annual average temperature and precipitation is respectively 1 5.80C and 821 mm, with a
frost-free period of 225 days in the year.
With a lower vegetation percentage, the eco-environmental conditions along the proposed
segment are relatively poor. But the waters covers a large area which takes up 14.1 % of the
whole county. The Danjiang River is the major river with 1 10 km distributed in the county. In
the west mountain areas, there are more forests and plant species. Also, large wildlife is seen
in high mountains.
1.2.2      Socioeconomy
1.2.2.1    7# Road System
7# system is located in Shongshan County which is one of the 28 poorest counties in China.
Covering a total land area of 3008.9 kM2, it has a total population of 509800 and farmland
area of 506640 mu. The economy is less developed. In the year of 1994, the gross output
value of industry and agriculture was only separately 286 million RMB and 187 million RMB,
with a total ranking the last but one among the counties and districts governed by Luoyang
City.
7-2# and 7-3# segments involve a total population of 78100 people living in Baihe, Checun
and Muzhijie Xiangs, including 97% agricultural components. With 1 senior middle school, 10
junior middle schools and 51 primary schools, the total student population is 1 141. There are
3 small hospitals provided with 70 sick beds, and 71 clinics. The total medical staff is 299,
i.e. 35 per each 10000 people. The people in these 3 xiangs do not have safe drinking water
supply. Medical care, education and living conditions are all poor.
1.2.2.2     14$ Road System
Mianchi County where 7# segment is located is also one of the 28 poorest counties in China.
It governs a total population of 310600 people distributed in a total land area of 1480 km2
which includes 579200mu farmland. With agricultural components accounting for 84% of the
total population, the gross output value of agriculture in 1993 was only 147 million RMB, and
the output value contributed by the coal-based mining industry was no more than 166 million
RMB.
14-2# and 14-3# segments involve Tianchi, Hongyang and Changcun Xiangs with a total
population of 42900 in 1993, including 98.5% agricultural people. In the same year, the gross
Page-1 0



agriculture output value gained in these 3 xiangs was 34.59 million RMB, accounting for
23.5 % of the county total. Without any senior middle school, though, there are 4 junior middle
schools and 49 primary schools, with a total of 9122 students at school. About 3% of the
pre-school children do not go to school. There are 3 hospitals and 40 clinics with a total of
32 sick beds (i.e. 1 bed per 1000 people) and 76 medical staff (21 per 10000 people). Most
of the people here are having difficult drinking water supply and are living a poor life.
1.2.2.3     21# Road System
Xinchuan County, where 21 # system is located, is one of the 28 poorest counties at the
national level. The total land area is 2798 km2 (including 709600 mu farmland) where there
are 669615 people, including 433000 people (65%) living under the poverty line. As.a major
inundation county of the Danjiangkou reservoir, Xinchuan has one of the largest resettlement
populations in the country. Out of the total 15 xiangs (township), 11 are involved in the
reservoir resettlement. There are 1 2 xiangs (township) distributed in high mountains. The
gross national product in 1993 was 717 million RMB, including 440 million RMB contributed
by agriculture.
21-2# segment, a Category A project, involves Chengguan Township and Shangji Xiang.
Based on 1993 statistics, they had a total population of 57300, including 53700 agricultural
people (94%). The gross agricultural output value was 20.04 million RMB which constituted
4.6% of the county total. There is no senior middle school here, but there are 6 junior middle
schools and 12 primary schools with a total student population of 6549. Some 12% pre-
school children are not at school. About 20% of the total population are illiterate. There are
2 small hospitals and 1 30 clinics with a total medical staff of 1 75, i.e. 30 per 10000 people.
Approximately half of the population are not provided with safe drinking water supply.

1.3.1.2.3    Monitoring Time and Frequency
Monitoring of present air quality situation in all project areas was carried out at the same time
in the period from September 11 to 1 5, 1 995. The monitoring lasted 5 executive days, with
4 times each day respectively at 7:00, 11:00, 15:00 and 20:00.
Each monitoring included observations of air temperature, air pressure and ground wind speed
among other major meteorological elements.
1.3.1.2.4    Monitoring Results
Statistics of the air monitoring results involved in the above 3 systems are separately stated
in Tables 1-3-3, 1-3-4 and 1-3-5.
1.3.1.3    Evaluation of Air Quality Situation
1.3.1.3.1   7# Road System
The instantaneous T.S.P. concentrations at the 5 monitoring sites involved in 7# system do
not exceed the standard. With the maximum at 0.746 mg/m3, most of the measured values
are less than 0.500 mg/m3. The daily concentration exceeds the standard at 2 of these 5 sites
with an above-standard percentage of 20%, i.e. such excess occurs on one of the 5
monitoring days. But the maximum daily concentration is 0.350 mg/m3 which is only 0.17
time above the standard.
Neither instantaneous nor daily NO, concentrations at these 5 sites exceed the standard. The
maximum instantaneous value is at 0.063 mg/m3 which accounts for 42% of the standard.
The daily N0, values are almost below 0.500 mg/m3, i.e. less than half of the standard.
Page-1 3



The concentrations of CO are quite low at present, with instantaneous values constituting less
than 25% of the standard and daily values accounting for less than 50% of such.
As above mentioned, the sectoral air quality is in a good situation. All the indices are below
the assessment standard except daily T.S.P concentrations in some cases. The present air
quality here meets Class It standard.
1.3.1.3.2   24# Road System     r* ?
Among the monitoring sites involved in 24# system, the site at Hongyang Xiang Government
is subject to instantaneous T.S.P. concentrations above the standard. Out of the total 20
monitoring data, there is one exceeding the standard, but the excess is no more than 0.11
time. It is common for the daily concentrations to exceed the standard, and the values at all
the 3 sites are above the standard, with a maximum of 0.642 mg/iM3 which is 1.1 times above
the standard. This relates to the fact that much dust arises as rain has been rare since the fall
came.
Neither of the instantaneous and daily NO, concentrations exceeds the standard. At the site
of Hongyang Xiang Government immediately close to national road 310, however, the highest
instantaneous concentration of NO, takes up 82% of the assessment standard while the daily
maximum is 88% of the standard.
In the project areas of 14# system, the CO concentrations are measured to be significantly
above those at other areas. The daily CO concentrations at the monitoring site of Hongyang
Xiang Government exceeds the standard in some cases, though, such excess is at a low level.
The instantaneous CO values at all sites are almost less than half of the standards. The higher
CO concentrations here relate to the large number of small coal mines and coking plants.
The aforesaid analysis suggests that the sectoral air quality fails to meet Class Il standard.
1.3.1.3.3   21# Road System
The instantaneous T.S.P. concentration was once measured to be above the standard at the
monitoring site of Xinchuan County Government, with an excess of 0.95 time. The daily
values at this site also exceed the standard in some cases. According to the statistics, the
daily values are above the standard en 2 of the 5 monitoring days, with a maximum of 0.643
mg/m3 which is 1 .14 times above the standard. At the other monitoring site involved in this
system, the instantaneous and daily T.S.P. values are both below and only take up a small
portion of the standard. This is also the case of instantaneous and daily NOX and CO
concentrations.
Through the above analysis, it can be deemed that the present air quality along 21# system
satisfies Class II standard.

1.3.2       Acoustic Environmental Quality Situation
1.3.2.1     Assessment Standard
In line with the present sectoral environmental situation, it is agreed, by the local
environmental protection agencies, that Class II standard as included in the "Environmental
Noise Standard for Urban Areas" {GB3096-93), i.e. 60 dBCA) for day time and 50 dBMA) for
night time, will be applied to the assessment of acoustic environmental situation along all the
3 road systems.
1.3.2.2     Monitoring of Acoustic Environmental Situation
r
1.3.2.2.1    Arrangement of Monitoring Sites
The monitoring sites for such purpose are the same as used for air monitoring.
1.3.2.2.2    Monitoring Item
The monitoring items are environmental noise L,, values at day and night hours.
1.3.2.2.3    Monitoring Time
Monitoring of the environmental noise situation along all of the 3 systems was conducted
September 1 5, 1995 at the same time. Monitoring was carried out once at day and once at
night hours.
1.3.2.2.    Monitoring Results
The monitoring results are as shown in Table 1-3-6.
1.3.2.3     Evaluation of Acoustic Environmental Situation
1.3.2.3.1    7# Road System
At all the 5 monitoring sites, none of the environmental noise L.. levels at both day and night
time exceeds the standard. The L,,q values are all 10 dB(A) lower than the standard except for
the monitoring site at Muzhijie Xiang Government. This indicates that the project areas are
relatively quiet, with acoustic environment meeting the requirements of Class II standard.
1.3.2.3.2    144 Road System
Out of the 3 monitoring sites involved in 14# system, 2 have environmental noise L.q equal
to or higher than the standard at day hours, with the rest having L,, below the standard. The
Loq at night hours does not exceed the standard, though, it is approximate to the standard.
This means that the local acoustic environment is not in a good situation and fails to meet
Class II standard.

1.3.2.3.3   21# Road System
With environmental noise Lq not exceeding the standard at both day and night hours, the
acoustic environment at both monitoring sites involved In 21# system satisfies Class II
standard.
1.3.3       Surface Wator Quality Situation
The major rivers passing through the 3 systems include:
7# System: Jianhe River
14# System: Yihe River
21 #System: Laoguanhe River
The former two falls within the Luohe River watershed while the last is a tributary of the
Danjiang River. Based on historical monitoring records, the water quality of river sections of
concern (involved in the road systems) is as shown in Table 1-3-7.
Table 1-3-7 Water Quality of River Sections of Concern

The water quality standard for Class IV waters applied to the water quality assessment is
listed in Table 1-3-7.
As shown in the above table, water quality of the Jianhe River is relatively poor, with
permanganate index, COD and BOD5 exceeding the standard. The maximum excess belongs
to COD which is 0.9 time above the standard. Water quality of the river sections of concern
fails to meet Class 11 standard. As the exceeding parameters reveals, the river water is polluted
by organic matters.
Page-20



The Laoguanhe River water quality is also poor, with permanganate index exceeding the
standard by 2.6 times and SOD, by 2.4 times. Volatile phenol also exceeds the standard. The
water quality of the sections of concern does not meet the requirements of Class IV standard.
Relatively, the Yihe River water quality is good, with all parameters satisfying the standard for
Class IV waters and even the requirements of Class II waters except for oil. The Yihe River
sections of concern, with clean water without pollution, practically meet the functions of
drinking source water.
1.3.4       Overall Evaluation of Present Environmental Situation
As judged on the basis of the above environmental elements, the sectoral environmental
situation along 7# system is rather good, with that along 14# and then 21 # following.
1.4         Predicted Environmental Impacts
1.4.1       Construction Phase
1.4.1 .1    Air Pollution
Air pollution due to dust arising from construction activities is a common problem to be
enrountered during construction of all the 5 newly-built segments involved Category A.
Co,ostruction activities which may cause dust include: lime-soil mixing, construction material
transportation at temporary paths, and powder materials in store.
Generally, dust due to construction activities affects the area at short distance from work sites
(genera,ly 50 m, with a maximum of 100 m), although it also poses some impacts on the
range 200 m from the work sites. Beyond this range, the impact, if any will be minor.
Out of the 5 newly-built segments, only 21-2# will be paved with asphalt, asphalt smoke will
bring about some air impacts during construction activities, though the range to be affected
will not be farther than 200 m away from the lee side of tar heating sites.
1.4.1.2     Construction Noise Impacts
All the segments will be out-of-class roads. With a small number of construction machines to
be used, noise impacts due to construction activities are not expected to be significant.
As estimated, the range to be affected by construction equipment at day hours will not be
more than 100 m, though it may be as far as 200 m at night hours.
1.4.1.3     Water Pollution
7-2# and 7-3# segments are aligned along river banks, and 14-2# needs to pass across the
jianhe River. Without proper management, construction activities will pose some adverse
impacts on the water quality of the Jianhe (14-2#), Ruhe (7-2#) and Chantang Rivers (7-3#).
The latter 2 are small rivers.
Page-2 1



1.4.1.4     Physical Eco-environmental Impacts
Most of the project areas of the 5 newly-built segments are located in wasteland. As for 7-2#
segment, the first half is on river banks while the second half is at mountain contours. 7-3#
is completely aligned on the Chantang River banks. Most of 14-2#, 14-3# and 21-2# are
located in wasteland areas. The subgrade is 6 m width except for 14-2# and 14-3# with a
subgrade width of 7 m. The grand length of these 5 segments is 80 km. As a consequence,
the land to be covered will not be much, not to speak farmland. The construction of these
segments will not cause significant negative impacts on the local agricultural and ecological
environment.
Most of the local plants in the project areas are common species, without any large wildlife.
The construction of these roads will not cause any extinction of wildlife, and will not affect
wildlife migration, either.
Adequate bridges and culverts will be provided, as necessary, to have an adequate discharge
capacity. During construction of bridges and culverts, temporary channels and conduits for
drainage and irrigation purposes will be constructed. As a result, the road construction will not
cause significant impacts on the surface irrigation and drainage systems.
The road construction will not have any effect on such ecological elements as lamination,
temperature and moisture.
It is concluded that the construction of these 5 road segments will only cause minor eco-
environmental impacts.
1.4.2       Operation Phase
1.4.2.1     Air Pollution
When these 5 segments are completed and put into service, the traffic volume will not be
large. Up to the late operation stage, the traffic volume of any segment will not be more than
2000 vehicles/day, the value of 7-2# in the year of 2011, for example, will be only 340
vehicles/day. With such traffic volumes, vehicle exhaust will not result in significant air
impacts. Likewise, characteristic air pollutants (e.g. CO, He) will not exceed the standard as
a result of exhaust gas discharged by vehicles.
All of the 5 segments, except 21-2# which will be paved with asphalt, will have macadam
pavement which will cause much dust when vehicles pass on them. As a consequence, the
areas at a short distance will be exposed to adverse air impacts. At any section close to
villages, proper measures should be taken, as appropriate, to minimize dust on 14-2#, 14-3#,
7-2# and 7-3# segments.
1.4.2.2     Traffic Noise Impacts
Since the traffic volume will be small upon completion of these 5 segments, traffic noise by
vehicle motors will not pose significant impacts. Nevertheless, all the segments, except 21-2#,
will have macadam pavement with large coarseness, so driving vehicles may disturb the
residents in the vicinity.
Page-22



As judged on the basis of the predicted traffic volumes and as assessed using Class IV
standard of the "Environmental Noise Standard for Urban Areas" (GB3096-93), the traffic
noise in the range 10-100 m away from the roadsides will not be higher than 70 dB(A) during
day hours.
Since all the road segments will be rural roads with traffic volumes concentrated during day
hours, the traffic volume at night time, if any, will be very small. Even if the instantaneous
trafic noise will be higher than 55 dB(A) when one or two vehicles pass by, the time will be
too limited to significantly disturb the residents living on both sides.
Therefore, the traffic noise impacts upon completion of these road segments will not be
significant.
1.4.2.3     Water Pollution
The impacts on the local surface water will not be significant upon completion of these roads,
provided no traffic accident or spill of toxic/harmful materials will not be encountered.
1.4.2.4     Other Impacts
The milage of roads available upon completion of these roads will be extended, which will
benefit the local residents who will have more opportunities to take part in the channel of
commodities, and will have more access to employment, medical care and education. These
roads will remarkably promote the livelihood improvement of the local people.
With positive benefits overwhelming negative ones, these roads, when completed, will
promote the local economic development in a certain extent.
1.5         Mitigation Measures
1.5.1       Design Phase
1.5.1.1     Every effort has been incorporated into the alignment schemes of all these road
segments to minimize use of farmland and to link as many villages as possible, as well as to
avoid or minimize relocation work quantities. Also, the alignment schemes have adequately
considered the opinions of the local communities and governments. Since the roads are
located in mountain areas, the alignment schemes have been selected to integrate the road
construction with, rather than interrupt, the development of mineral and forest resources.
1.5.1.2     The existing rivers, ditches, canals and any other surface water systems to be
crossed by the roads will be provided with adequate bridges/culverts to minimize possible
impacts on the surface water irrigation systems as a result of the road construction.
Designed to have adequate discharge capacities, all bridges and culverts will be able to
withstand floods once in 100 years.
v4        Engineering or biological measures will be taken to achieve slope stability. Side ditches will be
constructed, on both sides of the roads, to guide surface run-off to natural ditches and canals,
and to control possible soil erosion as a result of local topographic change.
Page-23



At road segments going along mountain contours, such measures as slope controlling and
planting will be taken to stabilize slopes and to prevent mud-rock flow and landslide among
other geological disasters.
1.5.1.3     Soil materials required for new subgrades will be borrowed from within the land
acquisition limit as many as possible. Any shortage will be made up by means of longitudinal
allocation of soil works, such that destruction of land beyond the land acquisition limit will be
minimized.
For road segments aligned along river banks, the project design has considered the stability
of dykes so that the flood resistance of such dykes will not be weakened as a result of the
road construction.                                  a
Land for temporary use will be selected from wasteland areas so as to minimize destruction
of farmland.
1.5.1.4     The afforestation engineering of slopes and side ditches are improved to include
aesthetic effect of integrating road afforestation with natural landscape.
1.5.1.5     When the alignment is finalized, the local archeological agencies are entrusted
with archeological explorations. Since neither surface nor underground cultural relics are
discovered, the road construction will not cause any archeological impacts.
1 .5.2      Construction Phase
1.5.2.1     Land for temporary use will be selected from wasteland areas. Any land for such
purposes, regardless of greenland or wasteland, will be planted upon completion of
construction activities.
1.5.2.2     Construction camps for bridges/culverts and riverin segments will be placed far
from rivers.
At construction camps, garbage cans will be provided at fixed placed for domestic garbage
to be collected and simply dispose of before discharged.
Wastewater and excreta contributed by construction camps will be treated, in a simple way,
before discharged.
Drinking water supply for construction camps will meet the requirements of the "Sanitary
Standard for Drinking Water Quality".
1.5.2.3     Any wastewater arising from construction activities and construction camps will
not be directly discharged into rivers to avoid possible water quality impacts.
During construction of bridges/culverts, spoil materials and debris will not be allowed to join
river channels or conduits.
During construction road segments along river banks, construction management will be
erhanced to prevent construction materials from falling in the river course.
Page-24



1.5.2.4     During construction of road segments far away from villages, roadside mixing
of limb-soil materials will be applied; but in case of segments close to villages, central mixing
approach will be adopted, with mixing places being placed on the lee side of the villages. If
such mixing place has to be placed windward of the villages, it will be kept more than 200
mR, away from such villages.
Soil roads to be temporarily used for construction material hauling purposes will be often
watered, especially in the dry season, watering should be done at least twice a day (once in
the morning and once in the afternoon).
Piled construction materials, such as cement, lime and sand, will be covered to avoid dust to
be blown by wind.
For the construction of 21-2#, central tar heating should be provided with heating sites at the
leeward of any village. If such heating site has to be placed windward of any village, then a
distance of 200 m, at least, should be arranged in between.
1.5.2.5     In order to prevent construction noise from disturbing the nearby residents at
night hours, construction work will be suspended from 22:00 to 6:00.
1.5.2.6     During constriction operations of bridges/culverts and road segments at any
massif, construction workers will wear helmets for the sake of safety.
Wherever blasting operations are required, relevant procedures for such operations will be
closely followed, and the residents in the vicinity will be informed in advance for the purpose
of temporary evacuation.
Enhanced environmental awareness will be exercised among construction workers. Poaching
will be strictly forbidden.
1.5.3       Operation Phase
1.5.3.1     Road segments close to any village will be often watered, especially in dry
seasons, watering will be done, at least twice a day (once in the morning and once in the
afternoon), to cut down air impacts by dust arising from the road surface.
Road maintenance will be strengthened to keep the road surface flat and smooth so as to
reduce noise caused by passing vehicles.
Use of horns will be controlled. Wink lamps will be used, instead of horns, for indicating
overtake at night.
1.5.3.2     Trucks to carry toxic/harmful and dangerous materials will have permits issued
by public security, transportation and fire authorities.
In the event of any traffic accident or spill of toxic/harmful materials, fire, transportation,
traffic police and environmental protection agencies will be promptly informed such that
correction measures will be taken, as appropriate, to avoid or minimize possible environmental
impacts.
Page-25



1.5.3.3     Other Measures
Such measures include:
*     Enhanced training services for drivers to strictly forbid any driving without license and
in drunken conditions;
*     Strengthened management of vehicles to keep them in good conditions and to strictly
forbid overloading;
*       0     More efforts will be made to enhance education of transportation laws/regulations
among the local residents;
*     Any new permanent buildings will not be built in the range 10 m from the roadsides.
Construction of any new hospitals, schools and concentrated residential sites will not
be allowed in the area 200 m from the roadsides.
1.6   Public Consultation
During the environmental monitoring process, public consultation was carried out among the
local residents. As the result tells, the local communities sh4N their positive attitudes toward
the construction of the roads. When asked about relocation and land acquisition and other
aspects directly relating to their immediate interests, most of them said they would accept
relocation and resettlement provided proper compensations would be provided.
As consultation with non-government organizations (including people's representative
congress, peasant associations) suggests, all the non-government organizations support the
construction of these roads and think these projects, when completed, will do good to
promoting the local economic development.

2.2.        Environmental Setting
2.2.1       Geography, Topography and Geomorphology
2.2.1.1     5#, 6# and 7# Road Systems
These 3 systems are distributed in 2 Luanchuan and Songxian Counties of Luoyang City.
These counties are both located in the Xionger and Funiu mountain areas with intersecting hills
and fluctuating land.
2.2.1.2     12# and 14# Road Systems
These systems are distributed in Lushi and Mianchi Counties of sanmenxia City. Being in the
remote west part of Henan Province, Lushi County is adjacent to Shannxi Province in the
west, with Funiu, Xionger and Xiaoshan Mountains distributed here. Micnchi County is
squeezed in Taihang Mountain in the north and pediment hillyland in the south, with 14$
system located in broken country.
2.2.1.3     16# and 18$# Road Systems
Both are located in Lushan County of Pingdingshan City. With Funiu Mountain in the west,
broken country in the middle and plain area in the east, the topography declines from west to
east, with 16# system lying in deep mountains and 18# system in broken country.
2.2.1.4     21# and 22# Road Systems
Both systems are distributed in Xinchuan and Tongbai Counties of Nanyang City. Being in the
southwest part of Henan Province, Xinchuan County is adjacent to Shannxi Province in the
west and Hubei Province in the south. With mountains at an average elevation about 1000 m
in the northwest and southwest, and bruken country in the east, 21 # system is located in the
mountain area of the county. Being adjacent to Hubei Province in the south, Tongbai County
is in the south part of Henan Province, with 22# system in the Tongbai mountain area.
2.2.1.5     23#, 24# and 27# Road Systems
These systems are separately distributed in Xinxian, shangcheng and Gushi Counties of
Xinyang Prefecture. Xinxian County is in the south part of Henan Province and is adjacent to
Hubei Province in the south, with 23# system going in mountain areas where there are many
steep slopes and deep gullies with land fluctuating to a great extent. Being at the south tip of
the province, Shangcheng County is adjacent to Hubei Province in the south and Anhui
Province in the east, with 24# system being in the Taihang mountain area. Gushi County is
in the southeast part of Henan Province, with Anhui Province being adjacent in the east.
Located in the northeast part of the county, 27# segment is broken county and is adjacent to
Huaihe River in the north.
2.2.2 Climatology
All the road systems, except 23#, 24# and 27# systems distributed in Xinyang Prefecture,
Page-34



are distributed in the area between the Yellow River and tl. Huaihe River where there is
temperate semi-wet continental monsoon climate with 4 distinct seasons. The climatic
features include abundant sunlight, concentrated rainfall and consistent rainy and hot days.'
In Luoyang and Sanmenxia Cities where 5#, 6#, 7#, 12# and 14# systems are located, It is
relatively dry because of less precipitation.
Being in the area between the Yellow River and the Huaihe River, 23#, 24# and 27# systems
are subject to wet climatic features, with an annual precipitation over 1000 mm and a long
frost-free period.
2.2.3 Ecological Environment
All of the 26 segments included in the 12 systems under the first batch of RIPA projects are
located mountain areas with favorable ecological conditions and abundant animal/plant
resources. With a relatively high vegetation coverage, water and soil loss is not severe here.
Based on preliminary investigations, there is no rare and endangered species along any of
these 26 segments.
2.2.4 Cultural Relics
As verified by archeological departments, none of these 26 segments will involve any surface
or underground cultural relics.
2.2.5 Socioeconomy
All the counties involved in these 26 segments are almost poverty counties at the national
level, with less advanced economy, poor living conditions, lower health care and education
levels. These counties are all in mountains where the inconvenient transportation .s one of the
bottlenecks to the local economic development and livelihood improvement.
2.2.6 Atmospheric Air Quality
These 26 road segments are all located in mountain areas where there are few air pollution
sources. So the air environmental quality is all superior to Class II standards.
2.2.7 Surface Water Quality
Surface water in the project areas is almost all source water with good quality which satisfies
Class IV water quality standards. In most cases, Class II standards are satisfied.
2.2.8 Environmental Noise
Without major industrial pollution sources, the local acoustic environment is in a relatively
good situation. All the road segments are located in quiet areas.
2.3   Predicated Environmental Impacts
Page-35



2.3.1 Category R' rrojects are upgrading and improving of oxisting roads, without large-scale
relocation and land acquisition work. With less farmland destruction, agroecological impacts,
if any, will be minor.
2.3.2 In the construction stage, there may be such environmental Impacts as dust and noise
due to construction activities. Since Category B projects have small earth and rock quantities,
and the number of machines to be used in construction activities will be small, dust and noise
due to construction activities will be very limited.
Type I roads will have asphalt pavement. Asphalt smoke will arise in the tar heating process
that the asphalt smoke will cause environmental impacts, though the range and magnitude of
such impacts will not be significant.
2.3.3 Inadequate provision of bridges and culverts is a common problem of the existing roads
before upgraded and improved. More bridges and culverts will be provided for these road
segments, so adequate provision of such will do good to surface run-off improvement. Upon
completion of Category B projects, the local surface drainage and irrigation systems will be
considerably ameliorated.
2.3.4 The traffic volume in the operation stage of these Category B roads will not be largil,
with an average below 5500 vehicles/day in the late operation stage. None of these road
segments will be susceptible to significant impacts by vehicle exhaust gas. The local air quality
superior to Class II Standards will not significantly change as a result of road construction.
Type II roads will all have macadam pavemer t with a relative large coarseness and also large
dust content. Traffic noise and dust will turn outstanding environmental issues in the operation
stage. All these projects are located in less populated mountain areas, however, the targets
of such impacts will be few.
2.3.5 Other environmental impacts will not be significant in both construction and operation
stages of these road segments.
2.3.6 Category B projects, when completed, will promote the local economic development
and improve the living standard and health care of the local residents. Also, more education
and employment opportunities will be available.
2.4         Miti3ation Measures
2.4.1       Construction Stage
2.4.1.1     Dust/Air Pollution
In case of road segments far away from concentrated residential sites, roadside mixing of limb-
soil materials will be applied; but in case of segments close to villages or concentrated
residential sites, central mixing approach will be adopted, with mixing places being at least
1 00 m away from such villages or residential sites on the lee side of wind direction.
Page-36



Road segments under construction should be often watered, especially in the dry season,
watering should be done at least twice a day (once in the morning and once in the afternoon).
Material hauling roads should be also often watered.
For the construction of Type I projects, central tar heating should be provided with heating
sites at the leeward of residential areas. If such heating site has to be placed windward of any
village or residential area, then a distance of 200 m, at least, should be arranged in between.
Construction materials, such as cement, lime and sand, should be covered and kept at the lee
s:de of any village so as to avoid possible adverse environmental impacts by dust.
2.4.1.2     Noise
With relatively less equipment to be used in construction activities, noise impacts will not be
significant. In case of worksites immediately adjacent to villages and concentrated residential
bites, construction work should suspend during nighttime (22:00-6:00).
Machines and trucks to be engaged in construction activities will keep in good conditions to
reduce noise.
2.4.1.3     Soil Erosion/Water Pollution
All of these 26 road segments are located in mountain areas. Adequate attention will be paid
in thc construction stage so as not to cause further soil erosion. Any greenland to be used for
temporary purposes will be reforested upon completion of construction activities, and waste
land will be planted.
Temporary channels or conduits will be constructed to ensure smooth passage of surface run-
off (especially in flood seasons). Any wastewater due to construction activities will not be
directly discharged into :urface waters.
All of the bridges and culverts to be provided are designed to withstand floods once in 100
years. Spoil will not be stored on riverbeds to prevent interruptio.1 oi rivers, ditches and
canals.
2.4.1.4     Construction Camps
Rubbish bins and simple sewage treatnient facilities will be provided for construction camps.
Any rubbish will not be stored in a willful manner domestic sewage will not be discharged into
surface waters before simply treated.
Construction camps for bridges and culverts will be placed far away from rivers, ditches and
canals to avoid any direct discharge of domestic sewage into such.
Drinking water supply for construction camps will meet the national "Sanitary Standard for
Drinking Water Quality".
Page-37



2.4.1.5     Transportation Management/Traffic Safety
Any vehicles to be used for construction activities will keep in good conditions to ensure safe
operation.
Appropriate transportation plans for construction materials will be developed to provide proper
route and time arrangements, and to avoid any traffic congestion on existing roads.
Temporary roads to be used during construction will be provided with lighting facilities and
traffic marks as necessary.
Technical training and traffic safety education will be provided for drivers for them to closely
comply with traffic regulations.
2.4.1.6     Construction Safety
Construction workers will wear helmets in their construction operations.
In case of any road segment requiring blasting operations, blasting procedures will be followed
and separating measures will be taken as necessary. In case of residential site in the vicinity,
the residents will be informed, in advance, for the purpose of temporary evacuation.
2.4.2       Operation Stage
2.4.2.1     Noise/Air Pollution
Afforestation on both sides of the roads will be enhanced to cut down potential air impacts
by exhaust gas of vehicles.
Any segment close to any villages will be watered in dry seasons, at least twice a day, namely
once in the morning and once in the afternoon, to reduce air impacts by dust.
Use of horns will be prohibited during nighttime.
2.4.2.2     Traffic Safety
Roads will be provided with traffic marks as necessary.
Management of vehicles will be exercised to keep them in good conditions.
Training of drivers will be enhanced to avoid any driving without license.
Enhanced education of traffic safety and traffic laws/regulations will be provided for the local
residents.
Trucks to transport cement and lime among other construction materials will be covered and
any overload will not be allowed.
Page-38



2.4.2.3     Transportation of Toxic and Harmful Materials
Trucks to transport any toxic, harmful and dangerous materials should have permits granted
by public security, transportation and fire departments.
In the event of any spill of toxic and harmful materials, or explosion of dangerous materials
or fire among other traffic accidents, the local fire, public security and environmental
protection authorities will be promptly informed, such that correction measures will be taken
as appropriate.
2.4.2.4     Others
Any construction of new and permanent buildings will not be allowed in the range 50 m on
both sides of the roads.
Any construction of new hospitals, school and large-scale residential sites will not be allowed
in the area 200 m away from the roadsides.

,    ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT PROGRAM FOR RIPA PROJECTS
3.1   Environmental Management Organization
3.1.1 The first batch of RIPA projects involve 10 counties distributed in Sanmenxie, Luoyang,
Pingdingshan, Nanyang and Xinyang Cities/Prefectures, namely, Lushi, Songxian, Luanchuan,
Lushan, Xinxian, Tongbai, Shangcheng, Xinxian and Gushi.
3.1.2 The city/prefecture communications bureaus have their environmental protection
sections each of which has 3-4 full-time staff members responsible for traffic environmental
protection. The principal responsibilities include:
(a)   To implement national, MOC and provincial traffic environmental laws/regulations and
policies, to develop detailed rules for such implementation according to the local
situation;
(b)   To be responsible for traffic environmental routine duties, to wrap up and spread
advanced experience and technologies of such nature;
(c)   To summarize and report traffic environmental protection statistics;
(d)   To take part in handling major traffic pollution accidents as appropriate.
(e)   To guide and coordinate traffic environmental protection activities, and to organize
technical training services for environmental protection staff;
(f)   To assign environmental monitoring tasks in both construction and operation stages of
transportation construction projects, and to supervise implementation thereof;
3.1.3 The transportation bureaus of all the 10 counties involved in the first batch of RiPA
projects are equipped with trdnsportation environmental protection sections each of which has
1-2 full-time environmental management staff members.
Since all these counties are in remote and poor mountain areas where there is neither air-borne
nor water-borne transportation, such environmental protection sections are almost devoted to
highway environmental management of each county. The main responsibilities include:
(a)   To implement national, MOC and provincial traffic environmental laws/regulations and
policies, and to apply city/prefecture detailed rules for such implementation to the
construction of transportaticn construction projects in the county;
(b)   To be responsible for traffic environmental routine duties, to wrap up and spread
advanced experience and technologies of such nature;
(c)   To summarize and report transport environmental statistics on the roads in the county;
{d)   To take part in dealing with traffic pollution accidents occurring in the county;
Page-40



(e)   To supervise environmental monitoring activities to be carried out in both construction
and operation stages of highway projects in the county.
3.2   Environmental Management Program
3.2.1 The RIPA are proposed to be constructed in a series of lots. In the construction stage,
each lot will assign a full-time environmental management staff member to be responsible for
the implementation of mitigation measures in his lot, and to assist the full-time staff member
of the aforesaid environmental protection section in properly conducting environmental
protection work in his lot.
3.2.2 In the operation stage, each segment will have a road maintenance squad with a part-
time environmental management staff member to be responsible for the implementation ot
various mitigation measures in his lot, and to assist the full-time staff member of the aforesaid
environmental protection sections in properly carrying out environmental protection work in
his lot.
3.3   Environmental Managament Network
Upon completion of these RIPA roads, an environmental management network, under the
leadership of the environmental protection division of Henan Provincial Communications
Department, will be formed as shown in Figure 3-3-1.

ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING PROGRAM FOR RIPA PROJECTS
4.1        Environmental Monitoring Organization
4.1.1      Since the RIPA projects cover a large areas, environmental
monitoring in construction and operation stages will be entrusted to the
local environmental monitoring stations which will be supervised by the
environmental protection sections of county transportation bureaus and
the higher-level city/prefecture transportation bureaus.
4.1.2      Full-scale examination of the local environmental monitoring
stations, before entrusted with monitoring assignmients, will be exercised
to see if their equipment/instrument, expertise, personnel constitution
and quality are adequate to satisfy the requirements for such monitoring
in construction and operation stages.
4.2        Environmental Monitoring Program
4.2.1      Environmental monitoring in both construction and operation
stages will be devoted to such environmental elements as air, noise and
surface waters.
4.2.2      Analysis  methodology,  data  processing  mode,  submission
frequency and format will be aJ!rspecified by the environmental monitoring
center of Henan Provincial Communications Department, for the purpose of
facilitating monitoring data summarization and interpretation.
4.2.3      The environmental monitoring program for the construction
stage of RIPA projects is 06'shown in Table 4-2-1 in which the road
segments requiring ad hoc monitoring of asphalt smoke refer to the
asphalt-paved segments under the first batch RIPA projects, including 12
segments in 8 counties, namely, 5-1X and 6-1# in Luanchuan, 7-1# in
Songxian, 12-l# in Lushi, 16-1# in Lushan, 18-1# in Xinchuan, 22-1#, 22-
2# and 22-3# in Tongbai, 23-1# in Xinxian and 27-1# in Gushi.
4.2.4      Table 4-2-2 illustrates the environmental monitoring program
for the operation stage of these RIPA roads.

5,   TRAINING PROGRAM FOR RIPA ROADS
5.1.1 Henan Provincial Communications Department and Henan Provincial Environmental
Protection Agency will arrange training service for the full-time staff of the transport
environmental protection sections of Sanmenxia, Luoyang, Pingdingshan, Nanyang and
Xinyang transport bureaus, such that they will be familiar with national, MOC and provincial
environmental laws/regulations and policies. Also, training service will provide them a change
to learn environmental expertise, basic theories and scientific environmental management
skills, to know the features of transport environmental issues and to gain some organization
and coordination competency.
5.1.2 Such full-time staff at county level will be arranged by the upper level citylprefecture
transport environmental protection bureaus to familiarize these staff members with relevant
environmental laws/regulations and policies of the State, MOC and province, as well as
detailed rules for the implementation thereof as developed by upper environmental authorities.
Training is also an approach for such staff members to learn environmental knowledge and
highway project-related environmental features, to master environmental management
methodologies and to carry out detailed environmental management operations.
5.1.3 It will be the responsibility of the local city/prefecture transport bureaus to arrange
training service for the part-time environmental staff members assigned by each lot in the
construction stage. Being well aware of the features of corresponding lots, such members will
understand the objectives of various mitigation measures proposed for the construction stage,
so they will assist the above-mentioned full-time members in supervising the implementation
of such mitigation measures in construction operations.
Training service for these part-time members will be provided prior to commencement of each
project.
5.1.4 In the operation period, training service for the part-time environmental staff provided
for each road maintenance squad will be arranged by the local city/prefecture transport
bureaus. The purpose is to familiarize these staff members with different mitigation measures
proposed for the operation stage so that they will be able to provide the full-time members
with helpful assistance in proper implementation of such measures.
5.2   Training for Environmental Monitoring Staff
Joint efforts will be made by Henan Provincial Environmental Monitoring Center and Henan
Provincial Transport Environmental Monitoring Center to provide training service for the
environmental monitoring staff in both construction and operation periods. Such training will
cover environmental monitoring items for both periods, monitoring principles, analysis/work
methodologies, quality control measures, data processing and relevant monitoring theories.
The monitoring staff will be competent for their responsibilities, correct and reliable monitoring
data will be ready for use.
