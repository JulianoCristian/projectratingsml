Chapter 1 General
1.1   Origin of EIA Assignment
Starting at Lianyungang, a large harbor in the east part of China, and ending at Huoerguosi,
a port at the boundary at the west boundary, Luoyang-Sanmenxia expressway is one of
the 12 main frames of highways planned by the Government. With a total length of 3980
km, it passes through Jiangsu, Anhui, Henan, Shannxi, Gansu and Xinjiang provinces
(autonomous region). It is also one of the 'two longitudinal and two lateral' trunk roads
proposed by the Ministry of Communications to be practically completed by the year of
2000. With a length of 630 km, the section distributed in Henan Province is a trunk road
from east to west parts of the province as well as the backbone of the provincial economic
development. Out of this length, Kaifeng-Zhengzhou section is already open to traffic while
Zhengzhou-Luoyang section is under fast construction. As expected, Kaifeng-Luoyang
expressway will be almost completed by the end of 1995.
In YJJ No. 10 11993) "Notice on Assignment of Preparatory Works of Key Highway
Construction Projects in 1993" issued on January 19, 1993, Henan Provincial Department
of Communications required that preparatory works of Luoyang-Sanmenxia road be
completed as soon as possible. When completed, this road will connect with the would-be
completed Kaifeng-Luoyang expressway in the east and will link with Weinan-Tongguan
expressway under active preparations in Shannxi Province in the west. As a result, all-
round benefits of expressways will be brought to full play, which will greatly promote
opening to the outside world and economic development of Henan Province.
With a total length of 134.214 km, Luoyang-Sanmenxia expressway is estimated to cost
a total about 4000 million RMB, including 200 million USD loans (1700 RMB) applied to
source from the World Bank, with the rest will be self financed by Henan Province or
subsidized by the Ministry of Communications.
As required by relevant environmental management provisions for construction project of
the Government and Henan Province as well as EIA provisions for World Bank-financed
projects, a full-scale EIA is required to be completed for this road. As entrusted by Henan
Provincial High-grade Highway Construction Authority", Henan Provincial Environmental
Protection Institute is held responsible for EIA of this road (see Attachment I for Letter of
Assignment).
1.2  Project Location, Size and Alignment
Henan Province is located in the center part of China in the middle reaches of the Yellow
River (see Map 1-1). The proposed road is situated in the west part of the province, on the
south bank of the Yellow River (see Map 1-2 for the project location).
This road will be built into a two-way four-lane road with a total length of 134.214 km
according to standards for highways in heavy-hillyland areas.
This road passes through Luoyang, Mengjin, Xinan, Yima, Mianchi, Shanxi and Sanmenxia.
To avoid the settlement zone near Guanyintang in Shan-Mi:n mine area, two alignment
schemes are proposed in the feasibility study report, one is aligned south and the other is
aligned north of Guanyintang. Based on comprehensive comparative analysis (see Chapter
6 for details), the south alignment scheme is recommended herein.

Chanter 2 General Descrintion of Proiect and Identification of Environmental Impact
2.1   General Description of Project
2.1.1 Alignment and Main Control Point
The following considerations are incorporated into the road alignment:
a.   To take Luoyang, Xinan, Yima, Mianchi and Sanmenxia as main control points, with
consideration to the end of Kaifeng-Luoyang expressway and to connection with
Lintong-Weinan expressway in Shannxi Province;
b.   To properly align the road on both sides of Long-Hai railway and National Road No.
310 so as to provide good connection with the existing railways and highways;
c.   To keep the road 3-7 km distance off major cities and townships on the principle
of "not being so close to enter and not being so far to avoid them' in line with
short and long-term development plans of these cities and townships;
d.   to avoid cultural relics and villages as many as possible so as to reduce relocation
work quantities:
e.   To avoid settlement zones in coal mines and other geologically-improper regions.
On the basis of these principles, trend and control points of the road are determined as
follows:
The road just starts at the end of Kaifeng-Luoyang expressway, i.e. Dongtouzhuang Village
in Mengjin north of Luoyang. It goes west to pass by Xujiazui, Shuiquan and then connects
at Dongcun with the specially-design road from Luoyang to the XLD Multipurpose Dam
Project. To attract vehicles from and to Luoyang, an interchange is provided here. Then,
the road goes across the Jinshuihe into Xinan where it passes by or through Xipo,
Daaogou, Mujiangpu, Xiajiaao, Xiayanggou until it links with )(inan-Shisi road in the north
part of the county seat. An interchange in built here to serve vehicles from and to Xinan.
The road leads further west to go by Miaotou and Tieman, across the Hongyang River and
enter into Yima from where it passes by Chenjiagou and Wangjiazhuang before it reaches
the interchange where it connects with Yima-Rencun road. From Xiaocun, it goes into
Mianchi County, crosses the Xiyang River and links with Mianchi-Yangshao road where an
interchange is provided. Going to the west, the road goes by Matouzhai, Nanhegou,
Yinghao and across Long-Hai railway.'After skirting round the coal settlement zone, it
arrives at Guanyintang where in interchange is set at Shuiduicun to serve vehicles from
Guanyintang to Luoning. Going west by Wangcun, Lanzhuang, across Long-Hai railway at
Xiashi. it passes by Hongtuao, Qiaogou, Zhangmao and Jiaokou where in interchange is
set. Going further west through Dajiao and across Long-Hai railway, National Road No.
310, the Qinglongjian and Shijia Rivers, it goes by Chensongpo, Caijiazhuang before it goes
across Long-Hai railway for the fourth time. After going across National Road No. 310 and
Canglongjia River, it goes in parallel with National Road No. 209 before it reaches the
interchange located at Majiayan from where it heads west to reach its end at Maxiezhuang
on the boundary between Shanxi and Linbao Counties.
I
According this alignment scheme, the section from west of Mianchi to Hongtuao of Shanxi
is required to go across Long-Hai railway twice. Also, the road configuration is relatively
favorable. Therefore, a alternative alignment is proposed to go, as from Mianchi County
5.



seat, by Xiamatou, Zhuchengcun, Suzhaicun, Beigou, Yinnhao and reaches Zhangcun road.
After leaving a railway for the coal mine at Houying, it goes west to pass by Beigetiao,
Ushupo and then deflects southwest to pass by Tuling and Langwo. An interchange is
located at Hongtuao. This alternative alignment is relatively smooth and is 4 km shorter.
As passing through extensive coal mine settlement areas, it also poses difficulties for
subgrade treatment.
The road alignment is as shown in Map 2-1 in which the dotted line represents the
altemative alignment.
2.1.2 Size, Standard, Work Quantity and Technical Index of the Project
As recommended in the feasibility report, the whole road will be built, at one stroke, into
a two-way four-lane expressway. The project size and main work quantities include: length
of 134.214 km; 7 interchanges respectively located at Luoyang, Xinan, Yima, Mianchi,
Yinghao, Sanmenxia, Dongjiakou and West Sanmenxia; 10 super-large bridges, 31 large
bridges, 11 middle and small bridges, 27 overpasses and 66 through-cut overline bridges;
111 culverts and 137 passageways; communications engineering facilities to be completed
simultaneously except monitoring, telecommunications and toll facilities which will be
provided step by step; 24.601935 million m3 embankment and 29.454833 million m3
excavation works.

2.1.4 Road Configuration. Borrowing-area Operation and Spoil Scheme
The ground along the road fluctuates to a great extent and there are well developed gullies
in some areas. Also, expressways are limited by the maximum longitudinal slope and plane
curve radius.  As a result, the road construction will require large quantities of.
embankment and excavation works. In such case, high cuts and extensive excavation have
to be carried out. In case of road sections where embankment is too high, overline bridges
will be provided. Table 2-2 gives length of road sections will different height of
embankment and excavation based on statistics.
Average height of subgrade in cifferent sections has been retrieved, by method of weighed
mean, as shown in Table 2-3.

Since the subgrade works include both embankment and excavation components quantities
of which are almost equal. Spoil material stemming from excavation sections will be used
to sections requiring embankment by means of longitudinal allocation. If such allocation
is difficult in deed, spoil material from excavations will be placed in depression areas, and
the soil materials required for embankment will be borrowed from highlands. But the depth
of borrow areas will be controlled to avoid large borrow pits. Upon construction of the
road, borrow and spoil areas will be levelled to be reafforested or re-ploughed.

Asphalt required for the project is all planned to be imported low-paraffin asphalt.
Material requirements of the road are as shown in Table 2-6.

Quantity   141814   133992    1666157   11848154  3254754  58463
Among these materials, steel, timber, cement and stone will be transported with vehicles.
Access roads for transportation of such materials will be paths as many as possible so as
not to use the heavy-traffic National Road 310 as far as possible. Sand required for Xinan,
Yima, Mianchi, Shanxian and Sanmenxia sections will be transported, via Jiao-Zhi railway,
to the railway stations in these cities and then to the work site with vehicles.
2.1.8 Traffic Flow and Actual Speed
As predicted in the feasibility report, the traffic flow (absolute number of vehicles) is as
shown in Table 2-7.
Table 2-7 Traffic Flow of Luoyang-Sanmenxia Expressway
unit: vehicle/day
Section            2000               2010               2020
Luoyang-Xinan     14481              27078              37298
Xinan-Yima        12436              24492              37820
Yima-Mianchi      12530              24605              37646
Mianchi-Sanmenxia  11476             22689              35934
On the basis of 1.86 day-night flow ratio, large, middle and small-sized vehicles will
separately account for 20%, 50% and 30% in the initial operation stage. Considering that
vehicles in China will tend to be heavy and large in the middle and late operation stages,
it is deemed that the constitutions of large, middle and small-sized vehicles will be 40%,
30% and 30%. Such division of vehicles is made according to the following standards:
Large-sized: cargo wagon with a capacity above 8 t, passenger bus with more than
50 seats, container, trailer and large vehicles designed for special purposes;
Middle-sized: cargo wagon with a capacity of 3.5-8 t, passenger bus equipped with
20-29 seats;
Small-sized: cargo wagon with a capacity less than 3.5 t, passenger bus with fewer
than 19 seats, light off-way vehicle and car.
Peak traffic flow in day hours is considered to be 10% of the average daily flow.
According to the above parameters, it is calculated that the hourly traffic flows (absolute
number of vehicles) by vehicle type and time interval are as shown in Table 2-8.

As shown in the above table, most of such environmental impacts will be exist in limited
time in the construction period though they will be of long-term effect in the operation
stage.
This table also suggests that most of such impacts will be suffered by the local eco--
environment (e.g. vegetation, water and soil loss) and livelihood. Agricultural activities,
cultural relics, air and landscape will be affected to a less extent while the local water body
is subject to the least possibility and extent of environmental impacts. Borrow/spoil area
operations, vehicle noise/vibration and flue gas (including exhaust gas) will be outstanding
among these environmental impacts due to the road construction.
On the basis of the above identification of environmental impacts and in line with the fact
that the local population is small and sparsely distributed but cultural relics are distributed
in extensive areas and the local topography is complicated, eco-environment (with focus
on water and soil loss), noise, air, cultural relics and agriculture are selected as key
environmental elements of the EIA. Nevertheless, consideration is also given to landscape
and social environment.

Chapter 3 Local Physical Environment and Socioeconomic Back-round
3.1   Physical Environmental Description
3.1.1 Topography and Geomorphology
Along this road, the section of area from Luoyang to Xinan lies in loess broken county with
ridges and loess hills in most areas though loess plateaus and developed gullies, as high
as 60 m, are distributed in limited areas. Passing through Mount Xiaoshan, the section
from Xinan to Sanmenxia is located in high mountains with developed gullies and chicken-
claw topography. From Sanmenxia to the end of this road, it is loess plateau. Out of the
total length of the road, some 90 km is distributed in extensive hillyland while the rest 40
km is located in loess plateau and broken country.
3.1.2 Engineering Geology and Hydrogeology
The project area belongs to highland and broken country of the second bench terrain where
the strata are mainly quaternary system, although there are Triassic system, Permian
system, Ordovician system, cambrian system and middle Proterozoic erathem in limited
areas.
Most of the project area is in loess area, with outcropping loess and rock in Yima and
Tiemen-Guanyintang sections.
There are many coal fields, including Xinan and Shanmian mine areas with exploration
range almost determined. But it is hard to determine the range of private and township coal
mines sparsely distributed. Since coal fields are mined to a depth from scores to hundreds
of meters, it is hard for the consequent subsidence to stop settling in scores of years.
There is a large coal subsidence north of Guanyintang township.
The project area is limited to the Yellow River basin with less developed surface water.
The rivers here are rain-fed seasonal ones except Jianhe, O.inglonghe and Canglonghe
Rivers which are permanent ones.
Ground water here, except in floodland areas, is phreatic water lying 60-80 m (100 m in
some cases) under the ground. Most of the aquifers here are in late Pleistocene series
gravel and Triassic system sand and gravel with abundant water availability which the
main drinking water source of the local residents.
3.1.3 Local Fault and Basic Earthquake Intensity
There is a developed fault tectonics and many major faults along the road, including
Gongqian E-W fault in the west and Wenquan N-E fault in Sanmenxia. Both are active and
have ever induced intensive earthquakes.
The basic seismic intensity tends to increase from east to west. It is 6 degrees east of
Mianchi while it is 7 degrees from Mianchi to Guanyintang and 8 degrees west of
Guanyintang.
The project area is subject to a relatively high basic intensity and frequent fault movement.
In the past 1640 years, there happened 5-degree earthquakes. In 1972, a sensible
earthquake was experienced.
16



3.1.4 Climatology
The area along the route belongs to the warm semi-arid continental monsoon climate zone,
with distinct four seasons. Based on the long-term meterological data provided by the local
meterological station, the mean annual temperature is 12.4-14.40C, with a maximum
monthly average temperature of 26-280C in July and minimum of minus 0.3 to 1.2°C in
January. The extreme maximum and minimum is respectively 44°C and -17.20C. The
average annual frost-free period lasts 167-218 days, with a maximum depth of frozen
ground of 20-30 cm. The mean annual precipitation is 555-670 mm 60-80% of which is
concentrated in the period from June to September.
Deflected south wind prevails in the summer while deflected north wind prevails in the
winter, with greatly varying wind directions in the rest two seasons of the year. The mean
annual wind speed is 1.7-3.4 mIs.
3.1 .5 Physical Resources
In the area where the road passes by or through, there are rich physical resources.
Luoyang and Sanmenxia constitutes 15.39% of the total provincial land area, including
farmland which takes up 8% of the provincial total.
Luoyang enjoys more than 40 rich and large mineral deposits, mainly coal, aluminum,
molybdenum, iron and brimstone. Out of these, molybdenum, aluminum and brimstone are
proven to rank the first in the while country. In Sanmenxia, there have been discovered
57 deposits, including 26 proven ones, mainly gold, aluminum, coal, and also lead, lead,
antimony, tantalum and niobium which are abundant. quality and easy to mine.
Save plants created with artificial efforts, the local flora includes wild species distributed
in mountains. With fewer species and populations of wildlife, the fauna is predominated
by livestock and fowl.
3.2 Socioeconomic Background
3.2.1 Distribution and Population of Local Townships
The road passes through Mengjin and Xinan govemed by Luoyang, Sanmenxia, Yima,
Mianchi and Shanxian governed by Sanmenxia. Townships involved in the road are mainly
Wutou, Miaotou, Tiemen (town), Qianqiu, Yinghao, Guanyintang (town), Zhangmao and
Jiaokou xiangs. Based on 1993 statistics. Luoyang and Sanmenxia lincluding county, city
and district directly thereunder) had a total population of 7.96 million people, accounting
for 8.9% of the total of Henan Province. The population density was 300 persons/km2
which was lower in the province.
3.2.2 Industry and Agriculture
As important industrial and mining base of Henan Province, Luoyang tumed out 34550
million RMB gross output value of industry and agriculture in 1993, i.e. 11 % of the
provincial total. In gross output value of industry was 31680 million RMB which accounted
for 13.01 % of the provincial total. In the same year, the economic growth rate was 13%
which was higher than the provincial average. Sanmenxia generated 8825 million RMB
gross output value of industry and agriculture (i.e. 2.96% of the provincial total) in 1993,
17



including 7037 million RMB (2.89% of the provincial total) contributed by industry. In the
same year. the gross domestic product of Sanmenxia was boosted at a growth rate of
22.7% as compared with that of the previous year. Refer to Table 3-1 for socioeconomic
statistics in 1993.
This table tells that industry respectively contributed 91.7% and 79.7% to the gross
output value of industry and agriculture, which suggests that the percentage of industry
is far above that of agriculture in the economic structure.
Table 3-2 indicates planned economic development indices of these two cities.

3.2.3 Communication and Transportation
Located in the center part of China, Henan is a typical inland province. Over the past
years, the provincial communications has dramatically advanced such that an integrated
comprehensive transportation network is formed in which railways and highways are
playing the leading role, with supporting air, water and pipeline-bome transportation.
In the project area, there exist 12 highways as shown in Table 3-3. Out of these, only
National Road 310 passes from east to west and Henan Road 03 involves local areas.
These national and provincial roads have formed the regional highway network.
Since air-borne transportation is just at its initial stage, the local communication and
transportation is predominated by railways and highways. The sole access from east to
west parts of the project area, National Road 310, is subject to street and mixed traffic.
With the section in the coal subsidence near Guanyintang keeping on settling (as deep as
100 m), traffic congestion on Luoyang-Sanmenxia section of this road is 1.43. The traffic
flow is already above capacity of the road. The deferred communications development has
tumed out a bottleneck to the local economic development.
3.2.4 Tourism Resources
This project area is rich in tourism resources. As the capital of 7 dynasties in the history
of China, Luoyang City is one of the 7 great ancient capitals (including Luoyang, Beijing,
Kaifeng. Anyang, Xi'an, Nanjing and Hangzhou). Famous scenic spots include Longmen
Grottos in the vicinity of luoyang, White Horse Temple and Guandi Temple. All these
attract many foreign and local tourists all the year round. Luoyang Peony Fair held on a
yearly basis receives streams of visitors. Baiyunshan Natural Scenic Spot has been
gradually turned into a hot tourism site. Sanmenxia was called "Xianzhou' in the history,
it enjoys such famous scenic spots as Yangshao Cultural Site, Ancient Hangu Pass Site
and Baolunsi Pagoda which is one of the 4 largest echo structures in China. Sanmenxia
Dam, Yellow River Tourism Zone and Wudangshan Natural Scenic Spot are also located
here. However, tourism industry in Sanmenxia City is restrained by the inconvenient
communications.
Map 3-1 illustrates tourism resources distributed in the project area.
3.2.5 Cultural Relics and Their Distribution
As investigated and confirmed by archeological departments, there are altogether 19
historical sites within the range 200 m from the roadside, namely:
1.   Imperial tombs of the North Wei Dynasty (BC206-907)
2.    Shuiquangou Site (BP5000-3700)
3.    Huocun Site (BP4500-AD220)
4.    Mujiangpu Tomb Area (BC206-AD220
5.   Xiajiaao Tomb Area (AD960-1644)
6.    Pailou Tomb Area (AD1 368-1644)
7.    Chendongwa Tomb Area (AD960-1279)

15.  Lujiadian Site (BP6000-5500)
16.  Daiiakou Site IBP6000-5500)
17.  Shibangou Site (BP6000-4000)
18.  Zhaojiayuan Old-Stone-Age Site (BP100000-50000)
19.  Dongchengcun Tomb Area (BC206-AD220)
No archaeological site has ever been discovered on the ground save within 200 m away
from the proposed road.
3.3   Distribution of Sensitive Points
Most of the villages in the range 200 m off the centerline of the road are relatively small
and sparsely popularized except a few with schools and larger populations. Among these,
16 villages typical sensitive sites are selected, as shown in Table 3-4, on the following
principles:
-    larger villages with school;
*    villages at a distance less than 100 m away from the road;
*    villages subject to relocation;
*    medium and small-sized villages with concentrated households.

Chapter 4 Investigation and Evaluation of Environmental Setting
4.1   Eco-environment
4.1.1 Physical Eco-environment
The project area falls within the warm temperate continental monsoon climatic zone. With
extreme maximum and minimum temperatures being separately 440C and -17.20C, the
average annual temperature is 12.4-14.4°C. The maximum frozen depth ranges from 20
to 30 cm. The annual and daily tempe ature difference here is separately 25.7-29.20C 8-
9°C. In the year, the frost-free period lasts 167-218 days.
The annual sunlight hours in the project area are all more than 2000 hours, with a
maximum of 2292 hours. With 130 rainy or snowy days and an average about 50% total
cloud amount, the illumination is rather favorable.
The average annual precipitation is 555-670 mm of which 60-80% is concentrated in the
period from June to September. Since the annual evaporation is larger than precipitation,
the project area is so dry that the average annual relative humidity is about 65%.
Although the local air contains a low percentage of harmful substances, TSP content is
relatively high.
The local soils are all drab soil with pH value about 7.5. Most of the soils have average
moisture and fertility. With middle or heavy texture. such soils are unfavorable to farming.
Among the aforesaid physical ecological conditions such as temperature, illumination,
precipitation, air and soil, the most important restraint is precipitation which is followed
by soil.
4.1.2 Flora
Study area of the local flora involves the range 1 km off the road. There is no rare and
endangered species in the range.
The project area is located in the warm temperate deciduous and broad-leafed forest zone
with physical ecology satisfying growth and development of the existing flora. As a result
of the long history of forest destruction for reclamation, the natural vegetation has
changed to a great extent. Because of varying tectonics in hillylands, gullies, loess hills,
ridges and loess plateaus, distribution of local vegetation varies from place to place. In
particular, a series of artificial vegetation has been formed in the process of natural reform
activities, for example, agricultural vegetation predominated by crops and rural/urban green
vegetation. Along the alignment, there are natural deciduous shrubs, weeds and trace of
forest vegetation.
Agriculture vegetation is distributes to the most extensive areas along the road. Besides
grain crops, such also includes cash crops, vegetables, melon and fruit trees. Thanks to
the varying topography and soil, the local agricultural productivity is not always the same.
Green vegetation is generally distributed around residences and on streets. Most of the
local villages and townships are generally surrounded with green forest belts. Single or
23



double rows of trees are planted on villages and township streets. Greenlands at public
buildings are provided with columns or rows of trees in most cases. Residences here are
afforested in different ways, but generally arbors are planted along fences of houses. In
some cases, rows of arbors are planted in rear of the house, with fruit trees planted in
front. Ornamental plants are often seen in cites, townships and villages along the road.
Natural deciduous shrub vegetation is predominated by chaste tree and wild jujube which
are sparsely distributed in hillyland and broken country. With energetic suitability and not
asking for good ecological conditions, most of such shrubs live in dry and poor soils, and
even in rock openings and gravels where other species can hardly live. Such shrubs are not
in good order as judging from their appearance, with coverage and height generally ranging
20-30% and 50-100 cm. Mixed shrubs include Matrimony vine, birchleaf pear and smoke
tree. Mixed weeds include yellow bluestem, Siberian cocklebur, green bristlegrass and
cogongrass, etc.
Grass vegetation includes two categories, one is association predominated by yellow
bluestem and the other is predominated by wormwood. The former is mainly distributed
in waste mountains and on roadsides in Sanmenxia and Xinan, as well as gullies where the
soil is generally poor and dry. Edificator of such association is yellow bluestem. Mixed
grass is composed of Artemisia argyi, Artemisia capillaris, Japanese clover, potentilla
discolor, cogongrass, Siberian cocklebur and wild mint, etc. With height of 30-50 cm, the
coverage is generally 20-60%. The association predominated by wormwoods enjoys
similar universality as that Dredominated by yellow bluestem. The mixed species include
Siberian cocklebur, cogongrass, yellow bluestem, Anermone Vitifolia and mother
chrysanthemum, etc coexisting with multiflora rose, chaste tree, wild jujube and other
shrubs. Such association is generally 20-50 cm high, with a coverage about 30-50%.
Forest vegetation is distributed to a less extent. Besides deciduous and broad-leafed trees,
there live coniferous plants such as masson pine.
There are more than 100 common species of plants here, including 14 species of crops,
27 species of vegetables and melon crops, 9 species of fruit trees, 19 species green and
ornamental plants, 5 shrubs and 26 species of grass. Details are given in Table 4-1.
4.1.3 Fauna
The study area of the local fauna covers the range 1 km off the road where there is no rare
and endangered species.
According to zoogeographic zoning of China, the project area falls within the Mount
Xiaoshan and loess hilly and plain areas in North China zone of palaearctic realm. The
constitution is predominated by North China fauna of paratactic realm, though south and
north species infiltrate each other. There are some species of oriental realm, but the
population is small. The number of fauna species here in comparatively small, especially
there are few large and middle-sized forest animals. In fields, waste slopes, shrubs, loess
gullies and residential sites, there are relatively large populations of small-sized rodents.
It is reported that there are almost 200 animal species in the project area. However, our
investigation results a-nd the information collected over the recent years suggest rare
encounter of Rrinaceus earopaeus, wolf, fox, hog-nosed badger, badger. Paguma larvata,
porcupine, wild boar and pheasant which used to live here. Insects have predominating
species and populations. Also, fowl and livestock also have large species and populations.

4.1.4 Agricultural Eco-environment
The local agricultural ecology is suitable to growth and development of the existing crops.
Two-crop-a-year farming is practised which is predominated by wheat. While wheat
predominates in winter crops, is the leading character of autumn crops.
4.1.4.1     Sol Type and Distribution
As investigated, the local soil category is mainly cinnamon soil which includes adamic
earth, white spongy soil and loess sub-categories composed of 6 kinds of soils, namely,
white spongy soil, adamic earth, loess, black soil, sajong red soil and sajong loess.
White spongy soil is concentrated in typical loess hillyland areas distributed in Luoyang,
Xinan, Mianchi, Shanxian and Sanmenxia. The soil-forming parent matrix is loess deposited
in the late Quaternary Pleistocene Era. With such characteristics as deep and loose soil
layer and less developed strata, such is light-loamy soil of good cultivability, ventilation and
permeability, but its moisture and fertility-retaining ability is poor. The pH value ranges
from 7.0 to 7.5. With strong calcareous reaction and trace of sajong soil, average content
of organic matter and nitrogen, such soil is most suitable to growth of cotton.
Distributed in marginal loess plateau, terrace and gentle hillyland areas in Mengjin, Mianchi,
Shanxian and Sanmenxia, loess has soil-forming parent matrix of loess deposited in the
latr Quaternary Pleistocene Era. With a deposition depth varying from several to scores
of meter. such loess parent matrix has developed vertical joints which are subject to
landslide and bankcaving. The soil is all yellow except the surface which is slightly greyish
as a result of long-term farming and fertilizer application. The soil body is deep, with a
thick mellow layer. The soil is somewhat clayized. The top stratum is of particle or
fragmentary block structure while the sub-layer has diamond structure. The Ph value is at
7.0-7.5. With moderate calcareous reaction and good moisture retainablility, such is the
major agricultural high-yield soil in the project area.
Adamic earth is distributed between orogenic drab soil and loess in low mountain and
hillyland areas. The soil-forming parent matrix is Triassic red soil. Such soil is mainly red
and cohesive, with weak calcareous reaction and unapparent stratification. The top soil
is somewhat darker as a result of farming and fertilizer application, but the subsoil is
brown and cohesive. Being nut or fragment-structured, such soil is of undesirable
cultivability. The soil is muddy when it is wet and is hard to be full of cracks when it is
dry. The characteristics of such soil also include short cultivable period, poor permeability
and moisture. So it is susceptible to drought. The content of organic matter is so low to
be about 0.5%. The soil differencing is undesirable.
Sajong red soil is distributed at an altitude higher than that of adamic earth. Generally, a
50 cm layer contains more than 10% sajong. Being subject to serious erosion, it loses
moisture and fertilizer. Being well ventilated, though, it is unable to keep moisture. As a
result, it is susceptible to drought and is hard to cultivate. Also, it also restricts crop root
systems from extending.
Basic features of the rest 3 kinds of soil are similar to those of loess soil.
27



4.1.4.2     Crop
Cereal Grain crops here include wheat, barley, rice, corn, Chinese sorghum, millet and
sweet potato, etc. Among these, rich is only grown in limited areas. Cash crops are
soybean, peanut, rape, cotton and tobacco, etc.
There are more than 20 kinds of vegetables grown in the project area; with Chinese
cabbage and radish playing the leading role. Also, there Are many kinds of melon crops.
Over the past few years, more than more fruit trees have been planted in large and larger
areas. The yield of apple, peach, persimmon and data is relatively high. Extensively
planting fruit trees has turned out to be one of the economic development approaches
fitting into the local actuality.
4.1.4.3     Agricultural Productivity
As restricted by the local topography, agricultural productivity is at an average level. With
incomplete irrigation facilities, farming is often puzzled by droughts. In case of serious
droughts, it is even hard to get drinking water. In recent years, the local government has
gradually adjusted agricultural structure in such a way that the previous cerea!-based
farming practice is altered to play stress on both cereal and fruit. Being suitable to the local
topographic and climatic features, such adjustment has greatly promoted agricultural
development.
Based on statistics, the unit grain yield is some 600 kg.
4.1.4.4    Water for Agricultural Use
Irrigation and drainage systems here are far from perfect. As irrigation is not historically
practised by the local farmers, agricultural water use is mainly based on precipitation.
4.1.5 Water and Soil Loss Situation
According to the local topography, geomorphology, soil and vegetation, the project area
can be divided into loess broken country, loess plateau and loess low-mountainous areas
subject to varying water and soil loss.
Loess broken country is the leading geomorphology here. The elevation is generally being
200-300 m. But the elevation at the rim of Mianchi basin is 500-600 m, with a relative
height of 50-100 m. Hills slightly fluctuate, with round tops in some cases. Gullies, mostly
u-shaped, are well developed to be wide and flat at the bottom. Loess broken country in
Sanmenxia and Shanxian is generally at an altitude of 500-700 m, with a relative height
approximately 100 m. Such land is rather flat, with an angle of 1 5-20°. Most of the hills
have round tops. Such land is extensively distributed in the project area. With deep soil
layer, flat and broad topography between hills, most of such land has been turned into
farmland. However, loess is of poor erosion resistance. With sparse trees and other plants,
the vegetation ratio is very low. As a result, slope scouring and residual erosion are rather
intensive, wit!3 an erosion modulus of 1500-2000 t/km2.
Loess plateau areas cover both banks of Jianhe valley in Mianchi, as well as Zhangcun,
Sucun, Yangtang, Jiaocun and Chengcun of Sanmenxia. Such plateaus are accessible to
28



valley terrace via 15-20 m steep slopes and transit to loess broken country via steep
slopes. With a slope of 1-21, they are generally flat with large and perfect surface. Being
formed by alluvial loess of the middle Pleistocene Era, such plateaus have deep soil layers
and flat surface which is devoted to cereal crops and cotton in most cases. Most of such
land is subject to soil erosion, with erosion modulus of 500-2000 tlkm2.
Hillyland in the north part of Xinan County stretches from the northeast edge of Yima
basin to the south bank of the Yellow River valley. With elevation generally being 500 m,
the relative height is less than 200 m. Most of this area is composed of quartz-sandstone
and sandstone. In limited areas, hill tops and slopes has a loess overburden. Due.to serious
soil erosion, most of such hills are bare. The broken country on the right bank of Jianhe
valley in the south of Xinan extends form west to east, with elevation about 400 m and
relative height of 70-150 m. The bed rock extensively outcrops and loess is distributed in
local areas. With developed gullies and intensive soil erosion due to precipitated water, the
erosion modulus is 1000-2000 t/km2.
Low loess hills in the north part of Mianchi are distributed west of Duancun and Nancun.
Some of them have loess and red loess in the upper part, Triassic red gravel stratum in the
lower part while others have loess overburden with outcropping quartz and quartz-
sandstone strata. The elevation and relative are respectively 500-700 m and 200-500 m.
With relatively steep slopes about 200, hills here fluctuates to represent height difference
of 60-80 m. Many of the slopelands are devoted to farming activities. Since the vegetation
is thin, slopes and gullies are subject to intensive erosion due to precipitated water, with
erosion modulus of 500-1000 tlkm2 and even 2000 t/km2 in specific cases.
Recently, more and more attention has been attached by the local government to water
and soil conservation, and a series of measures have been taken, such as reafforesting
farmland, planting fruit trees in line of the local conditions and adjusting agricultural and
forestry structure, such that water and soil is under control to a certain extent.
4.1.6 Lead Content of Soil
Monitoring of lead content contained in soil was carried out in January 1995. Based on
investigations of soil distribution, 7 monitoring stations have been selected at Dongcun,
Hegou, Maling, Rugeta, Shidui, Jiaokou and Chengcun. These points have predominating
types of soil along the road.
Samples for monitoring of lead content in soil are taken, by 5-large-point method, from the
arable layer (0-20 cm) to provide 1 km specimen by 4-division method. After dried, sieved
and resolved, such specimens are measured in respect of lead content by the atomic
absorption spectrophotometry.
Measured results obtained from the arable layer of these 7 monitoring points are given the
following table.              I
Table 4-2  Lead Content of Arable Layer
unit: mg/kg
||Point I Dongcun I Hegou I Rugeta I Maling I Shidui I Jiaokou I Chengcun ||.
|Pb    116.69   139.98   133.80   137.18   133.01   115.37   C28.94_un.
29



The average lead content is 29.28 mg/kg. With pH value of 7.5-8.0 as monitored, the local
soil is somewhat alkaline.
As the monitoring results reveal, the lead content of soil is neither above the provincial
background value nor above the value of 300 mg/kg as recommended by the Ministry of
Agriculture for soils with pH value at 6.5. This means the lead content is at normal level.
4.2   Cultural Relics
As investigated, verified and confirmed, there are altogether 19 historical sites, including
10 cultural sites, 1 Old Stone Age site and ancient tombs at 8 places, see Table 4-3 for
the detailed descriptions of these sites. Archaeological exploration and salvation work will
be completed after land requisition and before civil work commencement such that
possible archaeological loss due to the road construction will be minimized.
4.3   Evaluation of Noise Environmental Setting
4.3.1 Investigation of Principal Noise Source
There are 3 principal noise sources within 200 m off the road, namely, quarry owned by
Luoyang Cement Factory, Yixi Cement Factory and Sanmenxia Paper Pulp Mill. In addition,
there are scattered small-sized township factories. But it is hard to get noise data from
these small factories. Table 4-4 includes industrial noise sources and major noise-producing-
equipment.

Save for National Road 310 and a few roads at provincial level, rural roads are less
developed as limited by the local topography. The proposes expressway will pass across
National Road 310 at 9 places. There are not many noise sources within 200 m off the
road except where cross other roads.
This expressway will pass across Long-Hai railway at 4 places and a special railway. At
such sections, railway traffic noise will be encountered.

Most of the project area is less populated. With few large villages and sparsely distributed
residents, these villages have fewer noise sources.
4.3.2         Monitoring of Acoustic Environmental Setting
4.3.2.1       Arrangement of Monitoring Points
Based on survey results, there are arranged 7 monitoring points along the road, namely,
Dongcun, Hegoucun, Rugeta, Maling, Shidui, Jiaokou and Chengcun. In addition, another
point (i.e. Beixiecun) is located on the altemative alignment at Guanyintang. Location of
these points are illustrated in Map 2-1. The background of these points is given in Table
4-5 which does not include Beixiecun which is 5 km north of Guanyintang. The altemative
alignment passes by 500 m north of Beixiecun which is small and is scarcely populated.
But there are many coal mines here.
4.3.2.2       Monitoring Time
Acoustic environmental monitoring was carried out on January 15, 1995, one in day and
the other in night hours.

pupils in its prirnary school, with a per capita farmland area of 1 mu. An
interchange is here.
4.3.2.3       Monitoring Methodology
Acoustic environmental monitoring inlved in this project is completed in compliance with
the measurement and counting methodology spelled out in the 'Environmental Noise
Standard for Urban Areas (GB3096-93)".
32



-4.3.3 Monitoring Result and Evaluation
Statistics on monitoring of the noise environmental setting at the above mentioned 7
monitoring points are as listed in Table 4-6.
Since there is no environmental noise standard available for rural areas, Category II noise
standards of the "Environmental Noise Standard for Urban Areas (GB3096-93)' is applied
to acoustic environmental setting evaluation of these monitoring points, i.e. 60 dBMA) in
day hours and 50 dB(A) in night hours. Details are given in Table 4-7.

The monitoring results, as compared with EIA standards, suggest that the environmental
noise l.q at Dongcun, Hegoucun, Rugeta, Maling, Shidui and Chengcun in both day and
night hours is still at a low level. The I., in day hours is 13-20 d)BA) lower than the
standard applied to this EIA while that in night hours is 9-13 dB(A) lower. This implies that
the acoustic environment at these points is in a good situation. According to statistics, a
is not high, which means that the environmental noise is rather stable and is subject to
less effect of accidental noise. Out of the total 7 monitoring points, Jiaokou is nearest to
33



the existing National Road 310, so the environmental noise I. here is obviously higher than
that at the rest 6 points. Nevertheless, it is still under the EIA standard, i.e. 60 dB(A) in
day and 50 dBIA) in night hours. In addition, o statistical values here are also significantly
above those of the other points. This suggests that the acoustic environment here is
affected by the adjacent National Road 310.
As previously analyzed, the local acoustic environmental is relatively good. Environmental
noise :q at all monitoring points in both day and night hours is under the EIA standard, i.e.
standard for Category l! areas. And most sections are only exposed to minor effect of
accidental noise. It is comparatively quiet along the chief alignment of the road.
4.4   Evaluation of Air Environmental Quality Situation
4.4.1 Investigation of Air Pollution Situation
Since air-bome pollutants contained in air pollutants are delivered and diffused to a large
extent, the range for investigating air pollutant sources in the local area is enlarged to the
range 1000 m off the roadside.
In the study area, there exist 5 major industrial air pollutant sources, namely Quarry of
Luoyang Cement Factory, Sanmenxia Cement Factory, Yuxi Cement Factory, Sanmenxia
Aluminum Power Plant (proposed project) and Sanmenxia Pulp Mil. In addition, there are
many small township and private factories. With a low pollutant-discharge height, these
factories do not pose significant impacts. Also, it is hard to obtain complete information
from these small factories in which production activities are interrupted and resumed now
and then.
Background of the main air pollutant sources are as shown in Table 4.8.
Apart from what is stated in the nrevious paragraph, there are many coal mines as well
as small township or private cokins plants which are contributing a large discharge of CO
and other pollutants out of control.

4.4.2      Monitoring of Air Environmental Situation
4.4.2.1    Arrangement of Monitoring Point
There are arranged 7 monitoring points, namely, Dongcun, Hegoucun, Rugeta, Maling,
Shidui, Jiaokou and Chengcun. In addition, there are 3 points arranged at Beixiecun north
of Guanyintang.
These points are described in Table 4-8. Map 2-1 illustrates locations of these points.
4.4.2.2    Monitoring Time and Frequency
Monitoring of the air environmental situation was conducted in the period from January
14 to 18, 1995. The monitoring lasted 5 days each of which experience 4 monitoring
activities respectively carried out at 6:30, 1 1:30, 16:30 and 21:30. Each motoring covers
observation of wind direction, speed, temperature and ambient pressure.
4.4.2.3    Monitoring Item, Sampling and Analyzing Methodology
Air situation monitoring items include T.S.P., CO and NOR.
Sampling, analyzing and quality assurance related to the monitoring are all compliance with
the "Specification for Air Environmental Monitoring' and "Environmental Monitoring and
Analyzing Methodology". The detailed sampling and analyzing methodology of these 3
items are as shown in Table 4-9.
Table 4-9 Air Sampling and Analyzing Methodology

NO.         Solution Absorption Method   Hydrochloric Benzathine Colorimetry
4.4.3 Monitoring Result and Evaluation
Statistics on the local air situation monitoring results are respectively described in Tables
4-10, 4-11 and 4-12.
Air environmental quality standards used for the EIA are included in Table 4-13.
Table 13 Standard for Evaluation of Air Environmental Quality
unit: mg/m3
Pollutant  Instantaneous Concentration   Daily Mean Concentration
TSP        1.00    -                  0.30
CO         10.0                       4.0
No,x       0.15                       0.10
35



As comparison of monitoring results and EIA standards suggest, the local NO,
concentration is at a low level such that both instantaneous and daily mean values are
below the EIA standard. Out of the 7 points arranged along the chief alignment, the
maximum concentration of NO, is 0.077 mg/m3 which accounts for some 50% of the EIA
standard. The daily mean concentration of NO. has a maximum of 0.037 mg/m3 which is"
37% of the EIA standard.
The local T.S.P instantaneous concentration is all below the EIA standard. Though the daily
mean concentration is above the standard in some cases, the overproof is not high. Out
of the total 7 points, Jiaokou has instantaneous and daily mean concentrations of T.S.P
above the standard, with a daily average 100% above the standard. This relates to the
fact that this point is immediately close to the existing National Road 310 which
contributes blown dust due to traffic.
The instantaneous concentration of CO is all below the standard at length of the road, but
the daily average is significantly above the standard. The daily average of CO is 100%
above the standard at Hegoucun, Rugeta and Shidui, and 80% above the standard at
Chengcun. This is also the case at Dongcun. Out of the 7 points, only Maling and Jiaokou
have daily average and instantaneous concentrations of CO below the standard. Judging
from statistics obtained from Jiaokou point, vehicle exhaust does not sicnificantly affect
CO content. The daily average of CO concentration is above the standard at most of the
monitoring points along the road. As analyzed, this is because: 1) there are many coal
mines which lets ou gas (with CO being the major ingredient) through air shafts; 21 there
are many coking plants here most of which are township and private ones using native
coking methods which discharge large quantities of uncontrolled CO; and 3) the monitoring
was carried out in winter days when CO was generated as a result of incomplete
combustion of coal used by the local residents for heating purposes.
In. the monitoring process, environmental monitoring yearbooks were collected from
Luoyang, Yima and Sanmenxia. As retrieved from these yearbooks, the air environmental
quality in these cities is relatively desirable, with T.S.P. as the leading pollutant in air.
Comparison of monitoring results obtained from executive years indicates that air quality
in these cities does not tends to degrade.
As a whole, the local air environmental quality is rather good, but T.S.P. concentration in
urban areas is higher than that in the country. In the monitoring interval, CO is the leading
pollutant of air in most of the geographic areas.

Chaoter 5   Environmental Impact Assessment and Analysis
5.1   Environmental Impact Analysis Construction Stage
5.1.1 Eco-environmental Impact Analysis
Such activities as land levelling, borrow/spoil area operation and bridge/culvert
construction in the construction stage will cause significant ecological impacts. In detail,
such impacts are as follows:
Large quantities of borrowlspoil area operations required for the subgrade will destroy the
surface vegetation in the work areas such that green vegetation will be reduced and the
micro-ecosystem will be ruined in some highcut and deep-excavation.
Construction of bridges and culverts may affect the surface water system.
Inevitable topographic change due to subgrade construction will probably aggravate the
local water and soil loss.
Land area for the road and temporary use will cause agricultural impacts.
Construction of the rcad will cause possible impacts on the local flora.
Large quantities of stone materials to be required will cause environmental impacts in the
vicinity of quarries.
5.1.1.1     Eco-environmental Impacts by Subgrade Works
The total quantity of earth works required for the road amounts to 54.056768 million m3,
including 24.601935 million m embankment and 29.454833 million m3 excavation works.
Besides inevitable vegetation destruction in the land area to be covered by the road per se,
such destruction will also occur at borrow/soil areas.
In terms of the road features, longitudinal allocation of earth works should be properly
arranged such that soil materials from subgrade excavation will be used for excavation.
Theoretically, all the embankment required for the subgrade will source from soil materials.
Due to the complicated topography, however, it will prove difficult to longitudinally haul
some of the soil materials that borrowed or spoiled soil in some cases will be inevitable.
To minimize possible eco-environmental impacts due to borrowed or spoiled soil, the
following measures may be taken: 1) proper longitudinal allocation of earth works to
minimize borrowed or spoiled earth quantities; 2) to locate borrow areas at highland or
wasteland and to strictly control borrowing depth so as to avoid large-scale borrow pits;
in case of any borrow area having to be located at farmland, 0-30 cm topsoil shall be
placed aside, before any soil is borrowed, for the purpose of topsoiling the borrow pit after
completion; 3) to locate spoil areas at low-lying areas and to strictly control spoil height
so as to avoid spoil stockpile; and 4) to provide proper afforestation upon completion of
the works.
40



5.1.1.2     Surface Watershed Impact by Construction of Bridge/Culvert
The road will be fumished with 10 super-large bridges and 42 large, middle and small-sized
ones as well as 111 culverts. Both the local watersheds and irrigation facilities are less
developed. Most of the rivers and streams to be crossed by the road all dry except the
flood season. The flood design probability is as follows: flood once in 300 years in case
of super-large bridges and once in 100 years in case of large, middle and small-sized
bridges as well as culverts. As a result, provision of bridges/culverts will not affect the
flood discharge of the rivers and streams.
As investigated, none of the rivers with permanent flow are not used for navigation
purposes. And there will not be any navigation requirement. So the provision of bridges
and culverts will not cause any navigation impact.
The Qinglonghe River to be crossed by the road is a protected drinking water source. The
water quality satisfies Level II standards required for surface water quality and the bottom
sediment has not been polluted. Efforts should be made to avoid any construction material
from falling into the River, except proper dredging, in construction of the super-large bridge
thereacross. Camps for construction workers must be located far from the river channel,
and domestic wastewater or rubbish must not be discharged into the river such that
provision of the bridge will not affect the river water quality.
5.1.1.3     Water and Soil Loss in Construction Stage
The local topography is so complicated that soil erosion due to precipitated water is very
serious. Also, the local vegetation coverage is very low. As a result, water and soil loss
here is more serious than anywhere else in the province.
In the construction stage, many road sections will require embankment and excavation
works. Rock and soil mass will lose their natural balance as a result of striping, disturbance.
and stockpiling such that local topography will be destroyed. Removal of ground vegetation
will cause more water and soil loss.
According to soil loss equation, the quantity of soil loss relates to A= ROKOTOP
in which,
R =precipitation coefficient
A = soil loss
K= soil erodibility factor
T =topography factor
P =vegetation factor
In this equation, R and K do not vary as a result of construction. So soil loss during the
construction stage relates to topography factor and vegetation factor.
In the construction, such activities as subgrade embankment, excavation, soil borrow and
spoil will change local topography such that the erosive area due to precipitated water will
be enlarged. With consideration to vegetation destruction, water and soil loss will be
further aggravated. Engineerino and biological measures will be required as appropriate,
including:
a.    Proper longitudinal allocation of soil works so as to cut down quantities of
borrowed and spoiled soil and to minimize vegetation destruction or local
topographic change as a result of such activities;
41



b.    To try every effort to keep excavation slopes stable and to provide drainage ditch
as required in the design:
c.    To level borrow and spoil areas upon completion of their operations so as to avoid
spoil stockpiles and to reduce slopes;
d.    To afforest borrow/spoil areas upon completion of their operations.
5.1.1.4     Agricultural Impacts in Construction Stage
A total land area of 13285.24 mu will be required for permanent use, including 10525.92
mu farmland. As calculated on the basis of unit yield 650 kg/mu, a total of 6824 t grain
will be lost each year. In the construction stage, another area of 2684 mu will be used to
temporary use. Assuming such is used for 3 years and another year is required for re-
ploughing, a total loss of 7000 t grain will be suffered in the construction stage. With a
total farmland area of 8.325 million mu, the 3 cities involved in the road generate an
annual grain yield of 6 million t. It can be seen that the grain loss only takes up a small
portion of the total yield. Other agricultural impacts include: 1) agricultural impacts due to
destruction of crops stepped on by construction workers; 2) photosynthesis, transpiration
and consequent corp yield impacts caused on by blown dust, especially such dust resulting
from vehicles hauling construction materials; 3) degraded produce le.g. cotton) quality as
a result of blown dust caused by construction activities; 4) inconvenience of field farming
as a result of subgrade construction.
Fortunately, such impacts will exist in limited time. Land for permanent use will be re-
ploughed and other agricultural impacts will also disappear upon completion of the works.
5.1.1.5     Flora and Fauna Impacts in Construction Stage
With few large wild mammals, the existing fauna is predorninated by fowl and livestock
which will not be affected by the road construction.
The road construction will ruin the habitat of some harmful insects dwelling underground,
which will reduce their populations and will be beneficial to agriculture.
Since there is no large bird habitat along the road, no impact will be posed on dwelling and
migration of birds.
Construction of the road will destroy local surface vegetation. But most of the local plants
are common species, such as shrub and grass, which do not require very good ecological
environment. And it is easy to recover the existing plants. So missing plant species will
be occur. Local shrinkage of vegetation coverage due to construction activities will be
offset upon completion of such activities.
Therefore, the road construction will not cause direct impacts on the local flora and fauna.
5.1.1.6     Analysis of Quarry Environmental Impact
Construction of the road will require a total amount of 3.254754 million m3 stone which
will respectively source from 9 quarries as previously described. All these are existing
42



quarries. So the road construction will only need to increase capacity of these rather than
create any more quarries.
At these 9 quarries, there are large areas of outcropping rock, and vegetation coverage is
very low. So the capacity increase demanded by the project will not cause an extensive
vegetation destruction.
However, quarry operations will result in the following environmental impacts: 1) extensive
outcropping rock and shrinkage of vegetation coverage as a result of natural topographic
destruction; 2) air quality impacts by blown dust arising from quarry operations; 3) impacts
on the local residents as a result of blasting noise; 4) interference with normal livelihood
due to intensive noise source of stone crushers.
Since stone requirements will be met by 9 quarries each of which only has to sacrifice a
small portion of the capacity, such environmental impacts will not be remarkable.
5.1.1.7     Analysis of Environmental Impacts by Construction Material Transportation
There are many vehicles available from the local community, so construction materials
required for the road will mainly hauled with such vehicles.
Stone, lime, cement, steel and timber will be transported with motor vehicles. Roads to
be used for such purposes are almost asphalt ones.
Stone materials required for Mengjin section will be delivered, with vehicles, from Luoyang
sand area to the work site. As for the rest road sections, sand will be hauled by railway
to different railway stations from where it will then transported, with vehicles, to the work
sites. Roads available for such purposes are also asphalt ones.
Longitudinal allocation of soil works will be completed with carry-scarpers or 8-t dumpers
in case of a long hauling distance. Roads for such purposes are xiang-village roads or
temporary path.
With asphalt roads available, vehicles hauling macadam, lime and cement are likely to
cause less dust. When transported, however, these materials, particularly, lime and
cement, do result in dust blown by wind, which means some air impacts. In addition, their
loading and unloading also produce some dust.
In the process of excavating and hauling soil for the subgrade, dust also rises. In particular,
a larger amount of dust is caused by vehicles running on country roads or earth paths.
Thus, environmental issues rising from such are not negligible.
The large quantity of materials tends to increase the traffic flow. Moreover, these roads
are so narrow to result in potential traffic bottlenecks and accidents. Based on field
investigations and overall analyses, sections subject to traffic bottlenecks and accidents
are marked with "black point" as illustrated in the map attached hereto.
To control dust blown in the transporition process, to avoid or mitigate traffic blockages
or accidents, such measures are proposed herein as:
43



a.    To often wet the road sections available for dumpers, Ito wet no less than 4 times
a day, twice in the morning and twice in the afternoon), and to wet the on-going
subgrade filling;
b.    To properly load stone, lirm  and sand for the purpose of smaller area subject to
wind and dust, to wet the upper macadam and sand to reduce dust amount caused
in the process of transportation;
c.    To keep cement bags intact when cement is hauled, to place damaged bags, if any,
at the lower part, and to haul cement with bulk vehicles if it allows;
d.    To properly arrange hauling time, to arrange transport routes in a proper manner,
and to escape peak traffic hours as far as possible;
e.    To enhance control of vehicles so as to keep them in good condition;
f.    To use as many heavy-duty trucks and to avoid or minimize use of tractors;
9.    To arrange supplylines in a scientific manner so as to make full use of the existing
highway network available along the road;
h.    To actively cooperate with local traffic police forces to make the traffic fluent and
to handle accidents, if any, in the right time.
5.1.2 Archaeological Impact in Construction Stage
It is confirmed that cultural relics exist under the ground at 19 places. Excavation work at
these . 9 places will proceed at fult scale after land requisition and before commencement
of the works. Possible archaeological loss due to the road construction will be minimized
and all the cultural relics to be discovered in construction activities will be salvaged as
spelled out herein. So the road construction will not pose significant impacts on the
cultural relics.
5.1.3 Analysis of Noise Environmental Impact in Construction Stage
In the construction stage, noise will stem mainly from such commonly used construction
equipment as excavators, bulldozers, graders, loaders, rollers, graders and concrete batch
plants, etc. Noise source intensity of such machinery is as shown in Table 5-1. In
addition, power generators, material hauling vehicles and pilers to be used in this stage are
also major noise sources.
Such noise environmental impacts to be encountered in the construction stage is estimated
as follows:
L=L0+201g-°
in which,
L=noise source intensity of construction machinery
ro=distance from noise source when Lo is measured
r= distance from prediction point to noise source
L=noise level at prediction point
44



Table 5-1 gives noise source intensity of construction machines while Table 3 describes
predicted noise levels thereof.
Noise in the construction stage is evaluated in compliance with the "Noise Standard for
Boundary of Construction Site" (GB12523-90). The standard values are as included in
Table 5-3.

As comparison of projections versus EIA standards suggests, the range affected by noise
of various construction machines in day time is within beyond 50 m. Beyond this range,
the protected noise level is all below 70 dB(A).
In night hours, the range affected by such noise is larger. The noise contributed by most
of the construction machinery does not reach 55 dB(A) until a distance about 200 m away
except loaders and graders which reach 55 dB(A) noise level at 300 m away.
As revealed in monitoring of environmental noise at the work site of Zhengzhou-Luoyang
expressway in Henan Province, the range affected by construction machinery is about 100
m during day hours and 200 m in night hours. But some intensive noise sources of such
machines affect to a larger range. Environmental noise impacts by construction are more
significant in night hours.
Fortunately, su^h environmental impacts are only limited to the construction stage. Upon
completion of works, they will no longer exist. Furthermore, such noise is interim and
random (e.g. pilers). If construction activities suspend in night hours, then such noise
impacts will not be significant.
5.1.4 Air Environmental Impact Assessment in Construction Stage
Air-borne pollutants in the construction stage mainly stems from blown dust arising from
lime soil mixing, material transportation as well as asphalt smoke. Major pollutants include
fume, hydrocarbon, phenol and benzopyrene. Analogical analysis method is applied in this
EIA for analyzing air environmental impacts in construction stage.
Lime soil mixing includes decentral mixing at road side and central mixing batching plant.
Blown dust by these two ways differs from one another. The following lists monitoring
results of T.S.P. obtained from the work site of Beijing-Tangshan expressway being under
construction in May 1990.

Note: The contrast point is 200 m windward of the mixing plant.
This table tells that the dust concentration and effect range of roadside mixing are lower
than those of mixing at batch plant, but effect line of the former is longer. Though effect
of the latter mixing mode is concentrated, it increases the possibility of blown dust from
delivering the mixed material to the work site. In line with the local topography, it is proper
to employ roadside mixing for most of the road sections.
The amount of dust caused by vehicles hauling construction materials relates to speed and
capacity of the vehicle, interface of the tyre and road surface, as well as dust content and
relative humidity of the road. Since most of the roads available for such vehicles during the
construction period are earth paths with high dust contents (especially in the summer and
dry seasons), dust blows to a terrible extent. Table 5-5 lists monitoring results of such
blown dust at work site of an expressway subject to similar conditions.

The table tells the TSP density within 100 m of the leeward is above 10 mg/m3, which
suggests the road-dust has significant affect in this area. Up to the area 150 m from the
leeward, the density does not decrease to 1 mg/m3 until the range is 200 off the leeward.
So it is necessary to often wet earth roads.
To sum up, the air impact of dust during the construction period is practically limited in the
area of 200 m while the area of 100 m receives more severe impacts. It is mainly
construction workers that are affected by such dust. It is, therefore, very necessary to
make proper efforts for physical protection of such people.
Asphalt smoke results from construction of asphalt concrete which, in this case, is
centrally prepared at batching plants equipped with closure process and precipitators. The
concrete is delivered to the concreting place in insulating movable high-temperature
containers.
As studies suggest, asphalt, when heated to 1 80°C, produces a large amount of smoke.
The smelting tank fumished in the plant adopted for this project keeps the temperature at
1 60°C, which implies less smoke. In addition, the degreasing and smelting tanks are of a
closure type. So no significant impacts are posed on the air quality.
As analyzed, hydrocarbon and benzene are the main harmful and toxic substances
contained in the asphalt smoke. In October. 1990, a certain monitoring agency in Zhejiang
Province monitored the hydrocarbon and benzene densities at different distances from the
leeward of a asphalt bath plant. And another monitoring agency in Beijing also monitored
such a asphalt batching plant in the outskirts of Beijing. The result suggests that the CnHm
density within 100 m of the leeward does be above the standard, but hydrocarbon density
and benzene content are very low, with asphalt content satisfying Class A standard of the
'Standard for Pollutant Dischargc if Asphalt Industry' (GB4916-85) which says the mean
hourly content of asphalt, when smelted and mixed, is not allowed to be more than 150
mg/mr.
As a result, the effect range of air pollution in construction stage is mainly the area 100
m leeward of the work site. Construction workers are principal victims of such impact.
5.1.5 Relocation and Resettlement
Luoyang and Sanmenxia exercise jurisdiction over 109 villages distributed in 23 xiangs
(township) of 7 counties (city at county level, district), including 10 villages in Mengjin,
1 village from 1 xiang in the outskirts of Luoyang, 20 villages from 3 xiangs (township)
in Xinan, 11 villages from 2 xiangs in Yima, 27 villages from 6 xiangs (township) of
Mianchi, 30 villages in 6 xiangs in Sanmenxia and 10 villages from 3 xiangs in Hubin
District. The former 31 villages are distributed in Luoyang while the latter 78 are governed
by Sanmenxia.
With a total length of 134.214 km, the road will require a total of 14385.24 mu (885.68
ha) land for permanent use. Details are given in Table 5-6.

In addition, a total of 2684 mu land will be requisitioned for temporary purposes in the
construction stage
As a result of land use for permanent purposes, a total of 3436 private rooms 5B065 m2
of 641 households will have to be relocated. In addition, relocation also includes 1014
earth dwelling caves (28479 m2), 318 brick caves (10429 m2). Out of this total, there are
2859 housings (48107 m2). Also, a total of 470 public rooms (8020 M2), including 30
earth caves (833 m2), are required to be relocated.
Other appurtenances to be removed from the land for permanent use include: 30 motor-
pumping wells, 4087 tombs, 17361 m3 fences, 9 brick kilns, 18 lime kilns, 66192 timber
trees and 106302 fruit trees.
5.1.5.2    Resettlement Work Quantity
The population involved is 2885 people of 641 households, including 1298 people being
capable of working or enjoying income source and 1587 without work ability or income
source.
As a result of the land coverage of the road, 9472 villagers will lose all or part of their
leased land, including 4736 with work ability or income source and 4736 without such.
5.1.5.3    Relocation and Resettlement Schedule
Appurtenances to be removed requisitioned land, e.g. real estate, motor well and timber,
will be provided with life-time compensation according to the "Compensation Standard for
Appurtenance to Land Requisitioned for State Construction in Henan Province" and "Notice
on Compensation for Appurtenance to Land Requisitioned for State Construction in Henan
Province" both issued by Henan Provincial Government in its document Do. 113 (1989),
as well as applicable notices issued by the local govemment as may be concemed.
As investigated, all of the 641 households whose housing will have be to relocated hope
to be resettled elsewhere nearby in their original villages. None of them wants to move
out. For resettlement of these people, residential areas will be allocated, as planned, by the
local govemment.
49



Out of tnle total resettlement population, 4736 relocatees with work ability need to be
resettled in respect of work, including 4618 people (97.5%) of them will be resettled, as
they desire, on farmland redistributed by the local government, while the rest 118 12.5%)
go to township enterprises at their will.
Resettlement is very complicated task of strong policy implications. As immediately related
to interests of the affected population, it has always been attached with great importance
by the Government. For construction of the road, well established resettlement
organization will be provided such that all efforts in this aspect-will be in strict compliance
with a series of laws, regulations or policies.
As scheduled, land requisition, relocation and people resettlement will be done from May
1, to September 30, 1996. Such work will be completed by October 1, 1 996 which is the
planned date of commencement.
5.1.5.4     Environmerntal Impact by Resettlement
As due consideration is given to opinions and interests of the affected populations (see
'Public Participation' herein), social impacts due to resettlement will be minimized.
Since all of those with housings to be relocated will be resettled nearby in their villages,
large-scale or long-distance resettlement will not be encountered. The existing environment
at involved villages will not change after resettlement.
Those to go to township enterprises will be employed in existing enterprises. The existing
industrial pollutant sources will not be enlarged as a result of the project. So the project
will not add any new environmental impacts of such nature.
5.2         Environmental Impact Assessment in Operation Stage
5.2.1       Eco-environmental Impact in Operation Stage
5.2.1.1     Impact on Eco-environmental Conditions
In the operation stage, heat absorption by the asphalt road and heat diffusion by vehicle
motors will make the nearby air temperature slight higher than that elsewhere. As a result
of !amps of vehicles driving in night hours, the immediate vicinity of the road will be
subject to light diffusion in prolonged time. The consequent impacts include:
a.    Such slight temperature rise in the immediate vicinity may increase temperature
cumulation to be beneficial to growth of crops;
b.    Such slight temperature rise may accelerate decomposition of chemical fertilizers
and pesticides such that more fertilizers and pesticides have to be applied, which
means more agricultural input;
50



c.    Such temperature rise may also speed up moisture evaporation and increase water
demand of plants;
d.    Being exposed to more light diffusion, crops will be in better position for growth,
but this is not the case for short-illumination crops; and
e.    Constitution of air on both sides of the rcad in operation will change in such a way
that CO and NO, portions will be somewhat increased.
The range of such ecological effects, including light, temperature and air, is limited and
insignificant.
5.2.1.2     Water and Soil Loss upon Completion of the Road
Slope protection and afforestation measures will be exercises upon completion of the road,
and surface vegetation destroyed will be gradually recovered.
Ramps will be protected with grouted scabbling, concrete grids and grass. In case of cut
sections, ramps will be stabilized with grouted scabbling, concrete grids, shotcrete or
sprayed grass seeds in line with the geology, ramp height and slope. Also, water sumps
will be provided, as appropriate, to lead natural slope water to natural ditches or other
drainage facilities.
As a result, water and soil erosion upon the road construction will be put under better
control and the loss will not be worse than the present situation.
5.2.1.3     Prediction of Lead Content of Soil during Oseration Stage
Lead contained in vehicle exhaust originates from lead ethide applied to the fuel to avoid
explosion. Based on relevant documentation, 50-60% of the lead accompanying the
exhaust gas drops in the range 200 m from the road sides while the other 40-50%
suspends in air and drifts farther. The lead inflow to the soil in the vicinity of the road will
accumulate. The local soil are slight alkaline and soil lead does not vertically move to a
large extent, so lead accumulates in the cultivable layer.
Accumulation of lead in the cultivable layer is predicted as follows:
F = aob*q*po3651G
in which,
F= annual lead discharge of unit vehicle
a = average fuel consumption, assuming a = 0.231 1/km
b = average lead content of fuel, assuming b = 0.2 g/l
o = lead ratio of exhaust pipe, assuming 7 = 75%
p = lead deposition ratio at leeward, assuming p = 60%
G =soil weight of cultivable layer at leeward,
G=0.2 m x 100 x 1 0000 m x 1.2 t/m2=24000 t
51



When discharged from exhaust gas, the lead partly drops on crop leaves and drifts away
and partly penetrates in the nearby soil at a ratio assumed to be 85%.
The total accumulation of lead W = KIB + R)
in which,
W =lead accumulated in soil
K =residual ratio of lead in soil
B =background value of lead in cultivable layer of soil
R =average annual lead inflow to soil
Lead accumulation in n year is as follows:
W,,= KJ K,- 1 1 ... KAKI B + RI)+ R2) + ...Re-l + RJ
if R,=R2=R3= ...R,,, then
W,=BK"+KnRI+Kb'R,+... +RnK=BK1 +N kt.,Kn-3
Predicted lead content of cultivable layer along the road are as shown in Table 5-7.
As the prediction suggests, such content in base year of the initial operation stage ranges
from 30 to 40 mg/kg which is slight higher than the background value. In 2010 and 2020,
respectively base year of the middle and late operation stages, the value will be
respectively 60 mg/kg and 100 mg/kg. All these are neither above the limit of 300 mg/kg
as recommended by the Ministry of Agriculture for soils with pH value at 6.5, nor above
the vworld average of 2-200 mg/kg.
5.2.1.4    Agricultural Impact in Operation Stage
With adequate provision of 248 culverts/passages and 145 bridges with varying sizes, the
road will not affect irrigation facilities. Also, field farming activities will not be affected,
either. Other agricultural impacts are not significant.
When the road is put into service, the structure of crops will be properly adjusted. Within
the range 100 m from the road sides, growth of vegetables potato and sweet potato are
not recommended. Otherwise, crop quality will be affected or lead in soil will be handed
down via food chain. In line with the local topography, it is proper to develop forestry in
the range 100 m off the road.
Along the road, farming should be carried out in a scientific manner to gain more from unit
farmland and to offset the loss caused by the land occupancy.
Provided with bridges and culverts, all the natural ditches and canals will not pose any
impact on the irirgation systems here.

5.2.2 Prediction and Evaluation of Traffic Noise Impact
5.2.2.1     Selection of Prediction Model
American FHWA model is used to predict equivalent traffic noise level. With a large traffic
flow in day hours, vehicles driving on the road can be regarded as infinite and
discontinuous noise sources. The model is expressed as follows:
L,w=L,=x +3.O1g(Qj/V1) +lOlg(zorl) 8 +s-13
As the traffic flow in nigh is small, vehicles driving on the road can be deemed as
discontinuous point noise sources. The model is expressed as follows:
L,q=LAj..+l01g(Q/jVjT) | 201g(zolz) +101g(zO1z)1 's&s-13
Then, the equivalent traffic noise level at a given point of the roadside is:
L07=lO1g (  10° W) -'&-
in which,
L,,=equivalent traffic noise level of "i" type vehicle dB(A)
L,= equivalent traffic noise level, d(BA)
LA,.= average reference ene-gy level, dB(A), of "i"type vehicles
()=traffic flow of 'i" type vehicle (vehicle/h)
VJI=average speed of Yi type vehicle (km/h)
T = sampling time, 1 hour (hi
r.= distance for observing L_ (m)
r =distance from observation point to effective lane (m)
&S = revision, OS = 3S1 + 3S2
&L =total revision, ;l = ,LI + ,L2 + )l3
5.2.2.2     Determination of Relevant Parameters of the Prediction Model
a.    Average Reference L,,..
This parameter relates to the average speed of vehicles. The relationship is as follows:
small vehicle:           LA,, =59.3 + 0.23 V
middle vehicle:          LM,,,= 62.6 + 0.32 V
large vehicle:           L,,, =77.2 + 0.18 V
Based on the actual speed of various types of vehicles in different base years as stated in
Chapter 2 herein, it is known that LA,. of large, middle and small vehicles in different base
years of the operation stage is as listed in Table 5-8.
Table 5-8 LAm,.M of Various Vehicles
unit: dB(A)
Year\LA,\Vehicle Type           Small         Middle         Large
2000                             82.3          88.2           88.7
2010                             80.7          86.6           88.0
2020                             78.8          85.0           87.5
54



b.    Traffic Flow Versus Actual Average Speed
Traffic flow and actual average speed in different base years are predicted as shown in
Tables 2-8 and 2-10 in Chapter 2.
c.    Distance from Prediction Point to Effective Lane
Such distance is calculated as follows:
r=PD.xD,
in which
D"=distance from prediction to nearer lane
Df =distance from prediction point to farther lane
d.    Revision &S
Revision AS is composed of two components, one is due to longitudinal slope of the road
and the other is due to the road surface.
The former component is considered as follows:
large vehicle:          &S slope=98 x 6
middle vehicle:         &S slope=73 x 6
small vehicle:          &S slope= 50 x 6
The maximum longitudinal slope of the road is 4%, so the revision is calculated as 4 dB(A)
in case of large vehicles, 3 dB(A) in case of middle vehicles and 2 dBIA) in case of small
ones.
The component due to road surface depends upon the road coarseness. This road is paved
asphalt concrete, such revision is zero.
e.    Total Revision &L
Such is due to 3 factors, road bend or finite section length, air absorption and acoustic
shadow.
In the prediction of traffic noise, the road is deemed as an infinite linear source. So revision
due to bending or finite section length is zero.
As measured, air is high absorptive in case of high-frequency sound above 2000 Hz.
However, spectrum analysis of traffic noise suggests that such noise belongs to low-
frequency sound at 125-1000 Hz, so air absorption is not obvious and its effect may be
ignored. This is to say such this part of revision is also deemed at zero.

Embankment Structure

Through-cut Structure
-~~~



Revision caused by acoustic shadow relates to the road configuration. Such acoustic
shadow is judged as shown in Figure 5-1 and Figure 5-2 which, by triangle approximate
method, indicates that:
Embankment structure: if D> HL  2 d, then the prediction point is in the
acoustic shadow; if D< H+hl h2 d, then the prediction point is in the insonify zone
i-1.
Cut structure: if D> h +h2 Hd, the prediction point is in the acoustic shadow;
h 2
when D< 1h2_  d, the prediction is in the insonify zone
A2
In case of prediction points in insonify zones, there is no revision due to acoustic shadow.
In case of prediction points in acoustic shadow, such revision depends on acoustic range
difference.
Point A in the aforesaid figures is located in the acoustic shadow, the acoustic range
difference , = a + b-c.
Embankment structure:    a =-H2 -d2
b=V (D-di) - + 03 z-.
Cut structure:          a=I (D-d) 2+ (h3 -H) 2
b=-d2 +h2
C=VD2, (h +h2-H)2
With known acoustic range difference, revision due to acoustic shadow can be retrieved
from the acoustic range difference to acoustic shadow revision relationship curve.
5.2.2.3     Predicted Traffic Noise
On the principle that "points and lines should be combined, with focus on points", traffic
noise at 16 typical sensitive points included in Chapter 3 herein is predicted as listed in
Table 5-9.
On the basis of prediction results, traffic noise I.q isograms are worked out as shown in
Figures 5-3 through 5-12 with reference to the EIA noise standard that is 70 dB(A) in day
and 55 dB(A) in night hours.
56



5.2.2.4     Evaluation of Traffic Noise Impact
The range 200 m off the roadside applies Category IV standard of the 'Environmental
Noise Standard for Urban Areas (GB3096-93) while schooles and hospitals in the range
100-200 away are evaluated in compliance with Category II standard therein. Overproof
of traffic noise at the 16 typical sensitive points is as listed in Table 5-10.
As the statistical results suggest, day and night traffic poise lq at Dongcun 200 m off the
road centerline in the initial operation stage satisfies Category 11 standard. In the middle
and late operation stages, the noise L. is above the standard only when it is subject to the
peak traffic flow in day hours, and the overproof is less than 5 dB(A). The noise L,q at
Shanglinghou 90 m off the road centerline is not above the standard in the situation of
average traffic flow during day hours in both initial and middle operation stages. The value
during day and night hours in middle and late operation stages is above the standard in
some cases, though, the overproof is less than 5 dB(A). This suggests that traffic noise
only poses trace of impacts on the rage 100-200 m off the roadside, but the range 100
m away receives more traffic noise impacts.
Out of the sensitive points 100 m off the roadside, Shuiquan, Uncun and Huocun will be
exposed to traffic noise overproof higher than 10 dB(A) during night hours in the initial
operation stage. In the middle operation stage, the number of such sensitive points with
overproof more than 10 dB(A) in night hours goes up to 10, with a maximum overproof
of 17.7 dB(A). The noise level in day hours will not be above the standard. Up to the late
operation stage, all these points, save for Tulinghou and Chengcun, will be exposed to
traffic noise overproof higher than 10 dB(A) in nighr hours. At the average traffic flow in
day hours, only 1 point will have overproof higher than 10 dB(A), with a maximum being
10.7 dB(A) above the standard.
Since the acoustic environment is in a relatively good situation and the background value
of environmental noise is at a low level at most of the road sections, the environmental
noise L., at these points in the operation stage does not greatly differ to the predicted
noise levels when superimposed to the background values. Superimposition results are as
given in Table 5-11
Therefore, the range 100 m off the road in operation, especially in middle and late stages,
will suffer from traffic noise disturbance. In particular, rest at night will be affected to a
greater extent. It is thus necessary to provide these points with engineering or other
measures to mitigate such impacts.

5.2.3      Air Environmental Impact Assessment
5.2.3.1    Pollution of Meteorology
Field aerophysical surveys were carried out along the road in Luoyang, Xinan, Yima,
Mianchi and Sanmenxia in 1990-1993. The measured results suggest that the low-altitude
detection data are well pertinent and coincident with ground observation data provided by
corresponding meterological stations. Wind deviation in 80% cases is not more than one
position while that in fewer than 10% cases is not more than two positions. As a result,
the ground observation data available at the local meterological stations can be used for
analyzing the polluted meterological features.
In terms of the local jurisdiction and topographic features, meterological data used, through
analysis and comparison, for the EIA are as follows:
Luoyang-Xinan section:       meterological data from Luoyang
Xinan-Yima section:    meterological data from Xinan
Xinan-Mianchi section:       meterological data from Mianchi
Mianchi-Sanmenxia section:   meterological data from Sanmenxia
Such data from these sources are all from in the series from 1989-1993.
a.    Conventional Observation Values of Meterological Elements
Conventional observations of meterological elements obtained from Luoyang, Xinan,
Mianchi and Sanmenxia in the past 5 years are as stated in Table 5-12.
Table 5-12 Average Values of Contentional Meterological Observation Values
Etement             Unit  Luoyang Xinan  Mianchi Sanmenxia
Annual Average Temperature    °C      14.4   14.1   12.4    13.9
Annual Average Air pressure   HPa            987.0  955.7   970.2
Annual Average Precipitation  mm      585.4  670.0  631.6   554.9
lAnnual Average Relative Humidity %   69      S5      66       60
As seen from the table, the local precipitation and relative humidity are on the lower side,
which means the project area is dry.
b.    Ground Wind Speed
Long-term average and maximum wind speed values are figured out, on the basis of the
statistics data over the past 5 years, as shown in Table 5-13.

In the year, wind speed in the spring and winter is relative higher as compared with that
in the summer and autumn.
c.    Ground Wind Direction
Ground wind direction frequencies from place to place are described in Table 5-14.

Wind frequencies in different places along the road are as illustrated in the rosettes.
d.   Air Stability
Based on the above mentioned meterological data, air stability is divided, by Pasquill
stability categorization method, into 3 categories, namely, unstable, neutral and stable. The
total frequency of neutral and stability in the aforesaid cities along the road is all above
70% while that of unstable is less than 30%.
e.   Inversion
Among different types of inversion, the inversion on the ground imposes the most
significant impacts on the exhaust diffusion of vehicles. Based on the measured data
provided by Luoyang, Xinan, Mianchi and Sanmenxia, such inversion occurs 17:20 and
63



then intensifies until its climax at 2:00-4:00 the next morning. As the sun rises, it
disappears as temperature goes up. The measured data also indicate that duration, top
height and intensity of ground inversion in the winter are all higher than those in the
summer. Frequency of ground inversion is rather high in the project area, with a minimum
top height generally being 30-50 m and maximum about 300 m. The average inversion
intensity is 1.50C/100 m.
The existence of such inversion is unfavorable to exhaust diffusion. Fortunately, most of
such occurs in night hours when the traffic flow -is relatively small and less exhaust is
discharged. Therefore, it will not cause significant air environmental impacts along the
road.
5.2.3.2     Prediction Factor and Source Intensity
Factors selected for predicting the local air environmental impacts include CO and NO,.
With the road regarded as an infinite linear source, the intensity is calculated as follows:
Q = f -Sk I jB jj
in which:
Q =linear intensity of "j" pollutant (mg/m.s)
Si=traffic flow of "i" type vehicles (vehicle/h)
K11 =emission factor of "i" pollutant by "j" vehicle
Bq=revision of "i" pollutant by "jI type vehicle

5.2.3.6    Prediction Results
Prediction results obtained from the 19 typical sensitive points are given in Table 5-18.
In the initial operation stage, CO concentration of air at these points may be, at most,
2.792 mg/m3 which is 28% of the EIA standard while the maximum NO. concentration
may be 0.204 mg/m3 which is 36% above the standard. The points with overproof are
located in Luoyang-Xinan section except the instantaneous NO, content is above the
standard at Shuiquan, Lingou, Beizhuanggou and Huocun except Dongcun which is 200
m off the road.
In the middle operation stage, the maximum CO concentration at all of these points may
be 5.220 mg/m3 which, though is not above the standard, accounts for more than 50%
thereof. The instantaneous NO. content may be as high as 0.380 mg/m3, i.e. 1.5 times
above the standard. Such points are located at Luoyang-Xinan and Xinan-Yima sections.
During the late operation stage, the maximum CO concentration at all of these points may
be 7.193 mg/ml3 which, though is not above the standard, accounts for more than 72%
thereof. The instantaneous NO, content at all of points may be above the standard, with
a maximum value 0.526 mg/m3, i.e. 2.5 times above the standard.
It is obvious that NO. will be the leading air pollutant when the road is put into service. At
high traffic flow, the instantaneous NO. content may be above the standard. Up to the late
operation stage, instantaneous NO. concentration at sensitive points 200 m leeward of the
road will be prubably above the standard at peak traffic flow. The instantaneous CO
content at leeward of the road in the entire operation stage is not above the standard,
though, it may be more than 70% thereof.
When the road is open to traffic, exhaust gas will cause significant impacts on sensitive
points 100 m leeward of the road. And such impact will increase as the traffic flow goes
up.
Table 5.19 gives results of present concentrations superimposed by predicted values at
these 19 sensitive points. As the table suggests, the superimposed concentrations are
greatly contributed by exhaust pollutants of vehicles. The overproof of pollutant contents
at these points are almost the same as the predicted results. In middle and late operation
stages, instantaneous CO and NO. concentration proof will be more significant, especially,
NO, values may be above the standard at all of these points, with a maximum overproof
higher than predicted.
Tables through 5-20 to 5-43 include predicted instantaneous CO and NO. concentrations
in different stages of the operation period. The. results suggest that the leeward CO and
NO. concentrations at day peak traffic flow is more than double of the values at average
day average flow. Overproof of air pollutants at leeward of the road, especially NO., will
mainly occur at day hours with peak traffic flow.
As predicted, Luoyang-Xinan section will be exposed to more impacts of such nature in
the operation stage. Up to the late operation stage, the maximum affected range in this
section may reach 140 m leeward. At day average traffic flow, such range involved in the
rest sections will not be more than 100 m leewards.
When the road is open to traffic, NO, will be the predominating air pollutant at leeward.
In line with the local topography and polluted meterological conditions, there will be less
possibility of cumulative air pollution and photochemical smog pollution.

5.3  Social Environmental Impact Assessment
Procurement of cement, steel, timber among other building materials required for the road
construction will promote the local industrial development.
In the construction stage, a total of 20 million workdays will be required, which will
provide the local dwellers with more jobs and higher incomes.
Also, a plenty of food, vegetable and meat among other produce will be required in the
construction period, which will provide more opportunities for produce sales. Utilization of
the infrastructures in the local cities and townships will be improved.
Many vehicles from the local communities will be engaged in hauling building materials.
This will promote the local communication and transportation development.
The road will be provided with 7 interchanges spaced at an average interval of 21 km, 27
overpasses, 137 passageways and 66 through-cut overline bridges (at average space of
1.5/km). Such passageways include:
Xiang-village road     6.3 x 3.5 m
Traitor-ploughing road  4.0 x 3.0 m
Walkway                3.0 x 2.3 m
All grade highways cross by the road will be provided with interchanges or overpasses
while out-of-grade roads, xiang-village roads and tractor-ploughing paths are furnished with
passageways or overline bridges. Communications blockage will be brought about upon
completion of the road. As a result, impacts on normal communication and farming of the
local communities will be minimized.
The road, when completed, will cut down passenger and cargo transportation cycles,
which will reduce fuel consumption and transport costs. Access between east and west
parts of the project area will be easy and will provide opportunities for commodities to
enter the market very soon. This will greatly push forward the local economy.
Upon completion of the road, convenient communication and transportation will further
improve the investment environment and attract more foreign funds.
Creation of the road will be beneficial for rational movability of labor forces such that more
jobs will be available.
5.4   Landscape Impacts
The project area is of a complicated topography In some areas, the land fluctuates to a
great extent. With developed gullies and low vegetation coverage, the existing landscape
is just so so.
Large quantities of embankment and excavation works required the road will significantly
destroy the natural landscape in limited areas.
Upon completion of the road, artificial efforts will be made to add some new contents to
the existing landscape. The project design has incorporated consideration attempting to
94



fit the road into the local natural landscape provided the general layout, plane curve radius
and maximum longitudinal slope among indices are satisfied.
Sections of the road in mountain and hilly areas are aligned by making full use of the
topographic features. Some sections are arranged to go along the massif contour. In case
of a large gully, an overline is built to minimize any possible destruction of the physical
configuration of the gully. Aesthetic effect is considered in design of bridges under the
condition of rational structure. Especially, the super-large bridge across the Qinglong River
at kl 16 + 740, with a length of 1912.1 m and height of 80-odd m, will also cross National
Road 310, Long-Hai railway. Continuous rigid structures with large span will be used, with
thin-walled hollow pier studs. The bridge will look magnificent and majestic. It will prove
an important new spot.
The road is altogether provided with 5 interchanges which are single hom-shaped except
the Y-shaped interchange located east of Sanmenxia. With nice-looking configuration and
smooth ramps, these will be also important spots.
The road design include efforts to afforest the slope and vicinity of the land area used for
the road such that this new landscape will be integrated into the physical nature.
Upon completion of the road, natural landscape destruction due to construction activities
will be replaced by new manmade efforts.
5.5   Risk Analysis of Traffic Accident
In accordance with geological data, the road will not face much possibility of mud-stone
flow and massif slide which will interfere with the road operation.
The recommended alignment scheme avoids the large coal subsidence at Guanyintang such
that subgrade instability as a result of ground settlement will not be the case.
In the project design stage, Henan Provincial Seismic Association verified, as entrusted,
the basic earthquake intensity and conducted bridge/culvert antiseismic design so that
impacts of possible earthquakes will be minimized.
When the road is open to traffic, large traffic flow and high speed of vehicles, especially
those carrying harmful, toxic, flammable and explosive materials, will provide more
changes of traffic accidents. In the event of any traffic accident, great environmental
impact will be suffered. Apart from proper management to keep the road always in good
condition, emphasized efforts are required to properly handle management of vehicles and
drivers, see Chapter 6 for detailed countermeasures.
5.6   Other Environmental Impacts
5.6.1 Environmental Impacts Contributed by Service Zones
All boilers in the service zones will fumished with precipitators such that the smoke
density will satisfy the national standard of 'Emission Standard for Smoke of Btoiler". The
boilers are design not to be lower than 1.5 times of the highest structure in the vicinity.
So gas from boilers will not bring about significant environmental impacts.
95



In the short run, wastewater from service zones are proposed to be simply treated, before
discharged, in septic tanks as follows:
wastewater -septic tank   discharge
Provided it financially allows in the long run, such wastewater will be disposed as follows:
oil-containing wastewater-oil separation tank- deoiling
wastewater
domestic wastewater-*septic tank--*aerobic biological
treatment---.precipitation-----edischarge
Therefore, provision of service zones should properly planned to reserve wastewater
treatment places. Drainage from these zones will be treated to meet relevant standards
before discharged.
Domestic rubbish in these zones should be centrally placed and then buried in depressions
in line with topography here.
As above analyzed, environmental impacts in such zones will be minor provided proper
measures are to be implemented.
5.6.2 Project Impacts on Water Intake Works
Generally, the expressway will not affect quality of the surface water body. Even in the
operation stage, the road will not significantly affect the Qinglong River water quality.
Huaipa water pumping station in Yima divert the Yellow River flow from Xipo Village,
Huaipa xiang of Mianchi County, and deliver it bridge gap of domestic water demand in
Yima. The works include a regulation reservoir at Xiduan Village. The area west of this
reservoir up to the Yellow River is mountainous where water is delivered via tunnels,
aqueducts and canals. From the reservoir to the city proper of Yima, delivery conduits are
all closed prestressed concrete pipes which will be crossed by the road. Consequently, the
water quality will not be degraded. For this purpose, the road will be provided with
culverts to facilitate maintenance of delivery conduits. The designed construction schedule
of the water pumping works is 3 years which will overlap the construction period of the
road which, however, will only bump into the pumping station at a single place, and the
intersecting distance is very short. So interference of construction will not be significant.
In Mianchi County, the Yanghe water intake project provides Mianchi County seal with
water diverted from the Yanghe River northwest of the county seat. The road will come
across the closed delivery conduit, but a culvert will be provided. Likewise, the road will
almost cause no impact on this water intake project.

Chapter 6 Environmental Protection Measures. Environmental
Manaaement and Monitorinn Programs
6.1   Analysis of Altemative
In the project design stage, quite a few comparative alignment schemes (altematives) were
proposed. The most important is the alternative scheme close to Guanyintang.
From Mianchi to Sanmenxia, there is a large work-out coal subsidence north of
Guanyintang. It is hard to the ground settlement in such subsidence to come to an end in
a short time period. There are two alignment schemes for this place, one is to go south of
Guanyintang, by a roundabout way, to avoid the coal subsidence, and the other is to go
through the work-out coal mine and to straightly head west. Table 6-1 gives comparison
of these two altematives in respect of length, work quantity, geology and environmental
setting.
6.1.1 Length of Route
As the aforesaid table reveals, the south scheme is 3.469 longer than the north one. As
calculated on the basis of the unit cost of this road, i.e. 30 million RMB, the south scheme
will cost 100 million RMB more than the north one. Moreover, the south route passes
twice across National Road 310 and Long-Hai railway, and the configuration is inferior to
that of the north scheme. In this aspect, the north scheme is superior to the south one.
6.1.2 Quantity of Main Works
Land coverage of both schemes is very similar, but soil works quantity of the south
scheme will be approximately 2 million m2 more than that of the north alignment scheme.
Either scheme needs 4 super-large bridges, but the total of such included in the south is
1500 m longer. While the south scheme needs more bridges of varying sizes, culverts and
overpasses, the north scheme will ask for provision of 2660 m two-way tunnels which
have to be completed with adequate ventilation and lighting among other facilities. The
south scheme does not required such provision.
In terms of the total quantity of works, these two schemes do not greatly differ to one
another.
6.1.3 Topography, Geomorphology and Engineering Geology
The south route is situated where the topography is relatively flat while the north scheme
passes through fluctuating land areas.
The north route directly passes through the work-out coal mine area, which represents
possibility of ground settlement. As time being, there is no desirable subgrade treatment
method to deal with such geological conditions. And there is no pioneering project of such
a nature in China. As envisaged, the treatment is to separate underground coal mining
roadways with masonry walls plus rockfill mud jacking method, and to apply high-pressure
grout treatment to drillholes made at given depth under the ground. But it is difficult and
expensive to do so. The north route is alignment where there are many coal mine shafts.
In some areas, mining is under way or is to proceed. To this end, it is necessary to reserve
mining pillars such that the existing coal mines will suffer some loss.

The south alignment scheme avoids the worked-out mine area. There is underground coal
deposits along this scheme, though, they are not mined now. So mining pillars can be
reserved to ensure subgrade stability.
It is obvious that the south scheme is superior in this respect.
6.1.4 Environmental Setting
In monitoring of the environmental setting, a monitoring point at set at Beixiecun on the
north route. Table 6-1 includes comparison of environmental setting monitoring results of
this point versus Shishuicun on the south route.
As the monitoring results suggest, both schemes are exposed to similar environmental
setting except that there are fewer populations along the north route. 'In environmental
settings of both schemes are relatively good.
6.1.5 Recommended Scheme
Based on the previous all-round analysis, the south scheme is recommended herein,
namely, the scheme which goes south of Guanyintang, by a roundabout way, to avoid the
coal subsidence.
6.2  Environmental Protection Measures
6.2.1 Environmental Mitigation Measures in Design Stage
6.2.1.1    Environmental mitigation measures were incorporated into the project design
in principles as listed in Table 6-2.
6.2.1.2    The road alignment has given due consideration to the local network
planning. To regulate macro benefits, public consultation has been conducted to know
what the local govemments and communities think. Also, the following principles have
been taken into account:
a.   To take Luoyang, Xinan, Yffna, Mianchi and Sanmenxia among other major cities
and townships as main control points, with consideration to connection of the road
with Weinan-Untong expressway in Shannxi Province;
b.   To arrange the road on both sides of Long-Hai railway and National Road 310 so
as to properly link the road with the existing railway and highway network;
c.   To keep the road "not so close to enter but not so far to avoid' major cities and
townships in line with short and long-term development plans thereof such that the
road is 3-7 km off these cities and townships;
d.   To avoid important archaeological sites and villages as many as possible so as to
minimize relocation and resettlement work and to mitigate adverse impacts on
cultural relics and villages;
99



e.    To avoid worked-out coal mines among other geologically-improper areas in line
with coal mining plans.
Table 6-2 Environmental Principles Considered in Design Stage
Description                        Environmental Principle
Route Selection   To properly align by roundabout way or other measures in line with the
topography and road network.
Social Disruption  Adequate number of interchanges; overpasses, underpasses and
through-cut overline bridges were designed.
Soil Erosion     To stabilize slope with engineering and biological measures so as to
control waterlsoil loss. Planting of trees and grass on median divider
and along the roadside was included in the design. As appropriate,
water sumps will be designed to lead natural slope water to natural
ditches or other drainage facilities.
Earth Works      To longitudinally allocate soil works, reduce the quantity of soil
borrow/spoil and minimize damage to topography, vegetation and
farmland.
Water Pollution    Waste water treatment facilities were designed for service zones.
Noise            Noise barriers, brick walls, double glass windows or other measures
were identified and integrated in the design.
Flooding         To provide adequate number of large. medium or small bridges and
culverts in line with the actuality, to consider adequate flood frequency
in design.
Cultural Relics  Cultural relics survey was carried out, archaeological salvation will be
undertaken.
Afforestation    To consider militation of exhaust gas and traffic noise mitigation by
aesthetic effect.
Landscape        Afforestation design paid due attention to aesthetic effect. Bridge
design also included considerations to aesthetic effect.
6.2.1.3      Adequate attention is given to proper longitudinal allocation of soil works
such that spoil materials from excavation works are used for embankment to minimize use
and destruction of farmland due to borrow/spoil operations on farmland and to reduce
agricultural impacts and vegetation destruction.
Whenever it is difficult to longitudinally allocate soil works such soil materials required for
embankment fail to be satisfied, central soil borrow will be done at fixed positions located
at highland or wasteland on both sides of the road. But excavation depth is required to be
controlled for facilitating future re-ploughing the borrow pits. In case of section with
extremely high embankment, overline bridges will be provided to minimize use of soil. Spoil
areas are located at depressions so as not occupy any farmland. Prior to spoil soil, the
topsoil should be put aside. And spoil areas must be levelled, upon completion of the
works, and then covered with the topsoil for the purpose of re-ploughing.
100



6.2.1.4     The local economy is relatively advanced. To give due consideration to the
local interests, interchanges will be set up at important townships in addition to major
cities and county seats. Altogether, there will be 7 interchanges spaced at an average
interval of 22 km. The road will be provided with 27 overpasses, 139 passageways and
66 through-cut overline bridges such that normal communication and farming will not be
affected as a consequence of the proposed road.
6.2.1.5     The road is to be supported by 10 super-large bridges, 31 large ones, 4
middle. and 7 small-sized ones, as well as 111 culverts. The super-large bridges are
designed to withstand floods once in 300 years while the other bridges and culverts apply
flood probability of 1 %. This ensures that the existing function, flow pattem and discharge
of the rivers, ditches and canal will not be deteriorated.
6.2.1.6     Detailed resettlement implementation plans were worked out in the project
design stage. Well established organizations will be provided such that relocation and
resettlement work will be completed prior to commencement of construction activities.
6.2.1.7     Henan Archaeological Research Institute has finished resurveying and
exploring cultural relics along the road, and has developed archaeological salvation plans.
Salvation of the cultural relics will be completed prior to commencement of the project.
6.2.1.8     In design of slopes, high embankment slopes will be stabilized with grouted
scabbling, concrete grids, shotcrete and grass while deep cut slopes are protected with
grouted scabbling, concrete grids, shotcrete or sprayed grass seeds in line with the
geology, ramp height and slope. Also, water sumps will be provided, as apprcpriate, to
lead natural slope water to natural ditches or other drainage facilities.
6.2.1.9     Afforestation envision is improved to include aesthetic effect of median
divider, slope and ditch as well afforestation beyond the land coverage of the road. Design
of bridges also includes aesthetic effect provided that their proper structure is guaranteed.
The design also proposes provision of manmade landscape at both service zones and
interchanges such that the local landscape will be improved.
6.2.1.10    Service zones will be fumished with wastewater treatment facilities and
boilers are designed to be equipped with dust precipitators.
6.2.1.11    It is proven, by Henan Provincial Archaeological Institute, that there are
altogether 10 underground archaeological sites distributed dlong the proposed road. All
archaeological salvation and protection activities will be completed after land acquisition
and prior to the project commencement.
6.2.1.12    For this expressway to contribute to the local landscape after its completion,
the afforestation design has considered the integrity of different plants such that the
landscape will differ from place to place.
Super and large-sized bridges are designed to be of T-shape configuration and different
span values to avoid simplicity and similarity. Also, guardrails are different from bridge to
bridge such that each bridge has its own unique characteristics.

6.2.2      Environmental Protection Measures for Construction Stage
6.2.2.1    According to the quantity of works, layout of structures and administrative
jurisdiction, this expressway is proposed to be divided into 8 lots, namely,
Lot 1 kO + 000-k12 + 385     Mengjin-Luoyang outskirts section 12.385 km
Lot 2 kl2+385-k38+915        Xinan section                 26.530 km
Lot 3 k38 +915-k47 +228      Mianchi section               11.756 km
Lot 4 k47+228-k56+557        Yima section                   9.329 km
Lot 5 k60+000-k81 +795       west Mianchi section          21.795 km
Lot 6 k81 + 795-k99 +060     east Shanxian section         16.797 km
(k96 + 467.994 = k96 + 000, chain breakage, 468 m shorter)
Lot 7 k100+000-k109+359  west Shanxian section             22.989 km
k122+070-k135+700
(k 100 +000=k99+060, chain breakage, 940 m shorter)
Lot 8 k109 + 359-kl 22 + 070  Hubin (Sanmenxia) section    12.633 km
(kl22+070-kl21 +992.142, chain breakage, 77.8 m shorter)
All these lots almost deserve the same environmental protection measures in construction
activities as summarized in Table 6-3.
6.2.2.2    Provided the work quality is not affected, solid industrial wastes such as fly
ash and slag as included in Table 6-3 may be applied to embankment sections so as to
reduce soi; demand. Such wastes are to be used as shown in Fgure 6-1.
6.2.2.3    As required by subgrade compaction, each of the 8 lots should be equipped
with a watering car which will also serve xiang-village earth paths used to building material
hauling purposes. Requirements in this respect are spelled out in Table 6-3.
6.2.2.4    Wherever it does be difficult to carry out central lime-soil mixing, decentral
roadside mixing is allowed provided it is far from any village and construction workers
engaged in such activities are provided with necessary protection devices.
6.2.2.5    All and any environmental measures for the construction stage shall be
incorporated into the tender documents of each lot such that the contractors will be aware
of and comply with such measures.
6.2.2.6    In case of any road section passing through coal field, alignment, statement
of construction and land requisition requirement shall be given to the coal mine as well its
responsible department and the' local government such that the mining plan would be
adjusted, as appropriate. This is to ensure that mining pillars will be reserved at proper
locations and that the subgrade will be stable. Also, this is to ensure that mining and road
construction activities will not interfere with each other.
6.2.3 Environmental Protection Measures for Operation Stage
6.2.3.1    Environmental impact mitigatingloffsetting measures forthe operation stage
are summarized in Table 64, while Tables 6-5, 6-6 and 6-7 separately include 'Allowable
Noise Standard for Motor Vehicles" (6B1495-79), "Emission Standard for Smoke from
Diesel Vehicle at Free Acceleration" (GB3843-83) and "Emission Standard for Pollutant
from Gasoline Vehicle at Idle Speed" (GB3842-83) related to environmental measures
proposed for the operation period.
102



6.2.3.2    For mitigating or avoiding environmental impacts due to accidental events
in the operation period, the following measures are proposed herein:
a.    Enhanced management of vehicles to ensure they are in good condition;
b.   Strengthened training services for drivers to forbid any driving in drunkness and
fatigue, and to forbid any forcible overtaking;
c.   Any vehicle carrying toxic, harmful, flammable, explosive and volatile among any
other dangerous things should have permissions issued by public security, fire and
communications departments;
d.   In case of windy, snowy, foggy and freezing days, vehicles should be driven at
limited speed, or sections of the road should be closed as appropriate;
e.    Dynamic management and monitoring of vehicles driving on the road should be
enhanced such that any abnormal condition would be promptly reported;
f.   In case of any explosion and fire, fire departments should be promptly informed and
the road section involved should be closed before such event is properly treated;
g.   In case of any traffic pollution event, emergency remedies should be provided as
required, and responsible environmental agencies at different levels should be
immediately informed such that corresponding measures can be taken as
appropriate;
6.2.3.3    Since rural housings generally face the south with gates and windows in
south rather than north walls. As a result, villages on the right side (north) of the road will
be exposed, in fact, to more traffic noise impacts than those on the other side. Relatively,
these villages on the right deserve better efforts to mitigate traffic noise impacts.
6.2.3.4    In accordance with predicted traffic noise levels, it is necessary to provide
sound arresters in case of traffic noise Lq above 10 dBIA) above the standard so that the
work and rest of the local residents will not be interfered because of the road construction.
As screened, sensitive points deserving such sound arresters are as listed in Table 6-8.
It is necessary to provide the sensitive points included in Table 3-5 and other villages 100
m off the road centerline as included in Table 3-4 with the following measures:
a.   To raise fences of the first row of housings immediately close to the road;
b.   To provide double windows for the first 3 rows of housing immediately close to the
right side of the ro&i;
c.   To surround villages with forest belts with a width not less than 30 m.

6.2.3.5     The local housing are almost single-storeyed with a height of 4.0 m. As
calculated, 2.5 m high sound arresters will be able to keep the sensitive points within in
acoustic shadow Such that noise attenuation will be achieved. There are lots of modes to
be used for sound arresters, some of them are as shown in Figure 6-1. The building
materials to be used to such sound arresters should be selected with consideration to the
sound absorptivity. Such materials include super-fine glass wool, mineral wool, rock wool,
cement expanded perlite board and slag expanded perlite board. Brick walls (especially
polished brick wall) are less sound absorptive. Building materials cab be selected in light
of the cost among other factors. Generally, such sound arresters are able to reduce noise
at nearby sensitive points by 10 dB(A).
106



Raising fences on the side immediately close to the road is of the same effect as sound
arresters.
It is reported that noise reduction is only about 4 dBIA) with all doors and windows open
and the reduction is some 10 dB(A) with all of such close. With double windows being full
close, noise attenuation is as high as 20 dB(A).
Forest belts with a width not less than 30 m cut down noise level by 5 dB(A).
As predicted, the maximum traffic noise level at sensitive points may be 25 dBIA) above
the EIA standard (in night hours at Shijicun in the late operation stage). With the measures
stated in Paragraph 6.2.3.3, noise level at sensitive points furnished with sound arresters
will be cut down by 20-30 dBMA) while that at other points or villages is reduced by 10-20
dBIA). In this way, the environmental noise level at these sensitive points or villages will
satisfy the standard rather than interrupt normal livelihood of the local residents.
6.2.3.6    Instantaneous N0, concentration at leeward of the road in the operation
stage may break the EIA standard. Save for the measures included in Table 6-4, this
problem can be dealt with by improving vehicle combustion technology to reduce NO.
discharge.
6.2.3.7    To reduce lead cumulation in the arable layesr on both sides of the road,
active efforts are required to spread use of lead-free fuel and to use as many diesel
vehicles instead of gas ones.
6.3  Environmental Management Program
6.3.1 Henan Provincial Department of Communications has already provided Henan
Provincial High-grade Highway Construction Authority (to be turned into Henan Provincial
High-grade Highway Administration) with a special environmental protection agency with
a staff of 5 persons 3 of which whom are now available, including 1 senior engineer, 1
engineer and 1 assistant engineer. This agency has begun to exercise the responsibilities
of environmental management involved in high-grade highways in Henan Province.
6.3.2 The environmental terms of reference of this agency includes:
a.   To ensure compliance with environmental protection policies, laws and regulations
of the Government, Henan Province and the Ministry of Communications, and to
work out environmental management procedures on the basis of such policies, laws
and regulations and in line with the local actuality and features of the high-grade
highways built, being built and to be built;
b.   To develop environmental work plans and to be in charge of implementation
surveillance and routine management of environmental measures exercised in
construction activities of high-grade highways;
c.   To organize and coordinate environmental research and information work for both
construction and oparation periods of high-grade highways, and to spread up-to-
date environmental protection experience and technology;

d.    To distribute environmental monitoring assignments devoted to construction and
operation periods of high-grade highways;
e.    To investigate and deal with any traffic pollution events occurring on high-grade
highways; -
f.    To properly handle longitudinal and horizontal cooperation in environmental work,
to collect and interpret environmental monitoring and research data, and to promote
internal environmental protection work.
6.3.3 Luoyang and Sanmenxia Project Offices for the construction of this road will be set
up and will be furnished with environmental protection sections (each of which is to be
staffed with 2 full-time persons) to be responsible for the routine environmental work in
the construction period of the road.
6.3.4 In the construction period, each of the proposed B lots will designate a person who
will be responsible, on a part-time basis, for surveillance and management on the regular
environmental work involved in his lot and will assist in supervising implementation of
environmental measures for his lot.
6.3.5 Upon completion of this road, Luoyang and Sanmenxia Project Offices for the road
construction will be tumed into expressway managements which will remain the existing
environmental sections and staff. Mengjin, Xinan, Yima, Mianchi and Shanxian along the
route will also set up their separate expressway management sub-agencies. Each of the
former 3 will be staffed with 1 full-time environmental manager whi!e either of latter 2 are
provided with 2 persons for such purposes. These environmental managers will handle
regular environmental management of each lot under the leadership and coordination of
the special environmental management agency included in Henan Provincial High-grade
Highway Construction Authority.
6.3.6 Environmental management networks for construction and operation periods of the
road are as illustrated in Figure 6-2 and Figure 6-3.
6.4  Environmental Monitoring Program
6.4.1 Henan Provincial High-grade Highway Construction Authority has already formed
a high-grade highway environmental monitoring center with 24 out of the establishment
of 30 persons are now available, including 2 senior engineers, 10 engineers and 12
assistant engineers. Having received professional training, all of these are competent to
work.
Equipped with some monitoring instruments and equipments as listed in Table 6-8, the
center is competent to carry out environmental monitoring activities.
This center, under the leadership of Henan Provincial Department of Communications and
Henan Provincial High-grade Highway Construction Authority, belongstothe environmental
management agency of the latter.
6.4.2 Environmental monitoring in both construction and operation periods will be focused
on air, noise and vibration though surface water is also one of the monitoring items. Since
the road has covers long distance and many monitoring points, it is impractical for the
109



Communications Environmental Monitoring Center to carry out all regular environmental
monitoring activities involved in the construction and operation periods all roads in the
province. In respect of this road, the environmental monitoring work in construction period
is proposed to be entrusted to the local environmental monitoring agencies. When the
center has completely built up its monitoring competence, it will be held responsible for
regular monitoring activities in the operation stage.
But the center will be responsible for preparation and implementation of monitoring
programs, quality assurance, study and selection of monitoring methods and monitoring
management. Also, it will summarize, count,.interpret, analyze and report monitoring data.
6.4.3 The environmental monitoring network is as shown in Figure 6-4. Figure 6-5 is the
environmental monitoring data submission process.
6.4.4 Before entrusting the local environmental monitoring agencies with environmental
monitoring work of this road, the communications departments will examine the personnel
and equipment of such agencies to confirm their monitoring competency and to ensure
smooth monitoring work. While defining mutual responsibilities and obligations, the letter
of assignment will expressly state monitoring point, item, time, frequency, method, data
reporting and any other matter as concerned.
6.4.5 Environmental monitoring programs for the construction and operation of the road
are respectively described in Table 6-9 and 6-10.
6.5  Personnel Training Program
6.5.1 According to the situation of high-grade highways (including those being and to be
built) existing in Henan Province, the environmental management agency under Henan
Provincial High-grade Highway Construction Authority and the Communications
Environmental Monitoring Center of Henan Province will be provided with 35 persons,
including 5 environmental managers and 30 monitors.
6.5.2 Out of the aforesaid 35 persons, 24 persons have already been trained and the rest
will be locally trained. Training activities in respect of environmental management mainly
relate to environmental management of communications construction projects, especially
high-grade highway projects. The environmental monitoring personnel will be trained in
respect of monitoring technology, management, data processing and quality control.
6.5.3 Full-time environmental managers of all sections (or the lots in the construction
period) and part-time personnel will be provided with concentrated training services to be
organized by Henan Provincial High-grade Highway Construction Authority such that a
solid base will be formed for environmental management of the road.
6.5.4 The Environmental Monitoring Center and the Communications Environmental
Monitoring Center of Henan Province will organize training services for all the personnel
to be engaged in the environmental monitoring in construction and operation periods of this
road such that they will be quite aware of the monitoring item, analysis method and
principle, work process and data processing.

ChaDter 7 Brief Economic Analysis
7.1         Economic Evaluation
7.1.1       Economic Cost
7.1.1.1     Transportation Cost
Highway-borne transportation cost is calculated as follows:
C=501.3328 - 12.33045 + 0.10198 S2
S.,,.., = 86.04 - N/960 (expressway)
S.xW,g= 1 56.7/N16'9 (existing road)
in which,
C =operation cost of transportation (RMB/1 000 t-km)
S = vehicle speed (km/h)
N =traffic flow (vehicle/d)
7.1.1.2     Adjustment to Construction Cost
Economic construction cost of the project is determined as shadow-price adjusted on the
basis of financial cost excluding tax, subsidy and reimbursement of price difference.
a.    Shadow price adjustment of major building n:aterials is calculated as follows:
shadow price of foreign-trade commodity= port price + freight plus trade cost;
shadow price of non-foreign-trade commodity=ex-works price + shadow freight
+ trade cost
b.    Shadow price adjustment of land: The present value of net income from farmland
areas to be covered by the road in the operation stage on the basis of total annual
yield. In the calculation, it is assumed that the unit yield of wheat increased by at
an annual growth rate of 2% and that of corn grows at 3% rate. The total shadow
cost in the whole period of land use is farmland area timed by opportunity cost of
land.
c.    Excluded breakdowns are: tax components included in building and fitting-in cost,
power-supply subsidy considered in other capital cost, escalation cost included in
the contingency and regulation cost of fixed assets.
d.   Interests and commitment charges of loans to be incurred in the construction period
are direct costs rather than reimbursements. In the economic evaluation, the annual
investment plan in the construction stage includes the due interests and
commitment charges on the basis of the actual loan availability incurred in each
year.
7.1.1.3     Calculations of Economic Cost
The total cost estimate of the proiect is 4100.8433 million RMB (including 235.945 million
RMB interests and commitment charges in construction stage). As adjusted, the economic
cost is totals 3192.3532 million RMB.
118



With a unit cost of 30000 RMB/km, the regular maintenance cost required for each is 4.05
million RMB on the average. The overhaul is arranged to take place in the 1 0th year upon
completion of the project. The unit cost for such is 200000 RMBIkm.
Residual value of the project at the end of the evaluation term, assumed to be 50% of the
economic cost, is included the total cost as negative.
7.1.2       Economic Benefit
7.1.2.1     Benefit of Road Upgrading
The total benefit of such nature is Bhj + Bkj,
Bhj = (Chw-Chy) x Qh (cargo transportation)
Bki = (Ckw-Cky) x Ok (passenger transportation)
7.1.2.2     Benefit of Shorter Milage
The total benefit of such nature is Bhd + Bkd,
Bhd =Cho x Qhd (cargo transportation)
Bkd = Cko x Qkd (passenger transportation)
7.1.2.3     Value of Saved Cargo Transportation Time
Bhs=P*Qh-l-T/(1 6 x 365)/L
7.1.2.4     Value of Save Time of Passenger in Tour
Bks=le-Qk-TI(8 x 365)1L
7.1.2.5     Benefit of Reduced Traffic Accidents
Bjsh = Pjsh-(Jw-Jy)-Mk
7.1.2.6     Beneft of Avoided Existing Traffic Congestion
Bhy = (Chw-Chyy)*Qh
Bky = (Ckw-Ckyy)eQk
7.1.2.7     Benefit of Enlarged Traffic Capacity
Such benefit is assumed to be half of the unit benefit of transferred traffic capacity.
7.1.2.8     Benefit of Transferred Railway Traffic Capacity
Such benefit is assumed to be quarter of the unit benefit of transferred traffic of the road.
Benefit calculations are as shown in Table 7-1.
119



7.1.3 Economic Evaluation
Economic evaluation is worked out on the basis of intemal return rate, net present value,
benefit/cost ratio and investment recovery term which are calculated as shown in Table
7-2.
As shown in the table, these indices at 12% discount rate are respectively as follows:
16.17% internal return rate, 1314.1651 million RMB net present value, 1.5 benefit to cost
ratio and 12-year recovery term. So the project will achieve outstanding economic benefit.
As sensibility analysis suggests, the projectsis of good risk-resistance.
7.2  Environmental Protection Cost
The total environmental cost is 128 million RMB which will be devoted to:
slope protection:                                  109.21 million RME
sound arrester provision:                            2.04 million RMB
road afforestation:                                 14.15 million RMB
archeological salvation and protection:             4.89 million mRMB
environmental monitoring instrument:                   1.5 million RMB
service-zone pollution control
(dust precipitator for boiler, wastewater treatment)  0.5 million RMB
miscellaneous
(construction worker protection, landscape construction)  0.6 million RMB
Environmer.al protection contributes 3.1 % to the total project cost estimate.
To meet the fast development pace, Henan Provincial Communications Environmental
Monitoring Center has to equipped with more instruments and equipment as listed in Table
7-3.
Environmental protection cost components should separately included in the project design
and efforts are required to make such costs readily available for use such that various
environmental measures will be implemented to minimize possible environmental impacts
to be caused by the project.

Chapter 8   Public Participation
8.1   Public Consultation
The road alignment and interchange site selection have incorporated the local government
and public opinions. And the design has considered the local interests as far as possible.
In the initial EIA process, representatives from the local environment/archaeological
agencies and EIA agencies have gathered to discuss and finalize sensitive points and
cultural relics deserving focus of the EIA. The local responsible environmental agencies
have also reached agreement on the EIA standards.
Local people's congress and political consultation commission representatives have been
interviewed in respect of the project implementation as well as environmental protection,
land use, and resettlement related to the project. What the 10 interviewed representatives
are concerning about is the project land coverage and resettlement compensation. And
they also hope that proper compensation be made in strict accordance with the provincial
compensation procedures in light of the local reality and that surveillance mechanism be
established to ensure fair and rational compensation.
As entrusted by the National Environmental Protection A.gency, the Henan Provincial
Environmental Protection Agency presided over the project EIA outline review meeting in
Zhengzhou February 21, 1995. At the meeting, 25 experts and representatives from the
local environmental agencies expressed their ideas on the environmental concerns and
highlights of the EIA. In YHJ 21 (1995) "Review on the EIA Outline Luoyang-Sanmenxia
Expressway, A Section of the National Trunk Road from Lianyungang to Huoerguosi",
Henan Provincial Environmental ProtectionAgency approved the outline while requirements
were provided.
8.2   Questionnaire Findings and Analysis
Questionnaires were distributed among the local residents and persons concerned in middle
January, 1995. For being informed of what the local people think of the construction of
the road and environmental protection related to the road, 300 questionnaires were
distributed. Out of the 280 feedback questionnaires (93.3%), 168 were contributed by
farmers, 14 (5%) by workers and 98 (35%) by others. The interviewees include 10
people's congress representatives and political consultation commissioners, see Table 8-1
for professional constitution of the interviewees. Table 8-2 includes education level of the
interviewees.

As seen from Table 8-1 and Table 8-2, 'such constitution as investigated appropriately
reflects the fact, but the education level is somewhat overestimated. Generally, the
interviewees are representative.
The results retrieved from the questionnaires indicate, most of the people (88%) knew
something about environmental protection, though the degree varies. More than half (52%)
of the interviewees expressed their dissatisfaction to the present highway communications
conditions. Absolute most (90%) of they said that the road would affect the environmental
to varying extent. Almost all of they thought the construction of the road would promote
the local economic development, while 89% of them thought the road would facilitate
livelihood improvement and 95% of them agreed to creation of the road as soon as
possible.
In respect of relocation which would relate to their own interests, 95% of them accepted
relocation and expressed their desire to be resettled elsewhere in the original villages.
Among the people who would lose all or part of the land, 97.5% of them said they would
continue to farm on farmland as readjusted while the rest 2.5% said they would like to go
to township industries.
This investigation by questionnaire method also reveals that resettlement compensation
is a common concem of the interviewees. So the project proponent should provide
intensified efforts to publicise resettlement compensation ways and standards for the
purpose of smooth relocation and resettlement.
Detailed statistics retrieved from these questionnaires are as shown in Table 8-3.
Table 8-4 is a sample questionnaire.

Chapter 9   Conclusions
9.1   With low vegetation coverage and less water availability, frequent droughts are the
main ecological restraints. There is no rare and endangered species along the roadside
since the local fauna and flora are predominated by common species.
The local land surface fluctuates to a large extent such that the land is susceptible to
water ard soil loss in most areas, with a soil erosion modulus of 1500 t/kWr. The local
lead content in soil is, on the average, 29.28 mglkg which is at the normal level. The soil
is somewhat alkaline.
9.2   As surveyed and resurveyed, there are altogether 19 archaeological sites where
salvation of cultura' relics will be completed prior to commencement of the project.
9.3   The local air environmental quality is relatively good. In the monitoring interval, the
instantaneous CO concentration is above the EIA standard in some cases. This is mainly
because: 1) there are many small coal mines which discharges gas via their shafts; 2)
many coking plants here are using out-of-date technologies which contributes large amount
of uncontrolled CO; 3) in winter days when the monitoring was conducted, incomplete
combustion of coal used by the local residents for heating purposes brings about CO.
The local environmental noise level is in very good situation, with environmental noise L,
being very low in most cases. This suggests that the project is located in a quiet area.
9.4  In the construction period, more water and soil loss will occur in limited areas as
a result of surface vegetation destruction and surface stability damage due to borrowlspoil
area operations.
In the construction stage, noise, blown dust and asphalt smoke arising from construction
activities will cause impacts on the range 200 m off the road, especially the range 100 m
away.
The project-related resettlement work is not heavy, so all land requisition, relocation and
resettlement work will be completed in the period from May 1 to September 30, 1996.
9.5   The road, when put into service, will not pose significant ecological environmental
impacts. At that time, water and soil loss situation will be put under control. When the
road is put into commission, the lead content of the cropped layer will pose cumulation
effect. As predicted, the content of such lead cumulated immediately vicinity may be 100
mg/kg be the late operation stage. However, this content is still under the limit are
recommended by the Ministry of Agriculture.
In the operation stage, the environmental noise at sensitive points 100 m off the road will
be above the standard, especially in night hours. As time passes by and traffic flow goes
up, however, traffic impacts on the sensitive points will be increasingly significant. It is
thus necessary to provide comprehensive measures to minimize such impacts.
The project area enjoys general air diffusivity. As predicted, the instantaneous NO. content
at leeward of the road may break the EIA standard, especially in day hours when there is
peak traffic flow.
128



In the operation stage, the range 100 m off the roadside will be exposed to more traffic
and vehicle exhaust impacts. In night hours, traffic noise may interfere the range 200 m
away from the road.
Upon completion, the road will promote the local socioeconomic development and will
improve the local landscape. Generally, merits are more than demerits.
9.6  Through comprehensive comparison, the south scheme is recommended herein.
With all the environmental mitigating/offsetting measures proposed herein implemented in
construction and operation stages, all the environmental impacts due to the road creation
will be offset or minimized to be acceptable.
9.7  The economic analysis results say the project will achieve significant economic
/performance and the investment recovery term is rational. The project is of good risk-
resistance.
The total environmental cost estimate amounts to 128 million RMB Environmental costs
should be separately included in the project design to ensure reliable funds for
implementing environmental measures.
9.8   As investigated, the public and all walks of life support the road construction, but
they concern about land requisition, relocation and resettlement compensations. The
project proponent should make enhanced publicizing and exploring efforts.
9.9  The project is deemed environmentally feasible with rational alignment.
