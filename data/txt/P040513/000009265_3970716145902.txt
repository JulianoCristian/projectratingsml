1.    General Description of Project
1.1   As the west part of the national trunk road from Lianyungang to Huoerguosi,
Luoyang-Sanmenxia expressway is located south of the Yellow River in Henan Province.
Covering a total length of 134.214 km, it involves Mengjin, Xinan, Yima, Mianchi and
Shanxian respectively governed by Luoyang and Sanmenxia municipalities.
1.2   Starting at the end of Luoyang-Kaifeng expressway, i.e. Dongtouzuang Village in
Mengjin, the road tends west to pass through north parts of Luoyang, Xinan, Yima,
Mianchi and south part of Sanmenxia until it reaches its end at Chengcun in Shanxian. TIe
project is situated in mountain and heavy hillyland area or loess broken country.
1.3   The road is designed to be built, against standards for highways for heavy hillyland
areas, into a two-way 4-lane expressway with calculated driving speed of 100 km/h and
roadbed width of 24.5 m. At the full length, there will he 7 interchanges, 27 overpasses,
10 super-large bridges, 31 large bridges, middle and small-sized ones, as well as culverts,
passageways and overline bridges. The whole project will be completed at one stroke
except monitoring and communication facilities which will be provided step by step. The
total cost estimate of the project is approximately 4000 million RMB.
2.    EtA Conclusion
2.1   Construction activities will cause adverse environmental impacts on such
environmental elements as vegetation, topography and landscape and will result in more
water and soil loss in limited areas.
2.2   Noise arising from construction machinery will affect residential sites in the vicinity
of the road.
2.3   Blown dust and asphalt smoke in the construction stage may bring about some
environmental impac.s.
2.4   Most of the environmental impacts to be suffered in the construction stage will
exist in limited time and will disappear upon completion of construction activities.
2.5  In the operation stage, the local ecoenvironment will be affected to some extent.
In the macro point of view, however, such impacts will be insignificant in most cases if
appropriate mitigation measures are taken. Lead will cumulate in the arable layer
immediately adjacent to the road, but the lead content will be still under the limit even up
to the base year (2020) of the late operation stage.
2.6   Traffic noise in the construction stage will interfere the villages 200 m off the road,
especially, the range and rnagnitude of such effect will be larger in night hours.
2.7  In the operation period, vehicle exhaust gas containing NO. and CO among other
pollutants will cause air environmental impacts along the road. The maximum NO.
concentration will exceed the air quality standard, especially at peak traffic flow in day
hours although such conditions will not happen frequently.
2.8   The expressway, when completed, will promote the local economic development
and will improve the local landscape.
2.9   The south scheme out of the two alternatives near Guanyintang is recommended
herein, i.e. the chief scheme considered in the design.

3     Environmental Mitigation Measures In Design Stage
3.1    Environmental mitigation measures were incorporated into the project design in
principles as listed in Table 3-1.
Table 3-1   Environmental Principles Considered in Design Stage
Description                         Environmental Principle
Route Selection    To properly align by roundabout way or other measures in line with the
topography and road network.
Social Disruption   Adequate number of interchanges, overpasses, underpasses and
through-cut overline bridges were designed.
Soil Erosion     To stabilize slope with engineering and biological measures so as to
control water/soil loss. Planting of trees and grass on median divider
and along the roadside was included in the design. As appropriate,
water sumps will be designed to lead natural slope water to natural
ditches or other drainage facilities.
Earth Works      To longitudinally allocate soil works, reduce the quantity of soil
borrow/spoil and minimize damage to topography, vegetation and
farmland.
Water Pollution    Waste water treatment facilities were designed for service zones.
Noise            Noise barriers, brick walls, double glass windows or other measures
were identified and integrated in the design.
Flooding         To provide adequate number of large, medium or small bridges and
culverts in line with the actuality, to consider adequate flood frequency
in design.
Culturai Relics  Cultural relics survey was carried out, archaeological sAlvation will be
undertaken.
Afforestation    To consider militation of exhaust gas and traffic noise mitigation by
aesthetic effect.
Landscape        Afforestation design paid due attention to aesthetic effect. Bridge
,1     design also included considerations to aesthetic effect.
3.2   The road alignment has given due consideration to the local network planning. To
regulate macro benefits, public consultation has been conducted to know what the local
governments and communities think. Also, the following principles have been taken into
account:
a.    To take Luoyang, Xinan, Yima, Mianchi and Sanmenxia among other major cities
and townships as main control points, with consideration to connection of the road
with Weinan-Lintong expressway in Shannxi Province;
b.    To arrange the road on both sides of Long-Hai railway and National Road 310 so
as to properly link the road with the existing railway and highway network:
Page-2



c.    To keep the road "not so close to enter but not so far to avoid" major cities and
townships in line with short and long-term development plans thereof such that the
road is 3-7 km off these cities and townships;
d.    To avoid important archaeological sites and villages as many as possible so as to
minimize relocation and resettlement work and to mitigate adverse impacts on
cultural relics and villages;
e.    To avoid worked-out coal mines among other geologically-improper areas in line
with coal mining plans.
3.3   Adequate attention is given to proper longitudinal allocation of soil works such that
spoil materials from excavation works are used for embankment to minimize use and
destruction of farmland due to borrow/spoil operations on farmland and to reduce
agricultural impacts and vegetation destruction.
Whenever it is difficult to longitudinally allocate soil works such soil materials required for
embankment fail to be satisfied, central soil borrow will be done at fixed positions located
at highland or wasteland on both sides of the road. But excavation depth is required to be
controlled for facilitating future re-ploughing the borrow pits. In case of section with
extremely high embankment, overline bridges will be provided to minimize use of soil. Spoil
areas are located at depressions so as not occupy any farmland. Prior to spoil soil, the
topsoil should be put aside. And spoil areas must be levelled, upon completion of the
works, and then covered with the topsoil for'the purpose of re-ploughing.
3.4   The local economy is relatively advanced. To give due consideration to the local
interests, interchanges wifl be set up at important townships in addition to major cities and
county seats. Altogether, there will be 7 interchanges spaced at an average interval of 22
km. The road will be provided with 27 overpasses, 139 passageways and 66 through-cut
overline bridges such that normal communication and farming will not be affected as a
consequence of the proposed road.
3.5   The road is to be supported by 10 super-large bridges, 31 large ones, 4 middle and
7 small-sized ones, as well as 111 culverts. The super-large bridges are designed to
withstand floods once in 300 years while the other bridges and culverts apply flood
probability of 1 %. This ensures that the existing function, flow pattern and discharge of
the rivers, ditches and canal will not be deteriorated.
3.6   Detailed resettlement implementation plans were worked out in the project design
stage. Well established organizations will be provided such that relocation and resettlement
work will be completed prior to commencement of construction activities.
3.7   Henan Archaeological Research Institute has finished resurveying and exploring
cultural relics along the road, and has developed archaeological salvation plans. Salvation
of the cultural relics will be completed prior to commencement of the project.
3.8  In design of slopes, high embankment slopes will be stabilized with grouted
scabbling, concrete grids, shotcrete and grass while deep cut slopes are protected with
grouted scabbling, concrete grids, shotcrete or sprayed grass seeds in line with the
geology, ramp height and slope. Also, water sumps will be provided, as appropriate, to
lead natural slope water to natural ditches or other drainage facilities.
Page-3



3.9   Afforestation envision is improved to include aesthetic effect of median divider,
slope and ditch as well afforestation beyond the land coverage of the road. Design of
bridges also includes aesthetic effect provided that their proper structure is guaranteed.
The design also proposes provision of manmade landscwpe at both service zones and
interchanges such that the local !andscape will be improved.
3.10 Service zones will be furnished with wastewater treatment facilities and boilers are
designed to be equipped with dust precipitators.
3.11  It is proven, by Henan Provincial Archaeological Institute, that there are altogether
1 0 underground archaeological sites distributed along the proposed road. All archaeological
salvation and protection activities will be completed after land acquisition and prior to the
project commencement.
3.1 2 For this expressway to contribute to the local landscape after its completion, the
afforestation design has considered the integrity of different plants such that the landscape
wilj differ from place to place.
Super and large-sized bridges are designed to be of T-shape configuration and different
span values to avoid simplicity and similarity. Also, guardrails are different from bridge to
bridge such that each bridge has its own unique characteristics.
4.   Environmental Protection Measures for Construction Stage
4.1   According to the quantity of works, layout of structures and administrative
jurisdiction, this expressway is proposed to be divided into 8 lots, namely,
Lot 1 kO+000-kl2+385          Mengjin-Luoyang outskirts section 12.385 km
Lot 2 kl 2 + 385 -k38 + 915   Xinan section                 26.530 km
Lot 3 k38 + 915 - k47 + 228   Mianchi section               11.756 km
Lot 4 k47 + 228 - k56 + 557   Yima section                   9.329 km
Lot 5 k60+000- k81 +795       west Mianchi section          21.795 km
Lot 6 k81 +795-k99+060        east Shanxian section         16.797 km
(k96+467.994=k96+000, chain breakage, 468 m shorter)
Lot 7 klOO+000-kl09+359   west Shanxian section             22.989 km
kl22+070-k135+700
(kl00+000=k99+060, chain breakage, 940 m shorter)
Lot 8 kl 09 + 359 - kl 22 + 070   Hubin (Sanmenxia) section  12.633 km
(kl 22 +070- kl 21 + 992.142, chain breakage, 77.8 m shorter)
All these lots almost deserve the same environmental protection measures in construction
activities as summarized in Table 4-1.
4.2  Provided the work quality is not affected, solid industrial wastes such as fly ash and
slag as included in Table 4-2 may be applied to embankment sections so as to reduce sot!
demand. Such wastes are to be used as shown in Figure 4-1.
4.3   As required by roadbed compaction, each of the 8 lots should be equipped with a
watering car which will also serve xiang-village earth paths used to construction material
hauling purposes.
Page-4



4.4   Wherever it is difficult to carry out central lime-soil mixing, decentral roadside
mixing is only allowed provided it is far from any village and construction workers engaged
in such activities are provided with necessary protection devices.
4.5   All environmental measures for the construction stage shall be incorporated into the
tender documents of each lot such that the contractors will be aware of and comply with
such measures.
4.6  In case of any road section passing through coal field, alignment, statement of
construction and land acquisition requirement shall be given to the coal mine as well its
responsible department and the local government such that the rmining plan would be
adjusted, as appropriate. This is to ensure that mining pillars will be reserved at proper
locations and that the roadbed will be stable. Also, this is to ensure that mining and road
construction activities will not interfere with each other.
5.    Environmental Protection Measures for Operation Stage
5.1   Environmental impact mitigating/offsetting measures for the operation stage are
summarized in Table 5-1, while Tables 5-2, 5-3 and 5-4 separately include "Allowable
Noise Standard for Motor Vehicles" (GB1495-79), "Emission Standard for Smoke from
Diesel Vehicle at Free Acceleration" (GB3843-83) and "Emission Standard for Pollutant
from Gasoline Vehicle at Idle Speed" (GB3842-83) related to environmental protection
measures proposed for the operation period.
5.2  For mitigating or avoiding environmental impacts due to accidental events in the
operation period, the following measures are proposed herein:
a.    Enhanced management of vehicles to ensure they are in good condition;
b.    Strengthened training services for drivers to forbid any driving in drunk and fatigue
conditions, and to forbid any forcible overtaking;
c.    Any vehicle carrying toxic, harmful, flammable, explosive and volatile among any
other dangerous things should have permissions issued by public security, fire and
communications departments;
d.   In case of windy, snowy, foggy and freezing days, vehicles should be driven at
limited speed, or sections of the road should be closed as appropriate;
e.    Dynamic management and monitoring of vehicles driving on the road should be
enhanced such that any unusual condition would be promptly reported;
f.   In case of any explosion and fire, fire departments should be promptly informed and
the relevant road section should be closed until such event is properly treated;
9.   In case of any traffic pollution event, emergency remedies should be provided as
required, and responsible environmental agencies at different levels should be
immediately informed such that corresponding measures can be taken as
appropriate;
h.    At the full length of the road, there will be furnished with 3 emergency fire brigades
equipped with ambulances and fire engines among other necessary units, and the
staff will be provided with necessary training services to be able to cope with any
abrupt event.

5.3   Rural residences generally face the south with gates and windows in south rather
than north walls. As a result, villages on the right side (north) of the road will be exposed,
in fact, to more traffic noise impacts than those on the other side. Relatively, these villages
on the right deserve better efforts to mitigate traffic noise impacts.
5.4  In accordance with predicted traffic noise levels, it is generally necessary to provide
sound arresters in case that traffic noise Lq exceeds the standard by 10 dB(A) or more so
that the local residents will not be interfered by the rcad construction. As screened,
sensitive points deserving such sound arresters are as listed in Table 5-5.
It is necessary to provide other sensitive points 200 m off the road with the following
measures:
Page-9



a.    To raise fences of the first row of residences immediately close to the road;
b.    To provide double windows for the first 3 rows of residences immediately close to
the right side of the road;
c.    To surround villages with forest belts with a width not less than 30 m.
5.5   The local residences are almost single-storeyed with a height of 4.0 m. As
calculated, 2.5 mn high sound arresters will be able to keep the sensitive points within in
acoustic shadow Such that noise attenuation will be achieved. There are lots of modes to
be used for sound arresters, some of them are as shown in Figure 5-1. The building
materials to be used to such sound arresters should be selected with consideration to the
sound absorptivity. Such materials include super-fine glass wool, mineral wool, rock wool,
cement expanded perlite board and slag expanded perlite board. Brick walls (especially
polished brick wall) are less sound absorptive. Building materials can be selected in :ght
of the cost among other factors. Generally, such sound arresters are able to reduce noise
at nearby sensitive points by 10 dB(A) or more.
Raising fences on the side immediately close to the road has less effect than sound
arresters, but about 5 dB(A) or more noise reduction is expected.
It is reported that noise reduction is only about 4 dB(A) with all doors and windows open
and the reduction is some 1 0 dB(A) with all of such close. With double windows being full
close, noise attenuation may be as high as 10-20 dB(A).
Forest belts with a width not less than 30 m may cut down noise level by about 5 dB(A).
As predicted, the maximum traffic noise level at sensitive points may be 25 dB(A) above
the EIA standard (in night hours at Shijicun in the late operation stage). With the measures
stated in Paragraph 6.2.3.3, noise level at sensitive points furnished with sound arresters
will be cut down by more than 20 dB(A) while that at other points or villages is reduced
by 10-20 dB(A). In this way, the environmental noise level at these sensitive points or
villages will satisfy the standard rather than interrupt normal livelihood of the local
residents.
5.6   Instantaneous N0O, concentration at leeward of the road in the operation stage may
exceed the EIA standard. This problem can be dealt with by improving vehicle emission
control to reduce NO, discharge, strengthening vehicle emission inspection and planting
trees at sensitive sites.
5.7   To reduce lead cumulation in the arable layer on both sides of the road, active
efforts are required to spread use of lead-free fuel.

6     Environmental Management Program
6.1   Henan Provincial Department of Communications has already provided Henan
Provincial High-grade Highway Construction Headquarters Ito be turned into Henan
Provincial High-grade Highway Administration) with a special environmental protection
agency with a staff of 5 persons 3 of whom are now available (1 senior engineer, 1
engineer and 1 assistant engineer). This agency has begun to exercise the responsibilities
of environmental management involved in high-grade highways in Henan Province. About
two staff will work for Luoyang-Sanmenxia Expressway.
6.2   The environmental terms of reference of this agency includes:
a.    To ensure compliance with environmental protection policies, laws and regulations
of the Government, the Ministry of Communications and Henan Province, to work
out environmental management procedures on the basis of such policies, laws and
regulations and in line with the local situation and features of the high-grade
highways already con'-ructed, under construction and planned.
b.    To develop environmental work plans and to be in charge of implementation
surveillance and routine management of environmental measures exercised in
construction activities of high-grade highways;
c.    To organize and coordinate environmental research and information work for both
construction and operation periods of high-grade highways, and to spread up-to-
date environmental protection experience and technology;
d.    To distribute environmental monitoring assignments devoted to construction and
operation periods of high-grade highways;
e.    To investigate and deal with any traffic pollution events occurring on high-grade
highways;
f.    To properly handle longitudinal and horizontal cooperation in environmental work,
to collect and interpret environmental monitoring and research data, and to promote
internal environmental protection work.
6.3   Luoyang and Sanmenxia Project Offices for the construction of this road will be set
up and will be furnished with environmental protection sections (each of which is to be
staffed with 2 full-time persons) to be responsible for the routine environmental work in
the construction period of the road.
6.4  In the construction period, each of the proposed 8 lots will designate one or two
persons who will be responsible, on a part-time basis, for surveillance and management
on the regular environmental work involved in his lot monitoring noise and dust and will
supervise implementation of environmental measures for his lot.
6.5   Upon completion of this road, Luoyang and Sanmenxia Project Offices for the road
construction will be turned into expressway management authority which will remain the
existing environmental sections and staff. Mengjin, Xinan, Yima, Mianchi and Shanxian
along the route will also set up their separate expressway management sub-agencies. Each
of the former 3 will be staffed with 1 full-time environmental manager while either of latter
2 are provided with 2 persons for such purposes. These environmental managers will
handle regular environmental management of each lot under the leadership and
coordination of the special environmental management agency included in Henan Provincial
High-grade Highway Management Authority.
6.6   Environmental management networks for construction and operation periods of the
road are as illustrated in Figure 6-1 and Figure 6-2.

7    Environmental Monitoring Program
7.1   Henan Provincial High-grade Highway Construction Office has already formed a
high-grade highway environmental monitoring center with 24 out of the establishment of
30 persons are now available (2 senior engineers, 10 engineers and 12 assistant
engineers). Having received professional training, all of these are competent to work.
About 1 0 persons are expected to work for Luoyang-Sanmenxia Expressway. Equipped
with some monitoring instruments and equipments, the Center is competent to carry out
environmental monitoring activities.
This center, under the leadership of Henan Provincial Department of Communications and
Henan Provincial High-grade Highway Construction Office, belongs to the environmental
management agency of the latter.
7.2   Environmental monitoring in the construction and operation stages will be devoted
to air, noise, shock and surface water. Such monitoring activities will be completed by the
Henan Provincial Communications Environmental Monitoring Center.
7.3   Environmental monitoring programs for the construction and operation of the road
are respectively described in Table 7-1 and 7-2.
8     Personnel Training Program
8.1   According to the situation of high-grade highways (including those being and to be
built) existing in Henan Province, the environmental management agency under Henan
Provincial High-grade Highway Construction Office and the Communications Environmental
Monitoring Center of Henan Province will be provided with 35 persons, including 5
environmental managers and 30 monitors.
8.2   Out of the aforesaid 35 persons, 24 persons have already been trained and the rest
will be locally trained. Training activities in respect of environmental management mainly
relate to environmental management of communications construction projects, especially
high-grade highway projects. The environmental monitoring personnel will be trained in
respect of monitoring technology, management, data processing and quality control.
8.3   Full-time environmental managers of all sections (or the lots in the construction
period) and part-time personnel will be provided with concentrated training services to be
organized by Henan Provincial High-grade Highway Construction Headquarters such that
a solid base will be formed for environmental management of the road.
8.4   The Henan Provincial Environmental Monitoring Center and the Communications
Environmental Monitoring Center of Henan Province will organize training services for all
the personnel to be engaged in the environmental monitoring in construction and operation
periods of this road such that they will be quite aware of the monitoring item, analysis
method and principle, work process and data processing.
9.    Cost Estimate
9.1   The Henan Provincial Communications Environmental Monitoring Center has to be
further equipped with instruments and equipments at the cost as listed in Table 9.1

A. Deslgn Phase
1. Route Selection    The alignment was selected from two alternatives with due consideration to minimize land  HPCRDI
acquisition, impacts of air pollution and noise on residential areas, and to avoid
unfavorable geological conditions, coal mines and archaeological sites.
2. Social Disruption   Adequate number of large, medium and small bridges and underpasses/overpasses were    HPCRDI
designed to meet the requirements for crossing of local people, animals and vehicles.
3. Soil Erosion     Planting of trees and grass on median divider, sideslopes and along the roadside was     HPCRDI
included in the design where appropriate. Slope protection, such as grouted scabbling,
concrete grids, etc., were incorporated in the design.
Temporary and permanent drainage systems were designed to minimize soil erosion and alteration HPCRDI
of hydrological regimes, including impacts on irrigation channels.
4. Earthworks       Due consideration was given to properly allocate subgrade earthworks, in view of huge quantities HPCRDI
of earthworks. Quarries and borrow sites were selected by taking into account dust and other
problems at environmentally sensitive locations such as residential areas.
5. Water Pollution    Waste water treatment facilities as well as boilers equipped with precipitators were designed for  HPCRDI
service areas.
6. Noise            Adequate measures such as noise barriers, brick walls and double windows were identified and    HPCRDI
integrated in the design and bid documents.
7. Flooding         Bridges and culverts were adequately sized to meet requirements for safe discharge of design  HPCRDI
flonds (300 years for large bridges, 1% flood probability for other bridges).
8. Culxural Relics  Cultural relics survey was carried out and an archaeological salvation plan was developed.  HPICRAIHPCRDI

9. Afforestation    Afforestation plan was developed to reduce air pollution problems and enhance better landscape   HPCRDI
10. Landscape       Aftorestation plan paid due attention to aesthetic effect of medium dividers, slopes. etc. Bridge   HPCRDI
design also included consideration to aesthetic effect.
B. Construction -hiase
1. Protection of Land Forests will not be used as borrow sites. Reforestation will be undertaken for any previous  Contractors
Resou!, es         forests used for temporary purposes upon completion of construction activities. Affcrestation
will be carried out on previous wasteland used for borrow or spoil sites upon construction compietion.
Arable land will be avoided as material borrow sites wherever possible. If excavation has to be
done in arable land, top soil layer will be saved and returned after construction work is completed,
so as to minimize impacts on ecosystem and agriculture.
Education of construction workers will be strengthened to protect natural resources, wild plants and
animals. Poachi.ig will be strictly prohibited.
2. Soil ErosioniWater Trees and grasses will be planted on side slopes and along the roadside, where appropriate.  Contractors
Pollution         Appropriate measures, either rehabilitation or afforestation, will be taken, if the existing
irrigation or drainage systems are damaged.
All necessary measures will be taken to prevent earth & stones from silting up rivers, wate!r
channels, or existing irrigation and drainage systems. Construction camps will be located far
away from Yanghe and Cinglonghe Rivers where are used as drinking water sources.
Temporary channels or conduits will be constructed for irrigation and drainage during the
construction of permanent drainage systems.
All reasonable measures shall be taken to prevent direct discharge of polluted water from construction
activities into rivers and irrigation channels.
3. Construction Camp Septic tanks will be installed at the construction camp sites. Sludge is sewage treatment pits will Contractors
be disposed of regularly.

Environmental Issue  Action Taken/To Be Taken                                                                   Responsibility Remarks
Drinking water will rmeet the China national drinking water standards.
Garbage will be collected in garbage cans at fixed locations and disposed of regularly.
4. Dust/Air Pollution  All reasonable steps, including watering, will be taken to minimize dust pollution during  Contractors
construction, particularly in places near towns.
Stockpiles and storage areas will not be located within 100 m from residential areas on the lee
side of the wind direction. Stockpiles and storage areas will be covered or watered to prevent
dust pollution. Trucks to transport construction materials will be covered to minimize spills.
Asphalt mixing and lime-soil mixing will be carried out centrally to the extent possible. Asphalt
mixing and lime-soil mixing sites will be located at least 2J0 m from residential areas on the lee
side of the wind direction. Asphalt mixers will be equipped with adequate dust collectors.
Necessary protection measures will be taken for asphalt plant operators to protect their health.
5. Transportation    i{auling route of construction materials will be selected in a careful manner to minimize  Contractors
Management        interference with existing communications, hauling distances and environmental issues
suclh as dust and noise.
Adequate actions to direct traffic will be taken in consultation witlh communications and public
security departments, to prevent or minimize traffic jams during the construction period.
6. Noise             Noisy construction work will not be undertaken duritig the night time (22:00-6:00).        Contractors
Maintenance of i,iachines and trucks will be Improved to minimize noise.
7. Cultural Relics   Excavation will be stopped immediately if any cultural relics are found, and the local cultural  Contractors/HPICRA
authority will be informed of such discovery. Excavation will not be resumed until identification
of cultural relics by the authorized institution of preservation is completed and necessary
measures identified.
8. Transportation    In order to guarantee safety, efficient lighting equipment and safety signs will be Installed on  Contractors
Safety            temporary roads during the construction , and adequate traffic regulations will be adopted and
implemented for temporary roads.
