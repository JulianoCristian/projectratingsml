Lessons drawn from the\n            project indicate that even in low income environments, with\n            weak regulatory capacity, profitable service can be provided\n            at much higher levels, as demonstrated by the project, where\n            new mobile operators have committed significant financial\n            resources to the development of a state-of-the-art\n            telecommunications infrastructure, and, by the unprecedented\n            growth of fixed lines, and mobile subscribers. However,\n            inadequate regulatory framework restricted the rapid, and\n            sustainable development of competition, encountered by major\n            issues, such as inadequate interconnection\n            agreements/directives, high level of fees, and royalties\n            levied by the Tanzania Communications Commission, and\n            absence, or non-transparency of regulatory oversight.\n            Additional capacity building is recommended, including the\n            establishment of systems, and processes to review the\n            performance of the regulatory institution. Nonetheless, due\n            to the deteriorating market conditions, the privatization\n            option - a capitalization process - was successful in that\n            it increased the interest raised by private investors, the\n            price paid for the equity stake to be sold, and sector\n            development impacts, given that proceeds were reinvested to\n            support investments. The public postal company proved\n            efficient, and profitable, for the successful performance of\n            the franchising tool, prod the development of new postal services."}, "docdt": "2001-06-05T00:00:00Z"}
