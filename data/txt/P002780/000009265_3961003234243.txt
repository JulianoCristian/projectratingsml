MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION
OF THE PRESIDENT OF TIIE INTAERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO TANZANIA
FOR A THIRD TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROJECT
1.    I submit for your approval the following memorandlun. and recommendation on a development
credit to the Government of Tanzania (GOT) for SDR 53.6 million, she equivalent of US$74.45
million, on standard IDA terms with a maturity of 40 years to help finance a project in the
telecommunications sector. This Credit would be part of a US$ 220.1 million investment programn
with a US$ 189.7 million foreign exchange component. The amount of US$ 20 million of the Credit
will be invested in TPTC as equity by GOT; US$ 53.5 million will be onlent to the Tanzanian Posts
and Telecommunications Corporation (TPTC) f'r 20 years including 5 years grace, at 8% rate of
interest, with TPTC taking the foreign exchange risk on debt. The remainder of the Credit of US$
950,000 will be used by the Ministry of Conmmunication (MOC) for restructuring of the sector. The
project would be co-financed by ADB, DANIDA, EEC, JICA, and SIDA.
2.     algklgmdqg.. In 1967, Tanzania's leadership embarked on an era of socialismn and
introduced sweeping economic and social changes. They sought a path of self determination with the
goal of making public sector activity the primary means of achieving economic development. By the
end of the 1970's, however, the economy was faltering. A turning point was reached in 1984 when
the GOT, faced with economic stagnation, introduced a new, more pragmatic economic plan. In
1986, the Government introduced a comprehensive Economic Recovery Program (ERP) followed by
an Economic and Social Action Program (ESAP) in 1989. Tanzania's main development objectives
under these programs are to achieve a 5% growth rate in per capita income; to lower the inflation
rate; to restore a sustainable balance of payments position; to rehabilitate and improve the provision
of social services; and to improve the effectiveness of external assistance. Tanzania's strategy to
fulfill these objectives is to shift from a centrally planned system to a dynamic, market-oriented
economy. Key sources of growth and profitability in this economy are expected to be a) growth in
the size and productive output of the private sector, b) competition by producers and retailers within
and across sectors, c) liberalization of producer and consumer prices, and d) improved efficiency and
profitability of the institutions that will remain in the public sector.
3.    A reasonably reliable telecommunications sector is crucial to the sustained economic recovery
of Tanzania. The main linkages between telecommunications and economic recovery are (a) the
requirements of business and government in a market economy for timely, accurate, and reliable
information; (b) telecommunications as a prime medium for transmitting information quickly, cheaply,
and easily; (c) the cost to the economy of foregone economic oppornmities due to an inadequate and
unreliable domestic and international telecommunication network; (d) the expense to the GOT of
operating a loss-making telecommunications network; and (e) the sector's importance as a major
foreign exchange earner. Reliable communication capabilities are especially important for financial,
tourism, mining, transport, service, and export-oriented business activities in Tanzania and are
becoming increasingly important in the sale and distribution of agricultural products.
4.    The existing telecommunications infrastructure in Tanzania has grossly insufficient capacity
and a very poor quality of service. In 1991, .3% of Tanzanians had telephones or 25% less than the
average percentage of the population owning telephones in Sub-Saharan Africa. In addition, only 60-



-2-
70% of the installed phones actually worked. Fault rates are 30 times higher than those in developed
countries. The fmancial position of the sector is quite weak. TPTC, the main operator, was
insolvent by 1988 due to a lack of tariff increases, substantial foreign exchange losses, and
operational inefficiencies. The financial position has improved with 300 - 500% increases in tariffs,
conversion to equity of debt owed by TPTC to GOT; and improvements in operational efficiency.
5.    The GOT is onimitted in the medium term to ensuring that reasonably priced and satisfactory
guality telecommunication services are available to satisf,r business demand in terms of quantity and
scope of services to support economic development. To achieve this the GOT will establish a market
oriented sector which allows for private sector participation, and, where feasible, competition.
6.    v e active participation of private operators in the sector, particularly in value-added services,
is a cornerstone to the success of the GOT's mission. The current legal structure does not, however,
allow for private sector operators. Nor is there a regulatory body in place with experience in market-
oriented regulation. Under the existing environment the.e is limited interest from experienced and
reputable private firms in investing or operating basic services in the sector. To encourage private
investment the GOT will take a differentiated strategy for the basic (local, long distance, and
international) and non basic (all other services) market segments. Non basic market segments, where
there is greater potential for private interest, will be opened to private investment in the near to
medium term.  investnent in basic services will be done in a gradual and systematic manner to
ensure that the correct building blocks are in place to enable successful privatization and competition.
The Government is issuing a Sector Policy statement outlining their intentions.
7.    As part of a program to increase private interest in TPTC, in the past eighteen months,
TPTC was restructured, a code of conduct established (through a Memorandum of Understanding)
signed by TPTC and GOT, a new Director General was recruited from the private sector, staff
salaries were increased and a staff incentive program was introduced. To complete the program,
GOT will 1) split postal and telecommunication activities, 2) corporatize telecommunication activities,
3) divest TPTC of non-core activities, and 4) conunercialize TPTC's operations. This process is
expected to take two years to 2 1/2 years to complete. In addition, the MOC will establish a
regulatory body, revise the telecommunications law to allow for private investment, and legalize
investmnent in TPTC. Over time, the GOT will invite bids for private sector investment in
telecommunication as well as postal activities. Competition in basic services will be introduced
gradually; particularly in unbundled services within the basic network (customer premise equipment,
laying cables, etc.).
8.    Project ObJectives. To achieve its mission in the medium term the GOT has identified three
key objectives for the sector. The first is to ensure that efficiency and financial viability drive sector
development. The second is to eliminate the existing bottlenecks in the availability of
telecommunication services to business subscribers in key areas of economic importance. The third is
to optimize the availability and effectiveness of public and private resources invested in the sector.
Three building blocks provide the base from which these objectives will be carried out: a)
establishment of a market-oriented regulatory and policy framework; requiring a regulatory body to
license private operators to provide non-basic services in Tanzania; and developing an action plan to
secure private investment in basic services in the medium term; b) commercialization and
corporatization of the state-owned monopoly provider of basic telecommunication services; and 3)



-3 -
rehabilitation and expansion of the local and long distance telecommunication network.
9.    Project i)escription. The project has three major components. These are to (a) establish a
market oriented regulatory and policy framework in part to promote private sector involvement and
competition; (b) strengthen the institutional capacity of TPaC to ensure improved operational and
financial performance and augment TPTC's implementation capacity through a performance contract
with an external consultant to implement new works; and (c) rehabilitate and expand the local and
long distance telecommunications network in Tanzania. The total project cost is $220.1 million.
TPTC will fund $30.4 million in local costs and external donors will fund $189.7 nillion in foreign
costs. The IDA credit will concentrate on policy and regulation and institutional development in
finance, management, and computers as well as funding for investment costs. The regulatory
component will inciude technical assistance to establish an appropriate regulatory structure and
policies, a study on securing private sector investment, and training of staff.
10.   The institutional development component is designed to advise and assist TPTC in: (a)
studies required to implement the institutional reforms including studies on manpower planning,
computerization strategy, and organizational structure; (b) corporate planning activities; (c) network
planning related to overall planning, optimization, and c ,ordination of the natio'ial network; (d)
operations and marketing; (e) financial planning and controls and recruitment of a fiancial controller;
(f) provision of experts in manpower and training; (g) course development at the staff college; and (h)
training fellowships. To increase TPTC's implementation capaci y, TPTC will retain a consulting
firm to be responsible for supervision of procurement, supply, and installation of new works under
the program. In addition, all equipment contracts will be implemented on a turnkey basis. All
network expansion will be evaluated and compensated on performance based. output oriented results.
11.   The investment program will relieve the worst bottlenecks in the national network as well as
in local networks in Dar-Es-Salaam and regional centers. Given the poor financial position of TPTC,
high revenue-generating subscriber areas are given preference. The equipment purchased will be used
to (i) rehabilitate existing switching, transmission and external line plant equipment including the
provision of spare parts; (ii) supply, installation, and commissioning of 91,000 lines of switching
equipment including 44,000 lines in Dar-Es-Salaam and 47,000 lines in regional centers; a
complementary external line plant for these new lines, an external line plant for exchanges requiring
additional cabling, digital microwave radio links and fiber optical systems to interconnect the above
mentioned exchanges; power and air conditioning equipment related to the above mentioned switching
and transmission equipment; (iii) provide 20,000 telephone instruments and 500 pay phones to replace
unserviceable instruments and comect new subscribers, 200 teleprinters and 500 fax machines; (iv)
provide 50 motor vehicles for planning, construction, and maintenance works; (v) construct buildings
to accommodate equipment and staff; and (vi) supply ancillary equipment, including postal equipment,
computers and software for critical financial systems. A breakdown of costs and the financing plan
are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement and of disbursement are shown in
Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing events and the status of Bank group operations in
Tanzania are given in Schedules C and D, respectively. A map is also attached.
12.   Project ImhlemenWtaton. The establishment of a regulatory body will be the responsibility of
the MOC. A key goal of the program is to build the institutional capacity of TPTC staff to manage



-4 -
their on-going activities. To ensure successful project irnplementation, line managers will be
responsible for managing technical assistance in their functional area in addition to their on-going
activities. The existing team within the Corporate Pianning department will be expanded into a
Project Management Unit (PMU). This unit composed of TPTC staff and selected consultants will
monitor the project, prepare reports for the Director General and Donors; monitor overall technical
assistance effecti;eness, and ensure compliance with donor requirements. The physical and
institutional project components will be managed by the Deputy Director General Telecoms (DDGT)
and his senior staff. Since TPTC has not planned and executed such a large project, to expand their
implementation capacity and ensure its timely completion TPTC will employ a consulting firm to be
responsible for supervision of overall preparation, coordination, evaluation of tenders, execution of
contracts, and supervision of implementation of new works. The majority of contracts will be on a
turnkey basis. An Efficiency Audit of TPTC's performance will be -repared annually and made
available for IDA's review. The audit will compare TPTC's performance with agreed performance
indicators. A Mid-Term Review will be carried out by December 31, 1995. Commitment of
contracts in the second phase of the project are subject to TPT- having sufficient implementation
capacity.
13.   Proiect Sinabilitv: The MOC will issue a statement of sector policy indicating its
intention to establish a regulatory body and to legalize and promote private investment and
competition in telecommunications to promote sector growth and expansion. A Memorandum of
Understanding signed between the MOC/GOT and TPTC in March 1992 outlines an action plan for
the commercialization of TPTC. This action plan increases management autonomy and
accountability. The plan also enables TPTC to set tariffs automatically to cover inflation and
devaluation and provides autonomy in determining staff compensation. Further, the plan provides for
the restructuring of TPTC. The agreement also establishes a performance standard including tariff
levels, requirements for the number of lines installed and lines working, billing ratios, days
receivables, staffing reductions, and project impnementation milestones that will ensure TPTC's
operational and financial soundness.
14.   Lessons Leamned from Previous World Bank and lDA Exuerle=ce. IDA, in cooperation
with other donors, has financed two previous telecommunications projects in Tanzania. While
implementation of the first project was successful overall, a number of problems were encountered in
the phvsical implementation and institutional development of TPTC during the second project. These
problems were interpreted in the light of experience gained in the supervision and project completion
work done for this project as well as IDA and World Bank telecommunication projects worldwide.
The following issues to overcome as related to TPTC were identified: Sectoral (a) unclear role
defimition in regulation, policy, and operations; and (b) a lack of private sector involvement and
competition. Financial: (c) tariff policies based on social and political rather than economic
considerations; (d) weak financial controls and audits particularly in billing and collections; (e) an
unhedged foreign exchange position leading to accrued losses by 1991 of Tanzanian Shilling 17.8
billion; Operational (f) a lack of autonomy of TPTC's board and management; (g) loosely defined
operational (and financial) objectives and perfonnance targets for TPTC mnagement and staff; (h)
operational inefficiency; (i) shortage of skilled staff and appropriate training; Project
Implementation/Precurement (j) limited leadership in TPTC to coordinate donor investments leading
to a myriad of technologies being introduced that resulted in an expensive, poorly configured network



.5-
with a low quality of operation that required highly skilled btaff to operate ;t; and (k) poor donor
coordination which resulted in exchanges being purchased for which there was no outside plant.
15.   Rationale for Worid Bank Involvement and Ie  with te Countrv Asistance
Strat. IDA has an important catalytic role. Several donors have indicated willir-ness to invest
provided that IDA takes a lead role to 1) coordinate donor funding to ensure a coherent investment
program, and 2) overseeing institutional and sectoral reforms (including privatization) and monitoring
project implementation. IDA has significant sectorJ experience, particularly in Africa, to bring to
bear when designing a project. Further, IDA involvement is based upon and will reinforce IDA's
support to the overall adjustment process in Tanzania. Specifically, as per paras. 3-5, the project
supports the country's strategic objectives to (a) gfow the size and productive output of the private
sector (through improved communication services), (b) introduce competition (in specialized
telecommunication services) and (c) improve the profitability and efficiency of public institutions
(TPTC). The project fits with the current country strategy. The country assistance strategy will be
reviewed by the Executive Directors later this fiscal year.
16.   Through advice and investments, IDA will assist the GOT in their efforts to restructure the
sector, promote private investment, commercialize TPTC and rehabilitate and expand the network.
IDA conditionality is tied to GOT and TPTC fulfillment of these efforts. Capital investments are to be
implemented in phases to ensure TPTC's implementation capacity. Commitment of contracts for the
second phase are subject to satisfactory completion of the Mid-Term Review evaluating the level of
progress on the restructuring of TPTC. IDA is actively working with the GOT to 1) coordinate donor
investments, 2) rationalize the network design, and 3) encourage donors to allow competitive bidding
for equipment and thus make prices competitive. The latter is important given the history in Tzania
of donors investing in the sector on an ad hoc basis. Approximately 80% of the program will have
some form of competitive bidding. The urgent requirements for telecommunications and the very real
potential for other donors to invest in an uncoordinated fashion are the main reasons why investments
in equipment are not being delayed until a regulatory framework is established and private sector
investment is secured.
17.   AAreements Reached at Negotiations. The GOT shall (a) establish a regulatory body and
transfer responsibility for regulation of the telecommunications sector to this body by March 31,
1994; (b) split, by no later than March 31, 1994, TPTC's post and telecommunication functions; and
(c) furnish to IDA for its review, by the date of the mid-term review, the recommendations of a study
on the scope and extent of private sector participation and submit to IDA an action plan for private
sector involvement in the telecommunications sector. In addition, the GOT will take all actions
necessary to have or cause to (a) permit private sector involvement in Basic and Non Basic
Telecommunications services; (b) issue, by December 31, 1993, at least one license for a cellular
operator; and (c) issue, by December 31, 1995, licenses to private sector operators or investors for
two other Non-Basic Telecommunications services.
18.   TPTC will (a) prepare annually, for IDA's review, an analysis of their actual performance
against mutually agreed performance indicators; (b) divest: (i) by December 31, 1993, its motor
vehicle repair, printing and building construction works; and (ii) by December 31, 1994, its customer
premise installations, and sale of customer terminal equipment and equipment repair activities; (c) by



- 6-
December 31, 1994, introduce Frofit and cost centers for its network installations, bill collections,
and staff college; (d) by March 31, 1995, install a comprehensive billing system; (e) by the date of
the mid-term review (December 31, 1995) furnish to IDA its time bound action plan to irnplemeiit the
recommendations of the MOC to insroduce private sector participation into basic telecommunication
services; (f) adjust tariffs semi-annually by March and September in each year to cover "iflation and
devaluation; and (g) maintain a debt equity ratio of 60:40. The MOC and TPTC, shall by not later
than December 31, 1995, carry out jointly with IDA and the Donors, a mid-term review of the
Project.
19.   Conditions for Credit Effectiveness will be: (a) selection of consultants for the efficiency
audit, and financial review completed; (b) execution of the Subsidiary Loan Agreement; (c)
submission of TPTC's audited financial statements for 1992; (d) se;ection and commencement of
procurement of a comprehensive billing system; (el submission to IDA of a Letter of Sector Poiicy;
and (f) TPTC will have seected a Financial Controller with qualifications and experience, and under
terms and conditions of employment satisfactory to IDA.
20.  'Conditions for Disbursement will be: (a) Payments made for expenditures under the first
phase can be made once TPTC has employed a firm with qualifications and experience satisfactory to
IDA to be responsible for the supervision of the procurement and implementation of capital
construction activities under the Project; (b) payments for expenditures under the second phase can be
made after IDA notifies TPTC that it may enter into such commitments.
21.   Environmental Issues. The proposed project is expected to have no major environmental
effects. Efficient use of telecommunications will substitute for personal transportation and
correspondingly reduce environmental pollution and promote energy conservation. An environmental
impact summary and mitigation plan have been prepared to highlight specific environmental issues
and identify a plan for addressing these issues.
22.   ProEram Objective Categories. The project seeks to build the basic infrastructure of the
country, both in urban and rural areas through the expansion of telecommunication capacity. It also
supports development of the private sector by promoting private participation in the sector and
possible private investment in TPTC.
23.   Benefits. The project will reduce a major infrastructural constraint to economic development
and adjustment in Tanzania by upgrading and expanding telecommunication services. It will
maximize resources available to the sector by improving the enabling environment for private sector
investment and will improve quality and access to services by promoting competition. hnproved
telecommunication services will provide major benefits across all sectors by improving the flow of
information and enhancing communication. It will lay a new technological base for the industrial
sector as a precondition for successful long-term development of the economy. Furthermore,
institution building and commercialization of TPTC will result in full cost recovery, improved
financial viability, more efficient operations, and improved quality of service to subscribers.



-7-
24.    W_h  The principal risk in the sector is the effect of non-collection of revenues. There are
some indications that a considerable amount of traffic both for national and international calls are not
being billed. The financial projections are based on historical revenues, which excludes all non-billed
traffic, and is therefore a conservative estimation. However, if non-collections continues to increase
over the project period, the financial viability of the project may be compromised. Calcuations
indicate that if non-collections exceed 25% of the projected revenues, the financial rate of return will
become negative. One of the main objectives of this project is to institute controls in the billing
system, and carefully calibrated project conditionality (including linkage of staff salary bonuses to
financial performance) which will ensure that non-billing and non-collections will not be an issue in
the future. The other risks that this sector in particular and all other sectors in general face in
Tanzania is that of devaluation of the currency. Since this risk is a factor of many macro economic
variables it is not possitle for the telecommunications company to control this risk. However, all
possible measures are being taken by TPTC (e.g. tying international calls to the US Dollar) to
safeguard against this constraint. In addition, the IRR and ERR is an indication that the project is
financially sound.
25.   Recsmendation. I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the Articles of
Agreement of the Association and reconmnend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
credit.

DISBURSEMENT ISSUES
1.   IDA's portfolio in Tanzania at the end of calendar year 1992 consisted of 24
projects (investment plus adjustment) for a total commitment of US$ 1.4 billion, of
which US$ 668 million was undisbursed. Of the total committed, US$ 756 million
was for 20 investment operations, for which the US$ 47.7 disbursed in FY 92
corresponded to a disbursement factor of only 9.5 (ratio of disbursements to net
commitments at the beginning of the FY). One reason for the slow disbursement of
investment projects is the relatively young age structure of the portfolio. Of the 20
investment projects, 10 were approved in FY 89 or earlier and have an undisbursed
amount of US$ 72.5 million. Since FY 90 another ten have been approved and have
an undisbursed amount of US$ 443 million. The main reason for the slow
disbursement, however, is the limited domestic capacity. This is also the main cause
of the slow disbursement of import support funds through the adjustment operations.
2.    Limited domestic capacity has been a major constraint across sectors and a
proposed Public Sector Adjustment Credit (FY 93) is intended to address issues of
civil service reform which should lead to increased efficiency of the civil service. In
addition, an agriculture sector management project to reinforce the sector's
capabilities is being prepared; and supervision of the projects in the PHR sector has
been intensified.
3.    Another issue has been a lack of counterpart funding due to severe budget
constraints. This issue will require greater prioritization of public expenditures under
the rolling expenditure framework, improved financial management capabilities (to be
developed under the recently approved Financial and Legal Management Upgrading
project (Credit 24130-TA)) and better revenue generation through tax reform, also
being supported by IDA.
4.    A Country Implementation Review (CIR) is planned for the second half of FY
93 to review the above issues and others of relevance to improved implementation of
the Tanzania portfolio.
