Ratings for the National Rural Water Supply\n            and Sanitation Project for Peru were as follows: outcomes\n            were unsatisfactory, the risk to development outcome was\n            high, the Bank performance was unsatisfactory, and the\n            Borrower performance was unsatisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned included: strong focus on project outcomes and\n            adequate accountability mechanisms are key factors to the\n            achievement of significant improvements in service\n            provision. Efforts to replicate successful experiences from\n            other contexts must carefully take into account the\n            receptivity of the implementing institutions and\n            beneficiaries. Conserving water resources through demand and\n            supply management can yield quick benefits to liberate water\n            resources for new clients. Project design needs to address\n            gaps and weaknesses in sector institutions and governance\n            identified during project preparation, failing which the\n            risk to achieving project outcomes and timely implementation\n            is much increased. The modalities of cost-sharing and\n            community participation need to be adapted to the local\n            context and supplementary resources made available as\n            needed. Community participation in planning and operations\n            underpins sustainability, but adequate training support,\n            financial incentives, and contractual arrangements are\n            necessary for continued and effective participation."}, "docdt": "2016-06-30T14:24:03Z"}
