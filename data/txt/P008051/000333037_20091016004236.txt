1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

1.      Country background. Before the 1990s, Peru had long suffered from political and
macroeconomic instability. Between 1985 and 1990, the Garcia first administration followed a
state-led development strategy containing extensive legal controls that led to misallocated
resources, fostered inefficient public enterprises, and hindered the development of social,
economic, and physical infrastructure. Utility tariffs were politically influenced with little regard
for costs. The government implemented expansionary fiscal policies, including targeted credits,
subsidies, as well as reductions in taxes and public sector prices. These policies initially induced
economic growth but eventually increased deficits, created hyperinflation, and aggravated the
misallocation of resources. By mid-1990 annual inflation peaked at nearly 36,000 percent, GDP
dropped to 1960 levels. Scarce resources were used inefficiently, and few were allocated to
public utility systems.

2.     A macroeconomic stabilization and structural reform program introduced by the
government in mid-1990 included a tight monetary policy, instituted temporary taxes, and
increased public utility rates. These structural reforms promoted competition and private
investment, including an extensive privatization program that sought to privatize all major public
holdings by mid-1995.

3.      Sectoral background. Given the country context described above, by 1991, water and
sanitation infrastructure had deteriorated so much that considerable rehabilitation was needed to
guarantee its operation. The need to focus on water resource management was also urgent,
particularly in urban centers with limited water resources, such as Lima. In 1991, national
service coverage was estimated at 58% for water and 42% for sewerage. In urban centers, the
figures were 74% for water and 62% for sewerage. In Lima, the coverage was 79% for water and
75% for sewerage at the end of 1993. These figures represented the population physically
connected to the water supply and sewerage systems ­ not service quality. According to the
Living Standards Measurement Survey conducted in 1991, 48% of Peru's population received
water for less than 12 hours each day, and 28% received less than six hours of service each day.
Sewerage was also inadequate, with most domestic, industrial, and mining waste discharged
untreated into rivers and the ocean.

4.      SEDAPAL, the water utility responsible for water and sanitation service provision in the
Lima metropolitan area, had suffered more than a decade of low tariffs, inadequate management
and spiraling costs, leading to negative net income over the 1982-92 period. In the early 1990s,
some important steps were taken, including raising the average water tariff from US$0.10 to
US$0.28 per m3 (cubic meter), and cutting the workforce from 3,769 to 1,965 employees;
however, many operational deficiencies remained to be addressed to improve the company's
efficiency and financial sustainability.

5.      On the institutional side, the government decentralized water sector operations in 1989,
when all responsibilities for water supply and sanitation service provision were transferred to
local governments. With the exception of the water utilities in Lima and Trujillo, all subsidiary

                                                 1
sector companies were decentralized. In 1992, the Ministry of the Presidency assumed
responsibility for sector developing policies, favoring viable and autonomous water companies,
and established a special privatization committee for SEDAPAL (CEPRI-SEDAPAL) to promote
private sector participation. In addition, the government established in 1994 the Superintendency
of Sanitary Services (SUNASS) to regulate the sector and to help develop efficient water
companies at the municipal level. The water and sanitation reform also included increases in the
water and sewerage tariff, the enactment of the Water and Sanitation Services Law in July 1994,
as well as the preparation of accompanying regulations, e.g., the Water Resources Law.

6.      Within this context, the government of Peru requested assistance from the Bank to
address the three areas found to be particularly critical at the project outset: (i) the severe water
rationing and frequent supply interruptions in Lima, which had an average water availability of
11.5 hours per day, (ii) lack of access to water and sewerage services in low income peri-urban
areas in Lima, which experienced rapid urban migration, and (iii) addressing SEDAPAL's
remaining operational deficiencies.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

7.      The project's objective as stated in the Staff Appraisal Report (SAR) was to improve the
efficiency of water and sanitation delivery in the Lima-Callao metropolitan area. The project's
key indicators were as follows:
     Water conservation          Increase in metering coverage (%)
                                 Decrease in average domestic consumption (l/c/d)
     Network rehabilitation      Reduction of physical water losses (%) in targeted area
     Service expansion           Increase in water and sewerage coverage (%)
     Institutional support       Increase in labor productivity (workers per `000 connection)
                                 Reduction in unaccounted for water (%)
                                 Continuity of supply (system-wide average hours per day)

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority)

8.         There were no revisions to the project development objectives.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

9.       The main project beneficiaries were the 834,000 and 788,000 people in the Lima
metropolitan area, who would respectively receive improved water supply and sewerage services.
In addition, the planned network expansion in low income peri-urban areas aimed at benefitting
poor households, through the provision of new and improved service to 578,000 low income
households in the outskirts of Lima. Finally, SEDAPAL would benefit from the project's
institutional strengthening component, which involved studies and technical assistance aimed at
assisting the company in improving its overall performance.

1.5 Original Components

10.   To achieve the objective described above, the project included the following four
components:

11.     Water conservation. This component comprised efforts to improve water billing and
metering, as well as investments to facilitate conjunctive use of surface and groundwater. The
first sub-component included the preparation of a customer cadastre, the reconstruction of
substandard water meter boxes, and the installation of new water meters covering about 56% of
SEDAPAL's water connections. The second sub-component provided primary and secondary
network pipes, reservoirs, and rehabilitation of wells, aimed at expanding the system to
accommodate the additional flow from the water treatment plant and facilitating conjunctive use
of surface and ground water.

12.     System rehabilitation. This component included the rehabilitation of the existing water
supply and sewerage networks, and water wells in selected districts through: (i) replacement or
repair of primary and secondary water network pipes, reconstruction of household connections,
rehabilitation of unused reservoirs and repair of defective ones, as well as supply of basic
maintenance equipment; (ii) rehabilitation of sewerage networks in these same districts,
replacing primary and secondary network pipes, as well as repairing household connections and
manholes; and (iii) the rehabilitation of wells with diminished yields and provision of equipment
for new wells.

13.    Service expansion. This component consisted of the expansion of the water supply and
sewerage systems to provide service to 578,000 people in low-income peri-urban areas,
including the construction of transmission lines, pumping stations, reservoirs, interceptors and
wastewater treatment plants. This was to be achieved through the improvement of existing
services to 276,000 residents and by expanding service coverage to an additional 302,000
residents.

14.     Institutional strengthening. This component consisted of the provision of technical
assistance through consulting services, training, equipment and logistical support in six areas, as
follows: (i) management; (ii) modernization of financial management; (iii) SEDAPAL's
transformation from direct service provider to contract administrator; (iv) capacity-building to
SUNASS; (v) baseline studies to support the establishment of a water basin authority for the
Rimac, Chillón and Lurín river basins; and (vi) feasibility studies for wastewater disposal and the
Chillón water treatment plant.

1.6 Revised Components

15.     Without changing the overall project objectives, some of the project's physical targets
were revised and funds reallocated at mid-term review. This was required mainly to
accommodate an increase in engineering design and works supervision costs for the
rehabilitation program from US$7.1 million to US$19.2 million (paragraph 34 below has
additional details on this issue). As a consequence, the feasibility studies for wastewater disposal
were financed by a Japanese Policy and Human Resources Development (PHRD) grant.

1.7 Other significant changes

16.    Due to legal titling issues in the low income peri-urban areas at the time of project
preparation, SEDAPAL was not permitted to work directly in these neighborhoods. Therefore,
responsibility for implementing the works in these areas was divided between SEDAPAL, which
would construct the necessary trunk mains with financing from the project, and the housing
agency, FONAVI, which would act as a financial intermediary and lend money to local residents
for them to be able to finance the construction of the connecting secondary distribution networks.
This mechanism worked effectively, extending services to 170,000 people in low income peri-
urban areas until the year 2000, when FONAVI was dissolved due to an accumulation of over
US$1 billion of bad debts.3 This meant that the project was only able to reach 82% of the
population originally targeted by the end of 2002, and left a portion of the trunk mains financed
under the project without connection to the intended beneficiaries.

17.     As a result of the financing gap due to the dissolution of FONAVI, and given the
Project's successful outcomes by 2002, a proposal for additional financing, in the amount of
US$20 million,4 to extend services to the remaining 130,000 people in low income peri-urban
areas originally targeted by the project was prepared and approved in 2003. The design of the
activities to be executed with the additional financing incorporated the implementation of the
condominial approach for water and sewerage expansion in low income areas. This innovative
approach was principally based on the Brazilian and Bolivian experiences, and has two important
features that lead to significant cost savings: (i) the cost of water and sewerage distribution
networks is lower than conventional systems, not only because of the nature of condominial
engineering designs, but also because the beneficiaries supply their own labor for the
construction of condominial branches, and (ii) the operating costs of the distribution network are
lower with the condominial approach to the extent that there is community participation in the
maintenance of the condominial branches.

18.    Another benefit of this approach is that the interaction with the beneficiaries during the
execution of works provides opportunities to impact hygiene education and to influence water
consumption habits, among other benefits. The preparation of the additional financing included
the design and implementation of a pilot condominial subproject. This pilot experience
contributed to the design and elaboration of the social and implementation guidelines used
during implementation.

19.    The US$20 million additional financing was approved during the trial phase of the
current additional financing policy. The preparation of the additional financing package
followed neither the supplemental loan nor the additional financing framework, but rather it was
considered a pilot for the additional financing policy then under preparation. This arrangement
was done in consultation and agreement with the Operational Core Services Group (OPCS), and
both loans (3811-PE linked to Project ID P008051, and 7160-PE linked to Project ID P081834)
are governed by a single loan agreement. However, these loans are not formally recognized in

3
  As a housing fund, FONAVI's portfolio extended well beyond the water and sanitation sector. The agency's
dissolution was a result of bad debts issued largely outside of the water and sanitation sector.
4
  Implementation of the works financed by the US$20 million additional financing became the responsibility of
SEDAPAL.

                                                        4
the World Bank systems as Additional Financing, as they pre-date the current OP 13.20. Given
the fact that these two loans are simply financing instruments of one project and do not represent
two separate projects, it was agreed with OPCS that one Implementation Completion Report
(ICR) would be prepared and filed under each of the Project IDs.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

20.    The project pre-dates the introduction of the quality assurance process at the Bank, hence
no official quality at entry data is available. Nonetheless, the available evidence, as explained
below, suggests that quality at entry can be rated highly satisfactory, since the project design
incorporated a number of positive and innovative features.

21.     The project's design was based on an integral vision of the problems faced by SEDAPAL,
combining mutually complementary and reinforcing interventions to increase the availability of
water supply, expand the customer base, and improve the financial sustainability and managerial
efficiency of the company. In addition, the project design was able to leverage a substantial
volume of additional resources, as it succeeded in embedding itself within a much broader
US$600 million investment program5 that counted with parallel financing from Japan and other
donors.

22.     The preparation of the project took place against the backdrop of the government's
decision to award a 30 year concession contract for SEDAPAL with a required minimum
investment program of US$3 billion. Indeed, by the date of Board approval in November 1994,
three international consortiums were already pre-qualifying to bid for the concession. However,
during the run-up to general elections in mid-1995, the government decided to postpone the final
bid submission date for the concession. Following its re-election, the government gradually lost
interest in carrying out the privatization.

23.     Due to concerns about the political risk that the concession process might not go through
as planned during a pre-election period, the project was designed in such a way as to be viable
with or without the concession,6 as long as SEDAPAL proved capable of meeting the operational
and financial targets laid down in the SAR. The loan agreement specified that if the concession
were not to go through, efforts should focus instead on improving the institutional capacity of
SEDAPAL, which included developing the terms and conditions of a new Management Contract
to be signed between SEDAPAL and the line ministry to provide a basis for monitoring



5
  This US$600 million investment program was developed with Bank's assistance during project preparation, based
on criteria that would enable the company to optimize its resources, increase revenues, reduce waste in order to
improve service quality in the shortest time. Investments of about US$300 million outside of the Bank-financed
project included acquisition of critical fixed assets, rehabilitation, systems expansion, additional water conservation
efforts as well as studies related to the optimization in the use of available water resources.
6
  This particular aspect of project design represents the incorporation of lessons learned from regional experiences in
concession or privatization of water companies that were not successful at that time, e.g., the case of the Venezuelan
water company in the state of Monagas.

                                                          5
performance, and finding alternative forms of private sector participation outside of the
concession framework.

24.     A key question that could therefore be raised about the project design is whether it was
appropriate not to condition the loan on the successful completion of the concession process, and
whether this factor contributed to the government's decision not to go through with the proposed
privatization. The project design incorporated sector lessons and experience and its design
appropriately focused on the achievement of outcomes (either through a private or public
approach). Furthermore, it is difficult to say whether conditioning of the loan would have
carried enough weight to offset the government's broader pre-electoral concerns, or whether it
would simply have led to the loss of an operation that ultimately achieved major improvements
in the provision of water supply and sanitation services in Lima, even in the absence of private
sector participation.

2.2 Implementation

25.     Shortage of loan and counterpart funds and implementation delays. Although almost all
of the intended project outputs and outcomes were achieved, it is important to recognize that the
project took much longer to implement than was originally expected. First, there was an 18
month delay at the start of project implementation, due to: (i) the approval of tariff regulations,
which delayed loan effectiveness by 6 months until August 31, 1995; and (ii) the protracted
procurement process, which took 12 months longer than expected during the first bid for civil
works. Furthermore, the parallel financing did not become effective until 1996.

26.    Second, the original closing date of June 30, 2001 was extended three times by a total of
18 months as a direct result of an IMF Agreement that imposed annual investment ceilings on all
public agencies and consequently delayed project execution during its final three years. Finally,
although the project was entirely implemented and disbursed by early 2003, another closing date
extension was granted until June 30, 2003 to allow for the submission of the additional financing
request for US$20 million under the service expansion component of the project. The additional
financing was to capitalize on the project's success to date and extend services to the remaining
130,000 residents of low income peri-urban areas originally targeted by the project.

27.    The approval of the additional financing on February 25, 2003, automatically extended
the closing date of the project until December 31, 2006. The closing date of the additional
financing loan was subsequently extended until March 31, 2009 due to difficulties encountered
by SEDAPAL to implement the additional works, which were undertaken using the condominial
approach ­ which was new to the sector in Peru.

28.     Other key factors that affected project implementation are described below. It is
important to note that many of the factors outlined below were neither exclusive to SEDAPAL
nor the project, and were experienced by other utilities in the region, which faced similar issues
as they implemented their investment programs.

29.     Lack of authorization from the municipal authorities. A legal conflict arose between the
General Law of Municipalities and the General Law of Sanitation Services. The latter
established that water utilities can carry out works in public areas without having to pay fees to

                                                6
the municipality. However, municipalities claimed that the company should pay such fees, for
the authorization and control of civil works; something that SEDAPAL was unable to do. The
subsequent negotiations over this issue created serious delays in the completion of the civil
works, but were ultimately resolved through direct discussions, signing of agreements, and the
execution of some additional works by the company to the benefit of local municipalities. In
addition, there were delays in the signing of authorization to carry out works in some areas,
because of anniversary celebrations and events held in the city, which made it difficult to meet
the construction deadlines.

30.     Dumping claim against SEDAPAL from local producer. The Project had scheduled the
procurement of 406,000 water meters; however, SEDAPAL was able to buy only 126,712 units
because a local manufacturer submitted a dumping claim against SEDAPAL at INDECOPI since
the water meters purchased through ICB were made in China. INDECOPI declared the claim
valid for the local manufacturer and applied a tax surcharge to the water meters bought from
China, which SEDAPAL had to pay. Since this additional cost could not be accommodated
within the Bank loan, SEDAPAL decided to finance the metering program with its own
resources, while the resources from the Bank loan were reallocated to buy the valves needed for
the installation of the water meters. The claim made by the local manufacturer caused a six-
month delay in the implementation of the metering program.7

31.     Problems with the functioning of the regulatory framework. The regulatory agency,
SUNASS, was relatively new at the time the project was approved,8 and, as could be expected,
experienced a number of problems that limited its efficacy during the first five years of project
implementation, in particular the following: (i) a conflict between its roles as sector promoter
and regulator of water services; (ii) a lack of autonomy in decision-making due to its close
dependence on the line Ministry; and (iii) limited institutional and technical capacity. Many of
these issues were addressed in 1995 by the General Law of Water and Sewerage Services and its
accompanying regulations, which transferred sector promotion functions to the line Ministry and
required SUNASS to report directly to the Cabinet Office rather than to the line Ministry. Of
particular concern, to SEDAPAL and the Bank project, were the delays experienced initially in
approving tariff regulations that were a condition for project effectiveness, as well as delays in
the authorization to apply tariff increases scheduled by the regulator.

32.     Lack of financial capacity from the housing finance agency FONAVI. At the time of
appraisal, SEDAPAL was legally precluded from developing infrastructure in low income
neighborhoods lacking legal property titles. In order to get around this problem, a partnership
was established with the housing agency, FONAVI. Under the terms of this agreement,
SEDAPAL undertook the extension of the trunk water mains component of the Bank project;
while, FONAVI lent money to local residents allowing them to construct the secondary networks
needed to connect the primary infrastructure. However, the accumulation of nearly US$1 billion
in bad debts made it impossible for FONAVI to continue providing financing for first-time
service to local residents. As a result, the project achieved only 66% (200,000 residents) of the


7
  This issue was also faced in Brazil during the implementation of the first National Sector Modernization Project,
particularly for the Water Company in the state of Bahia (EMBASA).
8
  SUNASS was created in 1992 and started operations in 1994.

                                                          7
original target population (300,000 beneficiaries), and SEDAPAL was left with under-utilized
capacity in the corresponding primary networks. This issue was addressed with the
implementation of the US$20 million of works under the additional financing loan.

33.      Overly optimistic Project Implementation Plan. The Project Implementation Plan was
scheduled to begin by mid-1994 and be completed by the end of 2000. In practice, the start of
project implementation was delayed by about 18 months, due to a number of unforeseen factors:
(i) it did not prove possible to contract the works under the retroactive financing mechanism in
order to avoid the delays caused by the effectiveness process; (ii) the Project Administration Unit
(PAU) was inexperienced with respect to Bank procurement guidelines and thus needed
additional time for the preparation of the bidding documents; and (iii) the Project
Implementation Plan estimated a period of 180 days for the contracting of civil works; however,
this overlooked the need to develop adequate technical documentation to support the bidding
documents, so that the completion of initial contracting processes took 300-400 days.

34.      Poor information about condition of networks scheduled for rehabilitation. The
information base available for designing the rehabilitation program during appraisal proved to be
deficient in two key aspects: (i) the studies conducted during project preparation were based on
samples of the network that did not prove to be fully representative of all of the areas identified
for civil works; and (ii) the existing databases were deficient, and ultimately had to be supported
by data from other sources (such as military maps) that also proved to be outdated. As a result,
designs often had to be adapted on the ground by the supervising engineer. For this reason, the
PAU recommended that the engineering design and the supervision of the works be executed by
the same consulting firm, leading to a significant increase in the costs allocated to the
institutional strengthening component due to a more extensive need for engineering design and
supervision of works.

35.     Difficulties in implementing the condominial approach. The execution of activities under
the additional financing faced a number of delays related to the challenges of introducing the
condominial technology in Peru. Because the concept of condominial water supply and
sanitation was new to SEDAPAL, there is a steep learning curve that demanded additional time
and effort for its successful implementation. Unlike the conventional approach, condominial
projects require a longer implementation period in order to allow for the implementation of
social workshops with beneficiaries as well as continuous follow up throughout the condominial
project cycle. In this sense, the execution of condominial works faced difficulties related to (i)
lack of legal properties deeds for some of the beneficiaries, (ii) high entry costs incurred by the
beneficiaries, (iii) diminished project credibility given the time lag between the development of
workshops and the execution of the works for project beneficiaries.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

36.     M&E design. According to the project design, implementation progress was planned to
be measured against technical, operational and financial indicators. A management unit within
the Planning Directorate of SEDAPAL was created in order to collect data and report on project
indicators. This unit monitored SEDAPAL's performance against the appraisal estimates for the
project and the institution as a whole. Furthermore, during negotiation the Bank proposed, as a
back-up arrangement to the privatization, the signing of a Management Contract Agreement

                                                8
between SEDAPAL and the corresponding line Ministry. That way the Ministry could monitor
performance indicators and progress of SEDAPAL actions and investments. This proposal was
very innovative and crucial at that time due to the fact the water regulator was not fully
operational and lacked capacity to carry out the role of supervising water companies'
performance.

37.     The project preparation documents included a well designed and accurate list of key
outcome indicators related to various operational aspects (hours of service, reduction in
unaccounted-for water, etc.), and financial efficiency (tariff adjustments to cover operational cost,
internal cash generation, etc.). In addition, indicators to monitor improvements in operational
efficiency, such as reduction in staff per thousand connections, were also included to measure
achievement of project outputs and outcomes.

38.    Robust baseline data with respect to all the operational, financial and technical indicators
were collected, estimated and projected from 1994 to 2002 during appraisal. This array of
information and statistics about SEDAPAL's performance indicators promoted good
management practices within SEDAPAL management.

39.     M&E implementation and utilization. Through SEDAPAL's Management Unit in
charge of performance indicators for the overall entity, the PAU and the Bank had were able to
monitor and assess progress of the project's outcome indicators on a regular basis. The Bank's
supervision missions always had available the information required to analyze performance and
detect issues, and were able to recommend solutions during project execution. Furthermore, as a
result of the availability of baseline data, SEDAPAL's management introduced voluntarily: (i) a
metric benchmarking of the entity against seven of the most efficient water companies in Latin
America with a declared vision of becoming one of the leading water utilities in the region; (ii) a
performance agreement with the government's asset holding company (FONAFE) so as to link
staff bonuses and incentives to the achievement of operational and efficiency targets, and (iii) a
follow up output indicators of other investment projects financed with other international banks
and with internal resources.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

40.    Safeguards. Overall the project had a positive environmental impact given that it: (i)
increased sewerage coverage from 71% in 1994 to 90% in 2008; (ii) rehabilitated the sewerage
system, which contributed to reduced groundwater pollution; and (iii) optimized surface and
groundwater flows, that reduced the process of depletion the aquifer.

41.     Project preparation with respect to environmental assessment was carried out in
accordance with the World Bank Operational Policy 4.01 Environmental Assessment and
environmental procedures of the Government and the guidelines developed by SEDAPAL. The
project classified as Category B, given that the rehabilitation works for water supply facilities
had by their nature potential environmental impacts on human population or environmental areas,
which were site-specific. During project preparation, the environmental assessment examined
the project's potential negative and positive environmental impacts and recommended measures
needed to prevent, minimize, mitigate, or compensate for adverse impacts.                During
implementation the PAU made specific assessments for each of water and sewerage works to be

                                                 9
implemented which contributed towards reducing negative environmental impacts throughout
project implementation. As a result, during project execution, there were no major
environmental issues.

42.    Financial management. Financial management of the project was carried out in
accordance with the arrangements agreed upon in the legal agreements. A formal audit for both
the Project and the entity was carried out on an annual basis, stating the adequacy of the
accounting system and internal controls, the reliability of the Statement of Expenditures (SOEs)
as a basis for credit disbursement, and compliance with covenants of the credit agreement.
While the annual audits were carried out in accordance with international auditing standards,
there were some delays in achieving the agreed upon deadlines for report submission.

43.     Procurement. At project appraisal, SEDAPAL did not have capacity for procurement of
goods, works and services and thus, the project institutional arrangements proposed to have a
Management Consulting Firm assisting SEDAPAL and the PAU staff in preparing and reviewing
final designs, preparing bidding documents and supporting the supervision of the contractors. In
general, the procurement processes were carried out in a satisfactory manner following Bank
procurement procedures with few shortcomings, such as long procurement bidding processes at
the startup of the project, and the issues encountered on the procurement of water meters as
described in paragraph 30. On balance, after the first two years of project implementation, the
performance of the procurement process improved considerably.

44.    During the implementation of the project's additional financing, undertaken using the
condominial approach, SEDAPAL experienced initial problems related to contract size and
guarantee requirements, which affected their attractiveness to the private contractors. These
issues were promptly addressed by the company and subsequent procurement proceeded without
any major issues.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

45.     Investments financed under the project and the overall program for more than US$600
million are already being adequately operated and maintained by SEDAPAL, and have
contributed to improve the company's overall financial and service delivery performance. The
ex-post assessment carried out in 2007 by the JBIC has demonstrated that the operation and
maintenance arrangements established by SEDAPAL are suitable and adequately implemented.
Given the sector investment needs, the Government recently requested World Bank financing to
further develop and strengthen sector performance and improve service provision in the Lima
metropolitan area, through further network rehabilitation and system expansion.

46.     Moreover, the Government and SEDAPAL have launched a universal access program
called "Agua para Todos" aimed to provide water and sewerage services for more than one
million people living in the low income peri-urban areas, using both the regular water
rehabilitation and the condominial approach based on lessons learned from the implementation
of the Bank's project.




                                              10
3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

47.     The project objectives focused on addressing the most critical challenges facing the water
sector in the Lima Metropolitan area at that time, which were: (i) inefficiencies in the production
and distribution of potable water; (ii) low water and sewerage services coverage; and (iii) weak
financial and operational performance of SEDAPAL. As such, relevance of the project
objectives, their design and implementation is rated high.

48.     The project objectives were responsive to the Borrower's developing priority of
improving water and sanitation services and consistent with the Bank's Country Assistance
Strategy for Peru at that time, which had the following stated objectives: alleviating poverty,
rehabilitating critically damaged infrastructure, and supporting privatization.

49.     In addition, the project objectives remain relevant as they are consistent and in line with:
(i) the government's broader objectives to accelerate growth and provide access of the poor to
public services, (ii) the current government's efforts to achieve the Millennium Development
Goals, which focuses on reducing poverty and improving access of the poor to safe water, and
(iii) two of the three pillars of the current Country Partnership Strategy, i.e., economic growth,
which emphasizes among others, the importance of increasing investments on physical
infrastructure including the water sector; and social development, which focuses on improving
the basic living conditions of the poor and includes a set of basic infrastructure interventions and
technical assistance, including water and sanitation programs.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

50.      The achievement of the project development objectives is rated satisfactory, given the
substantial improvements in SEDAPAL's overall efficiency of service provision as well as
financial performance, in spite of the fact that the privatization did not materialize. These
improvements in SEDAPAL's performance are a result of the implementation of the planned
US$600 million investment program, which included the Bank loan. Although it is difficult to
separate the Bank's financing specific contribution to these achievement of the project objectives,
it is important to note that the Bank played a key role in ensuring that an adequate institutional
and framework was in place and in keeping the focus on outcomes ­ which can be considered
critical factors in the project's success.
51.     As shown in the table below, service continuity throughout the system increased from
11.5 hours per day in 1995 to 21.5 hours per day in 2008. This was reached by raising meter
coverage from 3% in 1994 to 70% in 2008, exceeding the original target of 46% in the SAR. In
addition, during this period the average tariff per m3 increased from US$0.28 to US$0.70 at the
end of 2008. As a result, domestic demand fell by 34% to 155 liters per capita per day (l/c/d),
leading to a total saving of 5 m3/s. Part of this savings came from network rehabilitation
activities which reduced unaccounted for water by about 10%, thereby releasing about 2.5 m3/s
of water supply. SEDAPAL was able to exceed the SAR target of 41% for overall unaccounted-
for water by 2002.



                                                11
52.     The conjunctive use investments in San Miguel and Los Olivos allowed groundwater
levels to recover by two meters between 1992 and 2000, thereby expanding the availability of
groundwater and improving the security and flexibility of supply. It is important to note that the
increase in the average water availability in Lima Metropolitan Area is particularly impressive
given that water coverage increased from 75% to 91% during the project implementation period.

53.      The modernization, reforms and institutional capacity building provided by the Bank
resulted in significant improvement of the financial sustainability of SEDAPAL over the life of
the project. This improved financial capacity was generated due to the increase in the average
tariff: rising 61% in real terms from 1995 to 2008 and reaching the long-run marginal cost.
Furthermore, the company's improved financial situation made it possible to triple the annual
level of investments from 1995 to 2008, to approximately more than US$600 million, and to
finance on average 50% of these investments from internally generated cash flow.

54.     Additionally, all debt indicators remained at acceptable levels. There was also progress
in efficiency, with labor productivity improving from 2.5 employees per thousand connections in
1994 to 1.77 employees per thousand connections in 2008. However, legal changes in 2001
obliged SEDAPAL to reincorporate 600 workers from its outsourced contracts back into its
permanent staff. As a consequence, by 2002 there were 1.95 employees per thousand
connections. Thereafter, labor productivity increased, and by 2008 there were 1.77 employees
per thousand connections.

3.3 Efficiency

55.     Ex-post cost-benefit analysis is applied to the first three components of the project, using
the same methodology at appraisal. The rate of return and the net present value were calculated
by comparing the costs and benefits of piped water and sewerage services under two scenarios:
with and without the implementation of the project. The actual costs and benefits obtained with
project implementation were included in the analysis. All prices were transformed to constant
prices of 1994 to make results comparable with the analysis performed at appraisal.
                                                     12
56.     Water conservation. The expansion of meter coverage from 3.5% to 70% of total
connections over the period 1994-2008, combined with a 61% increase in the real price of water
over the same period, created powerful incentives for water conservation. As a result, residential
water consumption declined from 236 l/c/d to 155 l/c/d, a 34% reduction. Also, total residential
demand was projected to fall to 17 m3/s by 2005, a target that was reached by 2001. Furthermore,
total non-residential demand was projected to reach 5.4 m3/s by 2005, whereas it stood at 4 m3/s
as of 2001. Water consumption has declined further reaching 14.4 m3/s in 2008 for residential
customers, and 3.6 m3/s for the non-residential sector. The ex-post internal economic rate of
return (IERR) for this component was estimated at 97%, and the ex-post NPV at about US$287
million, compared with 22% and US$209 million predicted at appraisal.

57.    System rehabilitation. The rehabilitation of the network led to a 7% reduction in physical
water losses over the period 1994-2008, which is equivalent to 2.5 m3/s of increase in water
supply. This figure was higher than expected at the time of appraisal, when a 2% reduction in
physical losses and a 1.3 m3/s increase in water supply were predicted. As a result of the greater
water availability, the ex-post internal economic rate of return (IERR) obtained for this
component was estimated at 26% and the ex-post NPV at about US$46 million equivalent,
considerably higher than the projected IERR of 13% and NPV of US$9 million.

58.     Network expansion. At the time of appraisal, approximately 800,000 people were living
in low income peri-urban areas without direct water and sanitation services. They had to rely on
water supplied by tanker trucks or standpipes connected to SEDAPAL's system, and had to pay
up to 20 times per unit of water compared to households connected to the piped water system.
At the same time, many of those households living in low-income areas with service access were
receiving highly deficient services, with very few hours of service per day. As mentioned before,
with the additional financing was possible to exceed the targets expected at appraisal, despite the
collapse of FONAVI. The service expansion targets were fully achieved, reaching 102% of the
intended water beneficiaries and 136% of sewerage beneficiaries. This means that 307,000
people received first time water service as against 302,000 projected, while 148,000 people
received first time sewerage as against 108,878 projected.). As a result, the ex-post NPV for this
component was US$105 million and the internal economic rate of return was 46%. These results
were similar to the ones obtained at appraisal where an IERR of 43% and a net present value of
US$143 million were predicted.

59.    Actual returns for the whole project were US$439 million and IERR of 54%, higher than
expected returns of US$209 million and 23% of IERR.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Satisfactory

60.     The overall outcome rating is based on the combined assessment of relevance, efficiency,
achievement of the PDOs, and takes into account the unusually long implementation period (14
years) in which the achievements reached by 2002 have been sustained and improved upon. The
achievement of the project development objective is assessed overall as satisfactory given in
particular: (i) the improvement of water supply services due to rehabilitation of groundwater
resources and water conservation components, (ii) the higher quality of life of the population
living in the poor urban areas of Lima due to the network expansion component, and (iii) the

                                                13
successful implementation of the financial and institutional reforms and operational
achievements in SEDAPAL, including the execution of the US$600 million investment program.

61.    The project was able to build on the initial sector reform steps taken by the government
and put in place a new framework that enabled significant improvements in SEDAPAL's overall
operations, as evidenced by an increase in service continuity from 11.5 hours to 20.6 hours in
2002 and 21.5 hours in 2008. Over the implementation period, as a result of efficiency gains
through the implementation of the investment program and regular tariff increases, SEDAPAL
was able to, among others: (i) increase service coverage, while its conservation efforts yielded a
lower average domestic consumption per capita, from 236 l/c/d to 173 l/c/d in 2002 and 155 l/c/d
in 2008; (ii) improve its working ratio from 0.81 to 0.44, which means the company's operating
expenses have decreased in terms of share of its revenues; and (iii) reduce its accounts
receivables from 100 to 78 days by the end of 2002 and 76 days by the end of 2008. In addition,
SEDAPAL has fulfilled most of the established targets in the most recent management contract
with the Government, and is in the process of negotiating targets and real tariff increases for the
2009-2013 period when the company plans to implement an ambitious investment program of
about US$1 billion in order to further improve the quality of water and sanitation service
provision.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

62.     Addressing the water and sewerage needs of the poor people became the central pillar to
the approach and design of the network expansion component. This component focused on peri-
urban areas and aimed at benefiting low income households, not only through the improvement
of water supply and sanitation services for customers already connected to the piped water
system, but also through the expansion of the water and sewerage networks to households that
used standpipes, group taps or vendors to get potable water.

63.     It is important to mention that the target of 578,000 beneficiaries was exceeded despite
the fact that FONAVI, the institution that would lend money to finance the secondary
distribution network, was dissolved in 2000 as mentioned before. The project component
improved the quality of life of 634,029 people in low income peri-urban areas, which is reflected
in the increase on the average water service hours per day and in the higher coverage levels. In
addition, the program allowed the reduction in the cost of water to the poor, because before
network expansion works were completed, water was supplied by tanker trucks or standpipes,
which can cost up to 20 times more per unit of water compared to water supplied by the network.
The program also reduced the costs associated with the time required to obtain water from
standpipes and group taps.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

64.      Following the government's decision to abandon the concession model for SEDAPAL,
the company went through an intense process of managerial reforms designed to bring about
institutional development within the public sector. The very wide range of measures taken


                                                14
included a major reform of the company's human resource policies, as well as the adoption of
modern software for commercial, accounting, and administration processes, among others.

65.     As a result of the reforms introduced during the project implementation, considerable
improvements have been gained with regard to management of human and financial resources.
For example, labor productivity increased considerably during project implementation as well as
level of investments and internal cash flow generated. Thus, there is evidence that SEDAPAL's
performance is better than at the onset of the project. In addition, the staff of the company
improved several operational capabilities such as strategic planning, billing, commercial,
infrastructure operation and maintenance, monitoring and supervision, and customer service
aspects of its operations.

66.    Another important institutional change was the signature of Management Contracts
between SEDAPAL and the line Ministry determining annual performance targets, an innovation
introduced by the World Bank loan agreement in the absence of the concession. Annual
Management Agreements were also signed with the government's asset holding entity FONAFE,
under the Ministry of Finance, linking staff salary bonuses with the achievement of corporate
performance objectives.

67.    Furthermore, while a full concession did not prove to be politically possible, SEDAPAL
engaged in other more limited forms of private participation. These included the awarding of a
BOT contract for a water treatment plan on the Chillon River, as well as increasing the
outsourcing of many company functions, such as maintenance services, meter-reading, and
leasing of vehicles and other equipment. It is worth noting that the Bank assisted in the
preparation of the feasibility studies of the Chillon water treatment plant and advised in the BOT
bidding process through workshops and provision of expert consultants.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

68.    During the implementation of the condominial approach, workshops about the
importance of paying water bills to avoid suspension of the service had a positive impact on the
beneficiaries, since the level of late payments is estimated at around 2.4%, lower than
SEDAPAL's average. In addition, another important unexpected result of the Project was the
reduction in the interest rate that SEDAPAL charges its customers to finance the intra-houses
connections. On average, the cost of the intra-house connections for the beneficiaries of the
project was US$200, which could be paid up to 10 years. The original interest rate that
SEDAPAL charged to finance these connections was 24%, which was high considering the low
income levels of the beneficiaries. Thus, in order to provide incentives for the participation of a
higher number of potential beneficiaries, the condominial project implementation unit (PAC-
Unit) was able to implement a reduction of the interest rate to 6.3%.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

69.      Since 1995, SEDAPAL has been conducting regular annual surveys of some 3,000
customers from across the socio-economic spectrum, in order to gauge their degree of
satisfaction with the services the company provides, including: tariffs, continuity, pressure,
reliability of the billing system, reliability of the metering system, among others. The survey ­ as

                                                15
highlighted in the graph below ­ provides a helpful basis for tracking the overall impact of
SEDAPAL's institutional reforms on the quality of service received by customers. At the outset
of the project in 1995, barely a quarter of SEDAPAL's customers were satisfied with the service
received. This percentage has climbed steadily during the project period reaching about 62% in
2003, and has remained at this level since then. Indeed, in terms of overall customer satisfaction,
the last five surveys put SEDAPAL on par with the two private electricity distributors that serve
Lima, and well ahead of the privatized national telephone operator. Relative to the other utilities,
clients rate SEDAPAL the highest on openness and transparency, client orientation, investment
in service improvement, as well as fairness of tariffs.

70.     In addition, from 1996 onwards SEDAPAL has received 27 prizes for the quality of its
technical and managerial performance. In particular, it is worth highlighting the prize for
"Peruvian Company of the Year 1999" in the services category, and the prize for "Best Water
and Sewerage Management 1998" awarded by the Peruvian College of Engineers. Furthermore,
in 2002 and 2003, the company achieved ISO 9001:2000 certification for its water treatment
process and ISO 9001 Version 2002 for its project quality management system, as well as ISO
14001 for environmental quality of its main operations center. Additionally, in 2006, the
company achieved ISO 9001:2000 certification for its projects and works management system,
its management and operation of groundwater, and its integrated management system treatment
plant; as well as ISO 14001:2004 for environmental quality of its integrated management system.

71.     In order to get the impressions and lessons learned from the stakeholders on the
implementation of the condominial approach, three workshops were undertaken: (i) with the
social consultants of the North and Center Cones, (ii) with the contractors of the North and
Center Cones, and (iii) with the beneficiaries and members of the Water and Sanitation
Committee (WSC) from the North Cone. The main findings of these workshops are presented in
Annex 6, and a full report is available in the project files.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Low

72.     The risk to development outcome of the project is rated low, based on the scale and depth
of the operational and financial improvements achieved under the project, which have generated
a major transformation of the SEDAPAL's operation and management. These improvements are
expected to be sustainable in the long-term.

73.     Also, technical and operational sustainability of physical investments in water
rehabilitation and conservation made under the project are likely given SEDAPAL's improved
capacity to operate and maintain its infrastructure facilities in a sustainable manner, which has
been enhanced through the project. In addition, tariffs and collection rates have increased
considerably during project implementation, given the parallel reforms implemented through
SUNASS, which contributed to turning SEDAPAL into a financially sustainable company and
an example to be followed by the rest of municipal water companies in Peru. Nevertheless, this
assessment of risk depends on the existence of a continuous supportive political and regulatory
environment.

74.     With regard to the implementation of condominial systems, the risk to development
outcome is also rated low, given that the sustainability of the condominial networks is likely due
to the level of beneficiary empowerment, as a result of social workshops carried out during
project design and implementation. Moreover, the project promoted the organization of Water
and Sanitation Committees, as a result of the development of individual and associative
capabilities.

75.     These community organizations are the basis for the success of the monitoring of the
operation and maintenance of the network performed by SEDAPAL, and the link with the entire
community as a whole. Their main responsibilities are: (i) to promote households active
participation in the social control of the network; (ii) to promote healthy practices and the
efficient use of the system; (iii) to verify the adequate maintenance of the grease trap and the
right use of the register box and the condominial box; and (iv) to encourage the coordination
with other public and private institutions to improve the community environment. If SEDAPAL
improves the legal status and recognition together with adequate training and supervision of the
WSC, the risk to development outcome would be very low.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Highly Satisfactory

76.     During project preparation, appraisal and negotiation, several missions visited Lima,
complemented by a mission of the borrower to Washington, DC. A highly qualified multi-
disciplinary team conducted the appraisal. The following aspects of project preparation proved
to be particularly well conceived: (i) the combination of supply and demand management
measures with a service expansion component, made it possible to liberate the water resources

                                               17
needed to attend the un-served population; (ii) the integration of the Bank project within a much
broader investment program co-financed by JBIC and SEDAPAL helped to leverage the impact
of the Bank's presence; (iii) the incorporation of a Management Contract as a back-up plan
helped to create discipline for company performance in the absence of private sector
participation; (iv) the inclusion of the approval of water tariff regulations as a condition of
effectiveness helped to consolidate the on-going regulatory reforms in the sector; and (v) the
inclusion of the services of a management consulting firm to assist the PAU in processing the
large volume of investment contracts proved to be particularly effective.

77.     In addition, the project team demonstrated responsiveness in the preparation, appraisal
and approval of the additional financing in order to build on the success of project achievements,
and meet the original service expansion objectives for the low income peri-urban areas of Lima.
There was a special interest by the Bank's team regarding the promotion of different technical
alternatives to be implemented with the additional financing, and after careful evaluation, the
condominial approach was selected, as its design and costs were a good fit with the geographical
and socio-economic characteristics of the beneficiaries, i.e., mainly low-income. During the
preparation of additional financing the Bank invited international experts specialized in
condominial systems to share their experience with SEDAPAL, and also provided key
SEDAPAL staff with on-the-job-training in the design and operation of this type of condominial
sub-project.

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Satisfactory

78.     On average, the Bank conducted two full supervision missions per year. Sufficient
resources were allocated to project supervision, which allowed for the constant project
monitoring. Supervision reports highlighted key project issues and strongly focused on project
development effectiveness and monitoring of operational and financial indicators of the company
through the annual Management Contract. Problems were quickly identified and the supervision
team, working together with the Borrower, was able to identify appropriate solutions. A
distinctive feature of the project was that the Country Office in Lima played an active role in
supervising the project in general, including procurement issues, by means of a locally-based
staff with an allocation of eight staff weeks per year. This helped to speed-up the Bank's
response to project issues and provided a continuous in-country presence for the Borrower.
Furthermore, the continuity of the Bank team, with only four task managers in charge throughout
project preparation and supervision, also helped to ensure the provision of focused and consistent
support to the Borrower and to SEDAPAL.

79.     With regards to the implementation of the additional financing, the Bank carried out three
supervision missions per year, and showed deep interest in successfully achieving results on the
ground. This is evidenced by the level of analysis and recommendations made by the
supervision team, and by the active participation of specialists in condominial systems, initially
to reinforce technical knowledge within the implementing team and later to evaluate the results
of the project.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

                                                18
80.     Based on the points highlighted above, which contributed to the satisfactory overall
project outcome and to the achievement of key sector institutional reforms, the Bank's overall
performance is rated as satisfactory.

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

81.      The government showed strong commitment to the project throughout its design and
implementation stages, and by implementing critical sector reform measures such as the
enactment of a new sector legal framework and the approval of tariff increases. The Ministry of
the Presidency through the Vice-ministry of Infrastructure provided ample support to SEDAPAL
throughout project execution, and the project received backing from the highest levels of
government. Also, SEDAPAL's high level management staff received support from the
government to implement the needed institutional reforms. Although the government did not
fulfill initial expectations regarding the award of a 30 year concession contract to a private
operator, it supported the back-up arrangement, which was the signing of a management contract
with the line Ministry.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Highly Satisfactory

82.     During project preparation, with separate staff and budget, a group of local consultants
integrated in a unit within SEDAPAL enjoyed ample technical, administrative and financial
autonomy. Some of the technical and financial tasks for the preparation of the project were
undertaken by international consultant firms engaged by the project, with additional assistance
provided by consultants working for the CEPRI-SEDAPAL privatization committee. A project
director was appointed to lead the project preparation, reporting directly to the general manager
of SEDAPAL. Overall, the borrower's staff spent a significant amount of time with the Bank's
team in Lima to complete the analysis and discuss project scope, objectives, components and
implementation arrangements, demonstrating its commitment and ownership.

83.    SEDAPAL delegated project implementation to a specialized Project Administration Unit
(PAU), created in March 1995. The PAU demonstrated an excellent capacity both to implement
the project and the ambitious US$600 million investment program within which it was
embedded, and to simultaneously support an ambitious and wide ranging program of managerial
reforms designed to improve SEDAPAL's overall performance. This was largely due to the
professionalism and competency of the PAU team, as well as to their continuity of service
throughout the duration of the project.

84.   Furthermore, two aspects of the project design contributed favorably to its successful
implementation. First, a Managerial Investment Committee was created to avoid isolation of the
PAU by providing a high level interface with the rest of SEDAPAL. This committee, which was
headed by the General Manager of SEDAPAL, comprised a full quorum of the company's
managers, met frequently throughout project implementation and was responsible for approving

                                               19
all of the key procurement and implementation decisions prior to the Bank's no objection. It
played a critical role in ensuring coordination between the PAU and other areas of the company.
The continuity of staff both on the PAU and on the Managerial Investment Committee also
contributed considerably to the ease of implementation.

85.     Second, the PAU was successfully able to manage a large quantity of medium-sized and
large complex contracts with local and international contractors, thanks in part to assistance from
a management consulting firm that was contracted throughout the implementation of the project.
The project team also applied successfully the Bank guidelines for procurement procedures and
used of the Standard Contracts for Civil Works which ensured transparency, efficiency and
economy throughout project implementation. It is worth noting that the same PAU team
managed and implemented the additional financing project for the expansion program, through
the establishment of a specific unit in charge of implementation of condominial projects in low
income peri-urban areas (the PAC-Unit).

86.     There were short-comings on the implementation of the condominial investments,
particularly with regards to the delays experienced and better mainstreaming within SEDAPAL.
However, given the inherent complexities of the condominial approach, the fact that the majority
of issues were satisfactorily addressed by SEDAPAL ­ which demonstrated its commitment to
the successful implementation of these activities ­ and that condominial investments only
represented about 4% of the total investment program and 12% of the Bank loan, the
performance of SEDAPAL as an implementing agency is considered highly satisfactory. With
the benefit of hindsight, the condominial implementation unit could have been better anchored
within SEDAPAL in order to allow the better rooting of the condominial project principles
within the company's main line of business. With the dissolution of the PAC-Unit, SEDAPAL
has lost a lot of expertise on the condominial approach, as it did not fully permeated to the main
technical units within the company.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

87.    The Borrower's overall performance is rated satisfactory, based on the commitment of
SEDAPAL to improve its overall managerial performance and successful implementation of a
wide range of institutional strengthening measures, the high level support received from the
Government to the project throughout its implementation period, as well as the excellent
performance of the PAU in implementing a large and complex investment program.

6. Lessons Learned

88.     Several lessons can be obtained from the implementation of this project, which was
particularly rich in creating innovative approaches to achieve operational efficiency in a public
company; some of these are:

89.    Focus on project outcomes and adequate accountability mechanisms are key factors in
achieving the significant improvements in service provision. The project's design adequately
recognized the need for the improved service provision whether SEDAPAL was privatized or
remained publicly managed, and incorporated in its design a flexible arrangement in case the

                                                20
privatization efforts did not succeed. This back-up arrangement entailed the signing of a
management contract between SEDAPAL and the line ministry with annual performance targets
that could be achieved as a result of the implementation of the planned investment and technical
assistance activities. The incorporation of: (i) tools that would enable SEDAPAL to achieve
these targets, such as staff training at all levels, support towards updating cadastral data to
improve diagnosis of rehabilitation needs, as well as (ii) additional accountability mechanisms,
such as regular customer surveys as a way to gauge improvements and increase awareness of
service quality, as well as management agreements with the government's asset holding entity
(FONAFE), allowing for linkages between staff salary bonuses with the achievement of
corporate performance objectives, provided an additional incentive and focus of managerial
attention to the achievement of these targets.

90.     Ensure adequate regulatory framework particularly with regard to tariffs. The
transformation of SEDAPAL achieved during the project period would not have been possible
without the prior establishment of a sound regulatory framework, whose development was
actively supported as part of the preparation process for the Bank project. This is particularly
true with respect to tariffs, where the new regulatory framework ensured that SEDAPAL would
be able to charge cost-recovery tariffs based on long-term financial investment plans, as well as
to adjust these for inflation over time. The new regulatory framework also made it possible to
improve and simplify SEDAPAL's tariff structure, reducing cross-subsidies and reducing the
number of consumption blocks to three levels. Without this assured flow of tariff revenues,
SEDAPAL would not have been able to finance an investment program of this magnitude.

91.     The Bank's flexibility and responsiveness in building upon the project successes and
approving the additional financing played an important role in ensuring continued sector
engagement. Global experience demonstrates that projects that build significant and complex
infrastructure such as this one take on average almost ten years to implement successfully. The
Bank should take this into consideration when designing operations in the sector, as shorter
execution periods could impede the achievement of desired outcomes.

92.    Tailored implementation arrangements that address identified challenges, such as the
complexity of the activities to be implemented are important to ensure relatively smooth
implementation. The PAU was set up under an adequate framework. The Managerial Investment
Committee provided the interface and ensured ownership by SEDAPAL of the project activities
under implementation. In addition, the hiring of a management consulting firm to assist the PAU
during the project's implementation, worked well in terms of avoiding the creation of a large
management unit made up entirely of SEDAPAL's own staff. In addition, the management
consulting firm brought in additional expertise in the management of a project of this size and
complexity. This mechanism proved to be very effective in managing the administrative,
technical and procurement aspects of the project, as well as in knowledge transfer and improved
capacity of SEDAPAL's staff, who are now able to manage more complex projects on their own.

93.     Use resource conservation techniques to liberate water resources for new clients. The
project provides a particularly successful example of the implementation of a comprehensive and
synchronized application of demand and supply management techniques to liberate water
resources. These made it possible to simultaneously achieve improved coverage and continuity
of service in what, before the project, had been a heavily constrained resource with widespread

                                               21
application of rationing. It also provides a powerful illustration of the potential magnitude of
customer response to economic signals in the pricing of water.

94.      The role of the social promoters and Water and Sanitation Committees (WSCs) is crucial
for the success of the condominial system. The presentation of the condominial system to the
potential beneficiaries by the social promoters was very important for a successful
implementation since this system represented a new way of doing business for SEDAPAL, so
there were many doubts about its quality and costs from both the company and the beneficiaries
at the beginning of each civil work package. The involvement of the beneficiaries during the
design and implementation phases through the formation of WSCs as well as through workshops
organized by social promoters was a key feature in the development of this system, as it helped
to empower the beneficiaries and will contribute to sustain an adequate operation and
maintenance of the system in the long-term. SEDAPAL's formal legal recognition of the WSCs
once the civil works are completed and the systems are in operation would help them further
fulfil their role during the operation phase and prevent the disappearance or dismantling of this
important community structure.

Annex 2. Outputs by Component

1.      Water Conservation. In most areas, the intermediate outcomes surpassed what was
expected at appraisal. Under the demand management activities, the customer cadastre was
updated reaching 971,095 customers, 330,121 water meter boxes were rehabilitated, and 426,712
new water meters and 689,000 valves were acquired and installed. It is relevant to note that, due
to a dumping dispute that arose in the acquisition of the 406,000 water specified under the Bank
project, an agreement was reached to acquire the remaining water meters with SEDAPAL's own
internal funds, and reallocate the proceeds of the Bank loan towards the purchase of valves
required by the metering program. Under conjunctive use of surface and ground water sources in
the areas of San Miguel, Los Olivos and Callao, the works completed substantially exceeded
those originally projected (see Table 1 below) allowing 92.3 km of the distribution network to be
connected to La Atarjea treatment plant and divided in sectors as part of the central mains
sectorization program.

2.      System rehabilitation. An integrated package of works was completed in neighborhoods
selected on the basis of historically high levels of consumption and water losses (see Table 1 for
details). The physical targets were largely achieved when water and sewerage services are
considered together, although the allocation of works across services differed from the original
projections. Overall, these works benefited 795,000 people, close to the 834,000 people that had
been projected in the SAR.

3.      Network expansion. The works needed to bring bulk supply of water into the vicinity of
the low income peri-urban areas were completed by the end of 2002, with about 300,000 people
benefiting from improved service provision and the network extended to an additional 170,000
people by that date. With the collapse of FONAVI and the subsequent approval of additional
financing from the World Bank, SEDAPAL was able to further expand the network and provide
services to an additional 164,000 people.

4.      Institutional strengthening. SEDAPAL took a very wide range of measures aimed at
modernizing and improving the management of the company. The scope of these went far
beyond what was originally anticipated at appraisal, due partly to the reallocation of technical
assistance resources towards SEDAPAL at mid-term review, but also to the fact that the
company chose to finance additional measures with its own resources, many of which reflected
technical assistance and advice received during the course of the project. The main highlights of
the overall program are listed below, while the specific studies financed from the technical
assistance component of the loan are identified in Table 2 at the end of this Annex.

   Preparation of a Master and a Financial Plan up to the year 2030, a Strategic Plan for the
   period 1996-2020, and an Institutional Strategic Plan for the period 2002-06, as well as
   annual Operational Plans with specific goals, outcomes and products.
   Major reforms to the companies human resource policy, including simplification and
   flattening of the pyramid structure, adjustment of pay scales to make them more competitive,
   and extensive training of staff at all levels following the "Productivity with Quality" model.
   Increased reliance on private sector participation through outsourcing of commercial
   operational and maintenance activities, and the awarding of a 27 year BOT contract for
   `Optimum Development of Surface and Ground Water on the Chillon River' to provide an
   additional 2.5 m3/s of supply to the northern cone of the city.
   Improved framework of accountability via annual signature of Management Contracts
   between SEDAPAL and the corresponding line Ministry, and Performance Agreements with
   the holding entity FONAFE, so as to link staff pay to the achievement of operational and
   efficiency targets.
   Introduction of a Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system enabling
   centralized tele-control of 200 points throughout the distribution network
   Introduction of modern management systems, such as Activity Based Costing, SAP R3,
   OPEN SGC, OPEN SGI, and SICAT to be used respectively in administrative and
   commercial activities, as well as in cadastral registry and management of the water
   distribution system.
   Upgrading of client support services and infrastructure, including the installation of the
   "Aquafone" Call Center, and the launching of a successful water conservation campaign and
   household leak detection program.
   Voluntary introduction of metric benchmarking in SEDAPAL against seven of the most
   efficient water companies in Latin America with a declared vision of becoming one the
   leading water utilities in the region.
   Financing the contracting of a management consulting firm to assist the PAU with the
   implementation of the complex and large-scale investments required by the project.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis


1.      The cost-benefit analysis was carried out using the same methodology used at appraisal.
The rate of return and the net present value were calculated by comparing the costs and benefits
of piped water and sewerage services for two scenarios: one with the implementation of the
project, and the other assuming the project had never been implemented. The actual costs and
benefits obtained with project implementation were included in the analysis. All prices were
transformed to constant prices of 1994 to make results comparable with the analysis done at
appraisal.

2.     The benefits expected with the project were: (i) water conservation through demand and
supply management; (ii) expansion of water supply and sewerage services to new customers
located mainly in low income peri-urban areas; and (iii) SEDAPAL's efficiency improvement.
These benefits were evaluated as follows:

Water conservation through demand and supply management

3.     At the time of appraisal, there was no incentive for efficient use of water. There were
problems such as: (a) intermittence of water supply; (b) inadequate tariff structure, which did not
follow cost of service provision or consumption patterns; and (c) billing was based mainly on
estimated consumption rather than actual consumption.

4.      According to SAR, water supply was short in about 36% of demand, the number of hours
of service delivery was less than 10 per day. The way customers coped with unreliable supply
was either by constructing reservoirs, or buying water from water trucks. At the same time, the
rate structure and the billing procedures were based on a flat rate rather than a volumetric tariff
and actual consumption; only 3% of customers had meters. There was no relationship between
price and consumption, and therefore no incentive for efficient water use. The water
conservation component was one of the major goals of the project, and it was targeted through
demand and supply management programs as follows:

5.      Demand Management Program pursued incentives to rationalize water consumption. It
was implemented through installation of meters, change in tariffs, and modification of billing
practice, going from minimum consumption to actual consumption. The installation of meters
made it possible to increase the connections billed with actual consumption from 3% in 1994 to
70% in 2008. Average tariff increased 61% in real terms from 1994 to 2008, and reached the
marginal cost by 2008; in addition, the tariff structure was simplified (Table A). The practice of
charging customers with the minimum consumption per district was eliminated, making the
billing process fairer to customers.

6.      As expected, these measures were an important incentive for water-use efficiency, with
actual results better than expected. It was predicted that consumption of residential customers
would decline from 236 liters per capita per day (l/p/d) in 1994 to 188 l/p/d in 2005. Also, it was
foreseen that total domestic demand would be 17 m3/s by 2005, and non-domestic water
consumption would be 5.4 m3/s in 2005. In reality, domestic consumption decreased from 236
l/p/d in 1994 to 155 l/p/d in 2008, a 34% reduction. Residential demand of 17 m3/s was actually
achieved in 2001, four years before expected; non-residential demand was 4 m3/s in 2001, for a
total demand of 21 m3/s in 2001, lower than the expected demand for 2005. In 2008 the
residential demand was even lower, 14.4 m3/s and non-residential demand 3.6 m3/s for a total of
18 m3/s. The decrease in demand occurred even though coverage was higher than predicted (90%
compared with 88%).

7.     Supply Management Program. The decline in consumption came along with better supply
management, through programs of reduction of unaccounted for water, and conjunctive use of
water resources. The first one was done with rehabilitation of the network, achieving a reduction
of about 7% in physical losses from 1994 to 2008, This improvement increased the availability
of water in about 2.5 m3/sec; this achievement was higher than expected at appraisal, when 2%
reduction in physical losses, and 1.3 m3/s increase in water supply was predicted. The internal
rate of return obtained with this component was 26% and benefits of US$46 million. At
appraisal it was projected an internal rate of return of 13% and a net present value of US$9
million.

8.      The second program, the conjunctive use of water resources, improved control of surface
and groundwater flows. In 1994 high water production levels depleted the aquifer because
production levels exceeded natural recharge flows worsening with saline contamination in some
areas.     The conjunctive use of water component consisted of using jointly surface and
groundwater resources taking advantage of the availability of surface water during the rainy
season while allowing the wells to rest and hence recharge the aquifer during this period. The
areas selected for this component, which were primarily served by groundwater, were connected
to the distribution system of the La Atarjea treatment plant, and served alternatively by surface
water and groundwater. The results show that, with the conjunctive use, 123 wells were resting


                                                                30
with savings of 3 m3/s, and groundwater levels increased by 10 meters in San Miguel and 15
meters in Los Olivos.10

with expected results at appraisal is shown in the following table.

10.     Other benefits dealing with the water conservation component were reflected in the
reduction of operating and maintenance costs. The main savings were found in energy costs, due
to a reduction of the volume of water pumped from underground, increasing groundwater levels.

Expansion of water supply and sewerage services to new customers located mainly in the low
income peri-urban areas

11.     At the time of appraisal about 800,000 people were living in the low-income peri-ubran
areas without direct water and sanitation services. They had to rely on water supplied by tanker
trucks or standpipes connected to SEDAPAL's system, and had to pay up to 20 times more per
unit of water than households connected to the piped water system.

12.    According to the SAR, the number of projected beneficiaries in water was going to be
578,000 people; 302,000 of those with network expansion, and 276,000 with system
improvement. With the implementation of the water works the actual beneficiaries were 634,000;
of those 307,000 with network expansion and 327,000 with system improvement. In the
sewerage service the expected number of beneficiaries was 204,000; 95,000 of those with
network improvement, and 109,000 with expansion. With the implementation of the sewerage

Environmental benefits

15.      In addition to the benefits described above, the project had environmental benefits, such
as: (i) increase in sewerage coverage from 71% in 1994 to 90% in 2008; (ii) rehabilitation of the
sewerage system, which reduced groundwater pollution; and (iii) the optimization of surface and
groundwater flows, cut the process of depletion the aquifer.

Annex 6. Stakeholder Workshops Summary of Outcome

1.      In order to get the impressions and lessons learned from the stakeholders on the
implementation of the condominial approach, three workshops were undertaken: (i) with the
social consultants of the North and Center Cones, (ii) with the contractors of the North and
Center Cones, and (iii) with the beneficiaries and members of the Water and Sanitation
Committee (WSC) from the North Cone. A full report detailing the discussions and
recommendations of these workshops is available in the project files.

2.      The participants in the workshops highlighted the importance of the promotion phase,
since at this stage the beneficiaries sought clarification and answer to questions they may have
on the condominial system, got involved with the project, and consequently, collaborated
throughout the entire project cycle. In addition, the beneficiaries as well as the consultants
expressed the great value of the "Methodological Guidelines for Social and Technical
Intervention in Condominial Projects"; however, they recommended that it would be useful to
improve these guidelines with the experience gained during project cycle, including aspects
related to procurement, social, and monitoring.

3.      The contractors considered that civil works for condominial systems were more complex
than for conventional systems, not only because the system was new (the first experience in
Peru), but also because of the difficult and complex topographical conditions where civil works
were executed. Also, they considered the role of social promoters very important, since the
nature of the civil works required more interaction and participation of the beneficiaries.

4.      The project's final beneficiaries had a highly favorable opinion of the role of the social
promoters. They also considered that the project improved their quality of life by reducing not
only the costs of potable water, but also diseases related to lack of adequate access of water and
sanitation services. Also, the beneficiaries have now a very high opinion about condominial
systems.

5.     Finally, the role of the WSC was to help contractors and consultants in the promotion and
implementation phases of the condominial system. After civil works were concluded, these
WSC considered they could have an active role in the operation and maintenance of the network
as planned; however, they needed official recognition or special legal status from SEDAPAL.

Annex 7. Summary of Borrower's ICR

1. Evaluation of the objectives

The initial objectives of the Project were: (i) the improvement in water supply and sanitation
services (WSS) efficiency in the Lima Metropolitan area to promote water conservation; (ii) the
rehabilitation of damaged water supply and sanitation systems in the Lima metropolitan area;
and (iii) the expansion of WSS to the low-income population in the Lima metropolitan area.

To achieve these objectives, the Project was structured into the following components: (a)
rehabilitation of existing water and drainage infrastructure; (b) water conservation; (c) expansion
of the water supply and drainage coverage for low income areas (slums); and (d) technical
assistance for institutional strengthening. Additional Financing was approved by the Bank in
February 2003 to expand component (c).

1.1 Investment Components and Works

The rehabilitation component had three subcomponents: (i) rehabilitation of water networks in
12 districts, including replacing or repairing 42 kilometers of primary pipelines and 622
kilometers of secondary pipelines, building connections to 117,000 homes, rehabilitating 129
unused reservoirs, repairing 156 reservoirs with defects and providing basic equipment for
maintenance; (ii) rehabilitation of the sewerage systems in the same districts by replacing 77
kilometers of concrete pipes and 616 kilometers of secondary lines and repairing 123,000
household connections and 12,300 wells; and (iii) rehabilitation of 39 wells serving low income
populations and provide equipment for 85 new wells.

The water conservation component had two subcomponents: (i) a program to reduce
unaccounted for water, including the preparation of a customer register, the reconstruction of
obsolete water boxes and the installation of 406,000 new water meters for 56 percent of the
customers of SEDAPAL; (ii) the combined use of surface and groundwater in three areas of
Lima where groundwater is depleted and where salt contamination was a threat, through the
construction of secondary network pipes and nine reservoirs, rehabilitation of wells and
strengthening of 35 kilometers of primary pipes to accommodate the additional flow from the
wastewater treatment plant.

The network expansion component would involve water supply and sanitation works to serve
578,000 low-income people living in slums, including transmission lines, pumping stations,
reservoirs, treatment plants, interceptors and wastewater treatment plants. Engineering designs
for these works did not involve complex technical solutions. Cost estimates were based on
recently executed projects of similar complexity. Participatory processes involving the potential
beneficiaries would establish the priorities.

The Additional Financing aimed to provide WSS to 130,000 people and to add secondary
networks to the original works in order to achieve the service expansion targets.



                                                37
1.2. Achievement of objectives

Given its overall successful implementation, the Rehabilitation of the Water Supply and
Sanitation System is considered highly satisfactory as it achieved all of the expected objectives.

Regarding the objective related to the improvement of WSS efficiency in the Lima Metropolitan
area to promote water conservation, the Staff Appraisal Report (SAR) anticipated that metering
systems and system rehabilitation would result in an average per capita reduction in
consumption. In 1994, when a total population of 7,854,616 was served by WSS, the total
demand per capita was estimated at 361 l/c/d. In 2007, the total demand per capita was reduced
to 260 l/c/d. Moreover, service continuity increased from 11.5 hours per day to 21.12 hours per
day over the same time period, which exceeded the original target. Furthermore, upon
completion of the investments related to the combined use of surface and groundwater in the
districts of Los Olivos, San Miguel and Callao, the exploitation of groundwater was reduced
from 8.6 m³/s to 5.25 m³/s. This has allowed the aquifer to recover and reduced the rate of
groundwater decline. The coverage level of WSS services increased from 79 percent in 1993 to
90.7 percent in 2007. Achievement of this objective and its performance indicators was rated
highly satisfactory.

Regarding the objective related to the rehabilitation of damaged WSS systems in Metropolitan
Lima area, civil works in the districts of Brena, Barranco, Chorrillos, Pueblo Libre and Lima
Cercado have benefited a total of 795,001 people, a figure very close to the estimated 834,000
and 788,000 beneficiaries for potable water and sanitation, respectively.

Under the water network, 302.1 kilometers, of the targeted 620 kilometers, were rehabilitated.
Under the sewerage network, 336 kilometers, of the targeted 615 kilometers, were rehabilitated.
Nevertheless, it is worth mentioning that works executed with Bank financing met or exceeded
the targets of 306.3 kilometers and 198.9 kilometers, respectively. Under in-house connections,
50.2 percent of the targeted 118 connections were rehabilitated.

Out of a targeted number of 36 wells, a total of 24 were rehabilitated, and out of a targeted
number of 85 new wells, a total of 89 were provided with equipment. In addition, 30 neighboring
wells were also equipped, a result not foreseen in the SAR.

Distribution and secondary collection in the older areas were replaced or upgraded. Works
financed by the Bank were concluded in the following districts: Brena, Los Olivos, Lima
Cercado, Pueblo Libre, San Miguel, Barranco, Chorrillos, San Juan de Lurigancho, Surco,
Surquillo, San Borja, El Augustino, San Luis, Magdalena del Mar, San Juan de Miraflores, Villa
María del Triunfo, Villa El Salvador and San Martin de Porres. In total, for secondary networks,
approximately 80 kilometers of water pipes were substituted and 160 kilometers of pipes were
rehabilitated. In addition, 120 kilometers of collectors were substituted and 150 kilometers were
cleaned. In summary, this objective is also rated as highly satisfactory.

Regarding the objective related to the expansion of WSS in low-income areas in the Lima
Metropolitan area, it was estimated that actions aimed at reducing water demand and investing
in service expansion in poor areas would benefit a total of 600,000 people, of which 276,000

                                               38
would directly benefit from improved WSS service. Works to improve water supply were
completed in 2007 and benefited 527,107 people, of which 326,949 received service
improvements while 200,158 received service for the first time. Works to improve sanitation
service benefited 384,391 people and works to expand service benefited 50,022 people. While
these figures directly correspond to the actual population living in districts where investments
were made, a larger population than originally envisaged in the SAR already had a certain level
of service. It is also important to note that the WSS works will continue to serve new
beneficiaries through secondary works that SEDAPAL is in the process of implementing with
additional financing from the World Bank and other multilateral banks such as the Inter-
American Development Bank (IADB).

The service expansion financed under the Additional Financing Loan is successfully under
implementation, with only the package's southern cone still to be completed (bidding already
finalized).

2. Privatization Process

The Peruvian government included SEDAPAL in the list of companies to be privatized, and they
appointed a privatization committee (CEPRI-SEDAPAL) to lead to the process for the
prequalification of three international companies. Following a change in membership, CEPRI
decided to postpone the privatization of the company until 2000 based on the political context.

The Project was designed within a privatization process framework. The Loan Agreement
established SEDAPAL as the Project's implementing agency and, under the privatization
process, through a 30-year concession, loan proceeds were to be transferred to the
concessionaire.

The suspension of the privatization process was advantageous for the company, as it availed
itself of the facilities offered by the laws in matters of finance and administrative management.
For example, regarding its status as a public company, SEDAPAL could not be seized but it
could transfer long-term debt. Such advantages have improved administrative and operational
management, facilitated staff dismissal or suspension and assisted in corporate restructuring
through outsourcing. The concession never materialized and the loan continued to be
implemented by SEDAPAL.

3. Physical Targets

All of the planned investments, including the ones to improve the water supply system of the city
of Lima, have been implemented. Achievement of some of the physical targets varied in relation
to the estimates laid out in the SAR. The result of the detailed assessment of the WSS systems
and the conditions actually encountered during implementation account for these difference.

To ensure their sustainability, all of the works were incorporated into SEDAPAL's operation and
maintenance. The Project supported the purchase of equipment for well and primary network
maintenance, as well as tankers to transport water to places where there was no supply and works
were not under implementation. The sustainability of investments made under the World Bank

                                               39
and JBIC program is assured and JBIC assessment studies show that SEDAPAL has a proper
operational and infrastructure maintenance system.

The portion of works financed under the Additional Financing Loan was successfully
implemented. More than 100,000 people were connected to the services, and there are 30,000
more that will be served once the works in the southern cone are completed.

4. Factors affecting implementation

Original Loan

Insufficient knowledge of Bank procurement rules. With 1994 as the starting point, the SAR
estimated that Project implementation would take seven years. However, SEDAPAL's relative
inexperience in following Bank procurement rules meant that Bank approval of the first bidding
documents took longer than expected. While the SAR estimated that the procurement process for
works would last six months, the request for expressions of interest took up to 400 days and the
bidding up to 300 days. Efforts on the part of the UAP reduced these delays to 150 days for both
processes by the end of the Project.

Availability of loan proceeds. Given the fiscal and financial situation of the country, the Ministry
of Economy set ceilings on investment levels, which resulted in restrictions on loan
disbursements from the third quarter of 1999 through the end of 2002.

Authorizations of municipal authorities. There was a conflict within the national legislation
between the Municipalities Act and the General Law of Sanitation Services. This was resolved
through direct negotiation with municipalities.

Adverse impacts during rehabilitation works. The concentration of rehabilitation works in
narrow streets not designed for modern traffic patterns generated some negative reactions from
neighbors and passersby.

Differences between foreseen and actual system conditions. During implementation, significant
differences were encountered between the initial studies (based on samples) and reality. Another
problem was that many buildings had built fences around their properties to protect themselves,
but these fences invaded public land and incorporated WSS systems behind them.

Additional Financing Loan

Delays in the Loan Agreement's signature. Project Appraisal and Negotiations were undertaken
between 2002 and 2003. Negotiations took place in January 2003 and Board approval was in
February of the same year. The Loan Agreement was not signed until March 12, 2004, with
effectiveness on March 23, 2004. This negatively impacted implementation according to the
Timetable of the SAR and Loan Agreements, which established December 31, 2006 as the
closing date.




                                                40
Lack of local experience with new technologies. With the incorporation of new activities
normally developed by consultants, it was necessary to develop the Methodological Guide for
Technical and Social Intervention in the Development and Implementation of Condominial WSS
Projects (November 2005). The duration of the first bidding processes for the contracting of
consultants also took longer than expected because of the relative inexperience with the
condominial works. Also, contractors' knowledge of this type of technology was very limited,
which slowed down the development of these component.

Overlapping of functions within SEDAPAL. Given the overlapping responsibilities between the
PAC intervention areas with other projects (PROMESAL, Team Projects), the lists of
beneficiaries in northern and central cones had to be restructured. In some cases, this overlap
also caused delays as some activities were conditioned by the completion of works undertaken
by other areas of the company.

Delays in the issuing of profile feasibilities (viabilidad). Changes in the process of declaring
viabilidad, which included the suspension and subsequent return of powers to SEDAPAL to
declare profile feasibility generated delays of five months.

Inflexibility in Bank norms in the selection processes for works, which did not allow for
modifications in the minimum contractual amounts for bidders. This drove away many small
businesses that could not participate in bidding.

Others. Excessive informality in the subcontracting of works, which led to many administrative
and technical setbacks. Delays in the issuing of the Bank's No Objection to bidding documents.
Some bidding processes did not yield any offers.

5. Institutional Strengthening

Component D (Technical Assistance for Institutional Development) included the equivalent of
1,500 months of staff time for consultancy, training, equipment and logistical support within six
subcomponents: (i) management assistance; (ii) financial management modernization; (iii)
assistance in the transformation of SEDAPAL from a direct provider of WSS service to a
contract administrator; (iv) capacity building for SUNASS; (v) baseline studies to support the
authority responsible for water resources; and (vi) feasibility studies for wastewater disposal and
a treatment plant on the Chillon River.

The following were achievements under the institutional strengthening component: (i)
establishment of a Master Plan and Financial Plan until 2030, Strategic Plan 1996-2020,
Institutional Strategic Plan 2002-2006 and annual operational plans with specific targets and
results, (ii) restructuring of the company from a bloated pyramidal organization with many
managers and a large number of staff to a flatter organization of only three levels, strengthening
the administrative and customer service functions and developing a new Manual of Organization
and General Responsibilities that reflects the new organizational structure; (iii) training of ESAN
and the University of Piura managers and the introduction of management contracts based on
performance, tied to the targets outlined in the annual operational and strategic plans, with
productivity bonuses; (iv) increase in staff abilities, especially top-level managers, so as not to

                                                41
limit the incorporation of more qualified professional staff; (v) outsourcing or private
participation in business operations and maintenance to reduce associated costs, ease
administrative burdens and mitigate negative effects in case of workers' strikes; (vi)
establishment of Management Agreements as recommended by the Bank to secure the
commitment of government authorities with the company; (vii) implementation of modern
management systems such as SAP R3, the OPEN SGC, the OPEN SGI, the SICAT, and SCADA
for managing the administrative, commercial, land registry and water distribution systems,
respectively; (viii) implementation of Productivity for Quality model to empower and improve
business productivity and customer service; (ix) implementation of a program of micrometering
and control of leaks; (x) ISO 9001:2000 certifications for the Atarjea production processes and
elaboration of projects and works of the company and the ISO 14001 certification for the
environment in the Principle Operational Center for Atarjea; (xi) modernization of company
premises, especially those devoted to public attention; and (xii) feasibility study for the
wastewater disposal and treatment plant of the Chillon River.

The establishment of a fair tariff was also an important part of the institutional strengthening
component, and it was part of the capacity building exercise for SUNASS. Currently, SUNASS
is undertaking studies to establish and exercise control over WSS tariffs for public companies.

The stability of SEDAPAL's governing body, which lasted for almost seven years from 1995-
2001, was essential in achieving more effective and productive management and administration.
This not only improved the image of the company but also ensured that prospects of
implementing its strategic plan

6. Company Financial Performance

As a result of SEDAPAL's modernization process, institutional reforms and capacity building
process, all financed by the Project, the company is currently financially sustainable and does not
require transfers from the central government. Their improved financial condition is partly due to
a 92 percent increase in average WSS tariffs between 1995 and 2007. In addition, efficiency
improvements, as measured by increases in worker productivity, from 2.5 employees per
thousand connections in 1994 to 1.9 employees per thousand connections in 2007, also helped
solidify the financial situation of the company.

As a consequence of their improved balance sheet, the level of investment in the company from
1995 to 2007 has tripled, with 50 percent of this financing from internal cash flows, which have
also increased by approximately 20 percent annual for the same period. All financial ratios have
been maintained at acceptable levels during these years.

7. Role of the Bank and the Borrower

7.1 Role of the Bank

The Bank, through advice and funding of a comprehensive improvement program, greatly
contributed to the achievement of institutional transformation because it defined a
comprehensive Project with investments in strategic areas (meter installation, SCADA

                                                42
installation, and rehabilitation of WSS systems, among others) that contributed to the
improvement of the company's operational indicators. Another of the Bank's contributions was
the introduction of Management Agreements between the company, SUNASS and the Vice
Ministry of Construction and Sanitation, which permitted the measurement, monitoring and
evaluation of physical, operational, and financial targets to be achieved by the end of
implementation. Also, as a condition to their financial support, the Bank promoted the ordering
of the WSS sector, from the creation of SUNASS and the enactment of the General Law of
Sanitation Services and its regulations to the creation of SEDAPAL and the adjustment of their
accounts and tariffs to ensure their viability.

The Bank also encouraged other areas of private sector participation, not only to finance the
feasibility study of the utilization of the waters of the Chillon River but also to allow the
construction and operation through a BOT process. Thus, the Bank's role is rated highly
satisfactory. Regarding the privatization, it is worth mentioning that the Loan Agreement
between Bank and the Government did not make privatization a condition of the loan.

Under the Additional Financing Loan, the Bank also showed a strong interest in promoting the
diffusion of new technological alternatives to solve the problem of sanitation in the intervention
areas. In this regard, the Project financed the trip of a multi-sectoral delegation of technicians to
Brazil to learn about condominial systems for WSS.

7.2. Role of the Borrower

The Peruvian government promoted a new regulatory framework for the sector. This framework
recognized the importance of a realistic pricing policy to provide quality services and expand
these services, but the regulator lacked experienced staff and had different criteria from
SEDAPAL's which delayed the application of the tariff.

SUNASS's autonomy was limited by their status under the Ministry of the Presidency, which is
responsible for WSS. This meant that political considerations intervened in the determination of
tariffs; however, subsequently SUNASS was moved to the Ministry of Economy and Finance.

Superintendency Resolution No. 228-2000-SUNASS approved the tariff formula which
determined rates which corresponded to the SEDAPAL ones for the period November 2000 to
October 2005. The role of the Borrower is considered satisfactory during project implementation.

DGPM-MEF facilitated the generation of appropriate parameters for obtaining the feasibility of
pre-investment at the profile level for the Additional Financing.

7.3. SEDAPAL - UAP

Original Loan

The Project Administration Unit (UAP) functioned according to the structure designed by the
Bank, with the project director and a small group of professionals supported by a specialized
international consulting firm (Italian-Peruvian consortium). Communication between the UAP

                                                 43
and SEDAPAL was at board level through a Committee of Investors constituting the highest
level of operations approval. However, those with the greatest economic impact were presented
to the Board for their knowledge and comments.

The UAP had approximately ten people and was relatively independent of the rest of the
organization, both in technical and administrative aspects; although in some cases they
coordinated and resolved aspects of project execution with the managers from the development,
projects and works, production and service units. Overall, the UAP worked closely with
management of the company, and when cases of divergence arose, they were addressed and
clarified in the Investment Committee, chaired by General Manager. The role of the UAP is rated
highly satisfactory as they achieved their targets.

Additional Financing

As the Project is an extension of Loan Agreement No. 3811-PE, the Bank and SEDAPAL
decided that PROMESAL would deal specifically with the administrative and financial work
because of its staff's expertise in the administration of the above loan. In parallel, with the
presence of the project leader, the PAC was responsible for aspects of project implementation.

The PAC, as project implementation unit, operated within the Bank's parameters with the project
manager and the involvement of a professional team of technical and social specialists.
Communication between the PAC and SEDAPAL was conducted at the level of the board,
through the Investment Committee established as the maximum authority for the approval of
operations.

The PAC had a team of approximately eighteen people and worked closely with the organization,
both in technical and administrative matters, and coordinated and resolved issues related to
project implementation with the managers of development, projects and works, finance,
manufacturing and services. In general, the PAC worked closely with company management,
and in cases of divergence, these conflicts were addressed and clarified by the Investment
Committee, chaired by General Manager.

In February 2008, SEDAPAL deactivated the PAC for administrative reasons and charged the
company's Projects and Works Management with the continuation of Project works.

8. Lessons Learned

Contractors should have sufficient experience to address unforeseen events during
implementation. Proper implementation and adequate management contracts can only be
achieved when the contractor has similar work experience, and thus knows in advance the high
contingency probabilities which need to be covered by the costs.

Clean works are important to reduce inconveniences to local inhabitants. The rubble, dust and
deteriorating infrastructure are the main problems. To address these concerns, each work
introduced a safety engineer whose main responsibilities were signaling, traffic detours, debris
removal and general cleaning.

                                              44
Public dissemination of works is important to achieve the support of the local inhabitants.
Complaints dropped substantially with an increased level of communication. This
communication was initiated through a pamphlet containing information about the scope of
works, work areas and the names of the contractor and supervisor. During implementation, fliers
explaining the nature of works, execution times and others were distributed. Before the start of
implementation, contractors must participate in training sessions on the system will build and
their social staff should permanently on hand to assist to their teams in dispelling doubts among
the local population. Visits to the cadastre area lot-by-lot permit the involvement of the team
with the local population and facilitate dialogue to remove the remaining resistance.

Disputes presented in the contract works were generally satisfactorily resolved through
conciliation. However, arbitration was necessary in cases where this was not possible. In this
regard, the Bank's standard bidding documents presented a problem as there was no distinction
as to what type of arbitration was to be used. According to Peruvian law, Arbitration
Consciousness is adopted in cases where the type of arbitration is not specified; however, this
harms the contracting entity. In these cases, national laws are not in line with Bank standards.

Right set of incentives. The decision of the company to finance the full cost of WSS connections,
with a significant decrease in the annual interest rate from approximately 23.23 to 6.12 percent,
was an incentive to finance in-house connections.

Permanent visits to work areas allow the project to incorporate accurate data, which permits
adjustments to the topographical design and social reality.

Additional benefits. Hygiene education allows people to remember healthy practices in the
family and community. The choice of sanitation services according to economic availability,
cultural patterns and the motivations of each family allows for the capitalization of community
resources for the efficient use of these services.

Community organization and social engagement. The internal organization within the local
population sought local suppliers to enable them to carry out individual and bulk purchases at
lower prices. The social network that ensures sustainability consists of the Water User
Committees (CAS), environmental advocates and people trained during the project intervention.
This network continues to monitor risk situations, formulates and implements agreements and
corrective actions that ensure the proper use of the condominial WSS system. The sustainability
of the condominial subprojects is ensured through the proper functioning of the CAS and its
proactive interaction with the decentralized management of the company. Public training
regarding the installation of the grease trap and its associated maintenance should be extended
toward providing ventilation to remove odors and prolongs time between cleanings, as in the
case of Brazil, which on average occurs ever four to six months. Work on the identification lines
and analysis of the health and organizational reality strengthens the capacity for public
participation and capitalizes on its capabilities, generating action to achieve change.

Summary of the Japan Bank International Cooperation (JBIC) Final Project Assessment.

The JBIC operation performance evaluation review is rated satisfactory in accordance with its
internal rating methodology, which took into account mainly how the operation and maintenance
are being managed after project completion.

The Water Supply and Sewerage Improvement project was focused in Lima-Callao Metropolitan
Area and it was a parallel financing from the JBIC for amount equivalent to US$80 million or
8,427 million Yen. The project had similar objectives as the World Bank project and consisted
on the following components: (i) rehabilitation of potable water and sewerage networks, (ii)
water conservation, which included a water metering program in selected districts and (iii)
consulting services for supervision of civil works. The project did not include financing for
project administration or resources for institutional strengthening due to the agreement with the
World Bank that these activities were planned to be financed with World Bank loan resources.

The loan agreement was signed on January 17, 2001. The starting the rehabilitation of water
system begun on July 4, 2001 for the execution of subprojects in several districts: Miraflores,
San Isidro, Jesus Maria, Lince, and Callao Districts. The project was successfully executed, fully
disbursed and achieved most of the intended products established in the loan agreement.

SEDAPAL, at the request of JBIC, prepared the project final assessment in accordance with
JBIC methodology, which focused on the sustainability of the project investments and how well
SEDAPAL is managing its operation facilities and maintenance. According to the final
evaluation study, the operation and maintenance of the infrastructure is well organized and the
operations and processes are functioning adequately.
