Some lessons\n            learned included: global experience demonstrates that\n            projects that build significant and complex infrastructure\n            such as this one take on average almost ten years to\n            implement successfully. The Bank should take this into\n            consideration when designing operations in the sector, as\n            shorter execution periods could impede the achievement of\n            desired outcomes. The presentation of the condominial system\n            to the potential beneficiaries by the social promoters was\n            very important for a successful implementation since this\n            system represented a new way of doing business for Lima\n            Water and Sewerage Public Company (SEDAPAL), so there were\n            many doubts about its quality and costs from both the\n            company and the beneficiaries at the beginning of each civil\n            work package. The involvement of the beneficiaries during\n            the design and implementation phases through the formation\n            of Water and Sanitation Committee (WSC) as well as through\n            workshops organized by social promoters was a key feature in\n            the development of this system, as it helped to empower the\n            beneficiaries and will contribute to sustain an adequate\n            operation and maintenance of the system in the long-term.\n            SEDAPAL formal legal recognition of the WSC once the civil\n            works are completed and the systems are in operation will\n            help them further fulfill their role during the operation\n            phase and prevent the disappearance or dismantling of this\n            important community structure."}, "docdt": "2009-09-28T00:00:00Z"}
