Miemorandm and Recommendation of the President.
of the IBRD to the Executive Directors
on a Proposed Loan to the Government of Peru
for a Lima Water Rehabilitation and Management Project
1.    I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed
loan to Peru for the equivalent of US$150 million to help finance a project for water and sewerage
network rehabilltaon and epansion, as well as water conservation and otlier instuion' I
strengthening programs for the city of Lima. 'Me loan would be at the Banl's standard variable
interest rate, with a maturity of 17 years, including five years of grace. The proceeds of the loan
would be relent to the Lima Water and Sewerage Service Company (SEDAPAL) for 17 yar,
including five years of grace, with interest at the same rate as the proposed loan..T:he vereas
Economic Cooperation Fund of Japan (OECF) is expected to co-finance the project with a loan of
US$76.2 million.
Background
2.    The water and snitation sector in Peru has deteriorated to a critical stage following yeas of
poor managevont. Since 1991 Peru has suffered from a cholera epidemic marked by high morbidity
and wide geographical distribuon-reflecting the poor water and sanitation infrastctre in the
coutry, pariulaly in the poorest urban areas. The problem is particularly acute in the water-
scarce Lima-CaUao _metopolitan area, which is serviced by SEDAPAL, the country's lagest water
and sanitation company.
3.    As part of the major reform process initiated in Peru in 1991, SEDAPAL went through a
drastic restng. The number of employees was reduced from 3,769 in 1988 to 1,965 in 1993
rugh a voluntary retirement plan Management was streamlined from nine to five operational
divisions. Water and sewerage tariff were increased from US$0.12 per cubic meter in April 1992 to
US$0.28 in May 1994. Decreased operational costs and increased tariffs generated positive net
income in 1993, for the first time in more than a decade.
4.    The Government has also designed a strategy for privatizing SEDAPAL, consistent with its
overall approach to privatization. A private operator would be engaged to improve service quality
and operational efficiency. This would reduce new producdon requirements, and thus delay the need
for investment in new water supplies. A privt, operator would also bring the capital needed to
rehabilitate and expand the Lima water and sanitation systems. CEPRI-SEDAPAL, the commitee
for SEDAPAL privatization, approved a 30-year concession strategy in March 1994. hmre
international operators were prequalifwd on August 12, 1994, and the prospect of Bank financing
for emergency rehabilitation of SEDAPAL's investment program has been a crucial ator in
attracng these international operators. The public tender process, selection of the private operator,
and fmalization of the contact will take nine to twelve monfts.
5.    The ultime form of the prvatzaton, and the time to complete it are difficult to pict at
tis moment. In the meantime, SEDAPAL will continue under public sector management, howver,
in a new policy environment with clear performance incentives. The new regulatoy famework for
water and sanitation, developed during te preparation of this project, introduced marginal cost
pricing, managerial autonomy, t :id accountability. Tllese are essential for efficient utili
management, public or private. SEDAPAL's institutional capacity should be suengthned by clearly
defining its resibilities and relationships with other sector entities.
Radonae fobr Bank involvemem
6.    After Pemu resumed its debt service payments to the Bank in 1990, te Bank'; lnding was
adjustment-based, and supported the government's macroeconomic stabilization and stuctur and



-2-
sector reform programs. During 1992 and 1993, four structural and sector adjustment loans won
approved and signed: the Strutural Adjustment Loan (3452-PE), the Trade Reform Loan (3437-
PE), the Fiacial Sector Reflm Loan (3489-PE), and the Privatization A4dustme  Loa (3595-
PE). The Bank has also supported those reforms dtrough technical assistance, principally through
the Privatization Technical Assitace Loan (3540-PE) and a series of PHRD (Japanese) gran.
Now that the objectives of economic stability and initial sectoral reforms have been substially 
achieved, the Bank is shifting its ate  to raise operating and investment efficiency in the
infrastructure sectors; to Cret the regulatory framework and policies for the private sector to
operate and invest; and to coordinate more infrastructure financing with public and private
financiers. In this context, the ultimate goal for the water and sanitation sector in Peru is to place
sector operations on a commercial basis, with any public -funds exrlicitly directed to provide the
poor with access to appropriate services, while protecting the environment. The Bank has a
comparative advantage in pursuing these objectives with the Govemment. This strategy is fully
consistent with the Country Assistance Strategy discussed by the Board of Executive Direts on
April 20, 1993 and the new Country Assistance Strategy to be circulated to the Board on November
5, 1994.
Project objects
7.    The project's goal is improving the efficiency of water and sanitation service delivery in the
Lima-Callao metropolitan area. Specifically, the project will improve efficiency in service provision
by promoting water conservation and supporting SEDAPAL's privatization, rehabilitatng Uma's
damaged water supply and sewerage system, expanding water and sanitation services to the urban
poor in the pueblos jovenes.
Lessons from prvWous Bank involvent
8.    Since 1976 the Bank has made three loans for water and sanitation projects in Peru, all In
Lima, amouting to US$55.9 million. Earlier projects had objectives similar to some of those of the
proposed project: expanding service, particularly in low-income areas, improving resource
management, and strengthening SEDAPAL's managerial, technical, and fnancial capabilities. They
largely failed to achieve their objectives because of political and economic constraints,
macroeconomic instability, and lack of policy and institutional reforms.
9.    This project, the Bank's first in ten years in Peru's water and sanitation sector, takes these
lessons into account. The Bank's assistance with regulatory and institutional reform will help to
ensure sustainability-both the government and SEDAPAL are committed to reform. The
macroeconomic environment is now considered to be sufficiently stable. And extensive instiuional
reform is underway and will be advanced with private sector participation. Furthermore, the
proposed project is needed whether SEDAPAL is privatized or remains publicly managed. The
Bank-finaned project is a small portion (less tban 20 percent) of the capital expendiure required in
the Lima water and sanitation system in the next decade, but contributes to establishing the direction
to further system improvement.
Projea Desciption
10.   The proposed project has four major components. The water conseinion component aims
to reduce excessive water use. It includes prepanag a customer cadastre, reconstucing watr meter
boxes, and inst    406,000 water meters. This component will also inktiate conjunctve use of
surface and groundwater in three districts where groundwater is depleted and the risk of saline
intrusion is serious. The rehabladon component will improve water supply and sewerage networks
in twelve districts that compris 40 percent of SEDAPAL's water sales and 75 peroeat of tota



-3-
revenue. A number of wells will also be rehabilitated under this component. The pueblos Jovenes
componet aims to expand services to low-income areas, reaching some 600,000 of Lima's poor.
The bs  ulonalstrengfrenng compnet consists of a number of studies and technical asitn
programs for SEDAPAL and the sector regulatory agency the Superintendency of Sanity Servie.
11.   The total cost of the project is estimated at about US$306.2 milion equivalent: US$287.4
million for theivestme  componentand US$18.8 million for the institutioal development
component. Ie Bank will help finance 49 percent of the total cost of the project, OECF abo  24.8
percent, and SEDAPAL 26.2 percent. The project cost and financing are shown in Scbedul A. The
Bank will provide fiuds for civil work, equipment and materals, and consutig services for
engineering, prect maaement and supervision of constution, and the various studie and
technical assistance planned under the instiutional development component. Project implemen
is expected to take six years. Project cost by ptOCUrementhod and disburement schedule an
shown in Schedule B. A timetabe of key processing evenu and status of Rank gmup operations in
Peru are given in Schedules C and D, respectively. Staff Appraisal Report No. 13206-PE, dted
November 1, 1994, is attached.
Project himlen
12.   Implemenation of the project will be managed by a Project Management Unit (PMU)
stablished at SEDAPAL. SEDAPAL will comply with agreed upon criteria, includig evidence of
adequate technical and financial capacity, through a Management Agreement, satisfatory to the
Bank, to be signed with the Ministry of the Presidency, as the apex sectoral instituion. The PMU
will be assisted by management consultant to be financed through the project. A Special Account of
up to US$8.0 million will be established in U.S. dollars in a commercial bank acceptable to the
Bank. A Project Review will assess progress on Government's privatization initiative for
SEDAPAL. If privatization is successful, the Project's financing plan will be modified to
accommodate the concessionaire paticipation, and the present legal agreements would be amended
as necessary. If privatization is unsuccessful, the instutional component intended to stente
SEDAPAL's management capacity, partcularly on the commercial and financial management areas,
will be expanded. The Project Review will be held by no hter than December 31, 1995.
13.   Rehabilitation subprojecs will be selected based on technical criteria agreed on during
project preparaton relating to mainteane urgency, disict locaton, and pipe material, which wil
be included in an agreed impmanual. Expansion subprojects in the pueblos jovenes wil
be chosen based on two principls. Firt, districts are prormized based on service demand.
Second, involvement of the Prject Managmemt Unit should be limited to defining and
disseminating the technical and financial criteria for feasibility, and quality control. The commnity
is responsible for preparing and submitting subproject proposals. Anmal work programs will be
consistent with an agreed six-year strategic plan.
Project sustainability
14.   The commitment of the Government of Pem and SEDAPAL to moderize the sector's
inional and regulatory framework is the key to project sustainability. A new sector law (Wat
and Sanitation General Services Law) and its detailed regulations encourage commercial efficiency,
private sector participation, and tariff levels that reflect economic costs. Establishing the new
regulatory framework will help to ensure the susalnability of earlier institutional restucudng.
Another factor that ensures project sustainability is setting clear investment priorities. In the past-
despite the poor sme of the existing network-priorities were given to network expansion.
SEDAPAL's investment program for 1994-2000 places a clear priority on much-needed
rehabilitation and maintenance of existing operating assets.



-4-
Eimnmentmal aspects
15.   A detd  environntal  aessmt was prepared for the proposed project. Ilo project Is
cassified as Categoty B under the Baik's rating system. Although minor constructon impacts am
expected from th rehabilitation works, the project's direct impact on land use and ecological
systems is exp3cted to be negligible.
Program objectve categories
16.   While the loan proceeds will mostly finance rehabilitation works of water and sewerag
network in selected districts of Lima, the project also places a high priority for expanding water and
sanitation services to the poorest slums of th- city. The project is also supporting the privatization
sttegy for SEDAPAL tough a 36-year concession contract.
Agre2d adkons
17.   During loan ntgotiations, the Bank obtained agreement and assurances from the Govarnment
of Peru and SEDAPAL: (a) that SEDAPAL will pi oduce funds from intemal sources equivalent to
no less than 30 percent of the annual capital expendiu  program; (b) that SEDAPAL would not
incur any new debt, unless the net revenues are at least 1.5 times the estimated maximum debt
service requrmeat; (c) that SEDAPAL shall submit evidence that the ratio of the number of
permanent employees per 1,000 water connections is less than 2.5 by not later ihan December 31,
1995, and less than 2.0 by not later than December 31, 2000; (d) the project would be carded out
in accordance with an agreed first management agreement prior to Project Review. After the
Review, the project must be in accordance with either the concession contract and second sLbsidiary
loan agreement or, if privatizaon is not successfil, new annual management agreements should be
reached; (e) on the selected indicators and targets to be monitored during project implementation; (fM
on Bank annual reviews in the implementation of the Project; and (g) on preparing and presening to
fte Bank, not later than November 30 each year, an annual operating plan with activities,
implementation schedule, physical targets and budget for the following year.
18.   Prior to loan effectiveness: (a) new tariff regulations would be approved by an executive
decree as part of the regulations of the Water and Sanitafton Services Law; (b) the Ministry of the
Presidency would submit to the Bank a satisfactory proposal for fmancing seconazy works in
accordance wifth the Water and Sanitation Services Law; (c) the Government of Peru and SEDPAL
would have executed the first subsidiary loan agreement; (d) the Government and SEDAPAL would
have executed the first management agreement; (e) SEDAPAL would have established and staffed
the Project Management Unit and the Project Consultative Committee; and (i) SEDAPAL wodd
have formally adopted the Project implementtion Mamnal.
Prjecthenefin
19.   At the end of the project   ementaton period the project is expected to have provided
834,000 people with better access to water supply and 788,000 people wifth improved sewerage
services. The pueblos jovenes component will benefit an additional 600,000 poor reside  with
improved access to water supply and sewerage services. The pnncipal project benefits will be: (a)
savings geneaed by the reduction of unaccounted-for water through the rehabiliation program; (b)
savings generated by a reduction of ex essive consumption use in high-income dsicts through the
water conservation program; (c) better hygienic conditions-leading to substantial health benefits-
in the pueblos jovenes; (d) increased reliability of water supply services will reduce water costs
since consumers will no longer be faced with rationed supply; (e) improved access to the piped
water supply and sewerage network will reduce ~he urban poor's fiancial burden since they will no

longr have to rely on costdy altentve watr sources; (f) pmervaion of water sources through the
conjuncdve use program; and (g) support for the privatizaton process. The intenal economic rae
of retum   of th. priec I. estimated to he 22%, whlbe the fncial rate of retm  s esmad at
17%.
20.  TMm pt'OWa main isk ate polHcal opposition to proposed sectoral refonn-lecbudn
privatizatlon, which may slow the refom procs, resultig In project  plementation dlays durig
the transition fm opublic to priat sector operation; insufficent counte   ng; and 
accptance of the Bank' funs by th concossioi. Te risk of political oppaition is minimized by
three factors. tis, the ew eulatory and iatiutonal framework is the result of two yean of
consensusbuidg within the Govemment of Peru. Second, the timing and social environment for
privatizalon is favorable-the current administradon expects to complete SEDAPAL's privatization
before the April 1995 elections. finally, successful pr.vadzation in other sectors and public utiitie
has created social support for privatiztion. The risk of ineffective execution of the project durig
the transition period is mintimized by a management agreement to be signed between SEDAPAL ant
the GoverameuL This contract defines key operadonal and invesment performance objectives and
progress will be evaluated every three months until a private operator assumes responsibility. If
privatization is successful, a performance plan-as part of the concession contract-will be signed
beween the private operator and SEDAPAL. If prlvttzation is unsucessful, a second management
ageement will be signed between SEDAPAL and the government during the project review. Annual
management agements should be signed tereafter. Te risk of Insufficient counterpatt fding is
mimnid thrwoug the new tariff regulations, which allow for adequate levels of revemie and
automatic adjustments based on five-year tariff formulas, and through the monitoring of inestment
decisons and operatonal effciency through the management plan (before privaization) and the
performance plan-(after privatization). The risk that the concessionaire may not take the Bank fnds,
and the possibt of loan cancellation, is considered to be low since the prequalifled privat
operators have already shown considerable interest in the Bank loan which would fiance urgent
rehabilitaton work.
Recommendalon
I am stsfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the
Bank and recommend that the Executive Directors approve it.
