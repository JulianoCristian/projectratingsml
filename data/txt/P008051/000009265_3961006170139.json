Project's goal is to improve the efficiency\n            of water and sanitation delivery in the Lima-Callao\n            metropolitan area. The project will promote water\n            conservation, support the Lima Water and Sewerage Service\n            Company's (SEDAPAL's) privatization, rehabilitate\n            damaged water supply and sewerage systems, expand services\n            to the urban poor in the pueblos jovenes, and support\n            reforms in the legal and institutional framework of the\n            water and sanitation sector. The project has four\n            components. The water conservation component includes\n            preparing a customer cadastre, reconstructing water meter\n            boxes, and installing 406,000 water meters. This component\n            will also initiate conjunctive use of surface and\n            groundwater in three districts where groundwater is depleted\n            and the risk of saline contamination is serious. The\n            rehabilitation component will improve water supply and\n            sewerage in the twelve districts that comprise 40 percent of\n            SEDAPAL's water sales and 75 percent of total revenue.\n            Wells will also be rehabilitated under this component. The\n            pueblos jovenes component will expand and improve water and\n            sanitation services for 600,000 of Lima's poor. The\n            institutional strengthening component involves studies and\n            technical assistance programs for SEDAPAL and the\n            Superintendency of Sanitary Services."}, "docdt": "1994-11-01T00:00:00Z"}
