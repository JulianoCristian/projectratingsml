APPRAISAL OF THE NORTH ROAD PROJECT
SUMMARY
i.        The Government of Honduras has asked the Bank and IDA to help
finance completion of the North Road from Tegucigalpa, capital of Honduras,
to San Pedro Sula, its most important commercial center. The Government has
also asked the Inter-American Development Bank to participate in the financing
of the road.
ii.       The project consists of the construction of a 202 km two-lane bitu-
minous surfaced highway between the Rio del Hombre and iotrerillos. It would
replace a narrow, winding gravel road, with sharp curves and steep grades.
The sections between Tegucigalpa and Rio del Hombre and between San Pedro
Sula and Potrerillos are already being improved to satisfactory standards.
iii.      The cost of the project is estimated at US$23.6 million equivalent,
including contingencies. The estimate is based on final engineering of all
but one small section of the road. The foreign exchange component is about
60 percent. The Government expects to finance about 20 percent of the project
costs (US>h.7 million) and has asked the Bank, IDA, and IDB to share the
remainder. It is proposed that the Bank and IDA contribute half of this
remainder and the IDB the other half.
iv.       All contracts for construction will be awarded on the basis of
international competitive bidding.  3xecution of the project will be the
responsibility of the Ministry of Communications and Public Works. The pro-
ject will impose a very heavy workload on the Ministry so that outside con-
sultants will be retained to finalize plans and contract documents, to assist
in the awarding of contracts and to supervise the execution of the project.
v.        The North Road was given the highest priority in the 1963-72 highwtay
program developed in a study by Stanford Research Institute under a previous
IDA credit. The traffic on the existing road already exceeds 400 vehicles
and is growing rapidly. The new road will sharply reduce transport costs;
this is particularly important to the economy of Honduras since a very large
proportion of these costs are direct foreign exchange costs. The rate of
return on the investment is about 20 percent, which is clearly satisfactory.
vi.       Agreement has been reached during negotiations on the use of
consultants, design standards, the strengthening of highway administration
practices and enforcement of traffic regulations, increased allocations fo.'
road maintenance, and provision of local funds for the project.
vii.      Subject to the Government obtaining the necessary additional financ-
ing for the project from IDB, the project provides a suitable basis for a
Bank loan and IDA credit totaling US`9.5 million equivalent.  The Bank loan
would be for US$6 million for 25 years including a grace period of 6 years,
while the IDA credit would be for US&,3.5 million on the usual terms.

APPRAISAL OF THE NORTH ROAD PROJECT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.        The Government of Honduras has asked the Bank and IDA to help finance
completion of the North Road from Tegucigalpa to San Pedro Sula. The Govern-
ment has also asked the Inter-American Bank to participate in the financing of
the road.
2.        This vould be the fourth highway loan or credit by the Bank and IDA
to Honduras. A loan of US$4.2 million (No. 135-HO) was made in 1955 to finance
the establishnent of a maintenance organization.  A loan of US$5.5 million
(No. 195-HO) was made in 1958 primarily to reconstruct the San Pedro Sula-
Puerto Cortes and Southern roads and to build bridges on the Western Highway
(see Map); all work has been successfully completed. The first IDA credit
of US,9 million (No. 1-HO) was made in 1961 to finance (a) an extension of the
lestern Highway to El Salvador; (b) feeder roads to connect with the Western
Highway; (c) further strengthening of highway maintenance operations initiated
under the first loan; and (d) a highway transportation survey to establish a
long-term investment program. The Western Highway extension has been completed,
and the feeder roads are being constructed. The survey, carried out by Stan-
ford Research Institute, was finished in 1962.
3.        The performance under all ofi these loans and the IDA credit has been
satisfactory. All construction was carried out on schedule to proper stand-
ards and within the cost estimates.  A maintenance organization has been estab-
lished, maintenance has improved and further improvements are suggested in this
report. The assistance of consultants, which has been required under all loans,
has been most beneficial.
4.        This report is based on (a) the Stanford study, (b) a feasibility
and final engineering study of the North Road by Brown & Root Overseas, Inc.,
consultants to the Honduran Ministry of Communications and Public W,forks,
(c) documents prepared by various Government agencies, (d) the findings of a
Bank appraisal mission to Honduras in September, 1964, and (e) the results of
negotiations held in Washington in January 1965.
II. BACKGROUND
A. General
5.        Honduras is located in the center of the five Central Anerican
republics. It is the second largest of these republics, with an area of
43,000 sq. miles (112,000 sq. km).  It has a population of 2.1 million,
which has been growing rapidly at slightly more than 3 percent annually.
6.        Honduras' gross national product has been growing by 4-5 percent
annually in recent years and is now-i approaching US$450 million equivalent;
the per capita income is about US)210, which is the lowest in Central America.



The transport and communications sector has accounted for about 7 percent
of Honduras' national product in recent years; it has been increasing slowly
but is still relatively low and reflects the fact that the transport network
is relatively undeveloped.
7.        Geographically, Honduras is the most mountainous country in Central
America. The terrain is exceptionally rugged and crossed by many rivers and
streams. This has made the construction and maintenance of a transport net-
rork difficult and expensive and thus has hindered the country's economic
development.
B. Transport in Honduras
8.        Honduras has three railway lines extending nearly 1,200 km. Two
of the lines are owned by two fruit companies and are used primarily to ship
bananas from their plantations to Caribbean ports and to transport imported
supplies for their own use.  The National Railways, owned and operated by
the Government, has only about 130 km of line. All three lines are located
on the north coast in areas adjacent to the major port cities; they serve
only a very small sector of Honduras. Nevertheless, they handle about one-
half of the country' s inter-city freight traffic, reflecting the importance
of the banana traffic.
9.        The difficult terrain and the related lack of a good highway net-
work have made air transport very important in Honduras. A number of com-
munities rely largely on air service for their contact with the outside
world. Airlines, using DC-3 and smaller planes, serve 28 communities, nearly
all receiving regularly scheduled service. The most important routes are
the triangle between Tegucigalpa, San Pedro Sula and La Ceiba. Total air
traffic has declined somewhat in recent years, primarily because of improve-
ments in the highway network.
10.       There is no inland water traffic in Honduras because the rivers
cannot be made navigable. Water transport serving Honduran ports on the
Caribbean and Pacific coasts, and providing most of the foreign trade vital
to Honduras, is complementary rather than competitive with internal road
and rail transport. Completion of the Tegucigalpa-San Pedro Sula road will
further enhance the importance of the port at Puerto Cortes, for which a
Bank loan is currently under consideration.
11.       The highway transport industry is the backbone of Honduras' domestic
transportation system. It has expanded rapidly in the last 10 years. The
motor vehicle fleet has tripled between 1953 and 1963 from about 5,500 to
16,700 vehicles, an annual increase of nearly 12 percent (see Table 1).
Since vehicle capacity is also increasing, the freight carried has expanded
even more rapidly. Of the fleet, nearly Lo percent are trucks and 13 percent
buses. This high proportion of commercial vehicles reflects in part the
Government's policy of promoting their use, rather than that of private cars,
by lower license fees and import duties and lower taxes on diesel fuel than
on gasoline. The average age of the fleet is high but seems to be decreasing.
The capacity of an average truck is only about 2 tons, which is low.



- 3 -
12.       Honduras can still espect a very substantial growth of highway
transport. In spite of the large increases in recent years, Honduras still
has only about 8 vehicles per 1,000 population, which is the lowest in Central
America.* The Stanford study estimates that the vehicle fleet will increase
from about 16,000 in 1962 to about 26,000 by 1967 and 47,000 by 1972 (see
Table 1). This increase of about 11 percent annually takes into account such
factors as the rate of growth in the last 10 years (12 percent); the expected
growth in national income (about 3.5 percent) and of individual sectors of the
economry; the trend toward larger trucks and buses, which means a smaller rate
of increase in the number of vehicles than in the volume of freight and pas-
senger traffic; and developments in neighboring countries.
13.       As in most developing countries, the trucking industry consists
primarily of one-truck owner-operators; only about 1 percent of the opera-
tors have 5 or more trucks. This means that most enterprises are too small
to provide efficient sernices.  Also, the wide dispersion of vehicles among
numerous small operators makes for extensive competition.  There is no eco-
nomic regulation of the industry; licenses are freely available at a small
fee and rates are not prescribed. Safety regulation and restrictions on
vehicle weights and dimensions exist but are not effectively enforced. This
latter problem was discussed during loan negotiations, and agreement was
reached on more effective enforcerment of regulations.
14.       Total annual investments in transport more than doubled between
1952 and 1962 from L 8.0 to L 18e7 million.  Highway transport accounted
for about 95 percent of the total in 1962 and was split nearly equally between
highways and highway vehicles; aviation accounted for most of the remainder,
15.       The subject of transport coordination has been given little atten-
tion so far in Honduras. However, impirovement of the highvay network will
raise at least two major issues; the future of the railways, especially the
National Railways, and the need to reduce air services in parts of Honduras.
The Government is employing foreign consultants to study the scope of future
air services. It has no specific plans for the National Railways anx no new,
investinents are being made in it.  The project road itseLf rill not affect
the railways significantly since there is no railway in its zone of influ-
ence, but it will affect the scope of air services between Tegucigalpa and
San Pedro.

C. The Highway System
16.       Development of the Honduran highway network on any significant
scale did not begin until the 1950's. As shown below, it now consists of
about 3,h00 km of roads, which makes it the shortest in Central America; relating
it to the are.a of the c.ountry, the density of the net,-xork is only one seventh
of that of Costa Rica, which has the longest network. While the principal
roads connect the major towns, the secondary roads connect remote towns and
villages with the principal roads.  Only about 400 km of roads, or about
12 percent of the network, are paved.

Secondary roads                         55        922         27         953
Tertiary roads                          -       1,1149       -         2,110
Penetration roads                                1476        -            e
Sub-total              384      3,026      1,439       3,252
Total                     3, 410                 ,691
17.       Under the 10-year highway program prepared by Stanford and generally
accepted by the Government as the basis for its highway plans, the highway net-
work would be extended by about one-third (see above table). But even more
important is the improvement of the network. Nearly one-third of the entire
network would be paved compared to only 12 percent in 1962, nearly 90 perceilt
of the principal roads would be paved compared to LO percent in 1962 and the
standards for many unpaved roads would also be substantially improved. The
program is generally well conceived but it will probably take more than
10 years to carry it out.
D. Highway Administration and Maintenance
18.       The two Government organizations primarily responsible for the
nation's highway system are the National Economic Council and the Highway
Department, in the Ministry of Communications and Public Works. The Council,
an interministerial planning body which reports directly to the President
of the Republic, prepares long-term programs for the development of the high-
way system in relation to the economic needs and resources of the country.
The Highway Department is responsible for the construction and maintenance of
the road network. The Police is responsible for traffic control and enforce-
ment of highway regulations and the Ministry of Economy and Finance for ve-
hicle registration.



- 5 -
19.       The organization of the Highway Department is shown in the attached
chart. The Department has central divisions for engineering, administration,
accounting and auditing, but the responsibility for the construction and main-
tenance of roads was recently decentralized by establishing two divisions, one
for the North and one for the South; this was intended to increase efficiency,
but it is too early to appraise the effects. However, a number of other
important reforms, some of which were previously recommended by consultants
employed under IDA Credit No. 1 and in the Stanford study, should also be
carried out. The most important of these include the strengthening of the
Planning Unit within the Ministry of Public Works, the establishing of a
professional career Civil Service system, elimination of red tape in financing
procedures, better accounting for highway expenditures, improved highway
maintenance practices, and better enforcement of road regulations. The Govern-
mRent is aware of the need for these improvements.  Their importance was
stressed during negotiations, and agreemrent was reached with the Government
on a program for carrying them out over time.
20.       Maintenance of highways is the responsibility of seven Maintenance
Districts. Each district is headed by an engineer and has its own technical
and administrative staff, equipment, workshop and service facilities. As
communications improve, the number of districts could be reduced, which would
lead to savings in staff and overhead. In recent years, the training and
equipment of the highway maintenance organization has been materially strength-
ened with the financial assistance of the Bank and IDA. Maintenance expendi-
tures have averaged about L 900 per km annually, which is barely adequate.
During negotiations agreement was reached on increased allocations for road
maintenance.
E. Highway Expenditures and Receipts
21.       As shown in Table 2, annual expenditures on highways have fluctuated
considerably in recent years, ranging from a low of L 9 million in 1957 to a
high of L 17 million in 1959. New construction accounts for about three-
quarters of total expenditures and fluctuates largely in accordance with the
availability of funds from foreign loans. Highway expenditures have been
equivalent recently to about 22 percent of the national budget.
22.       Numerous duties, fees and taxes are placed on motor vehicle owner-
ship and operations. These user charges are relatively light on commercial
vehicles; they are not subject to customs duties and sales taxes, their
license fees are much lower and the diesel tax is only 5.6 centavos per
gallon compared with 38.1 centavos for gasoline. The Stanford survey esti-
mated that the revenues from highway user charges covered about 55 percent
of expenditures on highways in 1962.  1Jhile this is on the low side, it is
not unreasonable considering the relatively small fleet and the fact that
at this early stage annual highway investments exceed annual highway costs
as measured by depreciation and interest on total highway investments. The
percentage of highway expenditures covered by user charges has been rising
rapidly; the Stanford study estimates that the revenues from present user
charges will increase substantially with the growth in traffic and average
nearly 80 percent of highway expenditures in the 1963-72 period, which
appears a reasonable assumption.



- 6 -
F. Transportation in the Development Plan
23.       Honduras has recently prepared a 1965-69 Development Plan and a
more detailed program for 1965-66. The former is very general and does not,
for example, give public investments by individual sectors of the economy;
the 1965-66 program, on the other hand, gives not only the sector invest-
ments, but also lists the individual projects in each sector. Both plans
have been approved in principle by the Government.
24.       Transportation is by far the largest sector in the 1965-66 plan,
accounting for more than one-third of total investments; a similar pro-
portion was invested in transport in the last five years. Highways account
for about 90 percent of the transport sector. The plan assumes that 70 per-
cent of highway investments will be financed from foreign loans, of which
about one-half for 1965 but less than 10 percent for 1966 have so far been
obtained.
25.       The highway projects included in the plan are generally those
recommended in the Stanford report, and include the North Road. However, it
is virtually certain that the estimated expenditures of L 35 million in 1965
and L 41 million in 1966 cannot be realized, and in its conclusion the plan
admits a possible slippage of 30 percent in its execution, which would reduce
expenditures to about L 24 and L 28 million, respectively. While these
amounts are generally consistent with the Stanford plan, they are still
ambitious when it is realized that investments in recent years have averaged
less than L 10 million. The North Road accounts for about one-half of
estimated investments in 1965 and for more than one-third in 1966.
III. THE PROJECT
A. Description
26.       The project consists of a 202 km long two-lane bituminous surfaced
road to be constructed between the Rio del Hombre and Potrerillos, linking
Tegucigalpa, the capital of Honduras, with San Pedro Sula, its largest
commercial center. It will no doubt be the most important road in the
country. The road would be part of the transcontinental route planned under
the Regional Program of Central American Highways across the Central American
Isthmus, from Puerto Cortes on the Atlantic Ocean to the Pan American Highway
at the Golfo de Fonseca on the Pacific. The project has been studied inten-
sively for many years.
27.       The existing North Road between the Rio del Hombre and Potrerillos
is a narrow, winding gravel road, with sharp curves and gradients up to 15
percent. It unuld be difficult and uneconomic to reconstruct this road to
satisfactory standards since the mountainous terrain would involve many sections
with long and steep grades and numerous sharp curves. After the construction
of the new road, the above road will have to be maintained only for local
traffic, and the Comayagua-La Libertad road can be abandoned.



28.       Several improvements were made recently on sections of the road
adjoining each end of the project. From Rio del Hombre south to Tegucigalpa,
the Government is reconstructing the existing road (approximately 37 kms)
with its own forces without external financing; and from Tegucigalpa south
to the Inter-American Highway, the asphalt pavement has been improved under
a Bank loan. From Potrerillos north to San Pedro, the Government is improving
with its own funds the existing road (approximately 22 kms), and from there,
north to Puerto Cortes, the road was also built under a Bank loan.
29.       The project starts from the end of the government-improved
Tegucigalpa-Rio del Hombre road and climbs toward the continental divide
at San Francisco, at an elevation of 1,450 meters. It then descends, crosses
the Comayagua Valley and proceeds to La Libertad in the Humuya Valley. After
crossing the Rio Humuya, it turns into the Yure River Valley and emerges on
a plateau at Santa Cruz de Yojoa. After descending to the Sula Valley, it
joins the existing North Road. The project also includes a new two-lane
concrete bridge over the Ulua River north of Potrerillos. At the present
time, vehicular traffic uses the single-lane damaged railroad bridge.
B. Design Standards
30.       The final design and specifications of the road from Zambrano to
Potrerillos, and of the bridge over the Ulua River, were prepared by Brown &
Root Overseas, Inc., consultants, and bids can be called for immediately.  The
design is generally satisfactory except for some mountainous sections where
the standards will be somewhat reduced. The 10 km section between the Rio
del Hombre and Zambrano has not yet been fully engineered and during loan
negotiations it was agreed that the design of this section would be executed
by consultants.
31.       The design standards as agreed upon during negotiations are satis-
factory and are an improvement over those previously used in Honduras (see
Table 3). Design speeds range from 50 km/h in mountainous terrain to 100 km/h
on level terrain. The maximum grades will be 7 percent. The pavement, a solid
base with a double bituminous surface treatment, is designed for heavy trucks
and the design provides for stage development so that it can be upgraded to an
asphalt concrete carpet when the traffic grows sufficiently to justify it. On
the basis of the traffic forecast discussed in paragraph 44, the road will have
adequate capacity to accommodate future traffic for more than 25 years if
certain relatively minor improvements are made.
32.       Bridges and other structures were designed to American Association
of State Highway Officials (AASHO) standard 15 ton loading (see Table 3),
which is common in Central America. All bridges will be of concrete, thus
utilizing to the maximum local materials and skills. The bridge over the Ulua
River will be a multispan box structure, one of the biggest in the country.



-8-
C. Execution
33.       Execution of the project will be the responsibility of the Ministry
of Communications and Public Works.  The scale of the project will more than
double highway construction in Honduras in the coming years. The Ministryts
professional staff and the construction industry cannot cope with such an
expansion. Cutside consultants will therefore be employed to supervise and
administer the construction, and the wArk will most certainly be carried out,
as in the past, by foreign firms. The use of consultants satisfactory to the
Bank is a condition of the loan. Construction will be carried out under unit
price contracts and on the basis of international competitive bidding. In
order to achieve the lowest costs, the project will be let in two or more
contracts.
3h.       Construction work will be mechanized to a large extent.   This is
justified since unemployment is not a major problem in Honduras, and the new
road crosses areas where labor is relatively scarce. The tight construction
time schedule for the new road, which is badly needed to cope with the growth
of traffic, and the quality standards of the work which are imposed by the
expected traffic volunes, also make mandatory the extensive use of mechanized
equipment.
D. Cost Estimate and Financing
35.       The estimated cost of the project is shown below (for details,
see Table 4):
US3 equivalent
(millions)
Construction                             19.4
Right-of-way                              0.5
Supervision (consultants)                 1.6
Contingencies                             2.1
Total                             23..6
The estimate includes the cost of construction, right-of-way, supervision and
administration of construction, design for the Rio del Hombre-Zambrano section
and establishment of roadside camps. Import taxes and consular fees are ex-
cluded from the estimates. Allowances of 10 percent are included in the con-
struction costs for physical contingencies and of 10 percent on all costs for
possible price increases. The estimates are based on detailed quantities
calculated from final engineering for the Zambrano-Potrerillos section. For
the 10 km Rio del Hombre-Zambrano section, the estimates are based on prelimin-
ary engineering and the allowance for physical contingencies has therefore been
raised to 17 percent. Unit prices were determined from cost analyses and also
take into account prices for similar works recently carried out on the Western
Highway extension in Honduras. The cost estimates appear reasonable.
36.       The foreign exchange component is estimated at about 60 percent on
the basis of information provided by consultants; this is consistent with
previous experience in Honduras. It includes imported equipment, materials
and personnel and the profits of contractors.



37.       It is expected that the work cannot start until late in 1965 due
to the time necessary to approve the loan and because the rainy season does
not end until November; the work is estimated to be completed in 1970. The
annual expenditures are estimated as follows:
1965      US$ million 1.0           L million  2.0
1966                   4e3                      8.6
1967                   4.8                      9.6
1968                   5.6                    11.2
1969                   5.6                    11.2
1970                   2.3                      4.6
TOTAL        23,6                    47.2
38.       The Honduran Government expects to finance about 20 percent of the
project, or about L 9.4 million, and has asked the Bank, IDA and the Inter-
American Development Bank to share the remaining L 37.8 million.*   It is
understood that IDB would like to participate in the financing with the same
amount as the Bank and IDA combined. This is acceptable provided that the
Bank carries out its customary procedures for the administration and super-
vision of the project. No difficulty is anticipated in this respect since
experience on the lWesterm Highway Extension financed jointly by IDA and IDB
has been satisfactory.
IV. ECONOMIC JUSTIFICATION
A. Introduction
39e       The Stanford study on highway transport in Honduras found that
"the most important of the projects considered is the North Road from Teguci-
galpa to the north coast because it is the principal artery of Honduras and
is the key route in the development of a highway network". Accordingly, the
North Road was given the highest priority in the proposed highway investment
plan and its immediate construction was recommended. Similarly, the road is
among those given the highest priority in the Regional Program of Central
American Highways adopted on September 1, 1963 by the Ministers of Econony
and Public Works of the five Central American Republics.
B. The Zone of Influence
40.       The North Road will pass through the middle of three of Honduras'
most populated departments:  Francisco Morazan, in which the capitiL,
Tegucigalpa (population 150,000), is located; Comayagua, one of the most
productive agricultural areas; and Cortes, in which the largest port,
* An additional amount of about L 4.5 million would. be added to the
government share of financing if we consider the total project between
Tegucigalpa and San Pedro Sula and take into account the improvements
described in paragraph 28 and being carried out with the Government's owl
funds on the extensions of the project road south to Tegucigalpa and north
to San Pedro Sula.



- 10 -
Puerto Cortes, and the country's largest industrial city, San Pedro Sula
(population 90,000), are located. These departments have a population of
about 650,000 or about one-third of Honduras' total; their population density
is about twice the national average and the rate of growth is also greater.
41. The total farm area in the zone of influence is about 370,000
hectares, or nearly one-quarter of the country's total.  The value of its
agricultural production in 1962 amounted to nearly L 50 million; major
items w7ere coffee (L 9 million), corn, bananas, and milic (about L 6 million
each), and cattle, sugar cane, rice and beans. 1ore than half the farming
is of a subsistence nature but the yields are generally better than in most
other areas of' Honduras. The value of agricultural production is estimated
by government officials to double betwzeen 1962 and 1972.
O2.       ilost of the country's manufacturing and processing facilities are
located in the zone of influence. There were in 1962 about 130 establish-
ments in San Pedro, writh an output valued at about L 50 million; examples
include clothing, metal workdng, chemicals, cement, rubber goods, automotive
repair and food processing. In the Tegucigalpa area there were about 170 es-
tablishments, with a total output valued at L 43 million. The two cities
together account for more than 75 percent of the country's manufacturing
output. Of the total number of motor vehicles registered in Honduras,
about 75 percent are in the project's zone of influence
C. Reduction in Transport Costs
43.       The project will sharply reduce transport costs on one of the most
heavily travelled roads in Honduras. This is particularly important to the
economy of Honduras since a very large proportion of highway transport costs
are foreign exchange costs; the Stanford study found that imports to sustain
a single vehicle per year, such as gasoline and spare parts, should decrease
from L 1,300 to L 600 between 1962 and 1972, largely as a result of highway
improvements. The rate of return on the investment, whose economic life
for this purpose is conservatively assumed to be 20 years though the road
will probably serve for a much longer period, is about 20 percent,
which is satisfactory.  There will be additional benefits which cannot
readily be expressed in monetary terms, but which are substantial (see
paragraph 46).
41h.      Traffic counts made as part of the Stanford survey indicate that
in 1962 the eauivalent of about 350 vehicles travelled the total length of
the road daily between Tegucigalpa and San Pedro Sula. About two-thirds of
these wiere trucks and only about 10-15 percent were passenger cars. The
daily traffic consisted. of about 370 passengers and 900 tons of freight,
including lumber, corn and other grains, coal and miscellaneous consumer
goods. It is expected that about 85 percent of the traffic will be directed
to the new road once it is completed.
45.       The Stanford survey estimates that the average daily traffic in 1972
on the old road will be about 100 and on the new road about 800 vehicles,invo'-
ving an annual increase in total traffic between 1962 and 1972 of about 10 per-



- 11 -
cent. The freight tonnage is expected to increase by about 5.5 percent
annually and the nunber of passengers by nearly 17 percent. The forecast
is based on such factors as the growth of population in the area (nearly
4 percent), the probable increase in vehicle registrations of 11 percent
(see paragraphs 11 and 12), and an analysis of the individual commodities
carried.  That the traffic forecast is reasonable is indicated by the fact
that between 1962 and 1964 the traffic on the road increased by more than
40 percent. Nevertheless, taking into account the large margin of possible
error because the samples of traffic counts were small, the calculation of
benefits in tlhis report assumes a 1972 daily traffic of only 700 vehicles,
or an annual increase of 7.5 percent.  After 1972, it is assumed that the
annual rate of increase would taper off to 3 percent by 1990.
46.       Vehicle operating costs on a poor gravel road, such as the ex-
isting North Road, average about 18.0 centavos per ton/lm. and 3.6 centavos
per passenger/km. For the type of vehicle now using the road this means
a cost of 45 centavos per truck/lkm., 40 centavos per bus/km. and 15 centavos
per passenger car/km. Because of h-igher design standards and a better pave-
ment, it is estimated that on the new road these costs will be cut in half,
in line with the experience from other similar road improvements both in
EIonduras and other countries. If this saving is applied to the estimated
traffic in 1972, the reduction in transport costs in that year would amount
to nearly L 11 million.
D. Other Benefits
47.       In addition there will be other benefits which are not included
in the above rate of return calculation because they cannot readily be
expressed in monetary terms. The most important ones include:
a)  The present road is so narrow and winding that larger
and more efficient vehicles cannot be used effectively,
if at all. The new road, by permitting larger vehicles,
iill thus reduce transport costs even beyond the cost
reductions mentioned in paragraph 45.
b) There will be substantial savings in time for both
passengers and freight. The present trip between
Tegucigalpa and San Pedro takes about 7 hours for a
passenger car; on the new road this will be reduced
to 4 hours. For the 600,000 passengers estimated to
use the road in 1972, this would be a saving of
1.8 million hours. The trip will also be much more
comfortable for them. The travel time for trucks will
be reduced from about 9 to 6 hours.
c) The road will provide access to the IHumuya Valley,
which has some excellent agricultural land, and also
serve other areas where exploitation of lumber is
possible. However, the road merely provides the



- 12 -
opportunity for these developments and whether they
will in fact take place will depend largely on private
initiative and investments.
d)  The road would make an important contribution to better
political and administrative integration of the country's
northern and southern regions which now are virtually
isolated from each other.
V. CONCLUSIONS AND RECO14MENDATIONS
48.       The project will greatly improve the conditions for road transport
on one of the most important highways of Honduras. It is well planned,
technically sound and will yield a good economic return on the investment
from lower transport costs alone. The Honduran Ministry of Communications
and Public Works will be able to execute the project with the assistance of
consultants.
49.       The Honduran Government expects to finance about 20 percent of the
project costs, and has asked the Bank, IDA and IDB to share the remainder.
IDB is considering financing the same amount as the Bank and IDA combined.
5o.       Subject to the Government obtaining the necessary additional
financing for the project from IDB, the project provides a suitable basis
for a Bank loan and IDA credit totaling US39n5 million equivalent. The Bank
loan of US.t6 million would be for 25 years including a grace period of 6 years,
while the IDA credit of US$3.5 million would be on the usual terms.
