satisfactory and borrower performance was also satisfactory.\n            Some lessons learned includes: effective communication is\n            the key to promoting development outcomes. Inject awareness\n            of Natural resource management (NRM) at the community level\n            by having natural resource department in the District\n            Assembly's (DAs). Effective relationships among\n            development partners and good donor collaboration and\n            harmonization are paramount to the successful implementation\n            of a decentralized project. Inexperience among rural banks\n            and project staff with the lending promoted by the project,\n            as well as the lack of business skills among clients, posed\n            challenges for implementing component three. Decentralizing\n            project management functions up to the zone and regional\n            levels was very instrumental in ensuring smooth\n            implementation of the project."}, "docdt": "2011-12-30T00:00:00Z"}
