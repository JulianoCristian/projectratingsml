                         The major achievement of the project are the completion of all the capacity building program all 10 RPCUs, all 170 DPCUs as well as users and beneficiaries such as school
                         management committees, Dam management committees, water users committees. The RPCUs and DPCUs visited by the team were very appreciative of the support provided by
                         the project. The project supported the (i) National Development Planning Commission (NDPC) in the preparation and training of DAs in using the guidelines for the formulation of
                         District Medium Term Development Plans; (ii) the Accountant General#s Department to prepare financial manual for the MDAs; and (iii) the National Public Procurement Authority

                         (NPPA) in the development a procurement manual and training of DAs.

                         The regions were thus able to support the districts to prepare their medium term development plans, and establish Procurement and Tender Review Boards. The DAs and Area
                         Councils were able to procure the services consultants and contractors to: (i) rehabilitate a total of 1277km of feeder roads, which have increased access to social services and
                         reduced the travelling time from an average of 15minutes to cover 1km to 4minutes; (ii) construction of 458km of basic school infrastructure providing congenial environment to 47,00
                         pupils reducing the number of bad weather disrupting school activities to zero from 15 days and also increased school enrollment by 29 percent; (iii) provision of 1676 borehole points
                         providing safe water to 586,600 people in 453 communities contributing to reduction in water borne diseases; (iv) construction of 5 dams, two wind pumps and 1 dugout to provide
                         water for year round farming; (v) completion of 39 markets to facilitate marketing of rural produce; (vi) provision of micro credit to 97 enterprises with about 27 percent average
                         recorded change in value assets; (vii) nine hundred and fifty seven trainees from the learning centers have set up their own enterprises; Construction of 271 Community health
                         Centers and 5 nutrition centers, creating access to health facility and contributed to the increase in hospital attendance; (viii) preparation of natural resource action plans for 152
                         communities in five watershed areas, and the establishment of replanting of 1031 hectares of degraded areas. Based on the above performance, it is likely that the development
                         objectives of the project will be achieved.
