                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The overall goal of the project is to reduce poverty and enhance the quality of life of beneficiary rural communities. The objective is to strengthen the capacity of
                         rural communities to enhance their quality of life by improving their productive assets, rural infrastructure and access to key support services from private and
                         public sources.

                          All 458 Area Councilss being supported by the CBRDP have prepared Area Plans in a participatory manner and in line with NDPC guidelines. 455 have received funds for subproject
                         implementation and have been able to do so satisfactorily. Implementation is at various stages of completion, with 241 ACs (53%) having fully completed their projects and 214 (47%)
                         ongoing. About 93% of projects completed are in use. The support in these critical areas of the decentralization process has helped to move the National Development Action Plan
                         forward and has promoted partnership among players within the development arena.

                         The boreholes and wells have improved access to safe water to about 350,000 people in 453 communities scattered all over the country and for their livestock. The training in
                         management and maintenance for all the communities have been found useful, in that, communities are now better organized to deal with technical problems such as regular
                         maintenance of the rural water infrastructure reducing the average time lapse between breakdown and repair. There is therefore relatively longer continuous availability of safe water.
                         The rehabilitation of 340 basic school structures has provided congenial environment for over 30,000 pupils and teachers which are expected to improve learning and enrolment and
                         improve youth literacy.
                         Recorded attendance for 42 CHPS in use is 117,128 for the year 2009 agianst 2008 annual figure of 380,828 and 38,145 for 2007 (baseline of completed and in use facilities)

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         ll (100%) DAs continue to prepare their medium term development plans using participatory approaches and in line with NDPC planning guidelines and carryout.
                           procurement activities in line with the Public Procurement Act of Ghana in line with training/capacity building provided by the Project.
                          All 458 Area Councilss being supported by the CBRDP have prepared Area Plans in a participatory manner and in line with NDPC guidelines. 455 have received funds for subproject
                         implementation and have been able to do so satisfactorily. Implementation is at various stages of completion, with 241 ACs (53%) having fully completed their projects and 214 (47%)
                         ongoing. About 93% of projects completed are in use. The support in these critical areas of the decentralization process has helped to move the National Development Action Plan
                         forward and has promoted partnership among players within the development arena.

                         Restructuring History
                         There has been no restructuring to date.
