The project development objective is to\n            strengthen the capacity of rural communities to enhance\n            their quality of life by improving their productive assets,\n            rural infrastructure, and access to key support services\n            from private and public sources. The additional credit will\n            help finance the costs associated with scaling up of CBRDP\n            to reconstruct public goods in the flood-affected regions of\n            the north, and extend support for decentralized service\n            provision through the financing of basic public\n            infrastructure by local level government authorities for an\n            additional sixteen months of project implementation. The\n            additional credit will also support further capacity\n            building in relation to the expansion and extension of\n            public works activities, and in support of decentralization\n            as envisioned under the original project. Finally, the\n            additional credit will support incremental program\n            management costs related to these activities and an\n            extension of the project implementation period."}, "docdt": "2008-06-02T00:00:00Z"}
