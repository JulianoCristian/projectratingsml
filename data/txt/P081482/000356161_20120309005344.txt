   Project Context, Development Objective, and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

At the time of project appraisal, Ghana had made remarkable progress on its economic and
poverty-reduction fronts. Its overall incidence of poverty fell from 50 percent in 1992 to 43
percent in 1999. The decline in poverty had only a modest impact on inequalities among various
socioeconomic groups across the country, however. Despite improvements in social indicators,
education and health services skewed toward urban rather than rural areas. Famers in northern
Ghana were far less well off than their counterparts in the South. Poor infrastructural
development, coupled with uneven service delivery, accounted for high poverty levels in the
northern areas.

At the same time, the Government of Ghana’s decentralization process was beset with
constraints, such as issues with the accountability of District Chief Executives, problems with the
system of appointing District Assembly (DA) members, and limits in their capacity to perform
their duties effectively. The functioning of local government structures suffered from inadequate
capacity (incomplete complements of staff), weaknesses in district departments, low levels of
internally generated revenues, and planning and budgeting constraints. Ineffective relationships
and links between local authorities and central government ministries, departments, agencies,
sectoral units, development projects, and programs influenced decentralization, along with the
scope of responsibilities and reporting mechanisms, the lack of checks and balances built into the
system, and the resulting implications for accountability. Finally, the inability of assembly
committee systems to function regularly and take development-oriented decisions, as well as the
lack of opportunities and space for civil society participation, are other urgent concerns.

To address these challenges, the government developed the Ghana Poverty Reduction Strategy
(GPRS), which linked its poverty reduction targets with the Millennium Development Goals.
The GPRS underscored the government’s overarching goal of creating wealth through the
transformation of the economy to achieve growth, accelerate poverty reduction, and protect
vulnerable populations, all within the context of more decentralized governance. Implicit in this
goal is the reduction of regional economic disparities through improved access to social services
and the amelioration of extreme poverty. The GPRS was organized around the need for greater
macroeconomic stability; issues related to production, employment, and human resource
capacity; and special programs for vulnerable populations and improved governance.

The Bank’s Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) supported the government’s priority objectives
as stated in the GPRS. The CAS outlined three main strategic areas of support: (i) sustainable
growth and job creation, (ii) human development and service delivery, and (iii) governance and
empowerment.

The Community-Based Rural Development Project (CBRDP) was designed in line with the
strategic directions of GPRS and the CAS. To realize economic growth and reduce rural poverty,
the CBRDP would provide access to productive resources for its beneficiaries through the
development of rural infrastructure and through activities to develop sustainable on-farm and
nonfarm rural enterprises.


                                                1
1.2 Original Project Development Objective (PDO) and Key Indicators

The project’s development objective was to strengthen rural communities’ capacity to enhance
their quality of life by improving their productive assets, rural infrastructure, and access to key
support services from private and public sources. To achieve this objective, six PDO indicators
were established at appraisal:

    1. Eighty percent of executing and beneficiary local government units, District Planning
       Coordination Units (DCPUs), and communities undertake preparatory planning in
       accordance with National Development Planning Commission (NDPC) guidelines.
    2. Eighty percent of all participating District Assemblies (DAs) and Areal Councils (ACs)
       meet the transparency and financial accountability requirements of the Financial
       Administration Act (Act 654) and Procurement Act (Act 663).
    3. Eighty percent of all participating DAs, ACs, and communities are able to implement
       their plans and deliver services in accordance with the Local Government Act (Act 462).
    4. Eighty percent of all participating Regional Planning Coordination Units (RPCUs),
       DPCUs, ACs, and beneficiary communities are able to monitor and evaluate development
       plans.
    5. The percentage of all participating DAs and ACs whose rural populations benefit from
       micro projects supported under each of the five components.
    6. Quality of life as measured by a 15 percent improvement among 80 percent of
       beneficiaries in income and access to water, education, health facilities, and rural roads.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
    Reasons/Justification

The PDO was not revised. 1 The task team revised the key indicators to be more outcome
focused, however, when the government sought additional financing in 2008. The additional
financing was requested to reconstruct public goods in flood-affected northern Ghana, support
more decentralized provision of services by funding local government authorities, and scale up
capacity building in connection with expanding public works. The team contended that the
original Project Appraisal Document (PAD) had too many indicators (making them difficult to
measure), that the indicators focused on outputs instead of outcomes, and that there were no
causal links between certain output and outcome indicators. As part of the additional financing
and corresponding restructuring of the project, the PDO indicators were formally revised under
three broad performance benchmarks, as follows:2

    1. Enhanced productive assets:
       (a) Percentage change in value of productive assets.
       (b) Percentage change in turnover of enterprises.



1
  Although the PDO was not revised, the team corrected a minor inconsistency in the way the PDO was described in
the PAD vis-à-vis the Development Credit Agreement (see page 7 of the additional financing project paper).

      (c) Change in time spent in traveling roads repaired under the project.
   3. Access to key support services:
      (d) Gross enrolment figure.
      (e) Percentage reduction in school days cancelled because school structures could not be
      used in bad weather.
      (f) Number of people with access to safe water.
      (g) Average time lapse between breakdown and repairs of water facilities.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

The project targeted rural communities, particularly in areas with the highest incidence of
poverty as identified in two key documents: (i) the Ghana Living Standards Survey and (ii) the
Poverty Map (supported through GTZ, the German Technical Cooperation Agency). Given that
stronger institutions were considered critical to the development of rural communities, the
CBRDP sought to strengthen the capacity of decentralized administrative structures, such as the
ACs and DAs, to be more effective and functional in development in their areas of jurisdiction.
The International Development Association (IDA) funding was augmented by € 10 million (US$
13.8 million) from the Agence Française de Développement (AFD), which helped to provide the
institutional support required for revamping decentralized administrative structures in the
project’s intervention areas.

The CBRDP investments also targeted public and private service providers and built their
capacity to deliver basic services to rural communities. As noted, the investments targeted rural
populations engaged in farm and nonfarm activities to create opportunities for increasing
incomes.

1.5 Original Components

The project consisted of five components: (i) Institutional Strengthening and Capacity Building;
(ii) Infrastructure for Agricultural Development; (iii) Rural Enterprise Development and
Learning Centers; (iv) Infrastructure for Social and Human Development; and (v) Community-
Based Natural Resource Management. Each is discussed in the sections that follow.

1.5.1 Component 1: Institutional Strengthening and Capacity Building (US$ 8.52 million;
IDA US$ 7.6 million)

This component sought to support the government's wider decentralization agenda by
strengthening the capacities of government institutions (national, regional, and local) as well as
nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), community-based organizations, and specific private
and public service providers to deliver basic services effectively to rural communities. This
component provided training, public communications programs, and technical and logistical
support to enhance communities’ participation in planning and decision making. It also sought to
improve the performance of government at various levels in planning and facilitating community
development.



                                                3
1.5.2 Component 2: Infrastructure for Agricultural Development (US$ 21.90 million; IDA:
US$ 17.3 million)

The objective of this component was to provide facilities and resources to improve farm and
nonfarm activities and generally enhance socioeconomic activity in rural areas: the provision of
water for agriculture, rehabilitation and construction of feeder roads, and provision of
intermediate means of transport (such as tracks, trails, carts, tricycles) to improve access to farms
and markets. The component financed consultants’ services for engineering/design, contract
supervision, and training; it also trained beneficiary communities to maintain their facilities.

1.5.3 Component 3: Rural Enterprise Development and Learning Centers (US$ 8.37 million;
IDA: US$ 6.5 million)

This component was intended to create employment in rural communities by supporting sound
management of rural enterprises to market, process, increase the shelf life, and otherwise add
value to agricultural produce. Through training in technical and business management as well as
through financial support for upgrading and rehabilitating equipment, this component would
strengthen cooperative business activities and promote market research, business linkages, joint
ventures, and micro- and small business development. Target groups included farm and nonfarm
entrepreneurs, as well as the underemployed and unemployed in rural communities.

1.5.4 Component 4: Infrastructure for Social and Human Development (US$ 23.34 million;
IDA: US$ 18 million)

This component was designed to provide an enabling environment for learning and for delivering
health services. It supported the building or renovation of school facilities as well as community
health and nutrition centers. It also provided potable water in areas subject to waterborne
diseases to relieve the disease burden, enhance the productivity of the rural population, and
improve women’s and children’s access to clean water. The component financed the construction
of hand-dug wells, boreholes fully fitted with hand pumps, and facilities for sanitation and
hygiene.

1.5.5 Component 5: Community-Based Natural Resource Management (US$ 4.50 million;
IDA: US$ 3.9 million)

This component sought to strengthen capacity in environmental and sanitation subcommittees,
ACs, and community-based organizations to improve environmental governance and integrated
management of land and water resources. Based on information from Ghana’s 2003 land
use/cover map, the component would rehabilitate five critically degraded watershed areas,
support communities and DAs to manage degraded areas; provide support to nonfarm activities
by targeting resource collectors, processors, traders, woodcarvers, traditional medical
practitioners, wildlife traders and breeders, tree crop growers, and rural ecotourism operators.

As indicated in Section 1.3, the project’s components were not revised, but under the additional
financing requested in 2008, three activities were planned: (i) scaling up public works under
Components 2, 4, and 5; (ii) scaling up capacity building under Component 1 to respond to
flooding in northern Ghana and extending the block grant mechanisms for 16 months; and (iii)
continuing project management associated with the increased work in northern Ghana, including
the extension of the project for 12 more months. The Development Credit Agreement was
revised to reflect the scaled-up activities, and the additional financing was approved by the
Board on June 26, 2008. The reallocation of funds in support of the cost of the activities
supported under the additional financing is detailed in Table 1.

In addition to the project’s extension under the additional financing, the Government of Ghana
requested a one-year extension of the closing date from June 30, 2010 to June 30, 2011. This
extension was intended to complete activities related to: (i) rehabilitating and making spot
improvements on 71 feeder roads (466.6 kilometers); (ii) rehabilitating 463 basic school
buildings; (iii) constructing 102 institutional toilets; and (iv) conducting tracer studies for rural
enterprises. The Bank approved the extension, and June 30, 2011 became the new closing date.


1. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design, and Quality at Entry

The project was prepared very rapidly, moving from concept to appraisal between September
2003 and March 2004. The project’s cross-sectoral orientation was matched by that of the
Bank’s multisectoral task team. The team’s rigorous analysis of the sector began at the project’s
conceptual stage and produced important inputs for project appraisal, including ―Beneficiary and
Stakeholder Needs Assessment for Community-Based Natural Resource Management,‖
―Assessment of Rural Water Infrastructure Needs,‖ and ―Ghana Social Assessment Study:


                                                           5
Changing Dynamics and Capacity for Sustained Community Development and Poverty
Reduction.‖ The government team visited community demand-driven projects in Thailand and
the Kecanatan Development Project in Indonesia. Lessons from those initiatives were
incorporated into the project’s design. For example, the learning centers were modeled along the
lines of Thailand’s Social Investment Fund, whereas the lesson to build on existing institutions
for sustainability rather than to create new ones emerged from the Kecanatan experience.

The design also reflected lessons (positive and negative) from Ghana’s Village Infrastructure
Project, implemented between 1998 and 2004. 3 Like the Village Infrastructure Project, the
CBRDP involved communities in designing, implementing, and monitoring subprojects. It
incorporated a range of activities that enhanced beneficiaries’ sense of ownership and
involvement in implementation and were therefore integral to achieving the project’s
development objectives—for example, social accountability, participatory monitoring and
evaluation (M&E), and community sensitization and mobilization. Unlike the Village
Infrastructure Project, the CBRDP emphasized the decentralization of such key project
management functions as financial management, procurement, and M&E. The Village
Infrastructure Project had centralized those functions but centralization was ineffective for
addressing issues emerging from the districts and communities.

In sum, the CBRDP was designed to support national development strategies, particularly GPRS,
and the national decentralization policy. The project’s design was especially influenced by the
need to strengthen the capacity of the DAs and other decentralized units to deliver rural social
services more effectively, in accord with the government’s strategy to reduce rural poverty and
geographical disparities in the incidence of poverty.

The task team ensured that its collaboration with development partners supporting the
decentralization agenda was optimal throughout project preparation. The team consulted widely
with AFD, the Canadian International Development Agency, Danish International Development
Agency (DANIDA), the UK Department for International Development, the European Union,
the German Agency for International Cooperation (GIZ, formerly GTZ), and International Fund
for Agricultural Development (IFAD). These efforts culminated in the establishment of the
Decentralization Secretariat at the Ministry of Local Government and Rural Development
(MLGRD) and the District Development Fund. DANIDA supported the District Development
Fund, whereas AFD cofinanced the CBRDP. IFAD decided to support a similar operation in the
northern Region of Ghana, where the incidence of poverty was highest.

Risks were appropriately identified and adequate measures put in place to mitigate them. The
risks identified by the team included weak capacity within MLGRD and RPCUs, the DAs’

  The main objective of the Village Infrastructure Project was to support the government's efforts to reduce poverty
and enhance the quality of life of the rural poor through the increased transfer of technical and financial resources
for the development of basic village-level infrastructure that could be maintained by the beneficiaries. It also
supported capacity building for DAs to better plan and manage these investments. The government implemented the
project for US$ 60 million, including an IDA credit (US$ 30 million) as well as joint financing from KfW (the
German-owned development bank) (US$ 7 million), IFAD (US$ 10 million), the Government of Ghana (US$ 7.1
million), the DAs (US$ 3 million), and beneficiaries (US$ 2.9 million).


                                                         6
potential use of project funds for activities outside the project, and the lack of effective
participation by financial intermediaries. To mitigate risk arising from the lack of capacity, the
team developed and incorporated capacity-building interventions into the CBRPD’s design. To
mitigate the risk that DAs and ACs could not fully comply with the government’s procurement
law or the Bank’s procurement procedures, project staff substantially assisted DAs and ACs to
enhance their understanding of procurement procedures.

Following negotiations in April 2004, the Board approved the project on July 29, 2004. The
Development Credit Agreement was signed on August 13, 2004 and the project became effective
on November 2, 2004.

2.2 Implementation

Project implementation began in November 2004. Originally the project was scheduled to close
in February 2009. As noted, the closing date was extended to June 30, 2011 after additional
financing (US$ 22 million equivalent) was approved to scale up key activities and rehabilitate
roads damaged by severe floods in northern Ghana in 2007.

An innovative Rapid Results Initiative, introduced to jump-start implementation, contributed
immensely to the project’s success. Subprojects approved under the initiative were completed
successfully within 100 days in 48 communities and ACs where the initiative was piloted.
MLGRD also facilitated operations by assigning its staff to work closely with staff of the Project
Coordinating Unit.

The national elections of 2004 and 2008 affected project implementation, because it took some
time to appoint new District Chief Executives; until then, decisions could not be taken in
beneficiary districts, and implementation stalled. Poor understanding of the procurement law
among some newly appointed District Chief Executives prevented them from adhering to
procurement and contract management guidelines; delays occurred until the project team could
ensure that implementation was done correctly. The project placed qualified staff (engineers,
institutional development specialists, procurement specialists, and accountants) in the regions to
work closely with the RPCUs and DAs to supervise and monitor progress and address
implementation issues on a day-to-day basis. Implementation was also delayed for about three
months in 2009, when the newly elected government issued directives to halt execution of all
contracts in the country. Implementation resumed after the Bank intervened with the government
to exempt Bank-financed operations from that directive.

The project had made significant progress toward the PDO by mid-term, and the Mid-term
Review (June 4–14, 2007) gave it further impetus by identifying and resolving key issues with
the government, including: (i) the high level of consulting and operating costs (the
recommendation was to reallocate savings from civil works and unallocated funds to cover such
costs); (ii) weak adherence to the agreed terms of reference for the composition of the Project
Steering Committee and the frequency of their meetings, reporting to IDA and AFD, and
approval of annual work plans and budgets; (iii) a lack of clarity in procedural arrangements
between the CBRDP, Apex Bank, and Rural Banks, which delayed implementation of the Rural
Enterprise Development/Learning Center Component; and (iv) a significant shortfall in


                                                7
counterpart funding from the government, which inhibited the project’s ability to meet its
financial obligations to consultants and vendors. The Ministry of Finance and Economic
Planning recommended and agreed with the World Bank that the financing agreement be
amended and counterpart funding requirements be eliminated as per current Country Financing
Parameters.

The Natural Resource Management (NRM) Component also experienced initial drawbacks in
implementation, owing to limited knowledge and skills in NRM on the part of project and district
staff, the lack of a logical focal point at the district level to champion implementation of the
component, and unclear institutional arrangements involving new partners not previously known
to the project (the Regional Management Support Center and Savanna Resource Management
Center). Other issues regarding governance (of revenues), land ownership, and sustainability of
reforestation activities also affected the component’s implementation.

Several administrative and logistical factors influenced implementation as well. Although the
project built capacity among administrative staff in the DAs and ACs, most could not be retained
owing to frequent turnover and staff rotations. Incorrect and inadequate filing of documentation
impeded implementation of community projects. Logistical constraints limited supervision in
many districts; because the project was not designed to facilitate logistics for district staff, the
effectiveness of supervision in some areas was affected. Untimely financial reporting also
affected supervision and reporting. The inability of district staff to provide financial reports on
time sometimes affected disbursement.

The CBRDP did a lot for rural people in Ghana, but little of its impact is known to the general
public because the project’s communications strategy was implemented inadequately. For
instance, CBRDP subprojects, funded through block grants to the Metropolitan, Municipal, and
District Assemblies, were either branded poorly or not at all, making it difficult to get
beneficiaries to speak on behalf of subprojects. Sometimes DA representatives found it difficult
to differentiate between activities (especially the installation of boreholes) funded by the CBRDP
and by others.

As mentioned, the Bank’s Executive Directors approved additional financing in 2008 to
reconstruct flood-damaged infrastructure and expand support to the decentralization effort; the
project’s closing date was then extended from February 15, 2009 to June 30, 2010. All
subsequent implementation supervision missions and independent beneficiary assessments noted
significant, satisfactory progress in implementation, but the closing date had to be extended once
again for all activities to be completed. The request for extension was based on the fact that new
public officials (particularly District Chief Executives) appointed after the 2004 and 2008
general elections had little or no knowledge of the public procurement law and their actions
initially stalled project activities temporally until all the newly appointed DCEs were trained to
understand the public procurement law and procedures. Subsequent joint missions by the Bank
and government reviewed progress, agreed on a realistic work and procurement plan, and
recommended that the project’s closing date be extended to June 30, 2011.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation Design, Implementation, and Utilization

The CBRDP implemented an M&E system focused appropriately on results. At appraisal, the
task team prepared a detailed results framework with key results indicators to monitor progress
toward the PDO. The project team also developed an M&E manual that emphasized a results-
based approach and served as a guide to monitoring progress. As noted, the indicators were
considered to be too numerous, and appeared to measure outputs rather than outcomes; the task
team reviewed the indicators and developed a performance review plan and data collection
instruments for selected indicators. The indicators were formally revised as part of the
processing of the additional financing in May 2008. The team reduced the number of indicators
and aligned them with the PDO. The revised indicators significantly improved data collection.

The project team used a sample approach to collect data, which significantly enhanced
implementation of the M&E framework. The CBRDP zonal implementation team liaised
effectively with DA staff in all data collection efforts. M&E reporting suffered some setbacks,
however, owing to differences in reporting mechanisms: The project team used the mechanism
specified in the M&E operations manual, whereas the DAs used the government’s reporting
system. The inconsistency in reporting led to undue delays.

To improve reporting and overall performance of the M&E system, the project collaborated with
the NDPC to harmonize M&E at the district level by developing district M&E guidelines. The
NDPC used the guidelines to train DA staff to prepare M&E plans and effectively monitor and
evaluate their activities.

Participatory M&E was integral to implementing M&E for the project, which organized training
of trainers programs for Regional Coordinating Council staff. The training was meant to increase
their understanding of the need for and use of participatory M&E at the community level to
improve social accountability. The Regional Coordinating Council staff in turn trained district
teams, who then trained beneficiary communities in the practical application of participatory
M&E concepts. The trained communities now use participatory M&E techniques in
implementing their subprojects, with the result that infrastructure subprojects of good quality
have been completed, and community ownership of the infrastructure has improved.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

2.4.1 Safeguard compliance
Based on environmental and safeguard assessments, the project was rated a Category B project.
The project triggered two safeguard policies: Environmental Assessment (OP 4.01) and
Involuntary Resettlement (OP 4.12). An Environmental Assessment identified measures to
mitigate negative environmental impacts that could arise from implementing some subprojects.
In response to these triggered policies, the government prepared an Environmental and Social
Management Framework and a Resettlement Policy Framework to address any potential
environmental, social, or resettlement issues, establish systems for consultation and redressing
grievances, identify potential environmental and social challenges and impacts, and specify how
to address them.



                                               9
Constant follow-up by the Bank team and effective collaboration with project teams ensured that
the project encountered no major safeguard issues. At mid-term, the project had complied fully
with safeguard policies, and no serious adverse impact was identified. All land acquired for
implementing subprojects was properly and voluntarily released by traditional community rulers
or the respective DA. These acquisitions were backed by proper documentation in compliance
with OP 4.12. No involuntary resettlement, displacement, or relocation occurred as a result of the
project. Minor concerns, such as ensuring safety at construction sites, were addressed fully.

Following the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding between the Project Coordinating
Unit and Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the project team developed good working
relations with the EPA staff and therefore understood procedures for complying with EPA
requirements. To extend this knowledge to all participating DAs, the project supported the EPA
to provide hands-on training in environmental screening, including social issues, for DA staff.
The project also provided financial support to the DAs for obtaining EPA permits and
implementing the conditions for the permits. These actions and outcomes have benefited other
Bank-supported projects, like the Ghana Social Opportunities Project and the Local Government
Capacity Support Project.

2.4.2 Fiduciary compliance
Throughout implementation, the project complied with the requirement to submit annual audit
reports. The more recent reports were submitted on the due dates, had unqualified audit opinions,
and were acceptable to IDA. Internal control weaknesses in zonal and district offices have been a
recurrent issue, highlighting a general weakness of government public financial management
systems at the subnational (DA) level. The most current audit report was received on June 21,
2011, within six months after the end of the fiscal year as specified in the Financing Agreement.

As discussed, procurement was initially constrained, particularly at the DA level, by weak
capacity and poor understanding of World Bank procurement procedures. The project’s
innovative response—placing procurement specialists in all regions—immensely smoothed
implementation. The project’s significant contributions to building capacity in public
procurement in decentralized units also improved the capacity for good governance at the local
level. Overall, no fiduciary issue posed a significant threat to project implementation.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

No follow-on operation to the CBRDP has been planned, although the Government of Ghana
expressed interest in another phase of the project through a letter to the Bank. The government is
interested in consolidating and deepening the gains from the project by improving the
capabilities of local government units, particularly in poorer districts, to provide social services,
narrow the geographical differences in the incidence of poverty, and strengthen the base for
long-term development of Ghana’s rural communities. The IFAD Country Program Manager has
indicated that IFAD would consider partnering with the Bank in an operation similar to the
CBRDP, if the Bank would cofinance it.

The Bank currently supports the Government of Ghana through two new projects that also work
with decentralized structures, although these projects were not designed as follow-ons to the


                                                 10
CBRDP. The Local Government Capacity Support Project, targeting Metropolitan and Municipal
Assemblies, seeks to strengthen the intergovernmental fiscal framework, strengthen local public
financial management and accountability for improved infrastructure and services in urban
assemblies, and improve citizens’ engagement with urban assemblies and their perceptions of
urban management. The Ghana Social Opportunities Project, directed at Ghana’s poorest
districts, seeks to improve targeting in social protection spending, increase access to conditional
cash transfers nationwide, increase access to employment and cash-earning opportunities for the
rural poor during the agricultural off-season, and improve economic and social infrastructure in
target districts.

2. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design, and Implementation

The project’s overall objective is as relevant now as it was at appraisal, given that the
government seeks to deepen decentralization at all levels, following passage of the Local
Government Service Act (656 2003). The CBRDP was coordinated with other development
partners to enhance donor support for implementing the Government of Ghana’s
Decentralization Policy Framework and assure synergy.4 The project’s objectives, design, and
implementation were fully consistent with the decentralization agenda spelled out in the policy,
and it supported activities that were highly relevant to the national response to rural poverty. The
project’s specific measures were also appropriate and fully consistent with the decentralization
policy and the strategic orientation of the GPRS and CAS. The focus on providing access to
productive resources for beneficiaries by developing rural infrastructure as well as sustainable
on-farm and nonfarm rural enterprises contributes to economic growth and rural poverty
reduction.5

The CBRDP effectively followed the decentralization strategy and supported the operational
mechanisms for its implementation by ensuring that the respective Metropolitan, Municipal, and
District Assemblies and other decentralized entities were strengthened to play their respective
roles as enshrined in the Local Government Act, 1993. The project strengthened capacities of the
national and regional planning coordination units; ACs; and the Metropolitan, Municipal, and
District Assemblies. At the community level, the project was instrumental in building capacity in
targeted local community institutions, such as the Unit Committees, School Management
Committees, and Community Water and Sanitation Committees.

In 2007, the Government of Ghana launched a countrywide exercise for preparing District
Medium Term Development Plans. The project supported this effort by building the capacities of
all the DAs and selected ACs to prepare development plans, particularly by supporting: (i) the



4
   Decentralization Policy Framework: Accelerating Decentralization and Local Governance for National
Development, 2010, MLGRD, Accra.
5
  According to a 2007 Ghana Living Standard Survey report, Ghana’s national poverty rate fell from 52 percent in
1992 to 29 percent in 2006. Poverty reduction was particularly impressive in rural areas, where the overall poverty
rate fell from 62 percent in 1991 to 39 percent in 2006.


                                                        11
NDPC to prepare (train) DAs in the guidelines for formulating District Medium Term
Development Plans; (ii) the Accountant General’s Department to prepare a financial manual for
government Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs) and (iii) the National Public
Procurement Authority to develop a procurement manual and train DAs in its use. The project
also provided resources to implement the districts’ medium-term plans.

3.2. Achievement of Project Development Objectives

The CBRDP largely achieved its development objective. The project’s investments helped
strengthen capacity in rural institutions and improved rural livelihoods. Local government
structures, particularly the DAs and ACs, acquired substantial capacity in planning,
implementing, and monitoring projects derived from their local development and investment
plans. The project also significantly improved the rural poor’s access to social services such as
schools, health centers, and potable water.6

The achievement of the PDO is measured by seven key performance indicators categorized
under three broad themes: enhanced productive assets, enhanced rural infrastructure, and access
to key support services from public and private sources. The agreed performance indicators
capture the intentions of the project objective. The CBRDP succeeded in achieving all of the
outcome indicators. The following section assesses the achievement of agreed PDO performance
indicators (see Annex 2 for a review of project outputs by component).

3.2.1 Enhanced productive assets
This set of performance indicators measured improvements in the growth of rural enterprises that
were able to upgrade and expand their facilities. The first indicator, which was fully achieved,
was a change in value of at least 5 percent for 70 percent of the supported enterprises. The
project promoted development of the private sector in rural areas by establishing learning centers
for entrepreneurial and business development skills. Through the project, 79 percent (957 of
1,210) of learning center trainees received support to set up their own businesses. The project
provided Ȼ 5.9 million (US$ 3.7 million) in microcredit to 5,289 enterprises (learning centers,
learning center trainees, and microenterprises) to improve their productive assets. This effort
increased the value of assets by an average of 27 percent in a sample of enterprises.

The second indicator, also fully achieved, was a change of at least 5 percent in the turnover of
the supported enterprises. The average increase in turnover was 21 percent in a sample of
enterprises.

3.2.2 Enhanced rural infrastructure
This performance indicator measured the effects of rehabilitating and maintaining feeder roads as
a reduction of at least 75 percent in time spent traveling. This indicator was fully achieved. The
project rehabilitated 195 feeder roads covering about 1,277 kilometers. These improved roads
helped to reduce the average time spent traveling from a baseline of 15 minutes per kilometer to
4 minutes per kilometer by the end of the project. They also increased rural dwellers’ access to


6
    The Beneficiary Assessment Study, conducted in May 2011, highlights significant outcomes of the project.


                                                          12
social and economic facilities and services, improved the transport of agricultural inputs to farms
and of food and cash crops to markets, and increased the number of vehicles plying the roads
from an average of three per market day to nine per day.

3.2.3 Access to key support services from public and private sources
This set of performance indicators involved changes in school enrolment and schooling days, and
sustainable access to safe drinking water through the construction and rehabilitation of schools
and water points in rural communities. The first indicator, which was fully achieved, was the
percentage change in gross school enrolment for target communities. Table 2 shows year-to-
year improvements in gross enrolment as a result of CBRDP investments. Overall gross
enrolment increased from a baseline of 20 percent to nearly 41 percent by the end of the project,
meeting the target of a 20 percent increase. The construction and rehabilitation of 458 basic
schools greatly contributed to removing a large number of Ghana’s ―schools under trees‖ and
created a convenient learning atmosphere for more than 60,000 students per school year.

Table 2: Percentage Change in Gross Enrolment by School Year
                                                                    School Year
                                               2006/07       2007/08        2008/09      2009/10
Pupils enrolled (number)                        50,857        56,023         58,747      61,434
Gross enrolment (baseline, %)                     20            –                 –         –
Gross enrolment (actual, %)                          –         30.2           35.5         40.8
Change in gross enrolment (%)                        –         10.2           15.5         20.8

The second indicator, which was also achieved, was the percentage reduction in school days
cancelled because school structures could not be used in bad weather. The improvement of
school structures to withstand bad weather dramatically reduced the number of school days
canceled because of bad weather from a yearly average of 15 to zero, thereby meeting the target
of a 99 percent reduction.

The third indicator was an increase of at least 200 percent over the baseline in the number of
people with access to safe water. This indicator was fully achieved through the provision of
1,676 water points (boreholes). At baseline, only 117,711 people in rural areas had access to
potable water; the new boreholes provided safe drinking water to 421,315 people in 453
communities, representing a 257.9 percent increase in access to safe water. Access to safe,
drinkable water significantly reduced waterborne diseases in communities where the CBRDP
intervened.

The final indicator was the average time elapsing between breakdowns and repairs of water
facilities. This indicator was fully achieved. The CBRDP investments in water infrastructure led
to an average of 1.5 days between breakdowns and repairs, below the target of 2 days.

3.3 Efficiency

The CBRDP investments have proven to be very efficient. A financial and economic analysis of
randomly selected activities showed that beneficiaries derived substantial financial and economic


                                                13
benefits from the project’s investments, with positive net present values (NPV) and high
economic rates of return (ERR). Focusing on three key areas of intervention—investments in
developing rural enterprises, education, and health—the analysis clearly shows that the
CBRDP’s investments were highly cost efficient and socially responsible (see Annex 3 for a
more detailed discussion of these results).

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Satisfactory. Taking into consideration the relevance of the PDO, project design, and
implementation as well as achievement of the development objectives, and efficiency, the overall
project outcome is rated satisfactory. All key performance indicators were fully achieved, and
most exceeded their targets. These achievements were obtained within a reasonable budget and
with a high level of efficiency.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes, and Impacts

3.5.1 Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
Impacts on small businesses. The component supporting rural enterprise development and
learning centers enhanced small business owners’ understanding of doing business and
substantially improved their business skills. Box 1 summarizes key outcomes of the project’s
support to small businesses. The majority now know how to keep proper business records and
build downstream networks. Many small businesses also added value to their products; for
example, a grasscutter and mushroom production business in Twimia Nkwanta (BenCom) started
to process mushrooms into powder, prepare mushroom pepper sauce (shito) for marketing, and
trained 20 chefs to use mushrooms in variety of dishes. BenCom significantly increased its
monthly production of mushroom spawn from 12,000 to 20,000, and it supplies over 3,000
mushroom farmers with oyster mushroom bags and spawn. The expansion of production created
new jobs within the enterprise (the staff increased from 7 to 12 employees).

Box 1: Results of the CBRDP’s support for small business development
Knowledge transfer to rural entrepreneurs. The CBRDP provided technical and business management training in
simple bookkeeping, packaging, marketing, and other skills to rural entrepreneurs engaged in various lines of
production, including making cassava flour, biscuits, bread, confectionary, and pomade; bead decoration; weaving
kente cloth; raising pigs, bees, snails, grasscutters, and rabbits; and growing mushrooms. The intention was to
improve beneficiaries’ entrepreneurial skills so that they could offer training and support to others and create
multiplier benefits in rural areas. Improved facilities for small businesses. The CBRDP, through Rural Banks,
provided financing to small business to upgrade their facilities. For example, in Zone 4, the Tornyeli Community
Women Development Association (TOCOWODEA) in the Hohoe Municipal Assembly received funding to build a
structure to produce cassava flour and biscuits; Tabitha Vocational Centre in Ga West Municipal Assembly received
funding for upgrading hostel facilities to house its trainees. In Zone 2, the BenCom grasscutter and mushroom
production enterprise in Twimia Nkwanta (Techiman Municipality in the Brong Ahafo Region) upgraded its
premises with a building for grasscutters, a spawn and incubating house, fencing, a mushroom fruiting house, and a
conference room that sometimes also lodges trainees. A grasscutter rearing and snail farming center in Bekwai
Municipality in Ashanti Region received support to upgrade its hand-dug well and cages for rearing animals. In
Zone 3, the Eddiebay Kente Weaving Centre and Bee Keepers Association in Twifo-Heman Lower Denkyira
District received support to upgrade their facilities. In Bibiani Anhwiaso Bekwai District, the Centre for Improved
Animal Production System, among others, received financial support to build simple but practical housing for pigs.




                                                        14
Growth in the networks of business entrepreneurs. Rural enterprises that benefited from the CBRDP’s capacity
support have become learning centers for trainees, who are either attached to the enterprises and thus serve as part of
the production network or have been supported to set up their own businesses. For example, BenCom, which used to
train 200 people per year, now trains 400–600, and trainees come from different parts of Ghana. Twenty initial
trainees under the CBRDP received financial support to build structures and start their own farms. For example, at
Kpeve Tornu in the Ho Municipal Assembly, Nutifafa Farming and Processing Group (a farming group) received
support to purchase a cassava mill to produce raw material for sale to TOCOWODEA to process into cassava flour
and make biscuits. Other individuals were trained in biscuit making and supported with materials to set up their own
businesses. Though the latter group of trainees is not yet fully established, they demonstrate the multiplier effects of
CBRDP support to rural enterprises and their potential impact on poverty reduction in rural areas.

Impacts on incomes. The project’s support to learning centers and provision of financial support
to trainees had positive impacts on their livelihoods. Most learning center trainees have
established their own businesses, which operate at full capacity. BenCom now trains between
400 and 600 people annually. The project financially supported an initial group of 20 trainees to
build structures for their own farm enterprises (Box 1). Business ownership significantly boosted
beneficiaries’ incomes. The project’s support to farmers in northern Ghana enabled them to farm
year-round, increased their incomes, and helped to reduce poverty across districts and within
particular communities.

Impacts on gender. The project benefited a substantial number of women compared to men. The
rehabilitation and construction of feeder roads increased the average number of vehicles plying
the roads on market days by 200 percent, from a baseline of three vehicles to nine. This
intervention benefited about 289,901 persons—124,591 men (44 percent) and 160,320 women
(56 percent). The construction of Community-Based Health Planning Service (CHPS)
compounds benefited 92,278 people—40,382 men (44 percent) and 51,726 women (56 percent).
The project built the capacity of 170 DAs to conduct participatory planning in accordance with
NDPC guidelines. This intervention benefited more than 469,151 people, and it is gratifying to
note that 40 percent (185,569) were female. The project also improved conditions for learning in
selected schools across the country for over 385,537 people, of whom 158,718 (41 percent) were
female and 226,670 (59 percent) male.

Impacts on children and teachers. The project transformed the lives of children and parents in
the areas where it operated. The provision of good classrooms increased both children’s and
teachers’ interest in school. They feel safer in the new classrooms. School enrolment and
performance increased significantly. According to the beneficiary assessment survey, school
enrolment in Adjoafour (in Bia District, Western Region) increased from 120 to 150 students.
BECE examination scores improved at schools where students previously scored zero. A case in
point is Wuwuso Damang District Assembly Junior High School (in Wasa Amenfi District,
Western Region), where 74 percent (23 of 31 students) passed the examination after none had
passed in 2006–08.

Impacts on health status. The CHPS had been run in small, rented, and often dilapidated
premises. Indeed, many communities lacked it. The CHPS compounds established under the
project improved community healthcare delivery throughout the project’s areas of operation and
reduced the distance that s residents had to travel before they could access health services. The
provision of CHPS improved key health indicators such as the number of births attended by



                                                          15
skilled staff, the maternal mortality rate, the prevalence of contraceptive use, and incidence of
diarrhea.

Impacts on access to water and improved sanitation. The project provided boreholes to
beneficiary communities; about 86 percent of these water points were situated within a
reasonable distance of the communities, increasing their access to good drinking water.
Improved water quality helped to reduce such waterborne diseases as guinea worm and diarrheal
illnesses. The construction of toilets reduced walking distances to toilet facilities and also
reduced the potential for disease outbreaks.

3.5.2 Institutional change/strengthening
In support of the government’s decentralization agenda, the project transformed institutions
throughout the country, especially at the district level and below. More specifically, the project:
     Strengthened communities’ project implementation capacity. The project revitalized
       subdistrict structures and helped make most ACs functional. ACs can now prepare work
       plans and use them to implement their subprojects. Through the DAs and Regional
       Coordinating Councils, the project provided matching grants, backstopping, and
       monitoring to the ACs. It trained and empowered communities to implement projects at
       subdistrict levels. ACs gained a better understanding of their roles and responsibilities in
       the development process and improved their performance levels. Communities are now
       better managed, administered, and mobilized for development activities.
     Built the capacity of ACs in participatory planning. The project also introduced
       participatory planning, project implementation, and management skills at the district
       level. For more than 458 ACs, the project organized training in participatory planning
       and management, fiduciary procedures (procurement and financial management),
       contract management, and administration. This new knowledge empowered communities
       to play active roles in district and subdistrict development. Participatory planning and
       management training also enhanced ACs’ capacity to prepare area plans in a participatory
       manner, in accordance with NDPC guidelines, and to handle procurement as required
       under the Public Procurement Act.
     Strengthened water and sanitation institutions. In support of the national policy to ensure
       community ownership and management of water facilities, the project helped
       beneficiaries form facility management committees. Through NGOs and staff of the DAs,
       the project organized and trained the committees to operate and maintain their water
       facilities. These committees are now functional and perform operation and maintenance
       in the communities.
     Strengthened the capacity of School Management Committees. In conjunction with the
       Ghana Education Service, the project supported the formation and training of School
       Management Committees and Parent Teacher Associations in selected districts. The
       capacities of those committees and associations improved, and they play active roles in
       their respective communities’ development programs.

3.6 Summary of Findings of the Beneficiary Assessment Survey

A beneficiary assessment survey conducted to evaluate the project found that beneficiaries were
generally conversant and very satisfied with the support they received from the project. Findings
of the assessment can be broken into two parts: improvements in institutional capacity, especially
in support of decentralization, and direct benefits to the beneficiaries.

3.6.1 Improvement in institutional capacity to support decentralization
At the national level, the project supported institutions directly involved in implementing the
decentralization program. It enabled the NDPC to train DAs, especially in the guidelines for
formulating District Medium Term Development Plans. It also assisted the Accountant General’s
Department to prepare a financial manual for the Ministries Departments and Agencies (MDAs)
and the National Public Procurement Authority in the development of a procurement manual and
training of DAs.

At the regional level, the project trained staff of RPCUs in procurement, contract management,
monitoring, and evaluation for district projects. The project provided additional technical
training to education and health workers so that they could train district and local communities in
managing school and health facilities. The majority of RPCU staff confirmed that the training
enhanced their understanding of procedures for tendering and contract management and that they
could respond more quickly to DAs’ requests for help in preparing tenders. The training greatly
improved the quality of public tenders.

At the district level, the project provided technical and financial support to the Metropolitan,
Municipal, and District Assemblies. District Planning Officers who received training in
procurement and financial management indicated that their understanding of those processes had
deepened. DPCU staff also significantly improved their knowledge of procurement, which
enabled DPCUs and RPCUs to work together more efficiently on procurement processes for the
benefit of local communities. The project also built DPCUs’ capacity in project management,
including community empowerment, community socialization, rural poverty reduction, effective
local governance, and social accountability. In sum, these efforts improved the DPCUs’ capacity
to deliver services efficiently to the communities.

At the subdistrict level, the project increased the ACs’ involvement in providing physical
infrastructure to communities. It trained subdistrict institutions in participatory identification of
community projects, community mobilization, planning, implementation, and management. The
project also trained 48 ACs to use the Rapid Results Initiative, enabling them to implement
projects and achieve results in 100 days. The project’s capacity building helped the ACs to
provide effective oversight for participatory decision making, planning, and project
implementation in their jurisdictions.

At the community level, the project also provided targeted capacity building. Recipients included
Unit Committees, School Management Committees, and Community Water and Sanitation
Committees.




                                                 17
3.6.2 Direct benefits to the project’s beneficiaries
The project increased communities’ access to physical and social infrastructure by building and
rehabilitating feeder roads, providing educational and health infrastructure, and providing
facilities for safe drinking water and improved sanitation.

More specifically, the rehabilitation and construction of feeder roads improved marketing of
goods and access to key social services. There is ready transport for traders to market centers.
Health services have improved as sick and expectant mothers can be sent to hospitals more easily
in emergencies. Health professionals regularly visit communities for important outreach
programs such as immunizations and health education.

The provision of spacious classrooms created an enabling environment for students and
teachers. School enrolment and attendance have increased in the majority of schools. Schools
formerly running a single stream are now running a double stream. Academic performance
improved at some schools, where more students passed their basic certificate examination
(BECE).

The provision of health infrastructure in the form of CHPS compounds significantly improved
health service delivery. Along with easier access to health services, the delivery of those services
is supervised by qualified health professionals. Health personnel now have better living quarters,
visit communities regularly, and have intensified health education and outreach programs.

The provision of more boreholes increased access to potable water and community toilet
facilities. As a result, the incidence of diseases caused by poor water and sanitation has fallen
substantially.


3. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcomes
Rating: Low

The overall risk to the project’s development outcome and sustainability is rated low, given the
high level of ownership at all levels, the low fiduciary risk to the project’s investments, and the
low risks related to social and environmental safeguards. This conclusion is supported by the
assessments for specific areas of risk that follow.

The institutional risk to development outcomes is rated low. Institutional development arising
from the project was substantial. The project helped build capacity to make the Regional
Coordinating Councils, Metropolitan, Municipal, and District Assemblies and ACs more
effective and functional in discharging their duties. At the district and community levels, the
competency built by the project in financial management, procurement, and project management,
including coordination with different actors, makes the institutional risk to the development
outcome very low. The project’s support for implementing District Medium Term Development
Plans improved planning and budgeting capacities in DAs and ACs. The project helped the ACs
to prepare area plans used as inputs into the Medium Term Development Plans. Within
beneficiary communities, the project created a sense of ownership and empowerment that will
undoubtedly sustain development outcomes.


                                                18
The economic and financial risk to development outcomes is moderate. In assessing quality at
entry, the project team identified three key risks that could negatively affect the achievement of
development outcomes. The financial management risks were mitigated by placing qualified
financial management experts in all project regions. Except for delays in the district counterpart
funds, no problem occurred with fund flow. All audit reports were prepared and submitted on
time. The risk of weak government capacity was addressed during implementation, given that
capacity building was integral to the project and that regional, district, and local capacity to plan
and manage projects improved substantially. The risk that financial intermediaries would not
participate in executing district financial services was addressed during implementation. Rural
Banks, under the umbrella of Apex Bank, participated fully in transferring funds to beneficiaries,
which greatly enhanced implementation of the project’s rural enterprise development
component. The financial and economic analysis of the project found substantial socioeconomic
impacts and benefits, with a high benefit-cost ratio (BCR) and positive NPV.

The environmental risk to development outcomes is low. The environmental and social
assessment undertaken at appraisal classified the CBRDP as a Category B project; it triggered
two safeguard policies (Environmental Assessment and Involuntary Resettlement). The very
minimal safeguard issues encountered during implementation were addressed effectively by the
project team, making the related risk to development outcomes low.

The social risk to development outcomes is moderately low. The project significantly improved
beneficiaries’ quality of life and contributed to Millennium Development Goals such as the
alleviation of poverty. The social and human development institutions put in place at the
community level should sustain the development outcomes, but the sustainability of those
institutions depends on the communities and government.

The infrastructural risk to development outcomes is moderate. The project’s investments in
building and rehabilitating agricultural and social infrastructure were well targeted, relatively
inexpensive, and required only modest costs for operation and maintenance. Yet the
sustainability of the infrastructure that improves communities’ access to education, health
services, water, markets, and slaughterhouses depends on communities’ ability to undertake its
routine maintenance. To enhance the prospects for sustaining infrastructure, particularly for
social development subprojects, beneficiary communities were trained to develop facility
management plans. Based on those plans, resources will be raised locally for routine
maintenance of infrastructure.


4. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

5.1.1 Bank performance in ensuring quality at entry
Rating: Satisfactory




                                                 19
The Bank’s performance in project identification, preparation, and appraisal is satisfactory. The
project was well conceived. It emphasized the capacity building and other forms of institutional
support needed at all levels to support Ghana’s decentralization agenda. The design was
straightforward, with simple, achievable targets. To prepare the project, the Bank mobilized a
highly competent cross-sectoral team with the range of skills to cover the project’s technical and
institutional requirements. The team moved project preparation smoothly from concept to
effectiveness without delay. Good coordination in support of the government’s decentralization
agenda culminated in AFD cofinancing the project with the Bank.

The team’s counterparts from government were assisted to visit Bank-supported projects in
Indonesia and Thailand that offered lessons to improve the design of the CBRDP. The team’s
financial management specialists examined the key issues highlighted in the 2003 Public
Expenditure and Financial Accountability report and instituted corresponding financial
management and disbursement arrangements to enhance the CBRDP’s efficiency. The placement
of qualified fiduciary experts in the four regions where the project operated was a key innovation
that aided the project’s successful implementation.

5.1.2 Quality of supervision
Rating: Satisfactory

The Bank’s performance in supervision is rated satisfactory. The Bank team paid great attention
to the quality of supervision; with the government and AFD, it organized and undertook no fewer
than 13 joint implementation support (supervision) missions. The missions involved teams with
the skill mix to identify and address any implementation issues observed. The missions enabled
prompt resolution of key implementation issues through clearly defined agreements with the
government. The Bank also organized a Mid-term Review mission, which was essential to assess
progress and take decisions on particular activities. For example, the team identified the causes
of delays in implementing the NRM component and made corresponding recommendations for
improvement. A joint technical supervision mission organized by the Bank in October 2007
discussed ways of assisting the government to respond quickly to the destructive flooding in
northern Ghana; the resulting recommendations to government resulted in the Bank’s additional
financing to the project. As noted, the new government’s 2009 moratorium on all projects kept
project implementation on hold for about three months; a remarkable intervention by the Bank
prevented a more prolonged delay by exempting the CBRDP subprojects.

5.1.3 Justification for rating overall Bank performance
Overall Bank performance is rated satisfactory. To recapitulate, project preparation was smooth
and fast, the project’s objective was sound, and the project supported clearly focused activities
aligned with the government’s decentralization agenda. The Bank was assiduous in supervising
implementation and offering appropriate recommendations for improvement.

5.2 Borrower Performance

5.2.1 Government performance
Rating: Satisfactory



                                               20
Government performance is rated satisfactory, based on the government’s high degree of
commitment to the project, clear sense of project ownership, and responsiveness in all related
matters at all stages, from project identification, design, and preparation to completion. The
government provided material resources (government strategies) relevant to the preparation team
and ensured that the intervention continuously supported the decentralization and rural poverty
reduction agenda. The government ensured that all effectiveness conditions were met quickly
and facilitated the launching of the project. During implementation, the government maintained
good working relationships with the Bank team, AFD team, and Project Coordinating Unit staff,
and it supported the organization of all supervision missions. The government also supported the
Project Coordinating Unit to play its role effectively and ensure the implementation of agreed
actions after every supervision mission. The government could not ensure consistent allocation
and release of the counterpart funds for project activities, however. The delay in releasing the 10
percent counterpart funds initially inhibited smooth implementation of some subprojects at
district and community levels.

5.2.2 Implementation agency or agencies’ performance
Rating: Satisfactory

The implementation agency’s performance is rated satisfactory. Project Coordinating Unit
personnel were highly committed to achieving the envisaged development outcomes and worked
tirelessly to ensure substantial progress. With their strong background from the Village
Infrastructure Project, members of the Project Coordinating Unit participated fully and
significantly in project preparation. During implementation, the Project Coordinating Unit placed
its experts close to project sites, where they assisted immensely in resolving issues regarding
planning, financial management, procurement, and participatory M&E. The unit established a
sound M&E system to track project activities and progress related to outcome indicators;
organized and coordinated supervision missions; and established good working relations with the
government (with the Chief Director as the focal point). The unit maintained proper records and
reporting systems for the project’s fiduciary and physical progress, managing and disbursing all
project funds satisfactorily (in fact, the project was judged to be one of the best performing
projects in a World Bank Country Portfolio Performance Review in 2009). The Project
Coordinating Unit’s lack of expertise in NRM favored implementation of the other four
components in relation to the NRM component, however.

5.2.3 Justification for rating overall borrower performance
Rating: Satisfactory

The overall performance of the Borrower has been rated satisfactory. The Borrower
demonstrated a high level of commitment to project objectives and ensured that the project
stayed on course to achieve all its outcome indicators. Throughout implementation, the project
complied with all legal covenants satisfactorily. Financial audit reports were submitted when
due. All audit reports had unqualified audit opinions and were acceptable to IDA.


5. Lessons Learned



                                                21
Effective communication is the key to promoting development outcomes. The CBRDP achieved
a plethora of successes but only minimally disseminated that information to the general public.
Future projects of a similar nature should incorporate a communications component with funding
for the project to engage a communications specialist who, as part of the project team, effectively
disseminates information and builds capacity to do so at all levels.

Inject awareness of NRM at the community level by having natural resource department in
the DAs. Because demand for NRM related sub-projects is low at the local level for lack of
awareness. The NRM component suffered setbacks in implementation owing to the lack of
capacity and ownership at the district and community levels. . The CBRDP supported the EPA in
developing a training manual that could be used to strengthen the capacity of district staff in
environmental and natural resources.

Effective relationships among development partners and good donor collaboration and
harmonization are paramount to the successful implementation of a decentralized project. The
strong relationship and collaboration between the Bank and AFD provided impetus to project
implementation. In future, more donors should be brought on board to support the government’s
efforts to establish robust decentralized systems.

Inexperience among Rural Banks and project staff with the lending promoted by the project,
as well as the lack of business skills among clients, posed challenges for implementing
component 3 (see Annex 3). The impact would have been considerable if the scheme had
targeted, developed, and promoted a few selected enterprises in the regions and districts in an
initial pilot scheme for eventual scale-up. .


Decentralizing project management functions up to the zone and regional levels was very
instrumental in ensuring smooth implementation of the project. The CBRDP placed
technically qualified staff, including accountants, procurement specialist, M&E specialists, and
engineers in all the project’s regions. This allowed the specialists to closely monitor, supervise,
and resolve issues on day-to-day basis with the districts’ staff. It also allowed the specialists to
develop the capacity of the districts’ staff in financial management, procurement, M&E etc..

Annex 2. Outputs by Component

Component 1: Institutional Strengthening and Capacity Building
This component financed activities aimed at strengthening capacities at different levels of local
government, in private and public institutions, and in NGOs to deliver basic services to rural
communities. Achievements under this component are rated satisfactory. Table 2.1 presents the
agreed intermediate performance and output indicators that relate to this component.

Table 2.1: Key Intermediate Performance and Output Indicators for Component 1
Indicator                                                           Baseline     Target      Actual Value
                                                                                              Achieved
1. Percentage of participating DAs implementing their plans and      80%          100%          100%
delivering services devolved to them in accordance with LGA 462
2. Percentage of participating ACs (and communities)                 13.7%     100% of 454   454 (100%)
implementing their plans and delivering services devolved to them                 ACs
in accordance with LGA 462
3. Percentage of participating DAs and ACs meeting the                0%          100%          100%
requirements of the Procurement Act
4. Percentage of participating DAs and ACs meeting the financial     0.0%         100%          100%
accountability requirements of the Financial Administration and
Internal Audit Agency Act

Under this component, the project achieved its target of building capacity in participatory
planning in 170 DAs. All DAs can prepare and implement their Medium Term Development
Plans in accordance with LGA 462; this effort benefitted about 469,151 people, including
283,582 men (60 percent) and 185,569 women (40 percent). At the subdistrict level, the project
trained all 454 ACs in participatory planning (compared to the baseline of 13.7 percent).

The component’s target of building capacity in 100 percent of DAs and ACs (170 DAs and 454
ACs) to undertake procurement activities in accordance with Ghana’s Public Procurement Act
663 was fully achieved (the baseline was zero). All the DAs and ACs can prepare procurement
plans and perform key procurement activities, including preparing procurement notices and
publishing them in national dailies, undertaking tender evaluations, and keeping proper records
of all procurement activities.

The project achieved virtually all of the 100 percent target of helping DAs and ACs meet the
financial management accountability requirements of Ghana’s Financial Administration and
Internal Audit Act 2003. At the end of the project, 99 percent of the 170 DAs and 458 ACs could
use the standard financial management reporting format. DAs lack training in using the
harmonized Chart of Accounts, however; at least 90 percent have Assets Registers, but they were
not updated on a regular basis.

Other significant outputs of this component include:
    Rapid Results Initiative. By introducing 48 ACs to the innovative Rapid Results
       Initiative, the project enhanced the ACs’ capacity to implement projects successfully in
       100 days. Using the Rapid Results framework, communities set their own achievable


                                                         24
       goals, which included an increase in school enrolments and an increase in pregnant
       women’s attendance at prenatal clinics. The beneficiary community members now
       understand and appreciate the principles of setting goals for development priorities.
      Development of training manuals for decentralized institutions. The project built
       collaboration with key national institutions—the Controller and Accountant General’s
       Department, Decentralization Secretariat, Ghana Education Service, Ghana Health
       Service, Ghana Irrigation Development Authority, NDPC, and the National Procurement
       Authority—to prepare training manuals and roll out training programs for key areas of
       decentralization. The project’s support to these critical institutions in the decentralization
       process helped move the National Decentralisation Action Plan forward and promoted
       partnerships among key players in the development arena.
      Enhanced capacity in social accountability. The project introduced 8,910 communities
       to the concept of social accountability through training that focused on two accountability
       instruments: Community Accountability Fora and Community Score Cards. More than
       455 ACs held at least two Community Accountability Fora, at which community leaders
       accounted for their stewardship to the local people. The project also trained 167 district
       teams and 162 ACs to use Community Score Cards. The score cards have been used to
       assess the quality of various public services in 339 communities. The various fora found
       90 percent of community leadership to be fair and responsive to social accountability
       issues.

Implementation of this component was influenced, however, by the four-year election cycle for
AC members and insufficient support from some DAs affected. In Ghana, ACs consist of elected
and appointed officers who serve for four years. When a new government is elected, it may
replace some officers appointed by the previous government. During the CBRDP, some trained
members of ACs were not reelected or reappointed, and new members had to be trained. Despite
the beneficial impact of the training, some districts made no provision for extending the training
as envisioned to other ACs beyond the pilot areas or to new AC members. Delays in rolling out
the District Development Fund, and the absence of some basic decisions and actions on the part
of actors outside the project’s control, constrained implementation to some extent as well.

Component 2: Infrastructure for Agricultural Development
This component provided facilities and resources to enhance farm and nonfarm activities and
increase the incomes of beneficiary rural communities by building or rehabilitating feeder roads
and farm tracks, market structures, irrigation dams, dugouts, and wind pumps. Table 2.2 shows
the agreed intermediate performance and output indicators.

6. Percentage change in revenues for DAs from market          0%           20%            –

The project constructed and rehabilitated 195 feeder roads spanning over 1,277 kilometers. The
investment in roads improved the rural population’s access to social and economic services and
facilitated the transport of agricultural inputs and produce between farms and markets. Most
vehicles have better access to rural communities, and on average time spent traveling fell from
15 minutes to 4 minutes per kilometer of road.

The project greatly improved rural people’s access to water by completing five dams, two wind
pumps, and one dugout. Water from dams and wind pumps is used for farming as well as
domestic purposes, enabling year-round farming and helping farmers increase their incomes
from agriculture.

The project also improved local economies by constructing 39 markets and 14 slaughterhouses.
The new markets provide numerous benefits to farmers, including improvements in sheltering
and storing goods, and the slaughterhouses provide a hygienic environment for handling and
storing meat. Reliable figures are not available, but some revenues reportedly accrue to DAs and
ACs from user fees, which are used to manage and maintain the facilities.

The impacts of these outputs were measured by the following intermediate outcome indicators
and their targets:
    Changes in crop intensity among target farmers (target: an average of at least two crop
       cycles per year). This indicator was fully achieved. An average of two cropping cycles
       per year was recorded.
    Changes in food production among target farmers (target: 70 percent of targeted farmers
       have an increase in crop production of at least 20 percent). This indicator could not be
       measured because farming was disrupted by heavy rains and floods in northern Ghana in
       2007.
    Number of people using dam/wind pump water for domestic purposes (target: number of
       people). This indicator was fully achieved: An average of 500 people use the dam/wind
       pump water for domestic purposes.
      Number of animals drinking dam/wind pump water (target: number of animals). This
       indicator was fully achieved: About 1,490 animals use dam/wind pump water each day,
       compared to none at baseline.


                                                       26
        Number of vehicles plying the road on a market day (target: the average number of
         vehicles increases by at least 200 percent). This indicator was fully achieved: An average
         of 9 vehicles ply each of the 62 of the completed roads that were sampled. Over 283,880
         persons benefitted from the improved roads—124,591 men (44 percent of beneficiaries)
         and 160,320 women (56 percent).
        Number of days that road is impassable each year (target: 90 percent reduction in
         number of days road is impassable). This indicator was fully achieved. At baseline, the
         number of days roads were impassable was 173. For the sample of 62 completed roads,
         this figure fell dramatically to 15 days.
        Percentage change in revenues for DAs from new markets (target: an improvement of at
         least 20 percent in revenue from the market). This indicator could not be measured owing
         to unreliable revenue information from the DAs.

Despite these remarkable achievements, some delays in implementation occurred. In particular,
the emergency response program for northern Ghana encountered delays form the lengthy
procurement process, renewed rains, and the government’s directive to stop contract payments in
January 2009.

Component 3: Rural Enterprise Development and Learning Centers
This component financed skills development and the creation of employment in rural
communities. It provided business management training, technical assistance, and credit to
owners and operators of rural enterprises. Table 2.3 shows the agreed intermediate performance
and output indicator for Component 3.

Table 2.3: Key Intermediate Performance and Output Indicator for Component 3
Indicator                                                            Baseline   Target   Actual Value Achieved
1. Percentage of trainees assisted to set up their own enterprises     0%        50%             80%

The component used Ghana’s rural banking system to channel loans and credits to beneficiaries.
Through the component, 65 of 99 accredited rural and community banks, including one
commercial bank, provided loans and grants to learning centers, trainees of learning centers, and
microenterprises. The capacity of the 65 rural and community banks to appraise, make credit
decisions, and disburse loans to rural enterprises engaged in farm and nonfarm activities was
improved. A total of Ȼ 5.1 million in loans and grants was disbursed to 1,210 recipients (learning
centers, trainees, and microenterprises). As a result, 40 recipients recorded an average change in
the value of their assets of 27 percent and an average change in the value of their turnover of 21
percent.

With regard to intermediate outcomes, the project supported 957 of 1,210 trainees to set up their
own businesses. The percentage of trainees assisted to set up their own businesses was measured
with the following target: At least 50 percent of trainees supported have set up their own
businesses. This indicator was fully achieved: 80 percent of trainees supported set up their own
businesses, which created about 1,622 jobs.

In addition, the project significantly improved learning center facilities. Of the 94 selected
learning centers, 78 received loans and grants amounting to Ȼ 1.1 million to upgrade their


                                                           27
facilities, and by the end of the project, 95 percent of those funded were using improved
facilities. The project provided training in vocational skills to 1,606 under- and unemployed
persons, which enabled them to establish their own businesses.

Despite achieving its purpose, this component could have benefited from more clearly defined
procedures and eligibility criteria for both the credits and matching grants. The lack of clear
procedures led to initial delays and unrealistic expectations among program implementers as well
as beneficiaries (particularly owners of learning centers and trainees, who expected grants
independently of commercial conditions). Other initial setbacks were the lack of experience
among Rural Banks and project staff with the type of lending promoted by the project, limited
funds for training them, and regular staff changes in Rural Banks. The lack of business skills
among clients affected the performance of learning centers, and the project lacked staff to
provide support at all project sites.

Component 4: Infrastructure for Social and Human Development
This component provided water, education, and health services by building water points,
rehabilitating dilapidated school buildings, and constructing community health compounds
(CHPS) and nutrition centers.

The project drilled and built 1,676 boreholes that gave improved access to safe water to 421,315
people in 453 communities. To ensure that the facilities would be maintained, the project trained
beneficiary communities in their operation and maintenance. The communities became better
organized to deal with technical problems and perform regular maintenance to reduce the
average time between breakdowns and repairs of water facilities from 2 days to 1.5 days. For this
reason, safe water is available longer and more continuously in beneficiary communities.

The 458 basic school structures rehabilitated under this component provided a more congenial
environment for over 30,000 students and teachers. Enrolment and learning improved in
beneficiary communities: Gross enrolment increased significantly from the baseline of 20
percent to 29 percent at the end of the project.

For health service delivery, the project built 271 community health compounds and 5 nutrition
centers, which significantly improved the use of medical facilities. The number of people
seeking medical attention in the CHPS compounds was measured with the target in Table 2.4. By
the end of the project, in 60 operational CHPS compounds, the number of people who sought
medical attention had increased by 290.7 percent over the baseline (from 60,728 to 237,282).

Table 2.4: Key Intermediate Performance and Output Indicator for Component 4

Although it surpassed agreed performance indicators, the component suffered some challenges.
The good level of engagement among district health teams was not always mirrored by regional
and national authorities, causing occasional difficulties in ensuring sufficient inputs and support
to guarantee services in a timely fashion.

Component 5: Community-Based Natural Resource Management
This component financed the rehabilitation of five critically degraded watershed areas and
strengthened the capacities of DAs, ACs, and community organizations in environmental
governance and integrated management of land and water resources. Table 2.5 shows the agreed
intermediate performance and output indicator for Component 5.

By the end of the project, 17 DAs and 39 ACs (representing 223 communities) had requested
support in community-based NRM. This result was achieved through sensitization programs on
the goals, objectives, and strategies of community-based NRM for all 170 DAs. The
communities are now aware of the importance of NRM and its contribution to increased
agricultural production and broader socioeconomic development in their areas. Greater
awareness led to increased requests for technical support, training, and materials to establish tree
nurseries, multipurpose woodlots, medicinal plantations and tree crop orchards, protective fire
belts/rides around 11 sacred groves, and community ecotourism reserves. In the five degraded
watersheds, over 22 nurseries have been established and rehabilitated, and they have produced
341,000 seedlings. Eight communities have initiated pilot sites.

The project financed restoration of nearly 1,611 hectares of critically degraded watershed area—
about 55 percent of the 2,930-hectare target area. Watersheds were restored by planting various
multipurpose woodlot, medicinal, and fruit tree species from community and school nurseries.
Community interest triggered active commitment and increased the survival rate of planted areas
from about 35 percent in 2007 to about 60 percent by the end of the project

Of the targeted DAs, ACs, and communities, 17 DAs and 39 ACs (representing 223
communities) prepared NRM plans. To lay the groundwork for developing the plans, the project
trained 378 personnel of 18 DAs in participatory resource management planning, monitoring,
and conflict management. The enhanced capacity of DA staff enabled beneficiary DPCUs to
facilitate the preparation of NRM action plans for 152 communities in five pilot watershed areas
and 79 communities in 8 community-initiated program areas. These capacity-building activities
also enabled DA staff to integrate their plans into the District Medium Term Development Plans.

Other significant outcomes and outputs include training in bushfire control and management and
training in environmental protection techniques. More than 500 community members learned



                                                   29
bushfire control and management techniques and were equipped with various small fire-fighting
tools. Communities reduced vegetation loss at pilot sites by creating 4.5 kilometers of fire belts
and breaks. A reward scheme was instituted to encourage traditional authorities to champion
bushfire control in their areas of jurisdiction. The scheme was piloted at four pilot sites, one each
in the northern savannah zone, forest-savannah-transitional zone, forest zone, and coastal
savannah zone. The dramatically reduced incidence of bushfires increased survival rates in
planted areas from 35 percent in 2007 to just over 55 percent at the end of the project.

The project strengthened the ACs’ capacity to undertake environmental protection activities. In
collaboration with the EPA, DAs, and Rural Infrastructure Coordinating Unit, the participating
ACs in the Upper West Region formed 25 school environmental clubs and 25 community
environmental management committees, which are leading vigorous campaigns for sound
environmental management.

Delays in implementing this component arose because of the less than adequate preparatory
work prior to project. The Rural Infrastructure Coordinating Unit did not provide sufficiently
adequate leadership in promoting the component, the Regional Management Support Center and
Savanna Resource Management Center did not initially understand their roles as sources of
technical input and support for the project. Inadequate consideration was given to determining
the best way to integrate the component at the DA level. At the operational level, implementation
was constrained by limits on the advances to DAs and ACs for NRM activities. Implementation
was delayed by issues with the release of funds to the Regional Management Support Center and
Savanna Resource Management Center for technical support, a lack of clarity on how the
livelihood subcomponent should operate, and the possible disincentive caused by cost-sharing
requirements. To overcome these initial difficulties, the project engaged the Bureau of Integrated
Rural Development of the Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology as well as
the University for Development Studies to offer training to DAs, ACs, and community members.
Short-term individual consultants were engaged to identify constraints and mitigation strategies.
These strategies eventually whetted communities’ interest in community-based NRM.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

The CBRDP’s interventions included a mix of demand-driven productive and social investments;
capacity building for DAs, ACs, and communities; assistance to rural enterprises and learning
centers; physical infrastructure for agriculture and for social and human development; and
support for NRM as well as project management. Some activities, particularly capacity building
and project management, did not generate direct economic benefits, while the remainder had
varying degrees of measurable economic benefits. A cursory look at the CBRDP’s portfolio
shows that over 70 percent of investments went to physical (economic and social) infrastructure;
close to 7 percent supported rural enterprise development and the learning centers, while the
remaining investments went into capacity building, NRM, and project management. The physical
infrastructure investments generated over 3,656 subprojects (Table 3.1).

the models and assumptions.

Summary of Results of Cost-Benefit Analysis

The economic and financial analysis showed that investments in rural enterprises (the learning
centers and new businesses established by learning center trainees and small rural entrepreneurs)
are profitable ventures. They accrued substantial benefits to both entrepreneurs and trainees, with
a positive NPV and high ERR. Table 3.2 shows results of the cost-benefit analysis of
interventions in support of rural enterprises.

Detailed Economic Analysis of Three Selected Subproject Categories

Learning centers
Respondents indicated that upgrading small and initially insignificant businesses into learning
centers was a positive move that improved the business owner’s managerial skills, increased
income, and created employment for other community members. The learning centers were
profitable businesses that demonstrated the beneficial effects of project support. Their financial
and economic incremental NPVs were positive, the BCR was greater than one, and the ERR was

very high (Table 3.4). Converting a business into a learning center created 62 additional working
days for hired labor and increased the economic value of a day of family labor to Ȼ 10.21.

Schools
The economic benefit to communities of improving their schools was demonstrated through a
model that accounted for the cost of improvements plus incremental spending for teachers’
salaries and school maintenance. That cost was compared to the benefits that children were
expected to obtain from improving and completing their education (Table 3.5). The incremental
economic benefits of school improvements expressed by the NPV is Ȼ 172,090, with an ERR of
27 percent.

Data for the model were provided by school administrations and included data on the cost of
renovations and additionally recruited staff, additional maintenance, and additional teaching
materials. It was assumed that the renovations would enable schools to function better for 15
years. On average, 50 more children attended each school after the improvements. Of that
number, 26.5 percent will graduate. The model assumes that the economic benefit of graduation
will be increased employment, that a graduate will be fully employed for 25 years (starting from
the sixteenth year of life), and that the daily revenue of a rural worker is Ȼ 4.

Rural health infrastructure
The economic benefits of rural health centers were estimated based on the average cost of
renovations and the incremental costs of personnel and maintenance over 15 years (Table 3.6).
The benefits were assumed to be the reduction in sick days among the additional patients visiting
the center (after renovation, centers received on average 603 more patients). The analysis
identified the reduction in the number of sick days required for the NPV to move from negative
to positive values. A patient’s sick days had to be reduced by 2 before the cost of renovations
balanced the higher costs of operating a health center.

Note: 603 additional patients received per year (9,045 in 15 years); economic productivity of one day of labor, Ȼ 2.4.

The cost of improving health services, along with the additional costs of managing the renovated
health centers, equal 3.3 days of work per patient per year over 25 years. Under those conditions,
and assuming that Ȼ 2.4 is the economic value of the working day, the cost of improving health

services is covered. If more days are saved, the improved health service becomes economically
beneficial to the entire community. The model does not take into account social and ethical
benefits.


               Appendix 1: Financial and Economic Evaluation Models and Assumptions

Data for the evaluations were collected using a series of questionnaires. They covered rural enterprises
(including the learning centers and rural enterprises opened by learning center trainees and rural
entrepreneurs), renovated rural schools, and renovated health centers. The models and assumptions for
each are discussed in the following sections.

Rural Enterprises
Information concerning financial performances was collected during interviews of approximately five
hours with the managers of selected enterprises spread over two to three days. Managers used the records
of the enterprise when possible, but when they were incomplete, missing data were completed by the best
estimates of entrepreneurs and their collaborators.

Data treatment before analysis. Enterprises first received project funding for upgrading or were created
in 2007. Data on those businesses span 2006–11 and are extrapolated to the future, based on the
assumption that the productive life of a given enterprise is 15 years. If the enterprise existed before its
improvements were funded by the project, data for the year prior to the improvements were used as the
baseline. The information provided by the entrepreneurs was too cursory to be used for a counterfactual
analysis of what would have occurred in the absence of the project over the same period.

Correction for inflation. Recorded cedi values were converted into fixed-term values, using 2010 as Year
1. Inflation coefficients and conversion coefficients for the evaluation are included in Appendix Table 1.
Prices were reported by the managers and introduced into an enterprise balance sheet by year covering the
year prior to investment, the year the investment was made, and 15 years of productive life of the
enterprise.

Incremental values. The values prior to the project were subtracted from the corresponding lines of the
balance sheet. The financial and economic coefficients thus reflect only the incremental values of the
enterprise arising from project support.

Conversion of financial into economic values. The next step in the economic analysis was to remove the
money flows (loans, repayments, and taxes). The financial conversion coefficient (CFf) for the shadow
exchange rate was calculated using averages for 2006–09 from the World Bank database for Ghana
according to the formula CF = (total value of imports plus total value of import duties) divided by total
value of imports. The corresponding values were Ȼ 11,437 million for average import values and Ȼ 852
million for average import duties and taxes. The CFf was 1.07.



                                                      35
The daily value of rural labor was estimated from the collected information as Ȼ 4 per day on average,
including food. Rural unemployment was 40 percent, based on information estimated jointly with the
project zonal coordinators, rural development offices, and other data collection activities for this analysis.

Given the almost unitary value of the conversion coefficient and lack of reliable information to calculate
conversion coefficients for other variables (such as transport), the only data conversion from financial to
economic values was a reduction of the labor value by 40 percent, from Ȼ 4 per day to Ȼ 2.4 per day.

Calculation of project performance coefficients. The financial analyses used discount rates used by the
Rural Banks for projects supported by the CBRDP: 23 percent for the learning centers, 22 percent for the
trainees, and 20 percent for entrepreneurs. For the economic analysis, the discount rate was the same as in
the PAD: 12 percent.

Project performance was calculated using several coefficients: NPV (to illustrate the relative financial and
economic importance of the production added as a result of the project investment and compare it among
projects); internal rate of return (IRR) and ERR (to indicate the financial or economic viability of the
enterprises); and benefit cost ratio (BCR), representing the discounted value of benefits divided by the
discounted value of costs. A BCR higher than one indicates that an enterprise is profitable.

Data in the report represent arithmetic averages for each category of enterprise examined. NPVs were
calculated with the corresponding standard errors.

Rural enterprises invest little. They used the loans obtained under the project mostly for financing hired
labor and other inputs, so IRR coefficients were not appropriated for the analysis, and ERR values were
too high. The BCR gives more balanced information.

School Facilities Rehabilitation: Costs and Benefits

The incremental costs of rehabilitating rural schools were calculated as the cost of renovation plus
additional spending on new personnel. The model for calculating incremental benefits had the following
parameters: It spans more than 45 years; Year 1 corresponds to the first year of school renovation; Year 2
corresponds to the first year of operation of the renovated school; and the renovation will be useful for 15
years (until Year 16 of the model). The effects of the renovation over time are examined for children
entering the first year of study in the first year after the renovation (Year 2 of the model). Those children
will graduate at the end of their sixth year of school at age 12, in Year 8 of the model. At 16 years, Year
12 of the model, these children will become professionally active and remain so until they are 40 (Year 36
of the model). The next generation of children will enroll in the second year after the renovation (Year 3
of the model) and turn 40 in Year 37 of the model. The last generation to use the school for six full years
before the next renovation will enroll at the beginning of the 10th year after the renovation (Year 11 of the
model) and graduate the last year that the renovated school is run (Year 16 of the model). The last
generation of children will enter productive life in Year 20 of the model and end their careers in Year 44.

The incremental number of graduates (14 students) was calculated as follows. Children enter primary
school when they are six, and primary school lasts six years. Before the schools were renovated under the
project, they enrolled 206 children, of whom 58 (26.5) percent completed the entire six years of primary
education and received diplomas. After the schools were renovated, enrolments increased on average by
54 students, from 206 to 260. The model assumes that the percentage of students that will complete their
primary education will not change, so the number of additional students who will complete their primary
education is 54*.265 = 14.




                                                     36
The total productive years of primary school graduates is equal to 5,500 person days. A year has 250
working days, and one day’s wage for a rural worker is Ȼ 4 (as noted, Ȼ 2.4 in economic value). Thus
total productivity was calculated as follows: productivity of one graduate per day (Ȼ 2.4); productivity of
one graduate per year (250 days) (Ȼ 600); productivity of graduate over 25 years of work (Ȼ 15,000);
productivity of 14 graduates during their professional lives (Ȼ 210,000); and productivity of 10 years of
graduates during their professional lives (Ȼ 2,100,000).

Annex 5. Beneficiary Assessment Survey

As part of project evaluation, a survey was conducted to ascertain the level of satisfaction of the
project’s beneficiaries. Overall, beneficiaries are conversant and very satisfied with the support
they received from the project. The survey findings are grouped as follows: improvements in the
capacity of decentralized institutions and direct benefits to the project’s beneficiaries.

Improvement in the Capacity of Decentralized Institutions

In support of the government’s decentralization policy, the project emphasized building capacity
in subnational institutions. The project’s improvements in capacity extended from the national to
the community level, however, as discussed in the following paragraphs.

Support to national institutions. The project supported key national institutions directly
involved in implementing the decentralization program, including MLGRD, NDPC, and the
National Procurement Authority. The project provided technical support to strengthen the
capacity of targeted departments and units in these institutions. Staff were trained in the
development of manuals and other relevant materials.

Support to Regional Planning Coordinating Units. The project trained RPCU staff in
procurement, contract management, monitoring, and evaluation for district projects. The majority
of RPCU staff confirmed that the training enhanced their understanding of tendering and contract
management procedures and has enabled them to respond quickly to DAs’ requests for help in
preparing tender documents. The quality of procurement documents (including public tenders)
has greatly improved.

Support to the Metropolitan, Municipal, and District Assemblies. Technical and financial
support to the Metropolitan, Municipal, and District Assemblies included training in
procurement and financial management for District Planning Officers. Their deeper
understanding of procurement and financial management, combined with significantly improved
knowledge of procurement management among DCPU staff, strengthened working relations
between DPCUs and the RPCUs, which work together to ensure the effectiveness and efficiency
of procurement processes and activities for the benefit of the local communities. The project also
built DPCUs’ capacity to deliver services effectively and efficiently to communities by training
them in project management, including community empowerment, community socialization,
rural poverty reduction, effective local governance, and social accountability.

Support to the Area Councils in project identification and implementation. The project
increased ACs’ involvement in providing physical infrastructure at the community level. The
project provided training to subdistrict institutions in participatory community project
identification, community mobilization, planning, implementation, and management. The project
also trained the ACs in RRI, which enhanced their understanding of the steps needed to achieve
results in subprojects in 100 days. Such interventions helped ACs to provide effective oversight
for participatory decision making, planning, and project implementation in their areas of
jurisdiction.




                                                40
Support to community governance structures. The project provided targeted capacity building
interventions to community structures, including Unit Committees, School Management
Committees, and Community Water and Sanitation Committees.

Direct Benefits to Project Beneficiaries

The project increased communities’ access to physical and social infrastructure by building and
rehabilitating feeder roads and providing infrastructure for education, health, safe water, and
improved sanitation. These interventions improved the living standards of the inhabitants of the
communities as discussed next.

Access to markets and social services. The rehabilitation and construction of feeder roads
improved the marketing of goods and access to key social services. Traders readily get transport
to market centers. Health services have improved as sick people and expectant mothers can be
sent to hospitals in an emergency. Health professionals visit communities regularly for important
outreach programs such as immunization and health education campaigns.

Access to better education facilities. The improvement in school infrastructure in the form of
spacious classrooms created an enabling environment for students and teachers. Enrolment and
attendance increased in the majority of schools. Schools formerly running a single stream are
now running a double stream. Academic performance improved in some schools, where children
scored better on their basic certificate examination (BECE).

Access to better health facilities. The provision of health infrastructure (CHPS compounds)
significantly improved health service delivery. Patients now have easy access to health services,
and supervised delivery by qualified health professionals has improved. The health personnel
now have better living places.

Access to better water and sanitation facilities. The provision of more boreholes increased
access to potable water and community toilet facilities. As a result, diseases related to
contaminated water and poor sanitation have declined substantially.

Annex 7. Summary of Borrower’s ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR

The overall goal of the CBRDP was to reduce poverty and enhance the quality of life of
beneficiary rural communities. The objective was to strengthen rural communities’ capacity to
enhance their quality of life by improving their productive assets, rural infrastructure, and access
to key support services from private and public sources. The project was declared effective on
November 2, 2004 and financed by two development partners (the World Bank and AFD) with
an initial IDA credit component of US$ 60 million complemented by an additional US$ 22
million. At the end of the project (June 30, 2011), the total contributions of the development
partners equaled US$ 94 million, alongside the Government of Ghana’s contribution of US$ 8.9
million. Project resources were allocated to six components, as discussed in the sections that
follow.

Component 1: Institutional Strengthening and Capacity Building

This component, at a total cost of US$ 8.52 million (US$7.6 of the IDA contribution),
strengthened the capacity of local government institutions to further the Ghana Poverty
Reduction Strategy, namely good governance and human resource development The component
financed training for the staff members of 170 DAs in participatory planning, procurement,
contract drafting, financial management, and participatory M&E and training for 29 percent of
the staff of Ghana’s ACs in participatory planning, procurement, financial management, and
participatory M&E. Supplementary training in RRI, the use of Community Accountability Fora,
and Community Score Cards was meant to further improve the scope for decentralized
administrative units to implement project components. The administration was effective in
mobilizing rural communities to execute their own development projects.

Frequent rotations of administrative personnel, frequent lack of continuity in follow-up of
documentation, and inadequate filing systems were some obstacles to timely and successful
implementation of community projects.

Component 2: Infrastructure for Agricultural Development

This component, which cost US$ 21.9 million (US$ 17.3 million of the IDA contribution),
provided facilities and resources to enhance farm and nonfarm activities in order to increase
beneficiaries’ incomes. It improved 1,277 kilometers of feeder roads; impact studies have shown
that the road improvement brought numerous advantages to rural communities, as predicted in
the PAD. Project funds were also used to construct 65 village markets or slaughterhouses,
creating more hygienic facilities for their users, increasing the influx of clients and merchants,
and increasing the volume of traded merchandise.

Component 3: Rural Enterprise Development and Learning Centers

This component, at a total cost of US$ 8.37 million (US$ 6.5 million of the IDA contribution)
aimed to develop skills and create employment in rural communities. It did so by assisting rural
enterprises to manage their operations properly and provide ready markets for agricultural
produce to be processed for added value and increased shelf life.


                                                43
The project created 49 rural learning centers, which trained 1,210 prospective rural
entrepreneurs. Most of the trainees have created or are creating their own enterprises.
Additionally, project funds provided loans to 731 independent rural enterprises that were willing
to increase their production and presented viable business plans for doing so. The grants and
loans were made available through an Apex Rural Bank and 99 Community Banks. The project’s
support to enterprises and learning centers was its most outstanding success. The businesses it
supported were generally financially and economically viable, increasing family revenues and
creating new jobs. The learning centers proved to be a prominent initiative that trained new
entrepreneurs and spontaneously created networks and circles of professionals that are active and
helpful to their members. The project promoted economic growth in rural communities and
improved the decentralized authorities’ capacity to combat rural poverty.

Component 4: Infrastructure for Social and Human Development

The objective of this component, which had a total cost US$ 23.34 million (US$ 18.5 million of
the IDA contribution), was to provide a supportive environment for learning and health by
rehabilitating school facilities, constructing health compounds and nutrition centers, and
providing communities with sources of safe water. Communities used funds from this
component to rehabilitate 832 basic schools, build 246 community health centers, and drill 1,672
successful boreholes. Financing for this infrastructure was associated with training for users in
maintaining and managing the facilities; the training was specific to the type of infrastructure
involved). The investigation of the economic benefits and impact of the investments in new or
renovated schools and health centers indicates that the investments provided the population with
the expected benefits (more satisfactory services) and delivered tangible economic benefits to the
country. The communities involved are satisfied and frequently proud of the investments, which
improved their personal lives and increased the communities’ prestige.

The maintenance and financing of this infrastructure still require attention from the government,
however. The communities have limited resources and in most cases rely at least partly on
government support.

Component 5: Community-Based Natural Resource Management

The objective of this component, which cost US$ 4.59 million (US$ 3.9 million of the IDA
contribution), was to strengthen the capacities of environmental and sanitation subcommittees,
ACs, and community organizations to enhance environmental governance and integrated
management of land and water resources.

The component financed sensitization of DA personnel, AC staff, and community members in
preparing NRM action plans (18 DAs, 152 communities), establishing tree nurseries, producing
seedlings (443,000 produced), and planting woodlots (568 hectares). Moreover, 504
communities were trained in bushfire control. Since NRM involves long-term actions that span
several seasons, the effects of this component’s activities are not yet fully appreciated. The
government’s future efforts will go towards selecting methods and incentives that will strengthen
previous impacts of NRM.



                                               44
Component 6: Project Management

This component aimed at ensuring the effective implementation of the project, technical
assistance, and M&E. The total cost was US$ 7.3 million (US$ 6.2 million of the IDA
contribution). Under this component, the project implemented its programmed activities
successfully and in a timely way. The project, as well as its overall management, monitoring, and
evaluation, received an award in May 2011 for being the World Bank’s best project in Africa.

In general, the project successfully achieved its objectives and contributed considerably to
achieving the Millennium Development Goals and reducing poverty in Ghana. The project’s
most remarkable result is the successful introduction and reinforcement of the government’s
decentralization policy, which massively mobilized communities to implement their own
development plans. Decentralized administrations are now able to partner with their communities
in the fight against poverty.

Annex 8. Comments from Cofinanciers and Other Partners/Stakeholders

The ICR has adequately reviewed all the key aspects of the project. You have reviewed the
performance relating to the PDOs and Outcome Indicators.

We have noted that generally, you have rated the project ―Satisfactory‖. This is not contestable
given that all the components, except initial concerns with NRM, actually performed to exceed
initial projections.

We have also noted that in the ICR Post-completion Operation/Next Phase, who have indicated
that no follow up on CBRDP operations have been planned although you have received a letter
from GoG expressing interest for a ―next phase‖ of the project.

From our side, we are also required to perform an expost evaluation. Data from the ICR, the
beneficiary assessment and others would provide substantial input which might not require us to
undertake a full expost evaluation but a bridging exercise to gather supplementary data to add to
the present findings. In this respect, it appears the sub-component ―Support to Decentralisation‖
under the Institutional Strengthening Component will require a deeper review than has been
covered under the ICR. This sub-component, as you will recall, was wholly funded under the
AFD component.

We agree with the findings especially proving as untrue, the assertion that rural communities do
not have the capacity to identify, prepare and implement development projects. We also agree
with the recommendation to include NRM departments in the MMDAs. The recent creation of
departments under the MMDAs only involves the Department of Parks and Gardens. Parks and
Gardens do not have the mandate to cover the wider NRM issues.
