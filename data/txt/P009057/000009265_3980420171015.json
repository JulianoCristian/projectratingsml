Some lessons learned\n            included: entrepreneurs like predictable debt service\n            obligations and prefer assuming the foreign exchange risk\n            rather than covering it at the cost of fluctuating relative\n            and high interest rates. In economies with a high rate of\n            inflation, sound economic and financial returns can be\n            obtained if lending activities are sheltered from the\n            effects of inflation through appropriate interest rate\n            mechanisms. Free-standing permanent working capital loans\n            with long-term maturities can be vital for the enterprises\n            in economies where banks are reluctant to provide\n            medium-to-long term financing, due to macro-economic\n            uncertainty. Lending mechanisms should be simple so that\n            sub-borrowers understand their obligations. When problems\n            arise between the Bank and the Borrower, solutions should be\n            sought right after the emergence of the problems. A credit\n            line can be highly satisfactory even in an inflationary\n            environment if negative real interest rates are avoided by\n            lending in foreign exchange or indexing of sub-loans to\n            foreign currencies. Sub-project performance can be improved\n            substantially through close ex-ante and ex-post review and\n            supervision of the Bank."}, "docdt": "1997-06-09T00:00:00Z"}
