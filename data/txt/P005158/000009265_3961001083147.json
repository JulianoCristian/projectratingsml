In line with this\n            objective, the project will support six core programs : 1)\n            the provision of essential municipal services; 2)\n            improvements to essential public transport services; 3) a\n            community development program including improvements in\n            basic and primary health care provision, immunization\n            programs, and mother and child nutrition programs; 4) an\n            enterprise development program; 5) a labor mobility program;\n            and 6) an institutional development program."}, "docdt": "1991-05-29T00:00:00Z"}
