and\n            manage Algeria's natural resources, specifically its\n            forests, watersheds, and nature conservation areas.  The\n            project will strengthen the institutions working in these\n            areas and, through appropriate testing, will develop the\n            policy and technical basis for replication of suitable\n            project components as part of a national resource management\n            program. The project will comprise:  (a) studies to:  (i)\n            identify how much of Algeria's wood needs could be met\n            domestically, (ii) simplify and improve forestry planning\n            and test ways to integrate forest activities with those of\n            livestock owners, and (iii) provide a master plan for major\n            watersheds; (b) pilot reforestation of 4,3000 ha and pilot\n            exploitation operations to introduce new, low-cost\n            techniques; (c) watershed management operations to introduce\n            new, low-cost approaches to increase farmers' incomes\n            and to reduce erosion on some 10,000 ha of fragile and\n            eroded land; (d) nature conservation with emphasis on the\n            strengthening of the applied research capacity in this area\n            and on training and the supply of equipment; and (e) support\n            activities including related applied forest research,\n            institution strengthening, vehicle and equipment purchases,\n            buildings, training and technical assistance."}, "docdt": "1992-05-18T00:00:00Z"}
