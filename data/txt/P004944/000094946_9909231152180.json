Among the key lessons learned are these: In\n            view of the relatively weak institutional capacity in\n            Algeria, it is important to design projects that are\n            relatively simple and easy to manage. It is important when\n            technical assistance is limited, to have more intensive\n            missions to provide needed assistance. The implementing unit\n            must have, from the start, an adequate skills mix to support\n            project implementation; the failure to recruit an economist,\n            and replace staff that left the unit, greatly reduced the\n            unit's efficacy. It is important to come up with\n            innovative approaches to ensure that monitoring and\n            evaluation are carried out, such as using a local consulting\n            firm, and using videos and photographs for follow-up. The\n            project's high dependency on external participation\n            crippled implementation when the security situation became\n            difficult, and it became harder to attract foreign\n            participation. Consequently many bids did not receive\n            submissions. Conditions to attract private investors in\n            forest operations need to be developed. Procurement of goods\n            and services must be required training for the\n            implementation unit. The participation of local populations\n            on communal or private lands must be encouraged in all\n            phases of project activities; this reinforces the sense of\n            ownership needed to sustain project operations. Slow\n            disbursement affected project implementation through slow\n            replenishments and delays in paying contractors."}, "docdt": "1999-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
