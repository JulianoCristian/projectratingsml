0N A PROPO3ID LAN
IN AN AMOUNT EQUIVAIENT TO U8$25 BILLION
TO THE DEMOCRATIC AND POPULAR REBLIC OF ALIA
FOR A PIOT FORESTRY A1D WATERSHED NAAGENT PROJCT
1.    The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan to the
Democratic and Popular Republic of Algeria for the equivalent of US$25 million
is submitted for approval. The proposed loan would assist Algeria in the
development of a long-term action program to better protect and manage its
natural resources, specifically its forests, watersheds, and nature
conservation areas. It would strengthen institutions working in these areas
and, through appropriate testing, would develop the policy and technical basis
for project replication in a national resource management program. The loan
would have a term of 17 years, including five years of grace, at the standard
variable interest rate.
2.    Backgroun4:  As a resu lt of inadequate natural resource management,
Algeria is faced with serious problems of land degradation that, in the long
term, could undermine its productive potential and exacerbate the problem of
water scarcity. Three key natural resources are its forests, watersheds, and
nature - conservation areas.   Excluding the arid Sahara region, gazetted
forests, parks, and reserves cover about 15X (3.5-4.0 million ha) of the
northern part of the country, about the same amount of land as is cultivated
each year. Rapid population growth over the past few decades -- accompanied
by encroachment, forest fires, and expansion of agriculture in marginal areas
-- has led to a steady decline in the area and quality of forests. Apart from
some replanting and the construction of fire breaks, forest roads, and water
points -- mostly conservation measures --, there is little evidence that
fo *sts are being actively managed.  The results of replanting are not
cor& ansurate with the resources spent. Forests have made little contribution
to the economy, and local production of wood products meets only 101 of total
needs. Algeria imports some US$200-300 million of wood-related products a
year, roughly 2.5X of merchandise imports.
3.   In the vaterabsds, south of the narrow, fertile elevated strip of land
that runs along Algeria's coastline, the combination of geological natural
susceptibility, cultivation of marginal areas, and overgrazing has resulted
in a loss of vegetative cover and, consequently, in intense erosion. Some
*        12 million ha are threatened by erosion, and the equivalent of 40,000 ha of
Algeria's limited agricultural land are estimated to be lost each year to
erosion. This has serious implications for the sustainability of agricultural
production in the nation's mountainous areas; for the social and economic life
of the communities that live in the watersheds; and for the productive life
of dams that are crucial to Algeria's future, given projected water shortages
and the lack of additional dam sites.   An ambltious program of watershed
management has been under way over the past 40 years, but with disappointing



-2-
results.  The costs of improvements are too high to replicate on a large
scale; local populations have not been involved, so that they have little
ownership of works, which have been poorly maintained; and works have stressed
physical structures rather than the means to improve the vegetative soil cover
and increase water infiltration.
4.    Lessons from Previous Bank Involvement:  The main lessons learned from
the implementation of Bank projects in Algeria are (a) to avoid overly complex
project design; (b) to ensure the full commitment of the Government of Algeria
(GOA) at each stage of project preparation; (c) to ensure timely availability
of technical assistance, where such assistance is required; and (d) to take
special measures to ensure satisfactory project accounting and auditing. The
proposed project has taken this experience into account through an intensive
and detailed dialogue with GOA during project preparation and appraisal. The
employment of project consultants is a condition of loan effectiveness.
Accounting and auditing have been addressed under the project by providing
technical assistance for the establishment of the project accounting system
and by including a covenant in the loan agreement requiring GOA to prepare an
action plan for ensuring that all audit requirements under the project will
be fully met.
5.    The Bark has had no previous forestry projects in Algeria but lessons
from 12 years of experience with forestry and watershed management in
neighboring Morocco and Tunist a include that (a) management of forest
resources requires an integrated approach, taking into account various demands
on it, e.g. domestic stock grazing, (b) traditional forest management plans
are too costly to prepare and too complex to execute, and (c) technical
success in limited water catchment areas is not enough to guarantee its
replicability to some 6 million ha of priority area in watersheds serving
major dams, let alone the entire 12 million ha threatened by erosion in
Algeria.   The proposed project takes these lessons into account by
(a) prescribing detailed steps for the identification of the concerned
populations and for their involvement (including provision of incentives) in
the planning and execution of project works; (b) prescribing the design and
preparation of simple and practical management plans; and (c) development of
low cost sustainable soil conservation techniques requiring a minimum of
budget funds and relying to a maximum extent on self-financing and the
participation of local populations.
6.    Rationale  for  Bank  Involvement:    Continued  degradation  and  low
productivity of the forests and cropped land, soil erosion, and siltation of
dams demonstrate that Government investments in forestry and watershed
management to date have been ineffective. With the introduction of improved
processes and technologies, forests and watersheds can be better protected
and, at the same time, can be made much more productive. The existing top-
down approach to tackling the problem of erosion needs to be changed to
involve local populations fully.   Works to reduce erosion should aim to
improve farmers' incomes rather than merely to benefit those who live
downstream. GOA seeks Bank assistance not only in the funding of the project,
but also for the Bank's expertise in other Maghreb countries in tackling these



issues, especially that of popular participation, and in the planning and
execution of actions designed to foster efficient and sustainable use of the
country's natural resourcen while conserving its fragile and threatened
ecosystem. The Bank is also uniquely placed to (a) help Algeria strengthen
its forestry institutions so that they can sustain and replicate successful
actions initiated under the project, (b) encourage the introduction of a more
competitive system to help reduce costs, and (c) link reforms in the sector
to those in other parts of the economy (for example, in water).
7.    Proiect Objectives:  The objective of the project would be to develop
a long-term, environmentally sound action program to better protect and manage
Algeria's natural resources, specifically its forests, watersheds, and nature
conservation areas. The project would be a pilot operation to prepare and
test components for replication in a national, natural resource management
program. The immediate objectiJes of the project would be to: (a) assist GOA
in defining a strategy for the sector; (b) develop and test low-cost
techniques, including institutional and social arrangements, to increase the
sustainable productivity of forest and watersheds while reducing erosion; and
(c) strengthen institutions, particularly in planning, execution, monitoring,
and rezearch.
8.    Proiect Description:  The project, which would be implemented over five
years, would include the following: (a) develogment of a strategy for forestry
and watershed management through studies: (i) of the forest sector, includi,ng
the identification of how much of Algeria's dem& id for wood could be met
domestically, (ii) to simplify and improve the preparation of forest
management plans and test ways to integrate forestry activities with those of
pastoralists, and (iii) to prepare a master plan for the country's major
watersheds; (b) oilot forestry development through the upgrading of an
existing forest nursery, the reforestation of 4,300 ha of degraded forest, and
the exploitation of 1,000 ha of existing eucalyptus to introduce improved,
low-cost techniques; (c) pilot watershed management oDerations to increase
farmers' incomes and reduce erosion in two different areas through the
development and adoption of appropriate low-cost techniques, extension, on-
farm investments, social infrastructure, and the construction of structures
to control runoff and reduce sedimentation rates; (d) nature conservation
through research, the training of staff responsible for the protection of
nature resources, and the supply of equipment; and (e) support activities
comprising institution building (strengthening of agencies involved in the
planning, execution, and monitoring of forestry activities), related applied
research, and a major program of training and technical assistance.
9.    The Ministry of Agriculture, through its recently created National
Forestry Agency (ANF), will have overall responsibility for management and
implementation of the project. Although the institutions involved in project
implementation are new, arrangements for the execution of the project are
satisfactory. Moreover, technical assistance and training provided under the
project will help strengthen the institutions working in the sector.

10.   Costs and  inancintg:  The total cost of the project is estimated at
US$37.4 million, with a foreign excharnge cost of US$19.0 million. The Bank
loan of US$25.0 million would cover about 80X of project costs net of duties
-nd taxes. This financing percentage was determined in view of the fact that
the project will be making a unique contribution to environmental protection,
local population participation, and human resource development. Retroactive
financing of US$1.0 million would be provided to allow for early project
start-up and would cover eligible expenditures after January 1. 1992. A
breakdown of project costs and the financing plan is shown in SchadiulA..
Amounts and methods of procurement and the disbursement schedule are shown in
Schedule B. A timetable of key processing events and the status of Bank Group
operations in Algeria are given in Scheduleks C and D, respectively. Map
.BRD 22755R is also attached. The Staff Appraisal Report No. 9390-AL dated
May 18, 1992, is being distributed separately.
11.  Prolect Sustainability:  Important objectives of the project - which is
a pilot operation - are to develop low cost techniques for forestry and
watershed management and to ensure the participation of local populations, in
order to render these operations sustainable. Project emphasis on effective
monitoring and evaluation (N&E) would help in replicating lessons learned
under the project. Strong technical assistance and training components would
help in strengthening concerned institutions and thereby help ensure their
sustainability.
12.  Aasreed Actions:  At negotiations, assurances were obtained that the
Government would: (a) employ consultants for major studies by March 1993
(simplified forest management plans and forest sector study) and March 1994
(watershed master plan), and complete these studies by September 1996;
(b) employ key project staff (deputy director, economist, and accountant) by
November 1992; (c) make arrangements, satisfactory to the Bank, by
September 1993 with the users of forest lands to be replanted under the
project for grazing purposes, to ensure that the reforestation activities are
consistent with grazing; (d) before starting watershed management operations,
prepare: (i) plans for Bank approval and (ii) make arrangements satisfactory
to the Bank to ensure the participation of local populations; (e) submit
annual progress reports on watershed operations for Bank review and introduce
agreed changes into the plans; (f) submit annual project budgets and financing
plans to the Bank and promptly finalize and execute the budgets, taking the
Bank's comments into account; (g) prepare an action plan for project auditing
by November 1992 and execute this plan, taking the Bank's comments into
account; and (h) carry out a project mid-term review with the Bank by June
1995.
13.  Bngefits:  The major benefit of the project would be the long-term
improvement in the use of Algeria's forests, watersheds, and wildlife habitat.
The project would develop a viable forestry sector, increasing wood production
and saving foreign exchange. It would also, through the use of competitive
bidding for the first time in the sector, encourage the development of the
private sector. In the watersheds, employment and incomes of the poorest
sections of the population would be increased. Techniques and processes would



-
be developed to reduce erosion and sedimentation of dams, thereby prolonging
the life of dams and increasing infiltration rates. Costs and benefits can
be directly quantified only for the reforestation and exploitation sub-
components, for which the internal economic rate of return is 12X. This rate
does not incorporate the significant, long-term environmental benefits of the
project, which are not easily quantifiable.
14.   .wlrona  t: The project is directed toward environmental protection
and enhancement and, thus, would have major environmental benefits. It is
rated *CO in accordance with World Bank OD 4.01 and does not require
preparation of an environmental assessment. The project would explore the
causes of forest and watershed degradation and would propose appropriate means
to remedy the situation; it would also test ways to devolve management of
natural resources to the local populations. The project would contribute to
the preservation of the country's diverse flora and fauna. Finally, it would
establish an institutional, technical, and strategic base for future
investment in natural resource management in Algeria.
15. Risks: Major project risks arise from: (a) possible teething problems
after the restructuring of the institutions involved in the sector;
(b) difficulties regarding participation of local populations; (c) lower-than-
expected reductions in unit costs; (d) failure to obtain agreement on, and
subsequently use, the extensive technical assistance that would be essential
if the project is to succeed; (e) failure to carry out the training program;
and (f) inappropriate M&E, which would considerably reduce the benefits. The
project -- which is a pilot operation -- is designed to address these issues:
to help strengthen institutions in the sector, to reduce costs, and to find
means to work with local populations.   During project preparation and
appraisal, emphasis has been placed on the technical assistance and training
components; the recruitment process is now well advanced. Special emphasis
has been given to NO6K in the design of the project. GOA is also aware of the
crucial importance that these components play and will fully support them.
Finally, there is the risk associated with undertaking a project that deperds
partly for its success on the presence of a decentralized and more market-
oriented system, when the Algerian economic system is ltself undergoing such
profound change.  Fortunately, GOA has shown a strong commitment to its
overall economic reform program. !t is likely, therefore, that the economic
environment in which the project will be implemented will be conducive to the
success of the project.
16.  Recomendatim. I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with
the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the loan.
