      satisfactory. The principals lessons drawn from the project\n            are: a) Flexibility during implementation is critical in\n            response to new and pressing developments in the education\n            sector. b) Great weight should be given to assessing\n            implementation capacity in the sector and the project should\n            be kept simple and focused where implementation capacity is\n            a concern. c) Successful institutional development\n            initiatives require sustained assistance in the course of\n            successive projects. d) Implementation of this project\n            underscores the need to have a full complement of\n            implementation staff in place before a project is launched.\n            The Project Implementation Unit did not have technical staff\n            with the requisite qualification when the project was\n            initiated. This resulted in delaying project start-up by\n            more than a year, which in turn resulted in the need to\n            extend the closing date by two years."}, "docdt": "1998-12-29T00:00:00Z"}
