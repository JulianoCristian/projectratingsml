   improvement of its financial situation and of the existing\n            services; as well as (2) a sound long-term development of\n            the sector. Because the government requested that the post\n            be kept under the same entity as telecommunications, postal\n            services would also be included in this effort. The project\n            would include the following components: (a) establishment of\n            a new post and telecommunications (P&T) Entity with\n            legal and financial autonomy; (b) preparation of a 5-year\n            investment program for the P&T Entity; and (c)\n            improvement of technical training at the P&T school in Yaounde."}, "docdt": "1981-11-30T00:00:00Z"}
