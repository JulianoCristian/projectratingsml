Some lessons\n            learned include: Government of Laos (GoL) has played an\n            irreplaceable role in terms of making unwavering commitment,\n            getting the policies right and staying the course. The\n            government set clear targets for electricity access and\n            developed an institutional framework and financing and\n            monitoring mechanisms to ensure the achievement of the\n            target in a timely and effective manner.
