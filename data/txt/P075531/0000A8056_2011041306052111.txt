                         Implementation Status Overview
                         All 12 sub-components of the Rural Electrification Phase I Project (REP I) of the Government's two-phase Rural Electrification Adaptable Program Loan (APL), with co-financing from
                         Norad, are nearly complete, with all 24 triggers for moving to the Rural Electrification Phase II Project (REP II) of the APL Program being met or exceeded. The Project Development
                         Objectives and GEF Objectives are likely to be achieved (and exceeded) by completion as measured by the key performance indicators. The only indicators not achieved so far are:
                         (i) the number of households with access to grid-electricity, with 40,590 achieved compared to the target of 42,000; and (ii) the number of households electrified with off-grid
                         renewable energy, with 9,900 achieved compared to the target of 10,000. The reason for the shortfall is a financing gap caused by a major price escalation in 2007-2008. To close
                         the financing gap and scale up the project, Australian bilateral assistance (AusAID) has provided additional financing of US$9.42 million for grid extension and off-grid electrification.
                         These AusAID-supported activities are expected to be completed by December 2011, or three months before the current closing date. The additional financing will connect 19,500
                         more households to grid electricity and will connect 5,000 more households to off-grid electricity, exceeding the project targets by about 25% and 50% respectively.
                         Regarding the financial sustainability of the project, the Tariff Adjustment Plan for 2005-2010 agreed at appraisal has been fully implemented, which helped Electricite du Laos (EdL)
                         achieve cost recovery and profits since 2007.
