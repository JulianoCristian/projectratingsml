                                              AIDE MEMOIRE

1.       A joint World Bank/IFC/AusAID/Norad team1 carried out an implementation support mission in
Vientiane and Champasak province, Lao PDR from May 23-31, 2011 to assess the overall progress of
REP I and II and the implementation performance of various activities under both the EdL and MEM
components towards achievement of the development objectives and outcome targets set out in the
respective results frameworks.

2.      The team met with key government agencies including the Department of Electricity (DOE)
under Ministry of Energy and Mines (MEM), and Electricité du Laos (EDL). (See Annex 1 for a list of
persons met). The team wishes to record its appreciation to the management and staff of these agencies
for the cooperation and hospitality extended to its members, and in particular, to the Provincial
Department of Energy and Mines (PDEM) and EdL Branch in Champasak for a well organized and
informative field visit to on- and off-grid villages in Champasak province. This Aide Memoire
summarizes the findings of the mission and is subject to confirmation by the Bank management.

3.      As part of the Bank’s new Access to Information policy, the team discussed with the Client
whether the Aide Memoire would be publicly disclosed. It was agreed that this Aide Memoire would be
disclosed.

4.      The team proposes that the next implementation support mission take place in November/
December 2011 to coordinate with the submission of the quarterly progress reports. In this regard, the
team reminded EdL and DOE of the importance of submitting timely quarterly progress reports by EdL
and DOE as per the Financing Agreements. The Bank looks forward to receiving the next progress
reports for April to June 2011 by August 15, 2011.

1.      Project Development Objectives (PDOs). The REP I is the first phase of the Rural Electrification
Adaptable Program Loan (APL) Program. The PDOs of REP I are to (i) increase access to electricity of
rural households in villages of targeted provinces; and (ii) improve financial performance of the power
sector. Global Environment Objectives (GEOs) of REP I are (i) substantial adoption of off-grid
renewable energy in Government’s rural electrification program; and (ii) increased efficiency of energy
supply by EdL and consumption by customers, resulting in greenhouse gas emission reductions as
increased hydropower exports substitute for thermal power production in Thailand.

2.        Additional financing of US$9.42 million by the Australian Government through the Bank-
administered Mekong AusAID Energy Fund was signed on October 1, 2010. This additional financing
will fill a financing gap to achieve the targeted number of household connections to the grid, and finance
activities to scale up the project impact.

3.       Risks to PDO/GEO achievement. The progress towards achieving the PDO and GEO is rated
satisfactory as well as the overall implementation progress. However, the team raised its concern
regarding the risk to fully implementing the AusAID-financed activities within the closing date, and in
particular the DSM/EE component with EdL and the MEM components. Further details are provided in
Annex 2 for the IDA and GEF- financed components and Annex 3 for the AusAID-financed components.
The team urged EdL and DOE management to closely monitor the agreed actions and timetables to
prevent further slippages.

4.      Key Results Indicators. The majority of the key result indicators have successfully met the target.
The indicators which have not met the target, such as number of households connected through grid
extension and village hydro, were due to financing gap and shortages of fund experienced during project

                                                                                                         2
implementation. Nevertheless, it is expected that the key outcome indicator on number of households
connected will be surpassed due to AusAID additional financing and the highly satisfactory progress of
the P2P scale up program. See the full summary of Result Indicators in Annex 5.


5.      Overall Implementation Progress of EdL Component. Implementation of the original activities
funded by IDA, GEF and NORAD under the EdL Component are virtually completed. The
implementation progress for each component is summarized in more details in Annex 2. However, close
follow-up on the AusAID additional financing activities under EdL is required to ensure that they can be
fully implemented by the March 31, 2012 closing date (see Annex 3).

6.       Overall Implementation Progress of MEM component. Similar to the EdL component, virtually
all of the original activities under REP I have been completed (see Annex 2), but there is a risk that the
activities financed under AusAID will not be completed by the closing date. The teams stressed the
importance of adhering to the agreed procurement timetables as only 10 months remained before the REP
I closing date.

7.       Key issues in the implementation of MEM component identified during the previous mission
remain. This included: (i) guidelines for processing withdrawals of SHS by some of the customers are
not implemented yet; (ii) verification of inventories at PESCOs’ warehouse in provinces against DOE’s
records at Vientiane, which should be conducted on a regular basis, has not been conducted; and (iii)
some SHS customers complained that dis-functioning of the SHS or its parts reported to the PESCOs
were not addressed by the PESCOs in a long time. In addition, the team discussed the poor performance
of certain PESCOs in terms of remitting funds back to the REF. DOE agreed to initiate the termination
for the Khammoune PESCO (which has never deposited funds into the REF account). Because of the
poor performance of some PESCOs, the Bank requested DOE to revise the allocation by province for
solar home systems to take into account PESCO performance as well as reconcile the provincial plans
against the Renewable Energy Master Plan.

8.      Project Development Objectives. The PDOs of REP II are to: (a) increase access to electricity of
rural households in villages of project provinces; and (b) further improve the financial performance of
EdL. The global environmental objectives (GEO) of the GEF additional financing are to: (i) increase
efficiency of energy supply by EdL and consumption by consumers; and (ii) adopt substantial renewable
energy in the government’s rural electrification program.

9.       Risks to PDO/GEO achievement. The implementation progress is rated as marginally satisfactory
given the approximate one year delay in procurement vis-à-vis the dates in the project appraisal
document. As a result, no significant disbursements have taken place against a target disbursement of
$10.5 million (29%) by end FY11. Revised procurement timetables were agreed, and the team urged EdL
and DOE to undertake its best efforts to maintain the schedules to allow achievement of the project
objectives within the closing date. In addition, the team raised some concern about new government
arrears accumulating due to insufficient budget allocation by MOF and the rising arrears from irrigation.
These issues should be addressed in the Joint Committee set up by MOF.


10.      IFC Co-financing. The IFC financing agreement was signed in July 2010, and EdL is taking the
steps to complete the Conditions of Disbursements as discussed below. IFC will follow overall IDA’s
policy and procedure in terms of procurement and social and environmental safeguards, however, being a
corporate loan, the (use) disbursement of IFC loan is flexible as long as it is earmarked for REP II.
Disbursement will be (made) available, upon completion of relative Conditions of Disbursement (CODs),
proportionally with IDA’s component subject to the amounts and timeline as agreed among involved
parties. There are some CODs that remain to be completed by EDL before the first disbursement can be
made including: (i) proposed name of bank where DSRA will be established; (ii) submission of all
evidences for payment made for related IFC fees and legal fees; (iii) proposed timetable for
disbursements; and (iv) a certificate of compliance issued by EdL's auditors in accordance with section
5.01 (c) of the IFC-EdL Loan agreement.

11.     Norad Co-financing. Norad grant agreement which provides parallel financing to REP II was
signed by the Norwegian Government and the MOF on August 3, 2010. The implementation of the
Norad-financed activities will be managed as an integral part of the implementation of the REP II. The
team reminded EdL and DOE that Norad is to be used for technical assistance and capacity building and
consultants’ services must be selected using the Bank’s guidelines. The Bank has agreed to review the
TORs, RfPs and draft negotiated contracts on behalf of Norad, but the agencies will need to seek final
approval from Norad as per Article VIII of the Norad legal agreement. (See Annex 6 for further details on
NORAD-financed activities.)

12.      GEF Additional Financing. GEF provided US1.818 million of additional financing in order to
scale up the impact of REP II and to achieve global environmental benefits. The activities under GEF
support include: improving energy efficiency in both the electricity supply and consumption, promoting
adoption of renewable energy in the government’s rural electrification program, and supporting project
implementation. (See Annex 6 for more details.) The GEF Grant Agreement was signed on May 5, 2011.
The team requested EdL and MOF to amend the Subsidiary Financing Agreement to include the EdL
portion (US$999,000) of the GEF Grant in order to meet the condition of effectiveness no later than July
1, 2011.



                                                                                                       4
13.      Overall implementation progress. There has been no significant progress to report on REP II
activities due to procurement delays. The team has been working closely with EdL and DOE to
accelerate the procurement of the large value contracts, and several bid documents (for grid extension and
solar home systems) are expected to be issued next month in June.

Component A.1 Grid Extension. The progress of EdL’s grid extension activity is shown in the table
below. The total number of households connected under REP I (including AusAID additional financing
and P2P) is 49,3972 which is 117% over the outcome indicator target of 42,000 households. A total of
570 villages have been connected over the target of 540 – a 106% increase.

Power to the Poor. Considerable progress has been made in the implementation and scale-up of the P2P
project following the initial pilot in Champasak province which connected 537 households using GEF and
EdL funds. Following the success of the pilot, it was agreed that AusAID additional financing would
contribute $600,000 under REP I and IDA would contribute another $600,000 under REP II. As of end
April 2011, a total of 16,692 households have been connected as part of P2P with 14,680 households
connected in the South and 1,952 households connected in the North. The total number of female headed
household supported is 1,042 and the total number of households with disabled is 535. P2P is active in
488 villages in 16 provinces both in the North and the South. The team discussed various recommended
changes to the P2P reporting format to clarify which connections would be eligible under REP I AusAID
additional financing and under REP II IDA financing and to reword some of the headings for clarity. This
would also prevent double counting of household connected under REP I vs REP II. In addition, the team
requested that the report include information on the financial status of the P2P revolving fund and agreed
to work with the P2P team to finalize the requested changes. The team informed EdL that the Financing
Agreement as well as the Disbursement letter for AusAID and REP II will have to be amended to allow
use of funds for replenishment of the P2P revolving fund. As a disbursement condition for P2P, the team
discussed the need to update the P2P Operations Manual to include guidelines to govern the operation and
use of the P2P revolving fund. It was agreed that a short term consultant be hired for this purpose.
Finally, the team would like to record its appreciation for the timely and regular reporting by the P2P unit.

 It is noted that this figure also includes the connection for P2P households to be reimbursed under REP II;
however, EdL is verifying the exact figure.

Component A.2 Loss Reduction. The procurement of domestic and commercial revenue meters and
calibration and testing equipment, with an estimated amount of USD 491,000, had to be rebid (with the
exception of one lot for which EdL awarded a contract for $19,203 for the supply of measuring
equipment). To the extent that all of the goods cannot be delivered by the REP I closing date, the
contracts can be co-financed with REP II to allow more time. See Annex 6 for additional details on the
A.2 Loss Reduction component.

Component A.3 IT System. There is not much progress in the roll out of the Accounting and Financial
Management System (AFMS):
    Modification of the AFMS to cope with the new chart of account and correction of some errors
      has been completed by the Chinese consulting firm, who first installed the AFMS.
    Installation of all six modules of AFMS (G/L, A/R, A/P, Inventory, Fixed Asset and payroll)
      together with the Billing System at 4 EDL branches (Bolikhamxay, Savannekhet, Salavanh and
      Champasak).
    Partial installation of two modules of AFMS (Inventory and Fixed Assets) together with the
      Billing System at the other 13 EDL branches.

REP II will provide continued support to complete the roll out of the AFMS.

Suspense Account. The outstanding balance as of May 2011 is 858,372,200 Kip (compared to 1 billion
Kip as of August 2010). EDL has requested to offset this balance with the longest outstanding debts.
MOF, however, has requested EDL to first refund this amount to MOF, and MOF will then pay it back to
EDL. The team suggests EDL to negotiate with the MOF one more time whether the offset can be done,
otherwise, EDL should follow MOF instruction in order to clear the balance in the suspense account and
some long outstanding debts.

Component A.4 Tariff Reform. In line with the “Action Plan for Financial Sustainability of the Power
Sector” endorsed by the Prime Minister in 2005, the Prime Minister Office has approved annual average
increase for tariff adjustment. However, in order to implement the plan, there is a need for PMO approval
of the detailed implementation plan, which will include increase rate for different customer categories.
EDL had prepared the detail plan, which was endorsed by MEM and submitted to PMO, but the plan has
not yet been approved by PMO. The team urged EDL and MEM to closely follow up with the PMO on
the approval.

Component A.5 Safeguards Capacity Building. The Safeguards Capacity Building componenet had
been designed to enhance EdL’s (and MEM’s) capacity in environment and social assessment and impact
assessment through training, study tours and acquisition of necessary equipment. International consultants

environment and social management for technical staffs and managers. A training program and a study
tour in Thailand was organized for managers in April 2010 and a training program and a study tour in
NT2 was organized for technical staffs in May, 2010. The activities under this component were fully
completed.

Positive outcomes of this Component were demonstrated by the excellent performance of the
Environmental and Social Office of EdL, as (i) the office have completed independently the field survey
and consultation and updated the EIA/EMP/RAP for a new Bank-funded 230 kV transmission and
substation line project, managed the local disclosure process satisfactory to the Bank safeguard review;
(ii) a satisfactory/highly satisfactory performance in safeguard management for a Bank-funded 115 kV
transmission line under construction, as concluded by the field visit of the Bank Safeguard Specialist
during this mission.

MEM Component

Component B.1 Off-grid Investment Program. Follow up from the last mission, for the 4 units of SHS
reported as lost in April 2008 while being transported by VOPS to PESCO, PESCO has refunded 50% of
the costs to DOE in September 2009 and the other 50% was offset with the bonus paid to the PESCO in
January 2010. In addition, DOE has not submitted the guidelines for withdrawn SHSs as agreed during
the last mission. The mission emphasized that the guidelines should be in place before the installation of
next batch of solar home systems to be funded by AusAID and REP II. It was agreed that the TOR for
local VOPS consultant to be hired under REP II will also include developing withdrawal guidelines and
verify the actual stock of withdrawn SHSs as reported by PESCO.

Component B.2. Institutional Strengthening – VOPS Management Contract. Execution of the
contract was fully completed. The consultant has completed (i) implementation support to DOE in
management of the SHS program, achieving 100% of the program targets on time; (ii) assessment of the
cost and efficiency of the implementation arrangement for SHS program and provided recommendations
on improvement, including recommendations on regulatory modifications of cost and charges for PESCO
services, and monthly charges for consumer payment, which were adopted by MEM; (iii) identification of
nine new PESCOs and training of new PESCOs, which have delivered the targeted SHS installation under
Component B.1 and are managing the operations of the installed SHS systems in their licensed provinces;
(iv) development of delivery models for micro hydropower technologies for off-grid electrification and
completed feasibility study for 13 micro hydropower projects side, for solicitation of private investment.
The VOPS has updated the Off-grid Operation Manual incorporating the regulatory changes and delivery
models for micro hydro and has fullfilled in full as a result of performance evaluation of the Quality
Insurance (QA) Surveyor, an international firm hired as an independent monitor for checking and
verifying the performance of the VOPS Contractor. Upon completion of the VOPS Contract, DOE has
conducted a full assessment of the performance of the VOPS Consultant with assistance of the Quality
Assurance Surveyor and paid bonus to the VOPS Contractor for excellent performance as specified in the
contract.



                                                                                                       11
Off-grid Customer Database. The mission was informed that the VOPS Manager developed by the
VOPS Consultant is no longer used due to insufficient information provided in the system and difficult to
operate. The FM Consultant has developed the REF Management System. The functions currently
provided in the completed portion include:
     Keep track of the monthly inflow and outflow in aggregated amounts;
     PESCO’s performance indicators;
     Monthly movement transactions in terms of units and amounts, such as new customers to be
         installed to calculate the planning and installation fees, no. of customers and amounts collected to
         calculate the net inflow, etc.

The portion to be developed will be the off-grid customer database to track the customer movement in
detail by customer and provide the outstanding debt per customer. In order to obtain the complete
customer database, a lot of data will need to be re-entered in the new system. As most of PESCO do not
have computer skill, the mission recommends that some staff be recruited to handle the data entering at
the central level.

Component B.2 Institutional Strengthening - Quality Assurance (QA) Surveyor. The final report of
the QA surveyor was submitted in June 2010. Activities have been completed and no further updates
required.
Component B.3 Alternative RE Delivery Models. The revised Rural Electrification Fund (REF)
Operation Manual was endorsed by the MEM in May 2010. However it has not been translated into Lao
language. DOE plans to further update the Operations Manual and translate to Lao language by the end of
2011, using remaining funds from GEF under REP1.
Component B.4 Rural Electrification Master Plan and Database. The consultant contract for Rural
Electrification Master Plan was completed by September 2010 as originally planned. The final workshop
was held in July 2010 and was attended by the Bank team.
Component B.5 Sector Financing Strategy. Activities completed and no further updates from the last
Aide Memoire.

Disbursements. As of May 29, 2011, the cumulative disbursements amounted to:

           IDA Grant H2180 - SDR 6.283 million (US$ 9.509 million equivalent) out of the total
            original IDA Grant of SDR 7 million (89.76%),
           GEF Grant TF056700 - US$ 3.749 million out of total GEF Grant of US$ 3.75 million
            (99.98%)
           AusAID Grant TF096084 - US$5.862 million out of total AusAID Grant of US$9.42 million
            (62.23%)

        Due to overruns in some categories under IDA Grant H2180, the reallocation has been approved
by the Bank since February 2011. For some reasons, the revised allocations have not yet been reflected in
the Client Connection, the Bank concerned department has been noticed and the revision should be made
very soon. According to the current exchange rate, the Project has exchange gain of $650,000 from IDA

                                                                                                          12
Grant H2180. The team recommends that the two IAs should monitor closely the movement of the
exchange rate and come up with the agreed plan to utilize the exchange gain within the closing date of
March 2012. The team noted that the disbursement grace period up to 4 months has not been provided for
both IDA Grant H2180 and GEF Grant TF056700, internal process will be arranged by the team with the
Bank concerned department soon.

        Under AusAID Grant, the funds provided to EDL are to finance several large goods and
consultant contracts which can be paid via direct payments or special commitments, therefore, no
designated account (DA) will be opened by EDL. For DOE, a small amount of DA ($30,000) will be
opened to pay the consultants.

        Management of REF Reflow Account for P2P. The amount pre-financed by EDL for payment
of coupons under P2P activity as of May 2011 amounting to approximately US$1.1 million, together with
US$60,000 under pilot project has not been reimbursed to the Project. The mission was informed that a
separate bank account has been set up to hold the repayment of 20,000 kip per month from the households
under P2P activity. The mission has consulted internally with the Bank concerned departments for the
amendment of the Grant Agreement to allow the reimbursement of the amount pre-finance by EDL under
sub-loan category, which is currently not available. Once it is done, the pre-financed amount can be
reimbursed by EDL using the SOE form, no supporting document is to be attached to the withdrawal
application.

        Interim Financial Reports (IFRs). The quarterly IFRs have been submitted with delays by both
EDL and DOE. The mission would like to remind EDL that the financing agreement requires that
quarterly IFRs be submitted to the Bank within 45 days after the end of each quarter.

        The Discussion of Progress Report prepared by DOE outlined several serious issues, some of
which have been outstanding for long and raised during the previous missions, but have not yet been
addressed. The mission strongly recommends that the appropriate measures should be developed to
address these issues:

          Several advances by the Project Manager amounted to US$7,870 have been outstanding for
           long time, some of them are outstanding since last year. In addition, the expenses to attend
           the SD week in Washington D.C. in February 2010 by four project staff has not yet been
           reimbursed to the project. The mission recommends that all advances should be cleared
           within 10 days after the end of the activity, the longer the advance is outstanding, the more
           possibility that the supporting document cannot be provided. For the claim of overseas
           travel, all supporting document are required, except for per diem which is to be provided at
           the rate not exceed the Bank provided to its own staff. Please refer to the previous aide
           memoire for more detail.
          The current collection scheme for small equipment, e.g. 20w SHS, does not support the
           sustainability of the REF Reflow Account. The expenditures incurred from installation of the
           small equipment scales are much less than the total inflow, hence, resulted in negative inflow.
           The DOE should carefully review the collection scheme to ensure the sustainability of the
           REF Reflow Account so that the customers can benefit the most from such system even after
           the withdrawal of the donor support.
          Since the departure of the VOPS contractor from January 2010, the inflows to the REF
           Reflow Account (the amount collected and transferred by PESCOs) has been reduced
           significantly ($7,000 per quarter compared to $9,000 per month). It is noted that some
           PESCOs transferred only 1-2 times since January 2010, more than 50% of PESCOs did not
           transfer any collection during the first quarter of 2011 (January to March 2011). The new

                                                                                                       13
           VOPS should be selected as soon as possible to resume the administrative and monitoring
           tasks. During this period, DOE should monitor and follow up all issues closely, proper action
           should be taken immediately to investigate and resolve the issues.
          During the field visit to Champasak, the mission met with Champasak PESCO, and was
           informed that he has not transferred the fund collected from the customers to the REF Reflow
           Account since October 2010, as he is not happy that he has not received bonus, which should
           have been paid since June 2010. According to DOE, one bonus has been paid by VOPS in
           January 2010 to all PESCOs, which should be the bonus for the year 2009. The DOE is
           currently working on the bonus to be paid for the year 2010. The mission recommends that
           DOE communicate clearly with all PESCOs when bonus for the year 2010 will be paid and
           all PESCOs should be requested to clear all debts.
          Currently, there are several PESCOs with very poor performance which seldom or have never
           transferred the funds collected from the customers to REF Reflow Account since the absent
           of the VOPS – Khammouane, Borkeow, Savannakhet, Sekong, Xayabuli – Paklai and
           Vientiane. The poor performance PESCOs should be evaluated and terminated. However,
           the terminated PESCOs should be forced to clear all the outstanding debts, The mission
           recommends that the DOE should consider whether any mechanisms should be added to the
           existing PESCO selection criteria in order to prevent such problems occurring in the future,
           such as DOE staff be assigned to responsible for following up closely with PESCO during the
           selection period of the new VOPS, interest to be charged if funds are not transferred within
           certain period, performance bond to be requested from PESCO, etc.
          Significant increase in PESCO debts with total balance of 471 million Kip as of March 2011
           (150 million Kip as of June 2010 and 358 million Kip as of December 2010). The DOE
           should investigate the reason and a mutually agreed timeframe should be agreed for the
           settlement of the outstanding debts. In addition, the PESCOs should be requested to confirm
           the amount owed to the DOE quarterly, any discrepancy can then be investigated and
           resolved promptly.
          The cumulative withdrawn equipments as of March 2011 was reported as 2,728 units
           (increased from 2,140 units in June 2010). Proper procedures have not yet been developed
           for the administrative of the withdrawn equipments, such as confirmation of the withdrawn
           equipment kept by PESCO, physical count by VOPS to check the existence and working
           condition, etc.


        Audit of FY2009. Two separate audit reports were submitted to the Bank for MEM and EDL
components on June 30, and July 6, 2010 respectively. The audit opinions are unqualified. The audit
report of EDL entity has just been submitted to the Bank on November 5, 2010 and the audit opinion is
unqualified. The management letter of EDL entity has just been submitted to the Bank during the mission
(on May 25, 2011), and outlined several weaknesses in internal control and operational procedures which
should be brought to the management attention as follows:

          No aging report was prepared for accounts receivable, BS-2000 system is not able to generate
           the complete aging report. Allowance for long outstanding debt was only providd at 3% of
           total revenue excluding export sales.
          No formal debt collection procedures in place. There are written policies and procedures on
           debt collection. Different branches have different methods in collecting debts and there is no
           follow by head office on the results of debt collection.
          There is a difference of 817 million Kip between the balances of accounts receivable per
           general ledger (G/L) and billing system (BS-2000) at VTE Municipality.



                                                                                                      14
           In July 2009, EDL made late payment for the personal income tax to the tax authorities. In
            December 2009, incorrect amount was paid, and the different was settled in March 2010.
           No segregation of duties between the staff who verifies the meter to the staff who records the
            details before posting in the system at VTE Province. The preparer and the verifier were the
            same person.
           Fixed asset register is not updated.
           The depreciation expense for the new fixed asset acquired during the month is calculated as if
            the asset is acquired on the first of the month.
           There was no specific vehicle log book maintained for all of the motor vehicles of the
            Company.
           No reconciliation was performed for Capital in Progress (CIP) transferred.
           No insurance have been purchased for all the motorcycles kept in Nam Nguen 1.

       Audit of FY2010. For EDL, E&Y has been appointed by EDL as its auditor for FY2010 and
FY2011. The audit field work has almost finished and the audit report is expected by the deadline of
June 30, 2011.

For MEM, the previous auditor has been subsequently evaluated as not acceptable to the Bank, therefore,
after the end of the audit contract, MEM is requested to select a new auditor. However, the selection
process has been carried out slowly until recently. The audit report is not expected by June 30, 2011.

Annex 3: REP I AusAID Additional Financing - Implementation Progress and Agreed Actions

The Grant Agreement for the AusAID additional financing for REP I was signed on October 1, 2010 and
became effective on October 14, 2010. The AusAID financing of US$9.42 million was to fill in a
financing gap on grid extension in order achieve the project outcome of connecting 42,000 households
and to scale up the impact of several other components. The table below presents AusAID financed
activities, associated targets.

Component A.1 Grid Extension (US$6.24 million). EdL has signed seven contracts for goods and
materials for the AusAID-supported grid extension for a total value of $5,995,271. Construction of the
grid extension has commenced and completion is expected by end of September 2011. It is expected that
7475 out of the target of 11,500 household connections will be achieved by March 31, 2012, with the
remainder to be achieved under P2P. The number of household connections as of May 2011 is reported to
be 1,874. Progress of household connections for each of the target provinces is summarized in the table
below.

Power to the Poor (P2P) (US$0.6 million): In the past, EdL has been reporting that P2P connections in
the northern provinces would be covered under AusAID. To date, 1, 952 households have been
connected in the north. However, there is no reason that AusAID financing should be restricted to the
North and the team discussed with EdL to modify its reporting to allow all households connected from
October 1, 2010 (the signing date of Ausaid) through March 31, 2012 to be claimed as P2P connections
under REP I AusAID up to an amount of $600,000. It was agreed that EdL would submit the new
reporting tables by mid June with the revised figures. The team also expressed its satisfaction that the
P2P unit is including data on female headed HHs and HHs with people with disabilities in its reporting.

During the mission, it was discovered that the Financing Agreement and Disbursement Letter would need
to be amended in order to allow disbursement of P2P as a subloan as the current withdrawal schedule only
includes disbursement categories for goods and consultants’ services. It was agreed that EdL would
formally request an amendment to the Financing Agreements for both AusAID additional financing and
REP II by June 15, 2011. The team also discussed the need for the Operations Manual to be updated to
include provisions for the use of the P2P revolving fund which would be a condition for disbursement.
Once this is completed, EdL can request to be reimbursed for households connected on or after October 1,
2010 (the signing date of the Grant Agreement).

Component A.6 DSM and EE (US$0.1 million). Building on earlier activities, it was agreed that EdL
would appoint ten energy coordinators under the AusAID additional financing to continue implementing
energy efficiency initiatives in government buildings and in doing so, support the DSM/EE activities to
be supported under REP II. Following the Bank’s no objection to sole source IIEC provided on May 29,
2011, EdL agreed to immediately contact IIEC to finalize the draft contract and submit such contract
(using the sample contract for small assignments provided) to the Bank no later than June 15, 2011.
(IIEC was the original firm recruited to assist EdL in implementing the DSM/EE component under REP I.
The Bank agreed to a sole source selection for IIEC during an interim period of Phase 1B and Phase 2 to
prepare protocols, specifications and bidding documents of low-cost and medium-cost EE measures for
46 public sector buildings, to assist the DSM Cell to recruit new energy coordinators (ECs), and to scope
out and prepare Phase 2 implementation plan.) The team stressed the urgency of mobilizing IIEC as soon
as possible so that they can assist EdL in recruiting and managing the energy coordinators. AusAID
financing can be used to finance the EC contracts up to March 31, 2011 after which they can be financed
using Norad funds under REP II.

The timetable below was agreed with EdL for appointing IIEC and hiring the energy co-ordinators:
       1. IIEC draft contract sent to Bank                    June 15, 2011
       2. Mobilization of IIEC                                July 1, 2011
       3. Contract ten energy coordinators                    July 31, 2011
       4. Completion of recruitment and training              September 30, 2011
            program for energy coordinators
       5. End of IIEC assignment                              December 31, 2011


                                                                                                       17
Component B.1 Off-grid Investment for Solar Home Systems (US$2.0 million). It was agreed that
DOE would prepare a single bid document to procure about 15,000 SHSs in two lots for a total estimated
cost of $6 million ($2 million from AusAID financing under REP I and $4 million under REP II3).
Unfortunately, the bid document has experienced protracted delays. The Bank received the revised draft
bid document on April 18, 2011 and provided preliminary comments on the commercial terms on May
24, 2011 to allow DOE to respond with an alternative proposal on its desire to request the supplier to
submit a sample. It is expected that the no objection to the bid document will be issued by June 3, 2011.
The team raised its serious concern that further slippages in the revised procurement timetable could
result in the goods not being delivered by the REP I closing date of March 31, 2011 and urged DOE to
undertake its best efforts to adhere to the agreed schedule below. In addition, it was agreed that the
delivery schedule for Lot 1 would be 90 days and the spare parts would be moved to Lot 2.

In addition, the team queried the proposed allocation of SHS by province in the bid document since about
25% of the SHS are expected to be installed in Khommoune, Savannakhet and Xayabir provinces for
which the PESCOs have been particularly poor performers and have failed to remit funds to DOE.
Therefore, DOE agreed to re-evaluate the allocation of SHSs by province in order to reconcile the
provincial requests with both the RE Master Plan and the performance of PESCOs by September 15,
2011 to allow sufficient time for the PESCOs to submit their cluster plans. In order not to delay the
issuance of the bid document, the team reserved the right to discuss and agree with DOE the final
breakdown by province before the final contract is signed.

Component B.3 Alternative RE Delivery Model - Micro Hydropower Schemes (US$0.28 million). In
December 2009, DOE appointed IFC as lead transaction advisor to assist in the implementation of a pilot
PPP (Public Private Partnership) transaction to electrify a number of villages using micro hydro systems.

3
 During the mission, it was subsequently agreed that $300,000 under REP II should be reserved to support the PPP
microhydro pilot schemes in Houaphan province. In this regard, it is noted that bid document allows for variation of
+/- 33 percent.

                                                                                                                 18
While this procurement method is common for large infrastructure projects internationally, it will be the
first time this model is has been attempted for such small investments, or in Lao PDR at all. The IFC TA
is split into 2 phases – Phase 1 covers a technical review of potential sites, legal and regulatory review,
and transaction structuring; Phase 2 covers implementing a competitive tender to select a private investor.

IFC Phase 1 Transaction Structuring Report was submitted in December 2010. The report recommended
moving forward with two pilot public private partnership (PPP) microhydro schemes in Houaphan
province as follows:

    1. Paonuea Village Micro Hydro Facility and Distribution System: 119 households, system capacity
       21.4 kW (equivalent to 180 watts x no. of households)
    2. Paotai Village Micro Hydro Facility and Distribution System: 102 households, system capacity
       18.36 kW (equivalent to 180 watts x no. of households)

DOE would select a private partner to construct and operate these two micro hydro systems in Houaphan
province. The partner will be selected through a fully transparent competitive tender with a single bid
criterion: capital subsidy needed. The estimate for total REF funds needed is approximately $500,000.
This is split in two components:

       A fixed "Availability Payment" of approximately $50,000 per year for the life of the project (5
        years)
       A "Capital Subsidy" payable at the beginning of the project. The amount will depend on the bids
        received, but is expected to total about $275,000.

There is $280,000 available under REP I AusAID additional financing to finance the capital subsidy (as
long as the payments become due prior to the March 31, 2012 closing date) and another approximate
$300,000 under REP II IDA financing. The team pointed out to IFC and DOE that at least the last two
years of the availability payment will fall outside of the REP II closing date of June 30, 2014. Therefore,
these payments would need to be financed from the REF account. It was agreed that IFC would develop a
projection of estimated REF monthly payment obligations between now and the end of the concession to
inform how much AusAID, IDA and REF reflow funds would be utilized.

During the mission, IFC, DOE and the Bank discussed the draft Bidding Memorandum, License
Certificates and License Terms and Conditions. Based on these discussions, IFC will revise the
documents and advertise this week for potential bidders to comment on the draft transaction document.

Given the time needed to appoint the evaluation committee, it was agreed that DOE would initiate the
process to appoint the committee immediately and ensure that before confirming the members that they
would be available during the evaluation period.

Component B.3 Alternative RE Delivery Model - Pilot Biomass/Biogas Power Plant (US$0.1
million). DOE proposed to focus this activity on a pilot biogasification plant using pig manure and
proposed to extend Chiang Mai University’s current contract to cover the detailed design for and
construction supervision of such a plant. During the last mission, it was agreed that AusAID would fund
the detailed design, preparation of technical specifications of the plant for the pilot demonstration site
within the available budget. In the previous mission of September 2010, DOE had agreed to submit the
TOR/estimated budget for the detailed design and the preparation of the technical specifications for the
Bank review by September 30, 2010.

Given the delays in submitting the TOR, the team discussed a revised scope for the assignment that would
include the above mentioned activities in addition to the development of financial model to assess the
sustainability of the scheme and size of required subsidy, environment and social impact assessment,
calculation of environmental benefits in terms of GHG emission reductions (for GEF purposes), proposed
contractual arrangements, and the design of a monitoring report for farmers to regularly report to DOE on
key performance parameters. The first phase of the work would cover four pig farms in order to ensure
that at least one demonstration project was constructed under Phase 2. During the first phase of work, the
consultant would propose a methodology for selecting farms in a transparent and competitive manner
since a government subsidy would be involved if the biogasification programme was scaled up beyond
the initial demonstration project(s). Phase 2 of the work would include the supply and installation for at
least one pilot demonstration project. DOE agreed to submit a draft TOR, cost estimate and justification
for the sole source selection of Chiang Mai University no later than June 30, 2011. The procurement
schedule is as follows:

Component B.6 Organization Strengthening of DOE (US$0.1 million). The international procurement
consultant to support DOE under REP as well as to support another department of MEM under the Bank’s
Hydro Mining Technical Assistance Project (HMTA) was mobilized in January 2011. The contract is for
a total of 12 man months over an 18 month period. The team learned that DOE has been financing 50%
of the contract under REP II Norad financing instead of AusAID additional financing under REP I. The
team instructed DOE to finance 100% of the payments under AusAID additional financing from now
until the closing date (March 31, 2012) and from thereon, pay 100% under HMTA. The team also
requested DOE to provide an estimate of the payments due between now and March 31, 2012 to
determine how much excess funds from the $100,000 may be unused under the contract.

Annex 4: REP I Status of the Implementation of the Action Plan for Financial Sustainability of the
                                  Power Sector (2005-2010)

Implementation of the Action Plan for Financial Sustainability of the Power Sector (2005-2010) is on
track. Status of agreed actions is summarized in the sections below.

1.      Annual Tariff Adjustment. The tariff adjustment for 2010 according to the Tariff Adjustment
Plan (2005-2010) endorsed by MEM in 2005 is on track. Following the Bank’s comments during the last
supervision mission, EdL submitted the updated Tariff Adjustment Plan with an annual average increase
of 6% in the next five years (2011-2016) with reduced amount of capital investment by EdL to around
US$ 758 million for MEM’s approval in May 2010. The Plan has been submitted to the Prime Minister
Office by MEM, but not yet approved by PMO. The team urged EDL and MEM closely follow up the
PMO approval.

2.       Settlement of Arrears. For settlement of the Government arrears up to September 2005, LAK 113
billion, payments from MOF to EdL over 2005 through 2009 were in line with the settlement plan agreed
between the two (see Table below). Due to insufficient budget allocated by MoF to settle the annual
consumption, the total arrears as per April 2011 remains LAK 84,821 billion. MoF has committed to
allocate another LAK 38 billion to settle the verified arrears before September 2011. The table below
shows the latest status of government arrear.

3.      Arrears from Irrigation continues to increase from the last mission. The accumulated arrears as
of June 2010 were LAK 70 billion. To reach an agreement on settlement of the arrears and solutions for
preventing new irrigation arrears from occurring, EdL held a workshop in June 2010 with concerned
government agencies to discuss the issues and possible solutions, including installation of pre-paid
meters. A committee led by MoF and comprising representatives from EdL HQ, EdL branch offices,
MOF, Ministry of Agriculture, and Prime Minister Office was set up to collect data and provide
recommendations. The draft report has been prepared and will be shared with the Bank. The main
findings are as follows:
        (a) Water consumption rate has been set unreasonably, which could not cover the electricity
             consumption for pumping water;
        (b) Water use fee collected has been used for other purpose than electricity bill settlement; and
        (c) Inefficiency of irrigation systems.


                                                                                                          22
4.     The committee will meet on June 1 to discuss on the findings and make recommendation to the
government. The Bank advises that the committee should look at three aspects:
           (a) policy issue: will government provide subsidy to farmers covering electricity for
               irrigation water, if so, government should allocate government budget to finance such
               subsidy. Being a services provider, EDL should not cover the subsidy.
           (b) collection system: find out if EDL can collect the electricity bill directly for the water
               users;
           (c) getting data on actual water consumption by individual household..

5.       Demand Side Management and Energy Efficiency (DSM & EE). A DSM and EE Cell was
created within EdL and entered into full operation in the early stage of REP I implementation. All planned
training activities under REP I were completed. A DSM and EE Strategy was prepared and an action plan
including the first-stage no-cost and low-cost measures proposed for DSM/EE at major government
agency consumers was under implementation in four pilot buildings. Further implementation of the plan
will be done under REP II. Please see Part B on preparation of DSM/EE activities under REP II.

6.     Operational Efficiency. The system loss reduction activity under the rural Electrification APL
Program aims to reduce the system loss from more than 20% in 2005 to 17% by the end of the REP I and
13% by the end of REP II. During January to July 2010, the distribution system loss was reduced to
11.44%, achieving the REP II target.

                       Annex 6: REP II Implementation Progress by Component

Under REP II, IDA is financing goods and incremental operating costs (no technical assistance) for EdL
and DOE; IFC is financing grid extension with EdL; Norad is financing technical assistance and capacity
building for EdL and DOE; and GEF is financing goods, services, training and incremental operating
costs for components A.2(a), A.5, B.3, and B.5.

The overall implementation progress is rated as marginally satisfactory given the approximate one year
delay in procurement vis-à-vis the dates in the project appraisal document. As a result, no significant
disbursements have taken place against a target disbursement of $10.5 million by end FY11. Detailed
progress by component is discussed below.

EdL Component

Component A.1 Grid Extension (IDA US$14.6 million4 + IFC US$15 million; Norad $0.5 million for
TA). (a) installation and commission of MV and LV transmission lines, transformers, and house wiring
to cover about 27,700 households in the project provinces; and (b) provision of technical advisory
services to EdL in project implementation and supervision, and capacity building for economic and
financial evaluation, project management, and procurement.

It was agreed that the procurement for grid extension under REP II would be divided into 5 packages of
goods (funded by IDA and IFC) and one package of installation (funded by EdL). All goods packages
would be procured using ICB. EdL’s detailed project cost estimate submitted during the mission is as
follows:

The team proposed to EdL that it might wish to consider dividing the contracts between IDA and IFC as
opposed to having IDA and IFC co-finance each contract as it might reduce the administration burden on
EdL. For instance, IDA could finance REP 1/1, 1/2 and 1/3 and IFC could finance the remaining

 It was discussed that this amount could be reduced by $230,000 to pay for goods (VPN plus 17 servers) under
Component A.3 for Information Technology. However, as stated earlier, this would require an amendment to the
Financing Agreement as this component is currently not eligible under the IDA Financing Agreement.

                                                                                                               26
contracts; however, it is realized that at least one contract would need to be financed from both sources.
Regardless, EdL would follow WB procurement guidelines for all goods packages.

The procurement under this component has been delayed for almost one year. The bid opening date as
stated in the project appraisal document was June 2010. The revised procurement schedule is provided in
the table below. It is noted that for meters, the timeline might take one month longer since changes to the
technical specifications are required.

Power to the Poor. There is US$600,000 in IDA financing to scale up the impact of P2P under REP II.
During the mission, the team discovered that an amendment to the IDA Financing Agreement (as well as
to the AusAID Grant Agreement under REP I) is needed to allow the disbursements of “sub-loans” for
P2P credit schemes to poor households under the Project. In order to process this amendment, the team
requested the P2P team to submit by June 30, 2011 (i) the revised P2P operations manual which includes
an overview of the arrangements for the revolving fund and (ii) a list of households connected to date by
province and by month to determine the eligibility for reimbursement under REP I AusAID and REP II of
P2P credit schemes extended to date.

During the last mission, the P2P team raised questions about the availability of funds for the P2P scale-up
and proposed for the following activities and budget.

    No                             Description                              Budget Proposed (US$)
     1     Value of Credit Extended                                             495,500

           environmental group (Posters, Brochures, coupons,
     2     Manuals..)                                                             48,586
     3     Miscellaneous Costs (Awareness Materials, Transport)                   55,828
           Total Budget                                                          599,915

The team clarified that for items (2) and (3) above, IDA resources cannot be used to finance EdL staff
salaries working on P2P. To the extent that any of the items qualify under the definition of “incremental



                                                                                                        27
operating costs5”, expenditures up to US$100,000 can be reimbursed under the Project. The team further
clarified that this US$100,000 for IOC is for EdL as a whole and not specifically for the P2P unit, so the
P2P unit would need to reach agreement within EdL. All other expenses (including pick-up trucks) will
need to be covered by EdL’s own resources.

As per the Project Appraisal Document, Norad will finance technical assistance to EdL in (i) project
implementation and supervision; (ii) capacity building for economic and financial evaluation, project
management and procurement. During the mission, the team discussed with EdL the concept of having
the implementation supervision consultant also assist EdL to establish standardized specifications and
equipment for the whole of EdL. This would help EdL improve future tendering processes, do eliminate
the need for consultants to produce technical specifications, improve spare management of EdL, reduce
implementation and operation cost, and rationalize some of the domestic electricity market. EdL agreed
to submit a draft TOR for this consultancy no later than September 30, 2011.

Component A.2. Loss Reduction (IDA US$1 million; Norad US$0.68 million; GEF US$0.2 million):
(a) enhancement of EdL’s loss reduction efforts through the provision of goods to support the
implementation of prioritize investment projects recommended by the Loss Reduction Master Plan; and
(b) provision of technical advisory services to EdL for nontechnical loss reduction activities.

EdL’s proposal for financing under the Loss Reduction component is as follows:

       Project Activity                                  Category        Funding     Procurement        Budget
                                                                          Source       Method

       sets) and Megger Power Clamp 3 phase (35
       sets)
       Sub-total                                                                                       2,151,797

The team indicated that $200,000 of GEF financing for technical assistance on technical loss reduction is
missing from the above table. It was also clarified that the Norad budget is for loss reduction in general,
and not only nontechnical loss. In addition, some of the project activities above have been financed under
REP I and therefore can be removed the list – EdL to revise proposal.

It was agreed earlier that AusAID would finance a Bank-executed study for nontechnical loss reduction.
The Bank indicated that it would share a draft terms of reference for EdL comment no later than June 30,
2011. Norad financing could be used for consultancy services to assist/train EdL in implementing the
recommendations under the Bank-executed study.

  “Incremental Operating Costs” means reasonable expenditures directly related to the Project incurred by the
Recipient (which expenditures would not have been incurred absent the Project), including expenditures for Project
staff travel and per diem, office supplies, communications services (including telephone and internet costs),
publication services, translation services, maintenance of office equipment, and maintenance of vehicles, but
excluding civil services salaries of officials of the Recipient’s civil service.

                                                                                                                  28
Component A.3 IT System and Financial Management (Norad US$0.3 million): Provision of
technical advisory services to EdL to: (a) integrate the operation of EdL headquarters and branch offices
in the project provinces by making the existing information technology system fully operational; and (b)
strengthen its financial management through the information technology system, which includes
computerized billing and accounting systems.

Since the last mission, EdL has proposed the following budget for IT system under REP II:

1. IT Roll Out. Due to the limited number of IT staff to support the users during the conversion period
   and lack of powerful IT equipment to support the day-to-day activities, the EDL has proposed the
   action plan to continue the roll out of the Accounting and Financial Management System (AFMS) as
   follows:

       Acquire the virtual private network (VPN), internet network, which will allow the IT staff to
        access remotely to the user system, so that the problems can be investigated and solved timely.
        The budget is estimated at $50,000.
       Install new servers at all 17 branches which will provide more disk space as the existing server is
        run on PC which has limited disk space and caused the system not workable. The budget is
        estimated at $170,000.
       Engage local IT consultants to assist in system roll out. Enough IT consultants will be engaged
        and first trained by the EDL IT staff to get familiar with the EDL IT configurations and the
        AFMS. They will then assist to support the users during the conversion period at the provincial
        sites. The budget is estimated at $100,000.

2. Financial Model. Budget for updating the financial model according to the new Power Development
   Plan including training for EdL Staff (US$35,000)

It was agreed in principle that EdL would prepare a single bid document for the supply and installation
of the VPN plus 17 servers using the bidding document for goods by June 20, 2011 . However, the team
highlighted that this component is not eligible for financing by IDA under the Financing Agreement as it
was originally envisaged to only involve technical assistance – and all technical assistance was to be
financed by Norad. Therefore, unless EdL wishes to request an amendment to the Financing Agreement,
this equipment would need to be funded using EdL’s own resources. If an amendment is requested, EdL
FM Dept would need to discuss with the EdL Project Team for managing the Component A.1 to finalize
the IDA funding re-allocation of $320,000 to finance the goods under the IT System Component. For the
engagement of the IT consultants to be financed by Norad, the Bank recommends that the TOR should be
revised to incorporate in more detail the tasks to be performed, required mandate and expected timeframe
to complete the job at all provincial branches. EdL agreed to submit the TOR for the consulting services
for the Bank review by June 20, 2011. The team also advised EdL to initiate the procurement for the VPN
and 17 servers in parallel.

Component A.4. Safeguards Capacity Building (Norad US$0.25 million): Provide goods and training
to EdL and its provincial authority counterparts to strengthen their capacity in management of
environmental and social assessment and impacts associated with distribution and substation projects.


                                                                                                        29
Component A5. Demand-Side Management and Energy Efficiency Program (IDA US$0.3 million;
Norad US$0.75 million, GEF US$0.88 million): Provision to EdL of: (a) goods to support the
implementation of the action plan under the DSM and EE Master Plan; and (b) technical assistance to
implement the action plan.

With the budget available, the priority activities (most of them are in the table below) under the REP II fo
DSM and EE, include:
   (i)     Hire a firm (like IIEC under REP I) for (a) continuous capacity building of EdL’s DSM and
           EE Cell; (b) preparation of priority DSM/EE projects (hospitals, CFL, markets), including
           detailed auditing and design for investment, and support and supervise the implementation of
           these projects to be funded under REP II (with funding indicated above); (c) mentoring,
           training and supporting the energy coordinators to be hired by the DSM/EE Cell under this
           component;
   (ii)    Implementation of the projects (no cost and low cost) recommended by the Master Plan for
           DSM and EE developed by the international consultant under REP I;
   (iii)   Hiring the 10 energy coordinator, and more if needed, to (a) expand walk-through energy
           audit of more government office building in Vientiane and in provincial government as well;
           (b) help these government agencies at both central and provincial level to implement no-cost
           activities, and facilitate implementation of low-cost projects if budget is made available
           (either under this component or from government’s own budget)
   (iv)    Implementation of the priority investment projects as prepared under item (i), according to
           budget availability for investment; and
   (v)     Other activities as listed by the DSM and EE Cell.

 It was agreed that the Low-cost investment program at the central government office building as
recommended by the international consultant under REP I should be implemented as a priority. These
activities are targeting to energy saving at the central government agencies, which are the major consumer
default on electricity bill payment, and the MOF is also expecting EE program in these agencies to save
energy consumption so as to save budget allocation and reduce electricity arrears.

EdL proposed the following for financing under the project –the team has provided its preliminary

The Bank provided its no objection on May 29, 2011 to sole source IIEC for an estimated contract value
of $65,000 to: (1) help EdL recruit energy coordinators; (2) implementation of low-cost EE measures in
the 46 public sector buildings for which plans were developed during Phase 1B in 2009 under REP I; (3)
preparation of medium-cost EE measures in 50 public sector buildings; (4) preparation of a CFL program
proposal for the residential sector; and (5) preparation of DSM/EE Phase 2 scope of works.


MEM Component

Component B.1 Off-grid Investment Program (IDA US$4 million): Application of off-grid renewable
energy technologies, including solar home systems (SHSs) and pico-hydro to provide electricity to about
10,000 households in the project provinces.

The procurement of the bulk purchase of solar home systems under REP II will be combined with the
procurement of solar home systems under AusAID Additional Financing to REP I. See Annex 3 under
Component B.1 for more details

The team reminded DOE that the total budget for off-grid investment is $4 million. Therefore, DOE
should retain some budget from this to cover the investment needs of the PPP microhydro (about
$300,000) and the biomass and biogass investment as needed. DOE should finalize the number of SHS
purchase based on the actual bid prices and budget needs for the items (b) and (c).

Component B.2. Institutional Strengthening (Norad US$0.5 million): Provision of technical advisory
services to MEM to support: (a) the implementation of its comprehensive program of management; and
(b) the monitoring of the performance of the outsourced management and the off-grid investment
program, including provincial electrification service companies (PESCOs) and village electricity
managers.

The Bank provided its no objection to the TOR for the VOPS management contract on May 12, 2011.
DOE has proposed a contract with two phases – each of 18 months duration for a total estimated cost of
$500,000 (to be financed by Norad using Bank procurement procedures). DOE has advertised the
Request for Expressions of Interest (REOI) with a deadline of June 30, 2011. It was agreed that DOE

                                                                                                               31
would submit for Bank no objection a waiver in order to use CQS method and advertise locally with
appropriate justification no later than June 4, 2011. Given the delays in recruiting the new VOPS
consultant and the necessity of having the VOPS in place well before the delivery of the new solar home
systems, the team urged DOE to undertake its best efforts to mobilize the VOPS without delay. In this
regard, it was agreed that the draft RfP and short list would be provided to the Bank no later than July 15,
2011 with the aim of mobilizing the consultant no later than October 2011.

Component B.3. Alternative Rural Electrification Delivery Model (Norad US$0.2 million and GEF
US$0.799 million): Provision of technical advisory services to MEM to: (a) promote alternative
renewable energy development and develop associated delivery models and financing mechanisms; and
(b) support small and medium enterprises in income generation that is linked to the use of the renewable
energy use.

AusAID funds will be used to find technical assistance for detailed project design, etc. to pilot up to four
biogas sites using pig manure. GEF resources could be used for the supply and installation of these four
biogas sites in addition to biomass sites. The team requested DOE to submit a plan for the use of Norad
funds for technical assistance under this component by July 31, 2011.

Component B.4 Rural Electrification Master Plan and Database (Norad US$0.1 million): Provision
of technical advisory services to MEM to: (a) maintain the rural electrification database; and (b) update
the rural electrification master plan.

DOE indicated its preference to use the local JV partner who did the original RE Master Plan and
Database to do the maintenance and update given the continuity of work and that it would require
significantly more resources for a new firm to carry out this assignment as they would need substantial
time to understand the approach and details of the renewable energy master plan for Lao PDR and
understand how the database is structured. It was agreed that DOE would submit a request for sole
source selection along with the draft terms of reference no later than July 15, 2011.

Component B.5. Organization Strengthening of MEM (IDA US$0.1 million and GEF US$0.02
million for incremental operating costs; Norad US$0.72 million): Provision of technical advisory
services to MEM: (a) to support the project management unit in the implementation of Part B of the
project; and (b) to establish and support the initial operation of a REFS to enable REF in its mandate.

The $100,000 of IDA and $20,000 of GEF resources is for incremental operating costs. The team
requested DOE to submit a proposal – including cost estimates, procurement timetable and brief
description – for the use of the Norad technical assistance funds under this component by July 31, 2011.

REP II Disbursement. As of May 29, 2011, the cumulative disbursement amounted to SDR 32,142
(US$50,000 equivalent) out of the total IDA Grant H5380 of SDR 12.6 million (0.26%). Only the
Designated Account of US$50,000 has been set up by DOE in January 2011 after the effectiveness of the
project since August 2010. A small amount of DA (US$50,000) will also be opened by EDL for small
payments of incremental operating costs.

Part A. On Grid installation implemented by EDL

Environment

As a follow up to the actions plan in the AM dated September 2010, EDL submitted to the World Bank
progress report of the Safeguard Implementation under REP I. The safeguard report confirmed no
significant safeguard issues for the on-grid sub-projects which have been implemented in the seven
southern provinces and (ii) summarized lessons learned by EDL management and technical staff who
participated in the study tour at EGAT in Thailand and NT 2 in Lao PDR respectively in April and May
2010. However, the report did not identify how many on-grid sub-projects that required EMPs based on
Environmental Screening datasheet (in accordance with ESSF or current safeguard operational manual).
EDL agreed to submit to the World Bank a list of on-grid subprojects which use house-keeping measures
and prepared EMPs by June 30, 2011.

House-Keeping Measures and EMP for on-grid investments. EDL branch office monitored and worked
closely with the contractor and EMU to ensure no serious disturbance to the environment and villagers
occurred during civil work activities and the record of damages (trimmed or cut trees for installation
clearance). The installation of all the on-grid distribution was within the existing right of ways and had
no effects on any known environmentally sensitive areas. This was evident through the on-grid site visits
in Champrasac province. Minimal damage on villagers’ crops and trees during the civil work activities --
such as installing poles and stringing conductors-- were managed by the contractor with the agreed house-
keeping measures. The mission discussed with EDL’s Environmental office regarding the incorporation
of either house-keeping measures or EMP in bidding and contract documents for the current and future
on-grid sub-projects (e.g. under REP I and II). EDL is requested to share with a copy of any recent on-
grid contract to the World Bank for verification or inputs for appropriate clause related to house-keeping
measures or EMP.

Safeguard Capacity Building. Under REP I, the ESL consultants provided basic safeguard training on the
preparation, monitoring, and reporting of safeguard instruments (such as EMP and RAP) to EDL staff at
central and provincial branch offices) in April 2010. The training proceedings was shared with the World
Bank safeguard specialists during the mission The mission discussed with EDL’s Environmental Office
on how to improve the TORs for the Safeguards Capacity Building under REP II’s A.5 . Component
(financed by NORAD). EDL will use the fund to hire a team of national and international safeguard
consultants (i) to deliver safeguard training courses based recommended in the safeguard training needs
assessment in 2008 and (ii) to assist staff of EDL’s Environmental Office and branch offices in planning,
preparing, and monitoring the implementation of safeguard instruments. EDL expected to have the
Safeguard Consultants on board by September 2011. The World Bank safeguard specialists agreed to
send written comments to EDL within one week after the mission. EDL will submit the revision of the
TORs by June 30, 2011 for review and approval by the World Bank.

Safeguards Operational Manual. EDL submitted to the World Bank its draft Safeguards Operational
Manual before the mission. The World Bank safeguard specialists clarified the status of and discussed
with EDL on how finalize the Safeguards Operational Manual . The World Bank safeguard specialists
agreed to send to EDL the written comments within one week after the mission. EDL will then finalize and
send the final Safeguards Operational Manual for the World Bank record, likely before end of the 2011.
The mission encouraged EDL to apply the Safeguards Operational Manual for all REP’s sub-projects and
other Rural Electrifications financed by other sources.

Social

All civil works under REP I that may have negative effects on private assets or the livelihood of local
population have been completed. The mission was also informed no negative social impact occurred due
to the off-grid program. According to the Safeguard Progress Report submitted by the EdL environment
and social unit, 30,466 households in seven provinces were affected under 67 subprojects financed by the
REP I. In total, 4,585m2 of land had been affected, and more than 1 million trees had been reportedly cut
or damaged6. Under the REP I AusAid Additional Financing, it is expected that about 8,900 households
would be impacted, with the size of land affected estimated at 990m2 and the number of trees cut at about
9,000.

According to the progress report, all affected people were willing to voluntarily contribute their land or
trees, given the large benefit from being connected to the grid and the limited negative impacts. The
report also mentions that the project supported the rehabilitation of primary schools, hospitals, temples,
and so on, with the value of such in-kind contribution estimated at about 247 million LAK. Therefore no
affected households were compensated for the negative impact. The mission noted, however, that the
progress report is not clear if impacts are minor at the household level too – the report seems to lump
together both private and public land in the total size of affected land, and the data on the number of
affected trees may include forest land that belong to the public too. In order to verify that no household
was significantly and negatively impacted without due compensation under the project, the mission
agreed with EdL that the size of impact on private assets will be separated from impact on the
publicly owned assets in the revised final report and submit it to the Bank by June 10.

EdL developed a log book, according to the template developed in the Social Operational Manual, in
which the environment and social specialist of the provincial project implementation units, under the
support of the environment and social department of the EdL HQs, recorded the size of the land acquired,
the number and types of trees affected, and other impacts. Some extracts of impacts recorded in the log
bookare attached to the Aide Memoire. A summary of impact was also developed at the provincial level.
The mission was informed that formal agreements were also developed for signature by relevant
households which describe the detailed list of impacts. The mission considers this is a very good practice
which could be used by other ministries implementing projects entailing minor impacts. The mission
requested to share with the task team the sample of filled inventory of impacts as well as sample
signed agreements for record and sharing with other projects and ministries.


6
  The mission considers and EdL agrees that this number is very high, which may either lump together privately
owned and publicly owned trees, or could simply be wrong. EdL agreed to check the record and get back to the task
team.

                                                                                                               37
For REP II, the mission noted the current good practice employed by the EdL can be further expanded by
strengthening voluntary donation processes and the documentation of informed consent. As noted above,
it is not clear if negative impacts are minor for all households and voluntary donations are thus justifiable.
It is not clear either if all households agree to forfeit their entitlements and donate assets with full
knowledge of their entitlements. The mission agreed with EdL that a clear threshold and simple
checklists be developed to ensure that impacts are indeed minor for all cases of voluntary donation
and that informed consent by affected people is clearly established and documented. The mission
recommended EdL to refer to some of the good practices that EdC recently introduced under the Bank
supported projects, and agreed to provide detailed description of what should be addressed in the checklist
in the comment to the draft Safeguards Operational Manual before the mission.

The mission observed very positive social impacts due to improved access to electricity in rural areas. As
mentioned above, schools and other public facilities were rehabilitated under the Project. The mission
also noted some instances of business growth following project implementation. The mission strongly
recommends an impact evaluation of off-grid and on-grid electrification among project beneficiaries
which will help showcase the positive impact of the project.



Part B. Off-grid component by MEM/DOE

Potential environmental safeguard issues of off-grid investments under REP I and II are limited to mainly
issues related to used and out-of-order batteries for SHS and safety of Pico-hydro technology. The
environmental and safety issues could be addressed through good housekeeping system (e.g. disposal
arrangement of used batteries with the SHS supplier, VOPS and awareness campaign program activities.
The batteries’ recycling is arranged by VOPs and its sub-contractor, PESCOs, in particular to collect
used/out of order batteries from households and send to a specialized company for recycling purpose.
PESCOs developed a one-page trouble shooting principles –including the do and don’ts of used batteries-
-for educating to the villagers prior to installing SHS to each household. DOE will send a copy of the
one-page trouble shooting principles to the World Bank for record purpose.

It was not clear on the disposal arrangement of broken or unused SHS panels. DOE was requested to
report to the World Bank on its arrangement or agreement with the SHS supplier regarding used or
unusable SHS panels in the next support mission in late 2011.

Safeguard capacity Building. DOE staff benefited from the basic environmental safeguard training
organized by EDL’s Environmental Office under REP I’s Safeguard Capacity Building component. The
mission discussed with DOE to integrate environmental and safety mitigation measures (defined in the
feasibility study of Pico and Mini hydropower in its bidding and contract documents. More safeguard
capacity building will be provided through the REP II’s safeguard consultants in order to ensure that DOE
staff has necessary capacity and skills to prepare and oversee the planning and implementation of the off-
grid investments.

Safeguards Operational Manual. DOE has translated the final ESSF in Lao and disclosed it in the country
and the World Bank’s Infoshop in October 2010. DOE has not submitted to the World Bank for review

         Annex 10: Field Notes from Site Visits in Champasak Province, May 26 and 27, 2011

The Team carried out field visits on May 26 and 27, 2011 to villages in Champasak province electrified
under REP I and REP I-AusAID additional financing on-grid, P2P and off-grid components, as well as to a
target village to be electrified on-grid under the REP II. Champasak and Attapu PESCO SHS warehouse
was visited as well in order to evaluate possible improvements.

A WB fiduciary team formed by Mr. Chanvongnaraz Khamphet (Procurement Specialist), Ms. Malarak
Souksavat (Financial Management) and Mr. S. Sisomphone (Consultant) joined the field visits as part of
the integrated fiduciary team for the Lao PDR portfolio. A summary of the main points is provided
below.

General information about Champasak province electrification was provided by EdL branch. Seventy-
nine percent of villages and 77.6% of households in the province have been electrified as of April 2011.
The highest household electrification rates are in Pakse district (100%) and the lowest in Paksong district
(57%) and Moonlapamok district (58.7%). The largest consumer category is residential, comprising 43%
of electricity billed and 47% of bills collected. Average energy losses have decreased from 18.8% in 2006
to 12.7% in 2010. Champasak province is supplied by two hydropower plants and purchases electricity
from the Thai grid in the dry season.

Key findings

    (a) SHS being portable is highly appreciated as it allows families to carry the system with them
        when moving to live in the huts in the rice fields for six months a year in the dry season.
    (b) SHS are used as well for recharging small batteries directly, sometimes selling this service.
    (c) Villagers that charge their batteries through the installed SHS are collateral beneficiaries do not
        have to travel to the nearest town for this purpose and they are charged 1,000 Kip instead of
        5,000 Kip, getting to save 4,000 each time.
    (d) Main uses of electricity are for lighting and for cell phones recharging. And for water pumping
        when having access to the grid.
    (e) Some SHS repayments collectors keep the repayments when not paid their agreed good
        performance bonus. PESCO is strongly advised to avoid these situations.
    (f) Main cause of SHS withdrawal seems to be the HHs connection to the grid, 15%-20% of the units
        were withdrawn because of not working. When the withdrawn taking place, just the panel is
        removed. Non-working units are used as a source of spare parts.
    (g) A capacity building necessity on testing and fixing SHS was identified in order to VEMs and
        PESCO staff to be able to deal properly with the withdrawn units.
    (h) Most of P2P beneficiaries found repayments affordable.
    (i) In the P2P village visited two different EdL staff collect monthly the P2P payments and electricity
        bills, an opportunity for optimization was identified.
    (j) EdL representatives were pointing that female-headed households and families with disabled
        members are giving priority to access to the P2P program.
    (k) Main productive developed uses of the electricity are: water pumping, use of small machinery
        for furniture’s production and welding machines for construction.
    (l) Previous source of electricity was mainly diesel generators, environmental benefits are evident.



                                                                                                        40
    (m) Access to the grid and SHS is meaning high savings for the beneficiaries, being around half of the
        amount of money they used to spend on diesel. When selling their old generators beneficiaries
        get 30% or more of the originally invested money.

Site visited no.1: Bontkair Village, near Pakse city

    44SHS installed. Electrified under SPREE I since 2007.
    HHs pay 87.5USD in 10 years; 20.000 Kip/month (USD 2.5); including the installation and the wiring.
    Chief of the Village each the one collecting the SHS repayments. He records the payments in a logbook along
     with the signatures of the beneficiary and himself. It takes him 10 days a month to visit the HHs with SHS for
     finishing the re-collection task, once sometimes the families are absent or not have the money available.
    Source of income: agriculture. Monthly average earnings of the visited family: 500,000- 1,000,000 Kip (USD
     62.5-125). They consume 5 ton of their own produced rice a year.
    Sources of energy used previously: diesel burn, and car batteries that used to recharge in the village (5,000
     Kip/recharge, USD 0.6)
    Villagers that charge their batteries through the installed SHS do not have to travel to the nearest town for
     this purpose anymore, they are charged 1,000 Kip (USD 0.1) instead of 5,000 Kip (USD 0.6).

    SHS being portable is highly appreciated as it allows families to carry the system with them when moving to
     live in the huts in the rice fields for six months a year in the dry season.
    Uses of electricity are for lighting and for cell phones recharging mainly. In the HH visited they use to charge
     people for recharging their batteries for 1,000 Kip each.
    After the one –year warranty period, when batteries not working they get new ones in Pakse city for 700,
     000 Kip (USD 87.5). PESCO provides thenm as well for 680,000 Kip in 5 payments of 136,000 Kip (~17USD).
    It was expressed by another PESCO worker in charge of collecting the monthly payments that he is not giving
     the paybacks to PESCO since June 2010 as he did not get the bonus payment agreed.
    A distribution line built by ECI just arrived to the village, the grid will be bought by EdL. Connection fee for
     this grid including the wiring and two lamps is 3,500,000 Kip (436 USD). A whole agreement has been set for
     connecting the village. Once connected the villagers expressed their desire to keep using the SHS when
     working in the rice fields. They plan to get pumps in order to improve their agricultural production, and later
     on invest on rising chicken with the benefits. They plan as well to get refrigerators and fans when connected.

Site visited no.2: Champasak and Attapu PESCO SHS Warehouse

      This PESCO providing service to Champsak and Attapu provinces has installed 2,000 SHS under SPRE
       and REP I.
     Withdrawal:
            Main cause of withdrawal is due to HHs connecting to the grid, 15%-20% of the units were
                withdrawn because of not working. Only 20 units were withdrawn because of beneficiary not
