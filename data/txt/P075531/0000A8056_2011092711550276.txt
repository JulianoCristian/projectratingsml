                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The original activities are substantially completed and have allowed for electrification of about 65,706 households and 671 villages, exceeding the revised target of 64,000
                         households in 640 villages. However, procurement of the off-grid electrification activities financed through AusAID's additional financing is behind schedule to meet the March 31,
                         2012 closing date and will require close monitoring. Nevertheless, the key outcome indicator on number of households connected will be surpassed due to AusAID's additional
                         financing and the highly satisfactory progress of the Power to the Poor (P2P) scale up program. Regarding the objective of improving financial performance of the power sector,
                         Electricite du Laos (EdL) has implemented the Financial Sustainability Action Plan, but government and irrigation arrears need to be cleared and tariffs need to be raised to keep EdL
                         on a firm financial footing.

                         GEF DO: The objective of substantial adoption of off-grid renewable energy in the rural electrification program has been met as the market share of off-grid renewable households
                         has reached 21% (through the installation of solar home systems) compared to the target of 19%. Although not expected to dip below the target, this current 27% value will likely
                         decrease somewhat by the end of the project as the number of households electrified on-grid will likely increase at a faster pace than off-grid through the P2P program. The overall
                         rating is downgraded to satisfactory because increased awareness and adoption of energy efficient technologies and practices by government agencies and other EdL customers
                         stands only at 76% (compared to a target of 100%) for the public sector. While the residential target of 20% has been surpassed (46%) and the target of 33% for commercial
                         customers has been surpassed (66%), the shortcoming on behalf of the public sector is considerable due to the public sector's larger share.
