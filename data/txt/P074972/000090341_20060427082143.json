development impact was substantial, the Bank performance was\n            highly satisfactory, and the borrower performance was\n            satisfactory. Lessons learned from the project: A\n            multi-sectoral design and cross-agency implementation\n            strategy proved useful to address inter-locking binding\n            constraints. A high level, multi-sectoral government working\n            group is an effective mechanism for monitoring\n            implementation and resolving issues. This mechanism also\n            provided an appropriate avenue for effective coordination\n            with other development partners. Development policy lending\n            works well when based on the government's own\n            priorities and when the government owns the process. Even\n            when program extends over a period of years, it is important\n            to be realistic on what can be accomplished during this period."}, "docdt": "2005-12-28T00:00:00Z"}
