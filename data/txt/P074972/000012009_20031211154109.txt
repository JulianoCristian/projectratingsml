            SECOND PROGRAMMATIC ADJUSTMENT LOAN
                  LOANAND PROGRAMSUMMARY


Borrower:                 Ukraine

Amount:                   U S $250,000,000
Terms:                     Variable Spread Loan (VSL) inU S Dollars under standard Bank
                          terms
Commitment Fee:            Standard Bank terms


Objectives andDescription: The proposed Loan o f US$250 million equivalent i s the Second
                          Programmatic Adjustment Loan (PAL-11). PAL-I1is to continue
                           and deepen the program o f achievements in the five thematic
                           areas o f the PAL Program (PAL) as outlined below:

                          Fiscal and Financial Discipline. Lack o f fiscal and financial
                           discipline during the past decade led to a large accumulation o f
                           fiscal and inter-enterprise arrears with negative consequences on
                           contract compliance and the overall business environment. The
                           Government's program in this area is to gradually eliminate the
                          non-payment problem by substantially reducing the stock o f
                           accumulated arrears to levels comparable to intemational and
                           regional standards.

                           The Government Program is implementing this process by, (i)
                           addressing arrears to and from the budget, and (ii) focusing on
                                                                              by
                           the resolution o f energy sector arrears as the nexus o f the inter-
                           enterprise payment problem inthe economy.

                          Regulatory Reform. Ukraine has a complex and non-transparent
                           regulatory    environment,    which    hampers    growth,    biases
                           transactions and provides a source o f corruption. Many agencies
                           (particularly at the local level) are still entitled to "inspect"
                          business and demand payments. Trade policies do not coincide
                          with intemational standards, thus limiting export opportunities
                           for producers and import opportunities for consumers. Market
                           institutions required for good corporate govemance are in a
                           fledgling state. A weak and incomplete regulatory environment
                           for utilities   contributes to poor operating practices and
                           deteriorating performance.

                           The Government Program seeks to remove obstacles to doing
                          business and attract investment by providing clear rules o f the
                           game through better, more independent and more accountable

           ..
           11


regulatory systems: (a) facilitating entry, operation and exit o f
businesses; (b) facilitating accession to WTO and supporting
reforms; (c) strengtheningthe s ystem o f corporate governance;
and (d) improving regulatory systems in key sectors (including
finance, telecom and energy).

Creating and Protecting Property Rights. Weakly defined and
poorly protected property rights affect opportunities for
individuals and businesses alike. Without clear and strongly
enforced property rights, opportunities for income-earning
activities and investments are inhibited, the power to enforce
contracts i s limited, and the security o f being able to retain the
benefits o f own effort is threatened. InUkraine, some important
laws and supporting institutions necessary for stable commerce
are either still missing or insufficiently developed.

The Government Program targets the following strategic areas
for improved ownership rights: (a) strengthening property rights
inagriculture, (b) supporting transparent privatizationprocesses,
(c) promoting investment in key utilities (in energy and
telecommunications),      and (d) utilizing bankruptcy as          a
mechanism to impose hard budget constraints and free up
underutilized assets for more productive purposes.

Public Sector Accountability. Ukraine's fiscal management and
public administration system was designed to encompass almost
every aspect o f social and economic life in the country. In line
with amarket economy, progress is beingmade to streamline the
systemand improve its transparency.
The Government's program gives priority to improving the
accountability o f the public sector with emphasis on, (a)
improving transparency and value for money o f procurement
practices, (b) improving fiduciary management through more
publicly available information, further opening and streamlining
o f the budget process, and providing for independent assurance
o f integrity, (c) improving the structure and efficiency o f the
public revenue system, (d) modernizing the system o f inter-
responsibilities o f the state at each level, and (0roles
governmental       transfers,  (e)    clarifying  the           and
                                                         advancing
reform o f the civil service.
 Management of Social and Environmental Risks.             Ukraine
inherited an inefficient and overextended system o f shared
provision o f social services provided both by budgetary
organizations and large state-owned enterprises. Ukraine also
inherited a relatively high pollution industrial base with negative
externalities on the population and the environment.

                       111



             The Government Program seeks to better manage social and
             environmental risks through the following: (a) reforming the first
             Pay-As-You-Go (PAYG) pension pillar and developing a
             legislative and regulatory framework for third pillar, which is
             already in defacto operation, (b) providing a better targeted and
             more efficient system o f social assistance, (c) effectively
             controlling public health risks, especially HIV and TB, (d)
             starting implementation o f new health and education sector
             strategies within available levels o f public finance, and (e)
             forming a legal and institutional basis for a viable environmental
             protection system.

Benefits:    Some key benefits o f the program include, (a) encouragement o f
             better policy coordination - PAL provides an anchor for the pro-
             reform constituency in the Government and o f the Verkhovna
             Rada, it acts as a catalyst for change, and it is able to direct
             technical assistance to areas o f need; (b) wider participation o f

             support    for  continued macro-stability while establishing
             structural reforms which are crucial for growth over the medium
             term; (d) improvement o f the social situation by reducing poverty
             directly,   improving   social services    and providing more
             opportunities for middle and lower income households to share
             inthe benefits o f economic development, both inurban and rural
             areas; and (e) provision o f significant resources to help finance
             the ongoing reform program.

Risks:       The key risks for the program are political uncertainty, the pace
             o f structural reform, and vulnerability to as yet unforeseen
             external economic shocks.
             Political uncertainty.    The pace and consistency o f policy
             implementation   - often calling for politically difficult reforms -
             will no doubt continue to be affected by short-term political
             tradeoffs. Nevertheless, a significant share o f the benchmarks
             associated with PAL-I1 have already been met and those
             remaining are clearly defined. Moving forward to PAL-I11and
             beyond, the flexibility built into the P A L design will allow the
             program to focus on opportunities while helping to ensure the
             sustainability o f achievements already made. Experience has
             already shown that institutional reforms achieved tend to create
             demand for other institutional reforms which are lagging.

             that the pace and quality with which market institutions are
             established, and the economy continues to reorient itself, are not
             sufficient to avoid further stagnation should current positive

                                    issue. Slow or poor-quality reform implementation would
                                    increase the vulnerability o f the economy to downside risks,
                                   while good policies would reduce these same vulnerabilities.

                                   External shocks. Adverse weather conditions or a significant
                                   slowdown o f growth o f regional trading partners are the most
                                    likely extemal shocks. The dramatic growth o f the banking
                                   sector (which i s small relative to GDP) and the riskiness o f
                                   banking activity as banks compete for market share, also need to
                                   be watched carefully. A shuddering o f the financial sector thus
                                   represent the most likely domestic shock. While any o f these
                                   would     present      downside  risks   for   the   macroeconomic
                                   framework, the economy is becoming more resilient (reflected in
                                   part by banking sector growth), the debt portfolio is more
                                   balanced, and the country is showing improved capacity to adjust
                                   its  trade flows. Nevertheless,        a combination o f shocks,
                                   particularly in concert with slow and/or incomplete policy
                                   implementation, would put substantial strains on the economy. In
                                   this case, a continued relationship with the IMF and support o f
                                   the World Bank and other donors remains extremely important
                                   for Ukraine's mediumto long runhealth.

                                           I.INTRODUCTION

1.     The Country Assistance Strategy o f August 2000 identified Ukraine's key development
challenge as the buildingup o f legitimate, pro-development institutions that can deliver on their
responsibilities-  especially by bridging the gap between formal rules and informal behaviors.
The proposed CAS for 2004-2007 also carries forward this challenge.

2.     The Programmatic Adjustment LendingProgram (PAL) is envisaged as the backbone o f
World Bank (henceforth, "Bank")       financial assistance under the Base Case. The three-year
program o f approximately US$750 million i s designed in three operations (PAL-I, PAL-I1 and
PAL-111) in support of concrete achievements in the implementation o f the Government's
structural reform program. The program i s articulated around five thematic areas which cut
across sectors and aim at an improved structural and institutional framework. These include: (a)
financial discipline, (b) regulation, (c) property rights, (d) public sector accountability, and (e)
management o f social and environmental risks.

3.     The First Programmatic Adjustment Loan (PAL-I) was presented to the Board o f
Directors on September 16, 2001. It entailed two tranches - US$l50 million directly upon Board
approval and an additional tranche o f US$100 million upon completion o f second-tranche
benchmarks. The second tranche was disbursedinDecember 2001.

4.     This report presents the proposed S econd Programmatic A djustment Loan for Ukraine
(PAL-11).It outlines recent political and economic developments, provides an update o fpoverty,
describes progress in implementation o f the Government Program and outlines its future plans.
This report also includes a description o f the Bank Group strategy and the proposed loan. Box 1
below provides an "At-a-Glance" summary o f achievements made and planned throughout the
three year program. Additionally, for those interested in comparing what was envisaged for
PAL-I1 at the time o f PAL-I, with what i s contained in the proposed PAL-I1program, Annex 2
provides a summary and an assessment the evidence insupport o fproceeding with PAL-I1at this
time.

5.       The Parliamentary elections,' o f March 2002 helped the center-right forces supported by
President Kuchma to increase their representation in Parliament, while the Communists and
allied parties suffered a setback.2 The coalition ledby former Prime Minister Victor Yushchenko
gathered the most votes based on party lists (23.6%), but represents the second largest faction in
Parliament after Kuchma's UnitedUkraine, which attracted strong support from single mandate
seat-winners. InDecember 2002 a pro-presidential majority was formed inParliament, which i s
composed o f a heterogeneous group o f political parties representingregional interests as well as
those o f several emerging industrial groups. Victor Yanukovich, former governor o f the Donetsk
oblast, was appointedUkraine's Prime Minister inNovember o f 2002.

6.       Presidential elections are scheduled for October 2004. Parliament has recently approved
the Government's Program, which includes an ambitious agenda of reform across many areas.
Approval o f the program gives the Government a mandate untilApril 2004. There is, however, a
general perception that by the Fall o f 2003, the window o f opportunity for bold initiatives,
particularly requiring parliamentary approval, will be limited as the presidential election
campaigns get underway.

7.       Since the parliamentary elections, President Kuchma has further consolidated major
political forces around him and will continue exercising strong control over the country's
political and economic agenda despite nearing the end o f his mandate within the constitution.
President Kuchma has sent strong signals to the international community that Ukraine will not
reverse its reform course. Further, the strength o f Yushchenko's block in parliament, which
voted for the Government Program and currently heads some key committees, recently helped
facilitate passage o f important market-oriented legislation. However, positioning for the 2004
presidential election has begun, which adds uncertainty and suggests that any coalition will be
tentative.

B.        The MacroeconomicFramework
8.       At present, the macroeconomic framework is adequate, however downside risks remain.
Longer term sustainability o f the program and the pace o f growth are fundamentally dependent
on the depthand quality o f structural reform implementation.

9.       The strong economic Performance o f 2000-2001 has continued in 2002-2003. Reform
measures and improved govemance, supported by a favorable exchange rate for exports, a
positive external environment (e.g., continued growth in Russia) and a reorientation o f trade
toward Europe and Asia, resulted in an improved macro framework, higher incomes o f the

'InUkraine's election system, 50% ofparliamentary seats are filled according to party tickets, and 50% according
to single mandate elections.

 The Communist party won 20% of the popular vote, but their share in parliament is lower at 15% due to weak
performance o f Communist candidates in single-mandate contests.

population and increased public trust inmarket institutions. Strong GDP growth in 2000 o f 5.9
percent was followed by 9.2 percent growth in 2001, 4.8 percent growth in 2002 and 8.6 percent
growth in the first semester o f 2003, despite a 7% decline in agriculture due to poor weather
early inthe year. Since January o f 2000, GDP has grown by 25 percent. This recovery was most
evident inthe industrial sectors (especially production o f metals, chemicals and manufacturing),
a surge in construction and retail trade, good agricultural performance and growth in services.
Agriculture prospered after swift elimination o f the collective farm system combined with exit
bythe State from operations inthe factor supply market andtrading of agricultural commodities.
Agricultural production grew by 9.8 percent in 2000, 10.2 percent in 2001 and another 1.2
percent in 2002. Adverse weather

increasing     availability      of credit,
employment in small enterprises grew
by 6.1 percent in2002.

10.      Underlyingthese trends was a surge inexport growth andstrong domestic investment. Ln
2002 exports to Russia fell by 13 percent, yet overall export growth was unexpectedly strong at
10.4 percent, anchored by diversification o f trade to Europe and Asia. This trend further
accelerated in the first semester of 2003 when exports grew by 26.9 percent. After a slowdown
associated with the change o f Government in 2002, investment growth has again picked up
speed. Fixed investment increased by 4.9% o f GDP in 2002, but grew at a rate of 23.1% in the
first quarter o f 2003. This reflects higher investment demand as exports expand, consumer
demand grows and also due to an accelerating inflow o f foreign direct investment which may
reach US$ 1billion in2003.

11.      Significant progress was made in price stability - CPI inflation declined from 25.8
percent (e.0.p.) in 2000 to 6.1 percent in 2001, and a slight deflation o f 0.6 percent was
registered in2002. Despite higher grain and expected increases in energy prices later inthe year,
CPI inflation in2003 is forecast to be 8.7 percent; it grew by 4.6 percent in the first semester o f
2003. The exchange rate and its forecast also remain roughly stable. After appreciating in real
terms by 8.2 percent in the first half o f 2000 (following a 19.2 percent depreciation in 1999), the
nominal exchange rate has been stable at about UAH5.33 per 1 US$, thus reflecting a gradual
real depreciation o fthe Hryvnia against the U S dollar, and especially the Euro.Price stabilityhas



  Ukraine's statistics do not distinguish medium and large enterprises.        Throughout the report we use "small
enterprises", which are those with 50 or less employees, as a proxy for small and medium enterprises (SMEs).

                                                  8

been helped by a surge inmoney demand, which i s accompanying monetization o f the economy.
The state has eliminated tax offset operations and barter in the economy has fallen to about 2
percent o f registered economic activity. Households and businesses are holding more domestic
currency and domestically denominated deposits, which are increasing rapidly. This, along with
fiscal tightness, has helped spur an increase in banking sector credit to the private sector and a
reduction o f nominal interest rates. Rea1 rates, however, remainhigh as expectations are still
catching up with inflation outcomes, and institutions in support o f creditor rights and financial
intermediation remain relatively weak.

12.      A more competitive exchange rate with Western trading partners, continued strong
demand from the CIS, a pick up in trade with Asia, and strong flows o f worker's remittances
have contributed to an external current account surplus o f 4.7 percent in 2000, 3.8 percent in
2001, 7.6 percent in2002 and a surplus o f 11.9 percent for the first quarter o f 2003.

13.      These trends have allowed the central bank to rapidly increase money supply while
accumulating significant foreign reserves, which currently equal 3 months o f imports (relative to
1.O months inJune 2000). Reserve accumulation has been achieved through non-sterilized dollar
purchases. At the same time, the Government has maintained a tight fiscal deficit o f under 2
percent o f GDP (actually registering a small surplus in 2002 on a commitment and cash basis),
held steady its modest stock o f domestic debt and is reducing its stock o f public external debt -
from 33 percent o f GDP in 2000 to 25 percent by year-end 2002. The Government was able to
issue roughly US$800 million o f Eurobonds in June 2003 at 7.65 with 10 years maturity, and
then an additional US$200 million on the same terms in October, 2003. The Government also
completed all o f its Paris Club rescheduling agreements, thus smoothing and improving the
sustainability o fUkraine's debt servicing requirements.

14.      Overall the economy remains relatively robust and does not show signs o f increased
vulnerability to financial or external shocks. Nevertheless, this does not mean that Ukraine can
afford to be complacent. The external environment, which has made it possible to borrow
relatively cheaply on the external market will not last. The main determining factor o f the pace
and stability o f growth (and Ukraine's eurobond spreads) will be the quality o f structural and
institutional reform. More details on the economy overall and the macroeconomic projections
can be found inAnnex 1.

A.     Progress on Poverty
15.      The critical foothold for each o f Ukraine's citizens to be able to take part in the positive
growth dynamic is the establishment o f legitimate and efficient institutions which operate in
practice as they are designed by law. Macroeconomic stability, through good fiscal and monetary
policies, is a necessary startingplace t o protect the poor as evinced by the poverty increases
associated with the 1998 financial crisis and the signs o f poverty decrease thereafter. The other
key ingredients for long-term improvements in welfare and poverty reduction are institutional
and structural reforms that address problems underpinning poverty. The Government has
elaborated (with Bank assistance) a poverty reduction strategy that sets out the strategic
framework supported by the PALprogram.

                                                  9

16.     Some o fthe pro-poor policies supported by this program include the following:

    Maintenance o f a sound macro-fiscal framework.

    Market liberalization, land reform, and development o f the institutional framework for
    pledge and crediting in the agricultural sector. This is generating increased rural liquidity,
    productivity and higher incomes inagriculture and agro-processing.

    Improving the business environment. Reducing the cost o f doing business, minimizing
    opportunities for rent-seeking by public officials and protecting property rights engender the
    creation o f small and medium enterprises, thus creating more jobs and opportunities for the
    middle class and the poor.

    Better regulation o f the banking sector and non-bank financial institutions (including private
    pension funds). This i s helping to protect the assets o f citizens from financial market
    instability by reducing irresponsible financial activities.

    Strengthened budget processes and improvements in fiduciary management of public hnds.
    This is helpingt o obtainmore v alue for money, while reducing 1eakages from the public
    sector which would otherwise take place through inefficiencies and non-transparencies.

    Financial discipline in public and private spheres. The reduction o f tax exemptions and tax
    privileges (which are highlyregressive), elimination o f tax offset operations and reduction o f
    non-transparent barter transactions, are helping to provide more funds to pay wages and
    pension, reduce social payment arrears, andbetter sustain social services and assistance.

    The system o f social transfers is being stabilized and streamlined. The long run stability of
    the pension system and improvement o f its day to day operations are being secured, while
    non-pension social transfers are being better targeted through the elimination o f the
    social/occupational privilege system, better administration and technical solutions to find and
    reach the poor.

    Finally, better social service delivery (health and education) is being designed and
    implementedwithin available public sector resources in order to provide crucial inputs for
    the growth of Ukraine's most important capital stock - a highly educated and capable people.
17.     Poverty i s falling in Ukraine.
Positive    developments       on   the
structural and institutional front are         Table 1: Ukraine: Headcount Poverty Rates

increases in household income and

                                                       10

consumption. In aggregate, real household income rose by 4.1 percent in 2000, 10 percent in
2001, and 17.8 percent in 2002. Increased economic activity also led to lower unemployment
(from 11.7 to 10.1percent o f the work force according to International Labor Organization (ILO)
methodology). The employment dynamics o f small enterprises within these figures are promising
and the trend i s expected to continue at a more rapid pace as the institutional reforms are
deepened. This good news i s also supported by microeconomic data provided through the
quarterly Household Budget Survey (HBS). The HBS shows that while lagging GDP growth,
poverty has seen a modest reduction from 29.4% to 25.6%.4 However, the data also show a
continued increase in income inequality (although the gini coefficient i s still at a relatively
modest level) and that rural areas continue to fare worse than urbanareas.

18.     A more detailed discussion o f poverty outcomes, including a poverty profile, are
provided inAnnex 3. The poverty profile suggests that the incidence o fpoverty i s highest among
families with many children, the unemployed, large households, and the less educated, and that,
as mentioned above, poverty i s more prevalent and deeper inrural than urban areas. These facts
are being used to inform policies moving forward in order to clearly and effectively reach these
groups and create a more inclusive growth dynamic inUkraine.

                                            111. THE REFORMPROGRAM
19.     The Government Program focuses on the most critical policy and reform issues with the
broadest economic and social impact. The objective is to help sustain the nascent economic
recovery, strengthen the pro-reform constituency inthe country, and help make sure policies are
designed and implemented to maximize the benefits for Ukraine. Especially, the program
recognizes the importance o f reorienting and strengthening institutions as a basis for
development o f a healthy and inclusive market economy.

20.     As outlined in the Government Letter o f Development Policy (see Annex lo), the
Government Program i s designed around five crosscutting, thematic areas: (a) fiscal and
financial discipline, (b) regulation, (c) property rights, (d) public sector accountability, and (e)
management o f social and environmental risks. Key achievements which have been reached to
date, and which form the basis for presentation o f this package to the World Bank Board o f
Executive Directors, are outlined inbold inthe text below.

A.      Fiscal and Financial Discipline
2 1.    Lack o f fiscal and financial discipline during the past decade led to a large accumulation
o f fiscal and inter-enterprise arrears with negative consequences on contract compliance and the
overall business environment. It thus affected the level o f economic activity and employment,
real incomes, and timely payment o fwages and pensions.




  Until recently the data showed that poverty was still increasing despite strongly positive macroeconomic
aggregates. Efforts are ongoing to strengthenthe HBSin order to further confirm poverty trends inUkraine.

22.      The medium-term vision i s to foster financial discipline through improved contract
enforcement and budget discipline. The Government has decided to lead this process by reducing
budget, tax and energy payment
arrears. Solving the non-payment                             Non-PaymentsinUkrainianEconomy
problem in the public sector is               Figure2:

the need for operating liquidity. It i s expected that over the medium term, Ukraine's payments
discipline as measured by net payables inthe economy will reach a level comparable to regional
standards (Le., from 91 percent o f GDP in 1999 to the regional average o f 10-20 percent o f
GDP).~

23.     Payment arrears. The Government i s making good progress on fiscal and financial
discipline. The first step was to eliminate the use o f veksels (promissory notes) and mutual
budgetary o ffsets for purposes o f t ax payment. Sustaining c ash based revenue discipline then
helped reduce overdue payables from the budget. Together, these factors have had a remarkable
effect on the rest o f the economy (see Figure2):

0   Cashrevenues of the consolidatedbudgethavebeen maintainedat roughly 100percent.

0   The Governmenthas eliminatedpensionandpublicsector wage arrears.

0   Social protectionarrears havebeen reducedby 55 percentrelativeto January 1,2000.

0   "Other" arrears, which includeoverdue payableson energy, catering, and other goods
    and services havebeen reducedby 50 percentrelativeto January 1,2000.

0   The use of barter by industrial enterprises has decreased substantially from 42.5
    percentin 1998 to less than 5 percentin 2002.
Further reduction o f budgetary arrears will be implementedby the time o f the second tranche of
PAL-11.

24.      Clearing of debt obligations to and from the budget. The Ministry o f Finance i s also
implementing a strategy to recover and settle overdue repayments on its on-lending and called-



  The level o f overdue payables inthe economy as of June 1, 2003 was 49 percent of GDP.

guarantee portfolio, while settlingits own debts to the banking sector (more detail i s provided in
Annex 4).

25.      Tax arrears to the budget. Parliament approveda tax amnesty in2001 that eliminated tax
obligation to the budget accrued before December 31, 1999 and introduced new procedures for
enforcement o f overdue taxes. Unfortunately,
tax arrears are still being accumulated,
particularly among the remaining state-                    Box 2: The Cabinet's Agenda on Reduction

since January 1, 2003, and the energy sector overall has been current on its taxes on a net
basis since January 1, 2003. Thus, 2003 is shaping up to be the first year since Ukraine's
independencethat the enterprise sector as a whole is current on its tax obligations.

26.      Moving forward, the Government is conscious that in order to overcome the culture o f
non-payment it has to take comprehensive action against weaknesses inthe economy. Especially,
it needs to implement a strategy to deal with non-viable SOEEs and continue to implement
reforms in the energy sector. Thus, it i s developing a comprehensive plan to reduce tax arrears
among fuel and energy companies, which inparticular focuses on improvingthe strategic vision,
operational efficiency and transparency o f Naftogaz (see Section 1I.C below for more discussion
o f Naftogaz). Already some key actions have been identified which will improve financial
discipline inthe energy sector andwill clear the w ay for increased c ash payments o f energy
bilk6 These actions, which constitute the Government' short term action plan to improve
financial discipline in the energy sector, will be implementedby the Government before release
o f the second tranche o f PAL-11. They include the following: (a) implementation o f procedures
for compensating consumers o f low quality or below billed provision o f heating and water
services, (b) submission to Parliament o f a law which would reestablish penalties for non-
payment o f housing and communal services by consumers, (c) implementation o f regulations
which will legally oblige local governments to compensate municipal companies for the setting
o f any loss making municipal services tariffs, (d) approval o f an emergency reserve list o f
potentially environmentally hazardous enterprises, including the protected volume o f electricity,
andidentification of fundingsources for reserves o f each o fthese enterprises, and (e) elimination



  This in turn clears the way for passage o f a comprehensive law on energy debt resolution and a launching o f a
privatizationtender for remaining power distribution companies.

                                                          13

o f electricity payment and/or tariff privileges for individual business entities and/or sectors, with
the exception o f communal service companies. The Government is also successfully promoting
legislation inParliament to broaden the tax base and further strengthentax collection powers (see
para. 70 for more information on tax policy).

27.      The Government recognizes the importance o f setting an example for the rest o f the
economy. Thus, it has committed to a plan to eliminate value-added tax (VAT) refund arrears
while undertaking the necessary steps to address the technical, administrative and organizational
problems which have led to arrears accumulation inthe past.

28.      The Government intendsto continue work on tax andbudgetarrears so that, bythe end o f
the PAL period, the country will be fully current with budget obligations and meet regional
practice inthe level o f arrears. However, further progress will be difficult as it i s linkedwith the
health o f the entire economy. Reform and/or bankruptcy o f large state owned enterprises (SOEs),
for instance, has social and political ramifications which may require c omplementary actions.
The Government's Program takes these factors into account. It is committed to monitor
implementation carefully in order to make necessary adjustments as implementation o f the plan
unfolds.

29.     Energy Sector.           The energy sector represents a nexus for inter-enterprise arrears.
Although energy arrears- (estimated in June 2002 at UAH 8.7 billion for electricity and another
UAH7 billion for gas)7 represent a
small part o f the overall inter-
enterprise non-payment problem,                         Figure 3: Cash CollectionsinElectricity and Gas
they represent more than half o f the         I1
annual average electricity sales. The
electricity and gas sectors are net
lenders and subsidizers o f the rest
o f the economy through arrears and
prices.    Improved       collection     o f
energy payments i s thus a necessary
step for creating financial discipline
throughout the        economy.        It is            0 4
helping to enable timely payments
for energy imports while helping to
reduce the energy intensity o f the
country. It i s also a pre-requisite for      11
reorganization           o f        energy      Source: Ministry o f Fueland Energy o fUkraine

companies,        which       will     also
contribute to improved financial discipline, and in particular sets a basis to precede with a
comprehensive debt restructuring program necessary for further power company ("oblenergo")
privatization. Thus, the Government program focuses on increasing the cash collection ratios in
the electricity and gas sectors. Progress is exceeding expectations:


' Internal debts to the electricity and gas sectors contribute to the outstanding external debt for gas estimated at
around US$1.9 billion, comprising the debt to Russia o fUS$1.44 billion and to Turkmenistan o f US$470 million.

                                                        14

     During the first six months of 2002, 22,556 of 31,312 non-paying electricity consumers
     (mostly enterprises) were cut off, thus strengthening the credibility of budget
     constraints.
     Cash payments from the oblenergos to the Energomarket increased dramatically, from
     15 percent of electricity bills in January 2000 to an average of 90 percent of bills for the
     first half of 2003.
     Cash collections in the gas sector also improved dramatically; they have been about 87
     percent over the period of June, 2002 - May, 2003, as compared to an averaged 50
     percent for the year 2000.
30.      Moving forward, in order to facilitate privatization o f the oblenergos, improve the
operating balances of other energy enterprises and bring further financial discipline to the
economy, the Government i s addressing the outstanding stock o f past debts. A comprehensive
energy debt resolution plan, which deals with the full chain o f debts from the Energomarket to
electricity generators to fuel suppliers, i s beingdeveloped by a special c ommission under the
Prime Minister's leadership. Debts o f four of the remaining state-owned oblenergos are
especially large,8 and implementation o f the debt settlement planwill require Parliament to enact
a law on energy debt resolution. Already,

     Debts between oblenergos, wholesale electricity market, generators and fuel suppliers
     have been quantified, a restructuring plan has been prepared which clarifies settlement
     mechanisms, and the supporting draft law on debt resolution in the energy sector has
     been submittedto Parliament.
31.      With regard to Naftogaz, which is one o f the most important agents in the fuel supply
chain, the Government recently concluded negotiations with Russia to settle debts accrued prior
to January 1, 2000. This settlement forms a basis upon which internal reprogramming of debt
obligations from domestic enterprises to Naftogaz can be concluded as well, and this process has
been initiated.


B.       Regulatory Reform
32.      Ukraine has long maintained a complex and non-transparent regulatory environment
which has hampered growth and investment, biased transactions and provided a source o f
corruption. Traditionally, many agencies (particularly regional branches o f federal agencies)
have been entitled to "inspect" businesses and demand payments. The net effect has been a
relative stifling o f small and medium enterprise development. Tariff and non-tariff trade barriers
havep layed a role inc reating a n uneven playing field, which int urnhinders investment and
delays the inevitable reorientation o f production and trade. Customs and standardization
practices need to undergo major improvements. The financial sector has traditionally been
shallow and has lacked adequate institutions to foster development and to oversee performance.
The 1egal and institutional framework for corporate govemance remains weak t o t he point of
stifling investment. Additionally, there is an incomplete regulatory environment for natural




 The net market value of these companies in a privatization would likely be less than zero.

                                                        15

monopolies. Regulatory reform i s thus a crucial part o f the program o f institutional change
necessary to encourage sustained growth and poverty reduction inUkraine.

33.     The medium-term vision seeks to remove obstacles to doing business while providing
clear rules o f the game through better, more independent and more accountable regulatory
systems. Inorder to achieve this, efforts are focused on: (a) facilitating entry, operation and exit
o f businesses; (b) facilitating accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO) and supporting
reforms; (c) bringing the regulatory environment for financial institutions up to international
standards, (d) strengthening corporate governance; and (e) improving regulatory systems in key
sectors (including telecom, energy and for non-bank financial institutions).

34.     Facilitating entry and operation of business. Under PAL-I, the Government advanced
in creating favorable conditions for opening and operating businesses, which are leading to an
upward trend o f registered small and medium enterprises (see Box 3). First, improvements were
introduced in 1998 through amendments to the Law on Entrepreneurship. The Government then
fine-tuned these changes to encapsulate the principles of one-stop shop registration. Also, inJune
2000, Parliament approved a new licensing law which streamlined licensing procedures by
allowing a single license to cover multiple economic activities. Implementingregulations o f the
law were adopted by October 2000 and have been under implementation since that time. These
legal initiatives are being complemented on the ground by efforts to streamline business
procedures.

35.     Independent surveys conducted annually by the United States Agency for International
Development (USAID) and the International Finance Corporation (IFC), and more recently, a
"Cost o f Doing Business Survey" funded out o f the Policy and Human Resource Development
(PHRD) grant o f the Japanese Government for PAL-I1 preparation, show that the dramatic
improvements achieved by 2000 were maintained in2001 and 2002:9




  Reported figures are taken from the forthcoming and past IFC Business Surveys.

                                                             16



                    Box 3: Special Focus on Small and Medium Enterprise (SME) Development
One o f the promising dynamics in Ukraine is the acceleration o f SME entry and their relatively strong performance (see
Figures 3 and 4 below). This i s helping to shift Ukraine's business and trade orientation, and it will be a critical part of
sustained growth moving forward. It is also creatingjobs. According to official statistics, out o f about 5 millionjobs lost in
Ukraine in traditional industries since 1991, about 1 million new jobs in small enterprises were created (of which 460,000
were created since January 1, 2001).

P A L focuses on encouraging SME development across a range o f areas by improving the environment for entrepreneurial
activity. The Government's reforms are already having a positive impact.
    P     Reform o f business registration, the permit system and control over inspections i s dramatically reducing the cost
          o f doing business.
    P     Establishment o f a presumptive tax for small enterprises has helped generate single proprietorships.
    P Fiscal consolidation and imposition o f hard budget constraints has reduced crowding out, encouraged lending to
          SMEs while accelerating a reallocation o fresources to higher value added endeavors.
    9 Reductionof state involvement inagricultural markets (both input and output) has generated a rapid increase of
          gross agricultural production, much o f which is generated andor serviced by SMEs.
    P Reduction of budget arrears and elimination o f offset and barter transactions by the State has helped bring barter
          down to under 5 percent o f business transactions and reduced inter-enterprise arrears. A payments culture is
          critical for SME survival and i s also helping to generate crediting.

PAL-I1extends this focus through pro-business institutional change.
    P         Widening o f the tax base and reduction o f rates is spreading out the tax burden and encouraging SMEs to
          emerge from the shadows.
    P         Simplification o f post-registration procedures (registering with tax authorities, receiving a permit, etc.)
          encourages survival o f SMEs.
    P         Leveling the playing field for foreign investors eliminates unfair advantages and encourages FDI, both to the
          benefit o f SMEs.
    P         Identification and elimination o f special administrative barriers in agriculture (e.g., establishment o f a sound
          registration and cadastre system, establishment o f a system o f mortgage finance, reduced state involvement in
          supply and output markets, etc.) encourages new private landholders to invest infarming.
    P         Progress toward WTO accession increases market access for SME products.
    P         Privatization and bankruptcy hardens budget constraints and helps reallocate resources to new more viable
          business endeavors.
    P         Regulation and privatization o f state service monopolies helps ensure affordable and dependable energy and
          communications services.

     The official cost of registration has gone down from US$192 in 1997 to US$22 in 2002,
    while the time needed to register a new business (Le., obtain a new registration
     certificate) has decreased from 34.7 days in 1997to 5 days in 2002.
     The number of licenses needed per enterprise has gone down from 3 in 1997 to 1.7 in
     2002, while a reasonable time limit (maximum of 16 days) is set to help avoid delays and
     opportunities for graft seekingby officials empoweredto issue licenses."
     The number of inspections has beenbrought down from an average of 30 per enterprise
     during1998 to 14 in2002.11
    According to the Cost of Doing Business Survey, average measured regulatory costs per
    firm fell from US$3,222 in1999 to US$2,248 in2002.12

36.      Facilitating theAccession to the WTO. Greater integration into the world economy i s an
important element o f the Government's strategy. The WTO membership process i s reinforcing
policy reforms, and full membership will help facilitate greater trade and investment. After a two
year hiatus, accession work accelerated in 2002. Ukraine presented an ambitious offer of
commitments inservices trade liberalization, and since January 1, 2002, has signed 14 additional
bilateral protocols o n market access bringingthe full t otal t o 14 out o f 3 2 participating trade
partners. It intends to complete bilateral negotiations with remaining W T O Working Party
members in the near future. These protocols should help to lock in liberalization o f border
barriers, maintain the political momentum neededto reform trade-related domestic regulations,
and facilitate engagement with other countries on economic issues. Ukraine i s taking steps to
improve its institutional framework for trade by developing a market-oriented standards regime,
improving its customs procedures, and reforming its regime o f property rights protection. Also,
through ongoing analytical work funded by donors (the United Kingdom's Department for
International Development, DFID, and the Dutch Government), Ukraine's WTO accession team
i s conducting negotiations based on an improved understanding o f the economic costs and
benefits o f various aspects o f accession, although muchmore needs to be done on this front. The
Government is also building and maintaining public c onsensus for W TO accession through a
public relations campaign. A more detailed description o f WTO accession activities are outlined
inAnnex 5 o fthis report. The keyrecent achievements supported byPAL-I1are as follows:

    Ukraine has taken steps to harmonize its standards regime with international standards
    by establishing an independent accreditation agency, by preparing 11 of 25 of the
    European Union's (EU) "New Approach'' technical directives governing technical
    harmonization and standardization, and by adopting over 1000 European standards as
    voluntary Ukrainian standards;

employees complying with the red table listed in(a), and (c) unofficial costs such as bribes paid.

                                                 18

    Ukraine has eliminated the use of minimum values in line with the WTO Customs
    Valuation Agreement;

0   Parliament has enacted laws on copyright and related rights to better protect
    intellectionproperty rights, and the lion's share of legislativeamendmentsnecessary to
    harmonize Ukraine's legal framework with the Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual
    PropertyRights(TRIPS) agreementhavebeen approvedby Parliament.
    A public educationcampaign has been launchedto engage stakeholders(in the private
    sector and civilsociety) intothe WTO process.
37.      Corporate Governance.      Ukraine has advanced in creating the building blocks for
adequate corporate governance interms o f shareholder rights, accounting and auditing standards,
reporting requirements and trade facilitation. These institutions, however, are far from operating
to best international standards and therefore do not sufficiently encourage the development o f
financial  and market transactions. The Government's efforts to further improve corporate
governance include, (a) securing a level playing field for all businesses, (b) adhering to
intemational governance practices, (c) improving the transparency o f traded companies, (d)
securing minority shareholder rights and (e) better managing state owned enterprises.

38.      The Government focused on advancing the legislative framework. It has made significant
improvements to earlier drafts o f the Law on Joint Stock Companies and amendments to the Law
on Securities and Stock Market. Attempts to pass "best practice'' versions o f the laws drafted by
international experts have failed inthe past. In order t o ensure ownership by Ukraine o f this
cardinal legislation, new drafts are under preparation by a d hoc working groups of Ukrainian
experts (including members o f the Government and Parliament), and the Government has
committed to promote them through enactment by the time o f PAL-111. In the mean time, the
Governmentis makingadditionalefforts to improveaccountingand auditingstandards -
compliancewith InternationalFinancialReportingStandards(IFRS)13is now requiredfor
all financial companies, traded companies and companies that issue commercial paper.
Also, in order to increase the share of securities traded on organized markets, improvements in
tax legislation are envisaged to create favorable conditions for concluding securities transactions.
Over the mediumterm, the Government intends to assure implementation o f this new legislative
framework and monitor improved business practices through pilots, sampling techniques and an
audit of the auditors.

39.      The current framework for management o f SOEs i s in disarray. The State Property Fund
was established to manage the portfolio o f SOEs and to execute privatization proceedings.
However, through numerous legal changes and administrative arrangements over the years,
management o f many SOEs have been transferred to line ministries and other agencies. Defacto,
many SOE managers are not held accountable. In particular, the selection and removal
procedures o f SOE's management needto be clarified, made more transparent and strengthened.
Given the importance o f the state owned banks to Ukraine's financial health,14 special efforts

have been taken to strengthen the authority o f the Cabinet o f Ministers (CoM) over their
management, while the National Bank o f Ukraine (NBU) has intensified its regulatory oversight
o f the Savings Bank inparticular. The C o M i s also starting to improve its corporate governance
over Naftogaz, as evinced through improved tax compliance o f Naftogaz in 2003, while
Naftogaz i s seeking to improve its management strategy with the assistance o f an international
reputable consultancy firm, while focusing on its transparency and image by taking necessary
steps toward adopting disclosure policies which reach international standards. For other SOEs, a
study was conducted on management incentives, accounting, auditing and disclosure
requirements, and the Government plans to implement recommendations o f the study over the
mediumterm.

40.      Regulatory Systems. The Government Program also supports regulatory improvements
intelecommunications, energy, financial services, andpensions. Inenergy and communications,
regulatory advances are needed to encourage competition and development o f the sectors,
support privatization, and institute a policy framework in view o f the long run interests o f the
country. The effort also needs to ensure that regulatory institutions are not captured by private
companies. It i s expected that Parliament will follow an integrated approach by passing
legislation, which defines the checks, balances and institutional structures overseeing the
regulation o f all natural monopolies. This i s being complemented by establishment o f
independent regulatory agencies in energy, telecommunications, and for non-bank financial
institutions, and development and publication o f clear sector policy statements o f the
Government. In the financial sector, at a time when banks and non-bank financial institutions
(including private pension funds) are rapidly growing, it i s extremely important for weaknesses
to be addressed, a sound regulatory framework consolidated, and that it be firmly supervised.

41.      Inthe energy sector,the Government isworking on amendments to the law onregulation
o f the energy sector for passage by the time o f PAL-111. Within a framework o f checks and
balances to assure accountability o f regulatory agencies, amendments to the existing regulatory
system are designed to enhance the energy regulator's (NERC) autonomy - both administrative
and financial. In addition, clearer rules are being established for efficient regulation o f the
sectors, as well as a monitoring system, which will allow predictable tariff settingbyNERC.

42.      In telecommunications, the objective o f the Government is to establish an independent
regulatory agency operating in an accountable and transparent manner as a complement to
successful privatization. As a beginning, the C o M has prepared a comprehensive sector policy.
When adopted and publishedit will help clarify the rules o f the game for potential investors in
Ukrtelecom and the entire sector, and thereby help lead to a privatization outcome, which will
help Ukraine fulfill its potential in telecommunication services. In particular, the policy paper
outlines the roles o f the State Committee on Communications and Informatization, the
telecommunications regulator and other agencies like the Anti-Monopoly Commission within an
accountability system, and guides the design o f the regulatory framework to be refined and
implementedby the regulator. According to the policy paper, the regulatory framework will
cover interconnection, licensing, tariff re-balancing, universal service, and radio spectrum
management. In parallel, the Government presented a draft telecommunications law to
Parliament, which was prepared within the framework of the sector policy paper. In July 2003,
Parliament adopted the draft law. The version o f the law that was passed would have created the
legal basis for a regulatory agency, but would not have been WTO nor EU compliant, in

                                                 20

particular with respect to the necessary degree o f independence o f the regulator. The draft law
has been refined, t akinginto account the proposals made by the President o fUkraine, and is
currently under consideration o f the CoM. By the time o f PAL-111, the Government plans to
promote enactment o f a WTO and/or EU compliant communications law, which inter alia will
create the legal framework for an independent regulatory agency.           This agency should be
established and working intime for a high quality privatization process o f Ukrtelecom. For PAL
111, the establishment o f the regulator will be confirmed by a benchmark on adoption and
implementation by the regulator o f a phased telecom tariff rebalancingplan.

43.      In the financial system, the Government Program mandates a forceful and prompt
implementation o f the Banking Law approved in December 2000 and expects concrete outcomes
from the enforcement o f the new regulatory system. Inparticular, the following improvements in
bank regulation are highlighted:


0   The regulatory framework for bank supervision has been revised to make it compliant
with the provisions of the Law on Banks and Banking.

0   According to the report of the Financial Sector Assessment Program(FSAP) conducted
jointly by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the NBU is
compliant with 22 of 30 Base1Core Principles (BCP) for Banking Supervision, including on
bank capital, large exposure, provisioning, enforcement and legal framework.

0   The NBUhas introduced procedures requiringthat external bank auditing is compliant
with ISA for the 2003 fiscal year audits.
By the time o f the second tranche o fPAL-11,the NBUhas committed to implementing a plan o f
action along the lines recommended in the October 2002 FSAP toward full compliance with
BCPs. Inparticular, efforts will be made in phases to meet the BCP on connected lending, as
well as to ensure that by the time o f PAL-I11 all banks are ISA compliant. The authorities are
also committed to creating adequate legal and institutional capacity to implement its anti-money
laundering (AML)and combating the financing o f terrorism (CTF) programs.
44.      To further strengthen financial intermediation in the country, reduce risks and improve
transparency, in July 2001, Parliament passed the law on Financial Services and State Regulation
o f Financial Services Markets, which calls for the establishment o f a regulator for non-bank
financial institutions. Significant steps have been taken to establish the agency: (a) the
needed Presidential Decree has been issued, (b) budget and premises have been provided
for its operation, and (d) the head of the agency has been appointed. Over the coming few
months, the regulator will set clear rules for a wide range o f non-bank financial transactions that
are currently carried out in the absence o f mechanisms to protect clients and investors.
Implementation w ork w illc ontinue s o that by the t ime o f PAL-111, the non-banking financial
institutions (NBFI) regulator will have created a register and issued regulatory requirements for
registration, licensing and control over activities o f private pension funds, insurance companies
and other non-bank financial institutions. Of special importance is the growth o f private pension
funds inUkraine, which to date has taken place inthe absence o f a regulatory framework. Thus,
Parliament recently passed the Law on Non-State Pension Funds which creates a modern
legal framework for operation and regulation of the sector.

45.      State Savings Bank (SSB): SSB has the largest network o f branches in Ukraine and its
share inthe total volume o f the population's deposits amount to almost 15%. These deposits are
100% guaranteed by the state. The volumes o f SSB's obligations are rapidly growing, as is the
case with the banking sector as a whole. Given the ramified network o f SSB's branches and the
number o fits staff, thebank's expenditures are considered to berather highas compared to more
profitable banks inthe private sector. Up to the present time, the bank remains undercapitalized,
the credit portfolio quality i s not satisfactory, and the level o f its information and technological
support do not meet its present-day requirements.

46.      The CoM, the NBU, and the SSB, in the presence o f the World Bank, have agreed and
signed a Memorandum o f Understanding (MoU) to improve the financial status o f the bank. At
its first stage, the M o U provides, in particular, for a partial restriction o f the volumes o f
crediting, maintaining the limit volumes as established by the bank business plan for 2003, a
reduction in the interest rate for the attracted deposits, and a decrease in non-interest
expenditures. In accordance with the MoU's requirements, an internationally recognized audit
firm is carrying out a special inspection o f SSB's portfolio, its ability to manage its portfolio, and
its crediting practices.    In addition, the M o U provides for a technical assistance plan to be
financed out o f the funds o f a grant o f the Dutch Government for strengthening o f the financial
markets o f Ukraine. With assistance o f consultants with relevant specialization, the SSB staff
are conducting a strategic inspection o f the bank and its operations, as well as carrying out an
analysis o f its clients, the products distribution system, and its competitive position. Based on
this analysis, a strategic andbusinessplanwill be preparedand implemented.

47.     Inaccordance with the MoU, after satisfactory completion ofthis process, and also after
implementation o f the recommendations based on the results o f the special inspection, the
restrictions will beremoved.


C.       CreatingandProtectingPropertyRights
48.     Weaknesses in property rights inhibit opportunities for income-eaming activities and
investments, they reduce the power to enforce contracts, and hamper the ability o f citizens and
legal entities to retain the benefits o f own effort. In Ukraine, the legal, institutional and
operational framework for private property ownership needs to be advanced in order to
strengthen financial intermediation, facilitate a better allocation o f productive assets, and
improve the incentive structure and management o f enterprises in all sectors o f the economy.
Special attention i s needed in the area o f utility privatization to attract investment, improve
management and secure stable and low cost services.

49.     The medium-term v isiorz targets the following strategic areas for improved ownership
rights: (a) strengthening property rights in agriculture; (b) utilizing bankruptcy as a mechanism
for facilitating the restructuring (or closure) o failing enterprises, (c) supporting a transparent
privatization processes, including for strategic utilities - energy and telecommunications; and (d)
outlining a plan to secure the viability o fNaftogaz.

50.      Strengtheningproperty rights in agriculture. Inthe agricultural sector, the Government
has set in motion a process to disband the previous system o f collective agriculture, to transfer
land to private owners to use as they see fit
(including for leasing and using it as                                 Box 4 Ukraine's New Land Code
collateral)     and to      allow tradability of             The new Land Code is liberal with respect to the use of
agricultural              land.             Significant      land, allows for the tradability o f agricultural land by
accomplishments have been made in the                        2005, and allows for the private accumulation o f large
recent past which contributed to a larger than               tracts o f land (over 100 hectares) by 2010.        While
                                                             foreign persons andor legal entities are prohibited from
expected rebound o f agriculture production                  purchasing agricultural land, both short and long term
in2001-2002. This included, (a) phasing-out                  leases (50 years) are allowed, and there are no
o f the Government monopoly on inputs and                    restrictions on purchasing land for non-agricultural
outputs, (b) issuance o f land certificates to               commercial purposes. Importantly, the code recognizes
the former Kolkhoz members(giving each o f                   land as a commodity and thus permits land to be usedas
                                                             collateral.   This watershed public action confirms
them ownership rights on around 4.2 hectares                 Ukraine's conservative, yet broad national support to
o f arable land), and (c) initiation of the                  the tenet of private land ownership. In particular, it
process o f issuing land title deeds to                      recognizes the importance o f tradability o f land as the
demarcated plots o f land (1.3 million deeds                 key to agriculture and rural development, as well as its
were issuedby June 2001).                                    importance for attracting foreign investment.


51.     In October 2001, just after the Board presentation of PAL-I, Parliament approved a
market orientedland code (see Box 4). With the Land Code inplace, the Government's focus
i s on promotion o f by-laws and regulations necessary for its full implementation. However,
significant progress was made on the privatization process even before the Land Code was
enacted. The issuance o f land certificates i s already ~omplete,'~and the Government i s now
focusing on the process o f land title issuance and registry. Land title issuance is the last step o f a
complex process which includes creation o f a cadastre and demarcation o f the land, assigning it
to individual land holders, and then issuing and registering the actual legal land titles. The
Government i s using experience gained over the past year to improve the quality o f the land title
issuance and has taken steps to develop a modem cadastre and unified land and real estate
registry system under a single agency. Specifically, the Government has achievedthe following:

0    Cumulativeissuanceof over 3.4 millionlandtitles;

0    A review was undertaken of land title issuance, and through survey techniques, a
     baselinequalityindex of landtitle issuancewas created;

0    The Government submitted to Parliament proposals to amend the draft law which
     would provide for establishment of a unified system of registrationfor legal rights to
     landand real estate ownershipwithin a single agency.
52.     By the time o f the second tranche o f PAL-11, the Government has committed to work
with Parliament so that the Government's proposals are adopted and the unified registry can be
established. The Bank i s supporting Ukraine in this process through the Rural Land Titling and
Cadastre Development Project. The project i s already helping to develop a clear, effective, and
transparent processes for granting land titles, and by the time o f PAL-I11the Government intends



   Land c ertificates represent only a f i s t stage inthe process. They c onfirm that a farm member has right t o a
portion of the farm's land, but do not specifically identify private plots.

                                                         23

to issue at least an additional 500,000 improved quality land titles according to the
recommendations o f the study mentioned above, and supported by the project.

53.     Bartkruptcy. The Government and Parliament have acted to streamline bankruptcy
procedures and related legislation to make the process a more effective and helpful instrument
for the restructuring or closure o f ailing enterprises and banks. In January 2000, a new
bankruptcy law was passed which streamlines the procedure, clarifies the rights o f creditors, and
allows for reorganization and/or liquidation procedures to be followed. Analysis comparing
implementation o f the new law in 2001 with the old law in 199916confirms that the process is
improving. According to the study, in 2001, bankruptcycompletionremainedabove 4000 per
year, less time was neededto complete bankruptcyproceedingson average, and fewer cases
were left undecided in courts. These are positive trends which are continuing as the court
system, creditors, trustees and enterprises become more familiar and comfortable with the new
law.

54.     UnderPAL-I,the Government formed a list o fthe largest overdue debtors to the state and
initiated bankruptcy proceedings against five o f the largest debtors. Under PAL-11, the
Government has increased its focus on large insolvent enterprises - bankruptcy procedures
have been initiated for 17 enterprises out of a list of the 63 largest chronic tax debtors."
The Government is committed to issuance o f an additional 10 bankruptcies from a revised list o f
the largest tax debtors by the time o fPAL-I1second tranche.

55.     In the financial sector, passage of the new Law on Banks and Banking Activity has
established a clear legal framework for bankruptcy procedures. These new rules, (a) integrate all
pertinent rules and procedures, (b) eliminate existing legal loopholes that allowed parties with
vested interests to interfere and endlessly postpone the process, and (c) put the NBU clearly in
charge o f initiating and managing the bankruptcy procedure for banks. Under PAL-I, the
Government withdrew the banking license o fBank Ukraina and appointed a liquidator o f the
bank. Since then, a time-bound resolutionplan has been implemented for Bank Ukraina
andpaymentsto householddepositors havebeen completed.

56.     Over the medium term, the Government is committed to continued implementation o f the
bankruptcy process for Bank Ukraina. Inparallel, it i s mitigating the social impact o f closing the
bank through retraining and assistance programs. It i s also working with the World Bank on
preparation o f a proposed Rural Finance Project which would establish an alternative source o f
mortgage financing for the agricultural sector. When effectively launched, a system o f mortgage
finance would set the basis for similar advances in other sectors o f the economy, thus further
contributing to financial deepness by facilitating the use o f movable and unmovable property as
collateral.




l6 study,"Report onthe Study ofBankruptcyProcedure ImplementationinUkraine", was preparedinJune
   The
2002 by V. Gorbachuk and 0.Balabushko under the PHRD grant for preparation o f PAL-11.

l7This list was arrived at by eliminating from the list of 100 largest tax debtors those for which bankruptcy
proceedings had already been initiated or for which criminal proceedings had been initiated.

                                                          24

57.       TransparentPrivatization is being supported. Transparent transfer o f ownership rights
from the State to the private sector i s a key part o f the Government's plan to develop a healthy
market economy. Special interests and unclear processes all too often have created an uncertain
climate for investment and inhibited potential interest by would-be competitors in privatization
tenders. As a result, outcomes have often been disappointing. Under PAL-I, in order to improve
the quality o f the privatization process (both to send a signal to potential buyers and to assure
Ukrainian citizens that public assets are not being squandered) the Government helped establish
an independent panel o f experts to advise and monitor the privatization process. In 2001, this
"Privatization Advisory Group" (PAG) reviewed the privatization o f eight large industrial
enterprises selected by the Government because of their size and importance. The review was
conducted according to a pre-set list o f transparency criteria established by PAG.PAG's exposte
review confirmed that the process was acceptable. With this as a start, the Government
broadened this process to the entire privatization program through random sampling o f
privatizations completed in 2002. PAG has given a net positive assessment of the
implementation quality of the entire privatization program."

58.      After a period o f review and revision, the Government recently submitted to the
Parliament a draft Law on the Privatization Program for 2003-2008. The proposed plan
envisages completion o f the privatization process by 2008, and stresses quality o f the execution
process as well as the importance o fprivatization o f large strategic assets. It is designed to be the
last privatization program necessary for Ukraine. Additionally, the Government intends to
rapidly sell residual shareholding in all joint stock companies o f which it holds less than 25
percent. This step will be important because it will provide a boost to Ukraine's equity markets,
reduce administrative costs and eliminate potential sources o f rent seeking by state officials who
sit on the boards o fprivately run enterprises.

59.       The program o f the Government includes the privatization of Ukrtelecom to strategic
international investors. By the time o f PAL-I, Parliament had already approved, and the
President had signed, the telecom privatization law which envisaged sale o f up to 25%+1 shares
through a competitive process, but allowed for the buyer to purchase management control in a
subsequent share purchase. Since then, through an international competitive biddingprocess, the
CoM has engaged a financial advisor and plans to launch a tender for Ukrtelecom as soon as the
rules o f the tender and the regulatory environment have been clarified for potential investors.
Thus, the current focus remains on designing the telecommunications policy framework and
establishing an independent regulatory agency.




*' While a net positive assessment has been given, the PAG report noted that, (a) privatization has significantly
slowed down in2002, (b) continued use o f investment commitments i s not consistent with the transparency criterion
and i s negatively affecting privatization outcomes, and (c) the role o f the courts in many cases appears problematic.
It was also noted that given the potential role o f the courts and the predatory behavior of some tender participants,
the existing transparency criterion, which focus on the tender process itself, may not capture important non-
transparent practices. It was thus agreed that the authorities would stop the practice o f investment pledge
requirements and undertake close scrutiny of the legalljudicial matters affecting privatization outcomes. The Bank in
tum agreed to pursue with PAG the possibility o f inclusion o f a competitiveness indicator among the PAG
transparency criterion.

                                                   25

60.     The Government Program also includes advances inprivatization of the power sector
companies (oblenergos) in order to increase the sector's performance and reduce long-run costs
to consumers, In M a y 2001, the first batch o f six oblenergos was successfully sold to
international investors on the basis o f the advise o f a financial transactions advisor. After this
first round o f power privatization, the Government took stock o f past experience and confirmed
that new owners were improving the operating efficiency o f the companies, increasing the share
of electricity collections in cash, and establishing a track record o f paying their bills to power
generators. Thus, moving forward, the Government re-appointed its advisor for the privatization
of the remaining oblenergos and plans to launch a tender as soon as implementation o f the
energy sector debt restructuring has matured sufficiently. Along with enactment o f a
comprehensive law on energy sector debt resolution discussed above, this has been identified as
a key benchmark t o trigger disbursement o f the s econd tranche o f PAL-11. Over the medium
term, the Government intends to complete privatization o f oblenergos while initiating
privatization o f the state-owned power generation companies. Progress inthe privatization o f the
power sector will improve the viability and attractiveness o f the power generation companies and
contribute to an improvement inthe viability o fNaftogaz - Ukraine's gas conglomerate.

61.     Naftogaz. Naftogaz represents one o f Ukraine's most important strategic assets. It
employs 164,000 employees, represents roughly 5% o f GDP, and contributes nearly 20%
Ukraine's state budget revenues. It includes gas and oil extraction subsidiaries, gas distribution
companies, and gas transit companies, among other subsidiaries. Naftogaz i s also the largest tax
debtor to the budget, and due to its revenue generating capacity, it often perceived as a source
concern interms o f public sector accountability.

62.     Financial discipline imposed by the Government (e.g., elimination o f mutual offsets,
requirements that taxes be paid in cash, targets on the elimination o f tax arrears), combined with
the need of Naftogaz to Justify its
requests for tariff increases, have
contributed to increased pressure to           Box 5: Naftogaz Subsidizes Ukraine's Economy

jeopardy        unless      necessary     Turkmenistan) are increasingly requiring cash payment prior to
investments are made in Ukraine's         delivery. Naftogaz is also under pressure from competing

Naftogaz group of companies. Simultaneously, Naftogaz i s improving its collection practices
and management of receivables by pressuringhousehold, enterprise and budget customers to pay
their bills infull and ontime.

63.      Naftogaz and the Government are taking steps to improve financial solvency and to
attract needed resources for investment. For instance, Naftogaz has hired a respected
intemational consulting c ompany to help it develop a business strategy. The CoM, in turn, i s
using the plan as an input into the comprehensive energy sector solvency plan mentioned above.
Among the reforms envisaged (some of which are already underway) are modemization o f
Naftogaz's procurement and financial management systems, a strengthening o f vertical control
structures, and identification o f ways to address such important issues as investment policy, tariff
policy, tax compliance and tax policy.

64.      Work i s also ongoing to improve Naftogaz's transparency. Under PAL-I, a contract was
signed with an internationally recognized auditing firm for a multi-year program to obtain an
ISA-based audit of IFRS-based financial statements o f the Naftogaz group o f companies."
Unfortunately, inthe wake o f the Enron debacle, the auditor went out o f business, and only parts
o f the agreed terms o f reference were completed. Inthe mean time, a terms o f reference for the
2001 audit was prepared and agreed with the World Bank. The 2001 work program was
completed in full and the reports were provided to the CoM and the World Bank for
review. The audit highlights certain internal control issues in Naftogaz's financial
management system, and Naftogaz management has outlined a plan of actions to address
these deficiencies. The next stage o f the work program is to take steps to obtain a fully
unqualified audit2' o f Naftogas' consolidated financial statements, prepared according to IFRS,
for the year 2004 by an intemationally affiliated auditing company. Toward this goal, a
contract has been signed for the 2002 year audit according to a terms of reference (TOR)
agreedwith the WorldBank.

65.      Duet o technicalprerequisites, calendar year 2004 is the earliest possible time that an
unqualifiedISA audit can be expected. In order to make this happen, Naftogaz is taking the
necessary steps: (a) a complete end-year 2003 physical verification o f its inventory will be made
in consultation with its auditor, (b) a professional independent firm is being hired to estimate
Ukraine's gas and oil reserves subject to clearances from the Government, and (c) a professional
independent firm i s being hiredto estimate "fair market value" for Naftogaz' property, plan and
equipment. It was agreed that these steps would be completed prior to disbursement o f the 2nd
tranche o f PAL-11.By the time o f PAL-111,Naftogaz intends to complete the 2003 audit and also
to adopt public disclosure standards according to good intemational practices for state-owned oil
and gas conglomerates.




l9 Following up on the 1999 audit, this second phase audit for the year 2000 included preparation o f audited
financial statements for the three subsidiaries involved in production, transmission and trading, as well as
compilation of the financial statements for Naftogas's oil subsidiary (UkraNafta).

2o An "unqualified"   audit i s one in which the auditor confirms that there were no notable exceptions to the
requirements o f IFRS, and that the audit is in compliance with ISA.

D.       Public SectorAccountability
66.      At the beginning o f its transition, Ukraine's fiscal management and public administration
system was designed to encompass almost every aspect o f social and economic life. Significant
progress has already been made in withdrawing direct state intervention in favor o f effective
market institutions, redirecting state resources toward basic health and education, and using
public funds more effectively to alleviate poverty. Equally, efforts to enhance accountability
assume a greater involvement o f civil society and thus help to empower the poor to voice their
concerns and participate inthe design and delivery o f public expenditure programs. Also, efforts
to reform public administration, modemize c ivil s ervice and o verhaul the revenue s ystem are
helpingto scale down and finance the costs o f the State, thus leaving more resources available
for private investment andjob creation.

67.      The medium-term vision seeks to improve credibility o f the State and the institutional
transformation underway through improvements in public sector accountability. Currently the
primary focus is on building an institutional framework that reaches the standards o f best
international practice. Key parts o f this process include the following: (a) refinement o f the
financial accountability system, (b) implementation o f best practice procurement processes, (c)
reform o f the system o f intergovernmental finance, and (d) public administration and civil
service reform.

68.      Improving Financial Accountability. The Government has improved transparency inthe
use o f public monies. Under PAL-I it eliminated the proliferation o f extra-budgetary funds and
promoted a new Budget Code which was subsequently enacted by Parliament. Today, with the
exception o f the Pension Fund, all extra-budgetary funds have been brought into the Single
Treasury Account o f the State Treasury (this includes the three non-pension social funds)*l and a
new budget preparationprocess has been established which reflects national and social priorities
and which involves participation o f civil society. The Ministry o f Finance is refining this process
through a communications campaign. The new Budget Code is also being supported by
improvements in budget execution through better treasury management, budget evaluation and
reporting.

69.      The Government adopted an Action Plan on Financial Accountability which was
presented to the World Bank Board o f Executive Directors along with the President's Report o f
PAL-I.The actionplan is a time-bound implementation schedule o f the key recommendations o f
the Comprehensive Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA) and the Review o f the
Budgetary Process, both completed by World Bank experts in 2001. The Government has made
good progress implementingthis plan and other related actions. Recent achievements include the
following:

0   Initiationof a "Green Paper"on internalfinancialcontrolwhich identifies and analyses
    problemsto be addressed to improveaudit of publicfinance;




21 These include the Fund for Sickness and Parental Insurance, the Unemployment Fund and the Fund on W o r k
Injuries and Occupational Disease.

                                                           28


0    Adoption of improvedaudit proceduresaccordingto the indicators of "performance of
     internalfinancialaudit"            - designedto    helpbudgetmanagers obtain"value for money";

0    Initiation of quarterly reportingto the State Stock Market and Securities Commission
     by SOEs havingsignificantstate shareholding(definedas 10percentor more); and

0    Executionof publicconsultationsduring the budgetprocess through television specials,
     other forms of mass media and public seminars targeted at specific issues (such as
     proposedchanges to tax legislation).
70.       The Government i s committed to continue implementation o f the action plan. By the time
of PAL-I1second tranche, the foremost task will be Cabinet o f Minister's adoption o f "White
Paper on Internal Financial Control", which will be discussed publicly and will form the basis for
draft legislation on financial and budget control.22 Inparticular, the White Paper will clarify the
envisaged accountability o f budget managers - including through increased clarity and
enforcement o f sanctions for misuse o f budgetary funds, the role o f internal financial audit units
within the system o f line ministries and other executive bodies, as well as the roles and
responsibilities o f the Department o f Control and Revision (KRU).The changing role o f KRUi s
o fparticular focus, since it i s envisaged to reform itself into a more strategic (and less across-the-
board) auditing unit, and also to provide technical assistance and emergency-task-force-services
to heads o f ministries and agencies to improve value for money and to address problems
uncovered in audits. In general, KRU will act to support the work o f budget managers and
internal audit units throughout the Government.

71.       Other key implementation measures o f the CFAA action plan to be supported by the
second tranche o f PAL-I1include, (a) establishment o f an external oversight body for the State
Tax Administration, and (b) implementation o f the commitment control treasury system
(KAZNA) inall o fUkraine's oblasts.

72.       Procurement Reform. Reform o fprocurementpractices and their uniform application by
all levels o f government i s central to the Government's efforts to improve fiduciary management.
Early government measures to strengthen the procurement process through decrees, resolutions
and regulations were a good first step from Soviet practices, but did not provide sufficient
consistency, clarity and guidance to procuring entities. In order to remedy this, the first Public
Procurement Law was passed inFebruary 2000 andput into effect inJuly 2000. According to the
Country Procurement Assessment Report (CPAR) for Ukraine, the new procurement law has
wide applicability, facilitates a decentralized procurement s ystem and advocates s ound public
procurement principles - economy and efficiency, international competition, equity and fairness,
development o f domestic industry and transparency. However, the CPAR also identified some
remaining weaknesses in the law and in the institutional design o f the system which need to be




22 The  " white paper" approach is novel for Ukraine. Traditionally, c ompeting 1egislative drafts are s ubmitted t o
parliamentary committee without sufficient explanatory supporting documentation. The drafts themselves are
typically dense and impossible to interpret clearly. The committee then often consolidates ideas from various drafts
at its disposal and forwards a composite draft to the general assembly, which itself is not supported by sufficient
analytics. Often there i s not a full understanding by voting parliamentarians as to the real implications o f legislation

addressed. In response, the Government adopted an Action Plan on the Development o f the
Procurement System, which was also presented to the World Bank Board o f Executive Directors
along with the President's Report o f PAL-I. The action planis a t ime-bound implementation
schedule o f the key recommendations o f the CPAR, and to date the Government has maintained
the envisaged schedule. Among the achievements are the following:

0   With assistance of internationalexpertise, the Governmentdrafted amendmentsto the
     ProcurementLaw andpresentedthemfor the considerationof Parliament;

0    A strategy for the further institutional organization and development of the public
    procurementsystemhasbeendeveloped;

0   Appeal decisions andthe resultsfrominspectioncontrolsare now publiclyavailable;

0   Transparency has been enhanced through promulgation of information over the
    interneton notification,advertisingandpre-qualificationof bidders;and

0   Procedures for the certificationof public procurement specialistshave been approved
     andimplementationinitiated.
73.      The Government will continue implementation o f the Procurement Action Plan. By the
time o f PAL-I1 second tranche, the strategy for institutional development o f the public
procurement system will be adopted by the CoM. Also, the number o f exceptions for the use o f
competitive bidding process (single selection) will be held to 25 % o f the total number and to
35% o f the total value o f contracts. By the time o f PAL-111, the Government plans to reduce this
further to 15 percent o f the total value o f contracts. Other highlights moving forward include
completion o f the process o f legal harmonization with the Law on Public Procurement, the
creation o f an agency on public procurement with appropriate independence and accountability,
introduction o f greater transparency to the tender and selection process, and further progress
certifying procurement specia~ists.~~

74.      TheRevenue System. Ukraine has advanced in creating a tax system compatible with a
market economy. However, the complexity o f the system, the level o f the tax rates, and the use
o f exemptions handicaps taxpayer compliance and tax administration. Tax revenue generation
decreased gradually t o around 2 9 p ercent o f GDP in2001.24 The Govemment recognizes the
importance o f addressing these weaknesses and has already taken steps to improve the situation.
UnderPAL-I, the practice o f granting tax and customs exemptions through decisions ofthe CoM
was eliminated. Improvements in administration practices have contributed to improved
compliance and revenue performance in 2002, as compared to 2001. Moving forward, the
Government i s supporting a significant overhaul o f the revenue system. The objectives are to
create an efficient and transparent public revenue system centered on the reform o f tax and



23 Ongoing work in the area o f financial management and procurement reform i s technically intensive and requires
significant training, technical assistance and some investment. The process i s being supported by a Government-
executed grant extended by the Dutch Government. Other donor agencies, including TACIS (Technical Assistance
for the Commonwealth o f Independent States), USAID, DFID, CIDA (the Canadian International Development
Agency) and SIDA (the Swedish International Development Agency), are also supporting various components of the
action plans.

24 As mentioned previously, this trend was reversed in2002.

                                                          30

customs policy, and the development o f a modem taxhstoms administration that succeeds in
distributingfairly the public finance burden andminimizing compliance costs.

75.     To implement these objectives, at the request o f Government, Parliament has passed
amendments to the personal income tax, enterprise profit tax and excise tax laws. Along with the
expiration o f some earlier time bound exemption programs, these laws broaden the tax base by
reducing exemptions and privileges, strengthening tax administration, reducing selected tax rates
and thereby reducing the burden on workers and employers. The results o f these efforts are
expected to increase tax compliance, reduce the shadow economy and spur both economic
activity and tax revenue performance. Most notably, the tax reform is succeeding by the
following:


0    Reducing tax exemptions and privileges by more than 35%, as measured by resultant
     increases in the tax base since January 1,2002;

e    Lowering PIT rates to a uniform 15 percent;25 and

e    Increasing excise charges on alcohol and motor fuels.
76.     Working with Parliament, the Government intends to make further progress by the time
o f PAL-I1second tranche. Inparticular, it intends to promote amendments to VAT, and possibly
other tax legislation, to reduce the overall base o f tax exemptions by at least an additional 28
percent, while improving administrative practices for VAT by strictly regulating the payment o f
VAT refunds and eliminating loopholesthat make VAT implementationdifficult.

77.     Inter-governmental Finance.              The Government Program sets in place a solid and
transparent system of inter-governmental finance. Local governments are already responsible for
about 40 percent o f consolidated national expenditures, excluding the pension fund. The system
o f inter-governmental fiscal relations i s based on: (a) a clear assignment o f expenditure and
revenue responsibilities; (b) a rule-based system to transfer resources between the national
budget and local governments; (c) improved incentives to generate local revenues; and (d)
transparent reporting and accountability mechanisms. The Budget Code approved in2001 set the
basis for this system.

78.     Under PAL-I, the Bank supported the Government in the development o f a rule-based
systemto determine fiscal transfers based on expenditure needs and revenue capacity o f the local
governments. As a first step the Government applied a formula-based system o f allocating
resources to the oblasts. A recent review shows that in 2001 the Government effectively
allocated budget revenues to oblasts according to the methodology set out by the CoM. For
2002 and beyond, the formula has been applied to the rayon level as well as to the oblasts,
and the process is being continued and refined. The Government has also been working to
develop a system o f investment grants to create conditions favorable to the proper maintenance
and upgrading o f local infrastructure. These efforts set the basis for further reforms such as a
strengthening o f local taxation and putting greater emphasis on service fees. Further, with the
advances that have been made in the national Treasury system, the Government i s extendingthe




25 According to the law, the rate will be reducedfurther to 13% in 2007.

                                                         31

Treasury to the rayon level. This system i s currently being piloted and will be expanded
nationwide when an adequate institutional and informational infrastructureis developed.

79.       Administration of Social Funds. Administration26 o f each o f the four social funds in
Ukraine has traditionally beenmanaged by the funds themselves. This creates undue burden on
taxpayers and reflects duplication o f activities o f comprehensive networks o f funds which carry
out administration. As part o f its overall efforts to use public funds more effectively, the
Government i s streamlining the system o f social funds. The first step has been to channelthe
revenueso f a11s ocial funds, with the exceptionof the PensionFundof Ukraine(PFU),
through the Single Treasury Account. Pilots were also conducted on consolidation of
controYaudit over collection of contributions to social funds and the PFU into a single
agency. By the time o fPAL-I1second tranche, a plan will be established based on this pilot
experience. The plan will outline necessary steps in order to do the following: (a) consolidate
control over collection o f contributions to the social funds and the PFU by a single agency, (b)
vertically centralize reporting on the flow o f funds within each social fund, (c) unify the base for
calculation o f contributions, and (d) unifythe database o f insuredpersons. The authorities intend
to implement this plan by the time o f PAL-111. In the mean time, by the time o f PAL-I1second
tranche, a system of external oversight will be developed and put inplace to ensure that there are
real-time checks and balances by an external bodJ7 o f the pension funds, which are currently
being serviced by the State Savings Bank.

80.      Public Administration Reform.             The public sector is inefficient and not sufficiently
aligned with the changing role o f the state. There i s under-developed capacity for strategic policy
making, dissonance between the reform agenda and policy actions effectively taken, and the
public administration i s stunted by complexities o f the legal and administrative system. To
address these weaknesses the Government has adopted a medium term strategy which focuses
on, (a) improving the decision making c apacity o f t he C abinet by downsizing it, focusing i t s
work on strategic priorities, and making it more transparent; (b) changing the role and functions
o f ministries; (c) strengtheningthe fiscal capacity o f the Government; and (d) improving civil
service performance.

81.      Under PAL-I, the Government reformed the Cabinet and its Secretariat. It downsized the
Cabinet from 50 to 20 members and reduced the number o f central state bodies from over 80 to
less than 50 (including 16 ministries). The Government created five specialized Cabinet
Committees to decrease the workload o f the Cabinet, improve transparency, and increase the
policy role o f the ministries. Also, the Government downsized and streamlined the Secretariat to
better support the work o f the new Cabinet and its Committees and eliminate the discretionary
role o f the previous Apparat.




26 Administration broadly includes collection, enforcement, cash management, debt management and execution of
     payments.

                                                   32

82.     More recently, the Government is improving the decision-making capacity o f the
ministries and lower levels o f government. Its plan i s to focus the work o f the Cabinet on
strategic priorities (especially preparation o f key policy decisions), while delegating non-
strategic and sectoral issues to lower levels o f govemment, eliminating the remaining
overlapping functions, and aligning budgetary resources with medium-term strategic priorities.
Already, the Cabinet has delegated authority by promoting legal changes (laws and by-
laws) to transfer selected powers to ministries, agencies and lower levels of government.
The focus by the time o f PAL-I11will be to create advisory capacity and advisory protocol along
the lines upon which modern governments operate, within the core ministries and in support of
Cabinet decision-making. This will leadt o better informed decision-making and b etter public
policy outcomes.

83.     Civil Service Reform.       The Government is aware that it i s difficult for public
administration initiatives to succeed without a comprehensive civil service reform. The strategy
is to increase the motivation o f civil servants through a system based on enhanced public servant
training, merit and competition, with strong safeguards against corruption. Recent steps on this
agenda include the following:


0   The development and approval of methodological improvements for the annual
    assessment of the performanceof civil servants; and

0   Introduction of entrance exams into the system of conducting open competitive
    selection of candidates.
By the time o f PAL-111, the Government intends to focus on a strengtheningo f the Main Civil
Service Administration, especially through allocation o f additional resources for the
development o f its regional departments. This will make it possible to broaden its supervision
and appeals functions to the civil service throughout Ukraine.


E.      Managementof Social andEnvironmentalRisks
84.     Ukraine has inherited a very inefficient and overextended system o f social services which
has limited its ability to address the emerging social risks that it faces. Similarly, the system of
environmental protection has not responded effectively to lower revenue levels, nor the
fundamental changes that are taking place in the economy and in the sources o f pollution. In
order to be effective in the provision o f these global public services, the Government i s
committed to prioritizing, streamlining and making efficiency improvements to mitigate
downside risks and set the stage for longterm restructuring and improvement o f the system.

85.     Medium-term vision. In the social services, the program seeks to address issues of
overstaffing, extensive networks o f outdated and under-equipped facilities, lack o f basic supplies
and other chronic problems. These reforms will be the basis o f improving sector performance
and reversing the downward trend in poverty and health indicators that affect vulnerable
segments o f the population (the elderly, children, single mothers, and unemployed). They will
also help to revitalize human capital and empower large segments o f the population to actively
take part in ensuing economic growth. Inpensions, the focus i s on continued development o f the
legal and administrative framework for a three-pillar pension system. In the area o f social
protection, the focus is on improving the targeting and operational efficiency o f the social
transfer system. In environment, where there are strong externalities to the population's health

                                                  33

and living quality, efforts are being made to streamline the fine and permit system while
improving the efficiency o f the use o fpublic funds for environmental protection.

86.      Education. The Ukrainian education sector has experienced cuts inpre-school education
services, deteriorating infrastructure, low wages and inadequate educational supplies. There are
indications o f decreasing enrollment rates in primary and secondary schools and disparities in
provision which tend to affect the rural poor more than those in urban areas. The Ukrainian
leadership has recognized the risks and challenges stemmingfrom these tendencies and i s putting
education on a reform track. Its main goals are to extend compulsory education, improve
education quality andprovide services more equitably across the population.

87.      Under PAL-I, education reform was initiated by the piloting o f education and financial
management techniques and the adoption o f a national program o f 12-year compulsory
education. Since that time, the Government's efforts have continued:

0    An implementation action plan has been developed and adopted for 2002-2004 which
     takes account of the financial implication of the reform process and the need for
     efficiencyimprovementsinthe system;

0    Plansfor optimizationof ruralschoolnetworkswere adoptedin 3 oblasts;and

0    The regulatoryframeworkwas developedand approvedfor provisionof loansto higher
     educationstudents.
88.      Moving forward, by the time o f PAL-I11the Government intends to complete evaluation
o f the pilot results and begin optimization o f rural school networks. The process will be assisted
by the creation o f six Regional Education Quality Monitoring Centers, and secondary education
will benefit from an improved 12-year curriculum. Additionally, new content requirementsand a
system for in-service teacher training will be developed for secondary education.

89.      Health. Inlight o f reduced incomes of the population, the high level o f health services
provided inthe past has become unaffordable to the bulk o f the population, and if fully provided
by the public sector, would require very highlevels o f taxation. Thus, the Government Program
focuses on developing a financially sustainable health care system that i s accessible to the
population, while addressing the most critical health priorities, especially control o f the
tuberculosis (TB) and HIV/AIDS epidemics.

90.      Financing the health care system.         The Government Program seeks to design a
financially and economically sound health system through analysis o f various sources o f
financing and payment. Options under consideration include state and local budgets, mandatory
social health insurance, voluntary health insurance, and private payments. In order to make any
alternative sustainable, prioritization and efficiency measures are needed. Under PAL-I a
National Health Sector strategy was adopted, improvements were made in primary care through
the establishment o f new family medicine centers and a creation o f a new university
specialization focusing on family medicine. Efforts were also made to better understand how to
develop a financially affordable system at the local level through pilots such as the one in Lviv
oblast. This process has already had some positive results. For instance, about 1000 family
doctors have been trained through the new university system and budget funds are being

                                                34

channeled to primary health care facilities to provide them with needed maintenance, vehicles
and equipment.

91.      The Government has continued this process by taking steps to put the national strategy
into implementation within available revenues. For this purpose, a financial and economic
analysis of the draft health insurance law has been prepared and regional plans have been
developed and approved for optimization of the network of rural health care
establishments in three oblasts Chernigivska, Kirovogradska and Kharkivska. Under the
                                    -
rationale that primary health care i s the key to maximum access and high efficiency, progress
continues to be made on the restructuring o f small rural hospitals and ambulatory health centers
and in the training o f family doctors. Moving forward, in order to prepare and apply a
restructured system, the Government i s developing a National Health Accounts analysis using
international standard definitions which will encourage financial discipline in health planning
exercises. Also, efforts are being made to use program-based financing to direct scarce health
funds to priority areas and to streamline the formula for distribution o f health budget resource
allocationto the oblast and rayon levels.

92.      TB/AIDS control strategies. The prevalence o f TB and AIDS is growing rapidly in
Ukraine (See Box 6). The Government i s taking aggressive action to combat the spread o f these
diseases. Its objective i s to reduce TB and
HIV/AIDS morbidity and mortality through
an effective National TB Control Program            Box 6: The Threat of TB/AIDS inUkraine

and a National HIVIAIDS Program, largely        As in many of the newly independent states, tuberculosis
focused on prevention o f transmission o f      has   increased dramatically     in Ukraine     following

these diseases among high-risk groups.          independence from the former Soviet Union. By 1999,
                                                the number of infected people had reached32,691, with a
Under PAL-I,         the Government,      (a)   case rate of 65.0 per 100,000, a doubling of the rate
improved control of public health risks         compared to 1990. Similarly, since early 1995, HIV
through execution of two pilots o f the TB      started to spread rapidly, especially among injecting drug
DOTS method           adopted    to  national   users.  By the end of 1995, a total of 1,500 diagnosed

conditions, and (b) adopted an AIDS             infections were reported. Just two years later, roughly
                                                110,000 adults were estimated to be infected with HIV.

2003.         Since      then,       detailed   2002, 44,559 persons were HIV positive. Current
implementation        plans     have    been    estimates by UNAIDS, taking into account under-

strategies, and a US$60 million loan from
the World Bank has been approved to help finance implementation costs. Among other actions
supported by the loan, by the time o f PAL-I11the Government intends to complete a study that
gives a credible overview of the knowledge, risks behavior, and attitudes among the key risk
groups for HIV/AIDS.

93.      Pensions. In pensions, the main objective o f the Government Program i s to reform the
first pillar, preparethe groundwork for the introduction o f a second pillar, and set up a regulatory
framework for the third pillar, which is already defacto in operation. The Government opted for
a three-pillar pension reform in 1998 and drafted the Mandatory State Pension Insurance Law in
2000. Significant progress has been made with support o f PAL-I1 to establish a financially and
socially viable pensions system. In particular, in July 2003 Parliament adopted the legal

                                                35

framework for the three pillar system: (a) the Law on Mandatory Pension Insurance, and (b) the
Law on Non-State PensionFunds.

94.      An efficient pension system relies on easily accessible and centralized databases o f
contributors and beneficiaries and a reliable administrative network. Inaddition, moving t o a
multi-pillar system requires personification o f accounts and personal identification certificates.
The setting up o f an institutional and technical framework for pension reform was started under
PAL-I when the pension determination function was transferred to the Pension Fund in 11 o f
Ukraine's 26 oblasts. The Government has continued this process:

0   The pension determination function has been transferred to the Pension Fund of
    Ukrainenationwide;

0   The large majority of new pensioncalculationsare basedon personifiedaccounts; and

0   A central database of insured persons has been created and 3 million certificates of
    mandatorysocial insurancehavebeenissued.

The focus moving forward will be ensuring that all necessary actions are taken to make sure that
the new systemremains fiscally sound and operates efficiently.
95.     SocialAssistance. The chief objective o fthe Government Program insocial assistance is
to improve efficiency in the use o f very limited budgetary resources to reach the poor and the
needy. The new system of targeted social assistance, in conjunction with organizational
consolidation and reduction in administrative costs, will help achieve that objective. Under PAL-
I,theprovisionoffamily benefits wastransferredfromstateenterprisestoSocialProtection
Departments (SPD) and social assistance administration was consolidated through the merger o f
the Housing and Subsidy Departments with the SPDs. A new unified targeting methodology was
developed which would institute means-testing for all social assistance programs, and 750
territorial social care centers were created to help administer the new system. The Government
has continued to progress inthis area:

    The number of social benefit programs was reduced from 11 to 5 and are now fully
    focusedon vulnerable sectors of the population;

0   Targeted fuel and liquefied gas subsidies, in addition to being means tested, are now
    providedas cash paymentsto recipients,and

0   A draft law on Social Services has been submitted to Parliament which envisaged
    diversified provision of social care services, including through private and non-
    governmentalorganization(NGO) provision.
96.     Moving forward, further progress i s expected from expanding the new unified targeting
methodology to all social assistance programs, continued consolidation o f the social assistance
administration, and further improving social care provision based on the results o f three regional
pilot projects.

97.     Special Privileges. In 2000 and 2001, in order to address the problem o f social and
occupational expenditure privileges, articles were included in the respective budget laws to
freeze these entitlements (See Annex 6 for a brief history). In the lead-up to the 2002
parliamentary elections, the previous parliament excluded a similar article inBudget 2002. Thus,

                                                36

Ukraine reverted back to a system o f unfunded entitlements which reduced the credibility o f the
State, resulted in poor needs-based targeting o f social transfers, and contributed to a worsening
o f the financial balances o f state-owned and private enterprises. Inresponse, the Government is
working with Parliament toward a more permanent solution. A CoM Resolution o f March 2002
calls for a moratorium on benefit categories, full cashing out of privileges, and compensation
increases as appropriate in parallel with the elimination o f occupational privileges (i.e., paying
public sector workers in cash instead o f through implicit taxing o f communal service providers).
However, while the Cabinet was able to take some measures on its own, full rationalization o f
the privileges system would require amendments to about 40 different laws.

98.      The Law on the Budget o f 2003 represents an improvement over the situation in 2002,
and represents another positive step toward a permanent solution to the privilege problem. The
Budget2003 requiresincometargetingof privilegesfor all publicworkers and ensures that
housing and communal service privileges are limited to only immediate family members
(through pro-rating by household members). Action has also been taken to consolidate
administrationof the privilegessystem withinthe Ministryof Labor and Social Protection.
The goal by the time of PAL-I11 is to fully rationalize the privileges system through the
necessary legal and administrative changes to, (a) income target privileges to all recipients, (b)
administer the system through a cash-based mechanism, and (c) make sure that all remaining
entitlements are fully financed through the budget.

99.     Environment. Inthe midst o f a difficult transition, Ukraine lacks a national consensus on
environmental policy priorities and regulations. The Government has started to take up this
challenge, and i s focusing on the following strategic areas: (a) strengthening institutional
capacity o f environmental agencies to enforce environmental regulations; (b) developing a
system o f environmental pollution permits for control and monitoring o f actual pollution
discharges; (c) defining priorities and establishing clear criteria for public environmental
spending on the basis o f cost-benefit principles; and (d) improving the existing institutional
structure o f environmental financing. Within this framework, the following key actions have
already been taken:

0    Pollutionfines have been increasedby a factor of 0.8 as of January 1, 2003 (the figure
     will rise to 1.5 on January 1, 2004) to help make up for their reduction in real terms
     since 1996;

0    After the January 2004 increased, the decision has been taken to index pollutionfines
     with inflationhenceforth;and

0    A pilot program of integrated pollution prevention permits has been launched at 8
     selected enterprises. The pilots include preparation of environmental audits as a
     technicalbaselinefor issuingpermits.
100.    The Government intends to continue and deepen this process by the time o f PAL-111. In
particular, the Government will abolish the practice o f granting exemptions related to payment o f
pollution charges to enterprises o f the mining and metallurgy industry. It will also develop and
issue a regulatory framework for the introduction o f an integrated pollution prevention permits
system in Ukraine, which is both environmentally sound and does not unduly burden the
productive sector. Toward implementation o f this framework, integrated pollution prevention

                                                   37

permits will be issued and operational for at least three o f the pilot enterprises as a basis for
nation-wide implementation of the system.


                                         IV. THE BANKGROUP STRATEGY

A.        The World Bank
101.     Lessons. Buildingon the lessons o f earlier Bank assistance to Ukraine, the 2001-03 CAS
outlined a support strategy based on demand for and supply of pro-development institutions.
Under the low case scenario, the Bank would envisage limitedprograms that would enhance the
role o f the private sector and civil society. Underthe Base Case scenario,28Bank support extends
to the creation and enhancement o f strong institutions in the economy and the public sector,
taking advantage of breakthroughs at the Government level, and seeking to complete and revise
the institutional framework and improve govemance. The recently approved CAS for 2004-2007
advances this design through an intensified focus on performance and outcomes.

102.     CAS Links. The PAL has been designed as the flagship set o f operations to provide the
institutional strengtheningand structural transformation which will lead to outcomes that can be
supported under the Base Case scenario o f

103.     Maintaining the Base Case. The proposed PAL-I1 is being presented to the Board
because the Government's record o f accomplishments justifies it as defined under the FY04-07
CAS. The triggers for the Base Case are outlined in Box 7. Overall portfolio performance has

                                                      38

improved through inter alia streamlining of the portfolio and implementation o f lessons learned
in projection formulation and supervision. The mechanism for Bank loan approvals and
effectiveness has been reviewedby ajoint Bank-Government working group, and recently there
has been improvement in processing time. Adherence to financial and fiduciary obligations has
been improved through implementation o f actions plans following from the Comprehensive
Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA) and the Country Procurement Assessment Report
(CPAR). A consistent and sustainable macroeconomic framework i s in place. Finally, PAL
triggers concerning financial accountability, regulatory framework, property rights, public sector
accountability and social and environmental risk management have been met as evinced by the
completion o fbenchmarks prior to Board presentation.


B.      Coordinationwith the IMF
104.    The PAL Program has been coordinated with the IMF at all stages. Joint work in
particular continues in the areas of economic monitoring, tax reform (in particular, reduction o f
VAT refund arrears and elimination of tax exemptions), calculation and reduction o f quasi-fiscal
deficits, (especially v i s - h i s the energy sector), financial sector policy and regulation, and close
coordination on fiscal policy issues and fiduciary management reform.

105.    During an October 2003 visit, the IMF did not conclude a proposed precautionary
standby arrangement with the Authorities.              While the IMF noted the economy's strong
performance and felt that the draft Budget 2004 was appropriate, progress at that time on
eliminating VAT refund arrears and VAT exemptions was not considered sufficient. These
issues are being addressed by the Government - supported by the P A L I1program with respect
to VAT exemptions, and in parallel with PAL I1 as regards VAT refund arrears. Progress
achieved form the basis for continued discussions.


C.      Coordinationwith OtherDonors
106.    Technical assistance of donors is an important element supporting implementation o f the
Government Program. PAL provides a framework for integrating and prioritizing donor
assistance and making it more effective. Importantly, by focusing assistance on priority areas,
coordination through PAL helps deal with the decreasing total volume o f donor support.
Significant trust fund resources are contributing to the Government's achievements. Inparticular,
three PHRD Grants from the Japanese Governmentz9have been implementedthrough the World
Bank ins upport o f a 11 five thematic areas o f t he Government's Program. Inaddition, a free-
standing     government-executed         grant provided by the Dutch Government is under
implementation in support of improved financial accountability, procurement reform, and
preparation for WTO accession. The Bank i s actively coordinating with other donors to eliminate
overlaps and identify potential new sources o f funding for needed areas. The Bank i s also




29 A PHRD Grantoriginally for preparationofthe LegalReformLoanwas combinedwith a PHRDGrant originally
for preparing the Public AdministrationLoan in support for PAL-I preparation. PAL-I1had a PHRD Grantwith
resources assigned to each of PAL'Sthematic areas. A PHRD Grant has been awarded in a parallel structure for
PAL-111, althoughthe GrantAgreement has not yet beendeveloped.

working with the Government to improve its counterpart practices in order to better focus the
efforts o f all parties towards achievement o fthe maximum reform impact.


                                       V.     THE PROPOSEDLOAN

A.      ProgramDesign

107.    The proposed PAL-I1loan is the second in the series o f the five adjustment operations
planned under the FY04-07 CAS period. PAL-I1 i s designed to support the Government's
reform efforts in each o f the five thematic areas o f the Government Program outlined above. As
with PAL-I, PAL-I1supports concrete and measurable outcomes already achieved as reflected by
up-front completion o f an agreed set o f benchmarks. Also, as was the case with PAL-I, while a
considerable amount o f outcomes are already completed, select second tranche benchmarks have
been identified, the completion of which would release the second tranche disbursement. It is
envisaged that PAL-I1would entail budget and balance o f p ayment support int he amount o f
US$250 million, o f which US$75 million would be disbursed upon Board approval, and
US$172.5 million upon completion o f all o f the second tranche benchmarks. The proposed
policy matrix containedinAnnex 9 sets out the benchmarks o f the PAL program, including those
achieved under PAL-I, PAL-I1 and those envisaged for PAL-111. The benchmarks are those
actions and outcomes that underpin the proposed legal agreement (as taken from the proposed
policy matrix). They are highlighted in the next section. Some o f the key milestones are also
highlighted inthe policy matrix.

108.    As mentioned above, a11of theprior actions for Board approval ofPAL-I1have been
completed, e second tranche benchmarks are clearly defined, and areas o f the Government
Program to be supported under PAL I11 have been agreed between the Government and the
Bank. As it reflects the design of the Government's Letter o f Development Policy (LDP), the
Government expects the proposed policy matrix to guide and help coordinate the work of
multiple ministries and agencies involved inthe continuous development and implementation o f
the Government Program. As this work continues and feedback is obtained on progress, the
Government and the Bank will further refine benchmarks to be supported under subsequent
operations inthe PAL series.

109.    The Government has agreed to the disclosure policy on adjustment operations, and plans
to publishthe Program Document o f the PAL-I1as well as the LDP on its official web site.

110.    Since the PAL cuts across different sectors, considerable internal government
coordination inUkraine is involved inits implementation and a great many experts and c ivil
servants in government are actively involved. Responsibility for P A L preparation and processing
within the Government is with the First Vice Prime Minister, supported by the Minister o f
Economy and Issues o f European Integration (MEEI), the First Deputy Minister o f Finance, the
First Deputy Minister o f the MEEI, a coordinating group, and five working groups headed by
experts at the level o f deputy heads o f agencies andor ministries. These individuals and groups
have worked actively on the implementation o f the Government Program supported by PAL. The
Presidential Administration and Parliament have also been consulted and have taken critical
decisions that facilitated implementation o f the program.

ThemeE: ManaEement of Social and Environmental Risk

There are no second tranche benchmarks inTheme E.

D.      LoanAdministration

113.    Borrower and Loan Amount. The proposed PAL-I1o fUS$250,000,000 will be made to
Ukraine, represented by the Ministry o f Finance. The proposed loan will be a two tranche
variable spread loan (VSL) with a 20-year maturity, including a 5-year grace period, at the
Bank's standard terms. The first tranche i s proposed as US$ 75,000,000 and the second tranche
as US$172,500,000.

114.    Disbursement.     Upon approval o f the loan and notification by the Bank o f Loan
effectiveness, the Government will s ubmit a w ithdrawal application. The Ministry o f Finance
will open and maintain a Deposit Account in the NBU. The International Bank for
Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) will deposit the proceeds o f the loan into this Deposit
Account at the request o f the Ministry of Finance. Prior to that, the Bank will withdraw from the
Loan Account a front-end fee amounting to 1% o f the loan amount. If,    after deposit in this NBU
account, the proceeds o f the Loan are usedfor ineligible purposes (for example, to finance items
imported from non-member countries or goods or services on the IBRD standard negative list),
the IBRD will require the borrower to either: (i) that amount to the account for use for
                                                    return
eligible purposes; or (ii)refundthe amount directly to the IBRD, in which case the IBRD will
cancel an equivalent un-disbursedamount o f the loan.

115.    Accounts, Auditing and Closing Date. The Government will maintain accounts and
records, or ensure that such items are maintained, showing that loan disbursements were in
accordance with provision of the Loan Agreement. Such accounts and records will be maintained
in a form acceptable to the Bank. The Government and the Bank have agreed on a tracking
mechanism that would provide the Ukrainian authorities and the Bank with a greater degree o f
assurance and transparency of the proper use o f Bank adjustment funds. The Ministry o f Finance
will arrange for an external audit o f the Deposit Account in accordance with auditing standards
acceptable to the Bank and by auditors acceptable to the Bank. The audit o f the Deposit Account
will be done either separately or in conjunction with the quarterly audits o f the NBU already
conducted under the IMF surveillance program, based on appropriate amendments in the terms
of reference for the audit acceptable to the Bank. The Ministry o f Finance and the NBU will
make the report on the audit of such records available to the Bank. The closing date o f the loan
will be December 31,2004.

E.      Benefits andRisks

116.    Benefits. Among the benefits to Ukraine are the following.

    PAL-I1 encourages better policy coordination; it provides an anchor for the pro-reform
    constituency inthe Government and Parliament, its acts as a catalyst for change, and it is able
    to direct technical assistanceto areas o fneed.
    Wider participation o f civil society in the design and implementation o f reform is reveals a
    growing public perception in Ukraine that a partnership between the Government civil
    society is both feasible and effective.
    PAL-I1 supports continued macro-stability while establishing structural reforms which are
    crucial for robust growth over the medium term and for reducing vulnerability o f the
    economy to internal stagnation and/or negative extemal shocks.
    PAL-I1improves the social situation by reducing poverty directly, improves social services
    and provides more opportunities for middle and lower income households to share in the
    benefits o f economic development, both inurban and rural areas.
    PAL-I1provides significant resources to help finance the ongoing and successful structural
    and institutional reformprogram o fthe Government.
117.    Risks. The key risks for the program are political uncertainty, the pace o f structural
reform, and vulnerability to as yet unforeseen external economic shocks.

118.    The large majority o fUkraine's political factions support the ideals o f a market economy
and eventual European integration. This forms a backdrop for the Government Program.
However, positioning for the presidential elections o f 2004 has already begun, vested interests
remain strong, and the Government's supporting coalitionwill remaintenuous. Therefore the
pace and consistency o f policy implementation - often calling for politically difficult reforms -
will no doubt continue to be affected by short-term political tradeoffs. Nevertheless, most o f the
benchmarks associated with PAL-I1have already been met, and second tranche benchmarks are
clearly defined, obtainable, and owned by the Government. This i s reflected by the up-front
actions in each of the areas in which second tranche benchmarks are outstanding. To further
reduce risks and support completion o f the proposed program, the operation's disbursements
have been significantly back-loaded. Over the longer term, flexibility built into the PAL design
will allow the program to focus on opportunities while helping to ensure the sustainability o f
achievements already made.

119.    Inan adverse scenario inwhichpolitical difficulties stall progress and leadto reversals o f
past institutional reforms and/or a deteriorating economic framework, the built-in safeguards o f
the CAS would be triggered and the country program would return to the L o w Case scenario. In
that scenario, no further PAL resources would be available, and all complementary operations
would be cancelled. It i s expected, though, that the probability o f an adverse scenario will
continue to diminish as economic growth continues, the macroeconomic environment remains
stable, and the country moves closer to having the institutional framework o f a modem market
economy.

                                                          47

120.     The second key risk is that the deepness and pace at which the economy reorients itself,
and market institutions are established, are not sufficient to avoid further stagnation should the
current positive economic trends lose steam. The macroeconomic/fiscal adjustments following
the 1998 financial crisis have reduced downside risks considerably. Inparticular, the debt burden
i s now sustainable and another public sector liquidity crisis appears unlikely under the current
leader~hip.~~However, slow or poor quality reform implementation would increase the
economy's vulnerability to downside risks. Inparticular, the rapid pace o f banking deposits and
competition for market share in the banking industry, combined with a relatively weak
institutional framework for financial intermediation and weak capacity within the banks
themselves, creates risks o f financial sector instability. The World Bank incoordination with the
NBU is cooperating on the creation of a risk monitoring system to help identify emerging
financial problems so that they can be addressed before markets react radically to them. Also o f
concern would be the continued accumulation o f quasi-fiscal deficits inthe energy sector. These
risks are directly related to the quality o fpolicy implementation o f the Government and National
Bank. Good policies can substantially reduce them, and inparticular, PAL-I1has a strong focus
on improved financial sector regulation given the risks highlighted above, as well as imposing
hardbudget constraints, especially as they relate to the energy sector.

121.     The third significant risk is external. Adverse weather conditions or a significant
slowdown o f growth and/or exchange rate fluctuations o f regional trading partners are the most
likely external shocks. While any o f these would present downside risks for the macroeconomic
framework, the economy i s becoming more resilient, the debt portfolio i s more balanced, and the
country i s showing improved capacity to adjust trade flows. Nevertheless, a combination o f
shocks, particularly in concert with slow and/or incomplete policy implementation, would put
substantial strains on the economy. In any case, a continued relationship with the IMF and
support o f the World Bank and other donors remains extremely important for Ukraine's medium
to longrunhealth.




32 In particular, domestic public debt outstanding i s relatively small and domestically owned, and the Ministry o f
Finance issuance o f new Tbills is roughly equal to amortization o f old ones. At the same time, the NBUcontinues to
accumulate foreign reserves at a rapid pace.

                                      MediumTerm Economic Prospects

The real sector. Real GDP i s expected to grow by 6 percent in 2003 before settling into an
average annual 5 percent growth rate over the 2004-2008 period. On the demand side, the key
factors underlyingthis assumptions are: (a) growing domestic demand fuelled by the increase in
real incomes o f households (especially during the coming presidential campaign) and higher
investment activity (especially from 2005 on as political risks subside) based on continuing
exchange rate and price stability, which will boost confidence and allow a longer-term planning
horizon for businesses and households, and implementation o f institutional and structural
reforms in support of economic growth; and (b) reviving external demand as the world economy
will returnto a higher growth level. On the supply side, growth will be maintained by continued
capacity increases in traditional sectors (metals, machine building, chemicals), further
productivity growth o f the comparative advantage sectors (e.g. agriculture, food-processing,
manufacturing), improvements infinancial intermediation, and creation o fnew businesses.

On one hand, the growth rate will not likely reach the 9.2% posted in 2001, at least until 2005
after the presidential elections. The major reasons constraining more rapid growth are pre-
election political uncertainty, and slower than possible progress inreforming natural monopolies.
Inparticular, the slow pace ofprivatizationof large enterprises has not ledto foreign investment
inflows at potential levels, and domestic investors remain wary.

On the other hand, risks o f GDP growth cessation, including major structural policy reversals
and irresponsible fiscal policies, are also modest. The main downside risks are the following: (a)
low agricultural harvest due to adverse weather conditions, (b) a large slump in oil prices which
would hurt Russian demand for Ukraine's exports,' and/or (c) further trade restrictions imposed
by the US, Europe, Russia and/or Asia. Apart from the direct impact o f specific measures,
implementation o f institutional and structural reforms (as evinced by progress on PAL 11) is
helpingto reduce these risks by improving economic expectations o f both domestic and foreign
participants, encouraging new business entry, attracting foreign direct investment, generating
consumer demand through higher and more evenly distributedincome levels. These reforms are
also helpingUkraine to find new markets for its exports, improve its energy security and reduce
Ukraine's reliance on traditional, low value-added industries.

     The externalposition. The current account surplus will gradually turn to a moderate deficit
by 2008. In2002, Ukraine's current account surplus reached a record-high 7.7% GDP, fueled in
large part by a real exchange rate depreciation' and low investment demand that improved trade
inthe resource balance and encouraged private transfers growth. Capital imports will help feed
U-shaped export growth as           " new s ectors" gain momentum. The current strong transfers from

'Small  oil price reductions typically help Ukraine by reducing oil import costs. However, a reduction large enough
to significantly affect Russian income, and therefore demand for Ukrainian exports, becomes relatively more
important - Russiapurchases roughly 11% o f Ukraine's GDP.
2 The real effective exchange rate depreciated in2002 due to (1) implicit targeting o f U A W U S D nominal exchange
rate through NBUpurchases o f Current account inflows, while U S dollar depreciated against other major currencies;
and (2) virtually unchanged consumer prices inUkraine.

abroad will continue, but at a decreasing rate as worker's remittances slow down and the retum
o f capital flight through the current account slows down. The service balance will also weaken
as Ukrainian business and tourists continue to demand more foreign services. Positive signals
from the IFIs, continued macro-growth, and a better business environment will encourage
foreign and domestic investors alike. FDI i s expected to follow an upward trend reaching a
US$1.3 billion inflow in 2008. Capital flight will continue to decline on a net basis. Coupled
with the current account surplus, this will allow NBUto continue to replenishforeign exchange
reserves at an average rate o f $1 billion a year, reaching nearly 4 months o f imports by 2008.

    Thefiscalposition. The public sector balance i s projected to retum to moderate deficits to
finance a gradually increasing share o f investments and pay for structural reforms, partially with
help o f World Bank project loans and the P A L Program. Budget revenues are expected to
diminish with the introduction o f lower tax rates, however, this reduction will be moderate since
the tax reform is also leading to base expansion, including through the elimination o f tax
exemptions. Over the medium term, revenues are expected to pick up gradually as more o f the
economy registers its activities.

    Money, inflation and the rate ofcurrency exchange. The NBUwill maintain a relatively
stable, slightly appreciating, real exchange rate in order not to weaken the price-competitiveness
of Ukrainian products. In2003-2004, the hryvnia nominal depreciationwill not exceed 1%.Later
on, the goal o f real exchange rate stability is expected to lead the NBU to support a 2-3%
nominal depreciation o f the hryvnia. Meanwhile, unsterilized purchases o f foreign reserves will
remain the major source o f money supply growth over the medium term. Over 2001-2002, rapid
monetary growth stemming from unsterilized foreign exchange purchases has been
accommodated by the dramatic increase in the money demand. However, the initial pace o f real
money demand annual growth o f 30-40% is likely to slow down owing to gradual satiation of
monetary transactions inthe economy and a slowdown o f new deposits into the banking system,
thus contributing to a change of the exchange rate trend to hryvnia nominal depreciation. Inthis
case, the NBUwill most likely tighten its monetary stance. However, the National Bank is still
lacking efficient instruments o f sterilization, as the domestic debt secondary market remains
weak-the     NBUholds four fifths ofthep~rtfolio.~

The NBUwill continue to focus on lowering real interest rates while strengtheningthe banking
system through better auditing and accounting practices. Consumer inflation might remain
volatile over the projected period. After virtually unchanged prices in 2002, CPI will pick up in
2003 to 8.5% (eop) due to bad weather in agriculture and increases in administratively regulated
service prices. After lower inflation o f 2004, growth o f consumer prices i s expected to accelerate
again in 2005 due to lagged effects o f fiscal stimuli in the run-up to the 2004 Presidential
elections and a faster rate o f the exchange rate depreciation. Afterwards, inflation will average
6.5%, although structural changes will continue to require the adjustment o f the relative prices.

    Growth of the banking sector and systemic risks. Ukraine's banking sector is relatively
small, but growing rapidly. Assets o f the banking sector grew from 22% o f GDP in2000 to 30%
o f GDP in 2002, aided by high real interest rates and conciliatory central bank policies. While
contributing significantly to economic growth, much o f the lending went to traditional industries


3 In2003, the secondary domestic debt market encountered a set-back with Ministry o f Finance setting negative rate
on the coupon bonds.

which grew over this period, but may not be able to generate growth over a longer term horizon.
Empirical evidence suggests that systemic banking problems have most often arisen in the
presence o f rapidly expanding banking sectors, due to a combination o f inexperienced managers,
weak accounting and reporting practices and the quality o f lending practices. An additional
problem in Ukraine i s that although banks are appear to be well capitalized, methods o f
calculating balance sheets need improvement while insider lending remains a problem. In light
o f systemic risk associated with the rapid increase o fbanking inUkraine, efforts are being put in
place to strengthen bankingregulations, and improve banking practices.

    External creditworthiness. Ukraine has improved its creditworthiness since the financial
crisis of the late 90's through a rebound o f economic activity, good monetary policy, responsible
fiscal management and debt restructuring. As o f July 2003, Ukraine's sovereign debt is rated in
the B range by the leading rating agen~ies.~            The Ministry o f Finance organized a series o f debt
restructuring agreements in 1999 and 2000 which significantly improved Ukraine's liquidity and
debt sustainability out10ok.~The fiscal policy implemented since 1999 has allowed the MoF to
keep domestic debt issuance at about the 1eve1 o f T -bill amortization. Along with c ontinued
economic growth, this has contributed to reduced debt and smoothed debt service ratios. In
1999, public and publicly guaranteed debt (PPG) topped 61 percent of GDP and external PPG
debt reached 50 percent o f GDP.                These figures have fallen to 33.4 and 24.6 percent,
respectively, through 2002. Meanwhile, inthe context of growing money demand, large current
account surpluses continue to provide foreign exchange through non-sterilizedpurchases without
depreciating the domestic currency. Reserves now cover over 3 months o f imports, compared to
3 weeks o f imports in 1999.               Further stabilization continues to come from the noted
diversification o f export markets, in particular to European and Asian markets. The rating
agencies note political uncertainty and the need to continue the process o f institutional and
structural reform as the keys to improving Ukraine's future creditworthiness.

Given the estimated 5 percent average real GDP growth, slow real appreciation o f the currency
with larger productivity improvements, a few more years o f current account surpluses and
continued fiscal restraint, the debt ratios are projected to decline to 19 and 12 percent of GDP
over the forecast period. With regard to the IFI's share o f the debt portfolio, preferred creditor
debt t o total debt is 7 3 percent. P referred debt service t o total debt s ervice is currently 4 3.8
percent and i s projected to be 62.7 percent in 2008. While this is above the guideline o f 35%,
this is because Ukraine's debt to GDP ratio is modest overall and as noted above, Ukraine has
recently concluded a comprehensive debt restructuring which has reduced debt service o f non-
preferred creditors substantially. Inthis context, IBRD debt service to Preferred Creditor debt
service i s currently 32.1 percent and i s projectedto be 46.1 percent in2008. Contingent liabilities
have also been reduced significantly and/or programmed into financial projections in recent
years through the recognition and restructuring o f energy sector debts to Russia, refusal to bear
the burden o f unguaranteed municipal debt (Le., Odessa bonds), recognition o f the debt service
requirements o f external guarantees issued inthe early 90's (which are called at a highrate), and
good progress on pension reform. Ukraine will face some US$0.9 billion o f external PPG annual
repayments over 2003-2008.              Taking advantage o f surplus in the current account, the


4 Fitchhas upgraded Ukraine's sovereign rating to B+, Moody's maintains B 2 and S&P B.
5 These steps include a purchase and restructuring o f T-bills by the NBU, a debt swap with Russia associated with
     the Black Sea Fleet, Eurobond restructuring, and a Pans Club agreement.

government i s expected to follow its declared principle o f decreasing the share o f external debt.
Thus, US$1 billion o f PPG disbursements o f are projected to be complemented by domestic
borrowing to cover moderate fiscal deficits. This in turn will provide the central bank with
instruments o f sterilization for the future.

    Financing Program. Ukraine's gross financing needs average roughly US$2.1 billion per
 year over the projection period as a result o f amortization o f credits, and the importance o f
 replenishing gross international reserves o f the central bank. These are expected to be
 counterbalanced by continued large current account inflows (primarily worker's remittances)
 and FDIinflows before exceptional financing.

Assessment: Substantial progress has been achieved under PAL-I1 to justify presentation o f the proposed
PAL-I1package for approval by the Board o f Executive Directors o f the World Bank. Though it has taken a
year longer than originally envisaged to achieve the substantial outcomes planned, this is understandable.
Institutional reform is technically intensive and often runs up against ingrained interests within the government
and society; while structural reform, if truly addressing key structural weaknesses, is politically difficult,
entailing significant short term costs, especially to vulnerable sectors o f the economy and the population. A s
discussed in the 2001-03 CAS, effort and time would b e the mitigating factors to overcome bottlenecks in
program implementation.
The design o f PAL-I allowed for adjustment o f the benchmarks in light o f real operational constraints that
would arise, or to refocus if new vulnerabilities became apparent. This is exactly what happened. Successful
efforts were made to obtain progress around roadblocks creating pressure to break through them (e.g.,
progress on banking sector regulation helped encourage the Auditor's Chamber o f Ukraine to adopt the
standards o f audit and ethics o f the International Federation o f Accountants as Ukraine's National standards;
this contributes to better accounting and auditing for all enterprises inUkraine, notjust for banks).
The outcomes already reached within the PAL-I1program, and to be reached by the time o f the second tranche,
are at least as substantial as those originally envisaged. Infact, in some cases indicative benchmarks for PAL-
I11 have been moved up to PAL-I1 (e.g., elimination o f tax exemptions, and implementation o f BCPs in
banking sector regulation, in light o f faster than expected growth in the banking sector), andor progress on
targets has been better than expected (e.g., cash collection for electricity and gas services, progress o n land title
issuance, etc.). In other cases, external problems arose (e.g., a weak market for power sector privatization)
andor larger structural problems than originally envisaged were encountered (e.g., tax performance o f energy
companies), which resulted in shortfalls relative to goals originally envisaged. In each o f these cases, serious
analytical, economic, political and institutional analyses were made at the operational level and appropriate
courses o f action were put into place.
For example, solving the problem o f tax arrears while moving ahead with power privatization demonstrates the
cross-cutting nature o f the P A L Program, which allows for adjustment as necessary to achieved desired
outcomes. The problem o f tax arrears could not be solved simply by decree, or increased efforts on the part o f
the State Tax Administration. It was recognized that fundamental/cross-cutting problems in the economy
require multi-dimensional and fundamental solutions. As such, a substantive short-term action plan for
financial discipline in the energy sector was put into place (which is, inter alia, designed to eliminate price
distortions and arrears inthe energy sector - a pre-requisite for energy sector debt resolution).    Electricity and
gas cash payment targets were set and superceded. Bankruptcy targets were strengthened and re-focused on
the largest tax debtors. Targeting o f social assistance was focused on payment in cash for fuel and liquefied
gas services, while occupational privileges for public sector workers were rationalized (which otherwise
represented an implicit tax o n communal service providers). The stoppage o f tax arrears was achieved. Inthe
mean time, a comprehensive long term plan for solvency o f all energy companies is being developed; this
focuses e specially o n the 1argest tax debtors inthe energy s ector (including Naftogaz and the coal s ector).
With stoppage o f arrears accumulation as a basis, a comprehensive debt restructuring plan is being
implementedthat will clear the way for completion o f the job o f power company privatization. Once the power
companies are privatized, the generation companies become much more attractive to good investors, and the
virtuous cycle can continue.
On balance, progress achieved under PAL-I and prior actions for the proposed PAL-I1 is assessed as
substantial.

                                       Poverty Update- 1999-2002


         The Government o f Ukraine has undertaken an ambitious program to monitor trends in
poverty and compile a poverty profile o f the population. Before 1999, the measurement o f
economic welfare was solely based on a basket o f goods thought to define a "subsistence
minimum." This indicator, however, was not a usehlmeasure of families inneed, as it suggested
that the majority o f the population lived insubstandard conditions.

         As part o f the development o fUkraine's anti-poverty strategy, another measure, equal to
75 percent o f median income adjusted for family composition, superseded the pre-transition
"minimum subsistence" concept. The old official "subsistence minimum" was maintained as a
goal with which to measure economic well-being sometime in the future. The new Ukrainian
poverty line constitutes an important step forward reflecting the interest o f Ukrainian policy
analysts to monitor and combat poverty. Like all poverty lines, however, the new official
Ukrainian poverty line has its limitations - in this case because it measures relative rather than
absolute poverty. But the definition selected i s consistent with international standards, and
relative poverty measures are commonly used in EU countries, particularly as in these countries
there are few real fears about reductions inwelfare over time.

         The World Bank currently uses a measure similar to the official Ukrainian poverty line,
also based on 75 percent o f median income scaled for family composition, but adjusted for price
inflation to measure changes inthe incidence o fpoverty abstracting from changes inineq~a1ity.l~
Another measure i s also used, equal to 60 percent o f median income in 1999, to determine who
are the poorest o f the poor. Analysis was conducted using the Ukrainian Household Budget
Survey (HBS) from 1999 to 2002 over several different time periods using several different
measures.14

         Poverty Trends. The poverty rate inUkraine responded positively to economic growth
duringthe first three-quarters o f2002, following several years inwhich strong growth hadno
visible impact on poverty reduction (Table l)?               Similar lags o fpoverty reduction inthe face o f
economic growth have occurred inother transition economies including Albania, Armenia, and
Poland. These patterns have raisedquestions about the mechanisms through which economic
growth influences living standards inthese situations.




13 World Bank measured poverty trends are consistent with those o f the Ukrainian analysts using the official
poverty line.
14 The HBS i s a nationally representative survey that was fielded first in 1999 based on modem survey principles.
Ukrainian officials also use this survey to measure poverty. The Bank is grateful to those officials for their openness
inproviding these data.
15 Data for the only the first few quarters o f 2002, but not the full year, were available when this annex was drafted.
Comparisons with 2002 are based on two or three quarters o f prior-year data to provide a consistent framework for
trend analysis.

         Several hypotheses have been offered for the lack o f an immediate correlation between
improvements in GDP and poverty, although no single one is completely satisfactory. For
example, urban residents gained more from economic recovery than rural residents. While
poverty rates declined overall, only the poverty rate in rural areas remains higher than it was in
1999. Rates in urban areas are well below those posted in 1999, with large cities showing the
greatest improvement. The poverty rate decreased significantly in Kyiv between 1999-2002,
while it increased in the countryside.            And, consumption is higher in Kyiv than any other
location. But Kyiv only has a little over five percent o f the population and cannot account for
the entire gain inGDP.16

         Poverty rates may have remained high in rural areas if farm managers captured all
productivity gains to the detriment o f the rest o f the workforce. The lack o f initial growth in
other industries with high labor/capital ratios may also have kept the poverty rate high. For
example, gains in the capital-intensive metallurgy sector accounted for one-quarter o f the
increase in industrial output during the first four months o f 2001. But sectors with a greater
potential for job creation were also growing, but at a slower pace (e.g. engineering, food-
processing, and light industry). And even though growth was centered in basic industries,
average wages increased across-the-board.


         Poverty may have lagged economic growth because o f increasing income inequality, with
consumption gains going to better-off families. The share o f expenditures for the lowest one-fifth
o f families declined by 10 percent from 1999-2001, while the share o f expenditures for the top
one-fifth  o f families increased by nearly four percent.I7 However, changes in the income
distribution cannot fully explain the lagging poverty rate, since income inequality continued to
grow in2002, when the poverty rate fell.

         Price increases could have distorted the measurement o f poverty. In some countries with
rapid inflation, such as Belarus, altemative price indices significantly alter trends inpoverty over
time. But changing the CPI to reflect the expenditure shares o f the poor for food consumption,


16 The HBS i s nationally representativebut not regionally representative. For that reason, cross tabulations by
  oblast and locality would not necessarily provide significant findings. Still it is possible that other cities may have
  had the same reduction inpoverty as Kyiv.
17 Ifincomes were distributed equally, each quintile would report exactly 20 percent o f expenditures.

non-food items, and services had no effect on the underlying trend in poverty between 1999-
2002 (Table 2). However, this alternative price indexation formula resulted in somewhat higher
poverty rates, as prices for expenditures made by the poor tended to increase more rapidly than
others."

         A better understanding o f a situation ofpositive economic growth and unreduced poverty
would likely require a thorough analysis o f the underlying data used in the national income
accounts and the HBS.I9One potential avenue for investigation could be related to the informal
economy. It i s generally perceived, but not well documented, that wages are paid both officially
and "in the envelope." If there were a shift towards formalization o f the economy, `official'
wages, measured in the national income accounts, could be rising, but at the expense o f
`envelope' wages. This could explain why national income accounts report rising wages and
survey data show flat consumption. The shadow economy in Ukraine is large, with some
estimates o f over 40 percent o f GDP. Thus formalization o f the economy and changes in
reporting practices could realistically influence disparate trends in poverty and growth.
Unfortunately measurement problems remain considerable so that it will be difficult to solve the
puzzle. Ongoing work in this area includes poverty analysis within the Country Economic
Memorandum and a full Poverty Assessment beginningin2004.

         Basic Measures.        Three traditional measures can be used to document changes in well-
being: (i) headcount poverty rate, (ii) poverty gap, and (iii) severity index. These
              the                                    the                            the
measures are all consistent with the basic downward trend in2002 (Table 3). Duringthe first two
quarters o f 2002, the headcount poverty rate edged off, after having increased slightly in
2001Q2. The depth of poverty, or the poverty gap also declined in2002Q2, after peaking a year


18 A third price index was proposed which was also based o n aggregate consumption groups, but this proposal
could not be implemented for 2002 as expenditures categories inthe HBShad been revamped. A pattern o f rising
poverty rates over the 1999-2001 period remained the same, however.
19 It has o ftenbeen observed that, administrative data and survey data are n o t necessarily c onsistent over short
periods o f time and the inconsistency cannot be satisfactorily explained. One example i s in the periodic differences

earlier. The severity index followed a similar pattern. The Gini coefficient did not fall in
2002Q2, however, indicating that inequality has beengrowing. Nonetheless, a Gini coefficient in
the 0.30-0.35-percent range reflects only moderate inequality. By contrast, the Gini coefficient
reached 0.44 inRussia, and 0.36 inMoldova.

                    * The headcount index equals the share of the poor in the population (or, in other
                   instances, in a particular group). The depth index (poverty gap) shows how far poor
                   individuals are from the poverty line. More precisely, the poverty gap index equals per
                   capita resources needed to bring all poor individuals to the poverty1ine (calculated as
                   percentage of the poverty line). Poverty severity takes into accountnot only the distance
                   of the poor from the poverty line,but also the inequality amongthe poor -this is done by
                   placinghigher weights on poorer individuals. The Gini coefficient indicates the degree to
                   which consumptionis skewed towards more affluent households.


        A second set o f measures, based on the extreme poverty line (equal to 60 percent o f
median equivalent adult expenditures) follows the same pattern as the basic poverty rate,
declining slightly in the 2002Q2 to 13.8 percent, compared to a peak o f 14.8 percent in first two
quarters o f 2001Q2 (Table 4).

         Certain groups are more likely to have a higher incidence o f poverty than others.
Vulnerable populations include children, the elderly, persons with disabilities, and single parents.
While these perceptions all have some credence, often these groups represent a relatively small
percentage o fthe total population that i s poor.


         Interms o f gender alone, there is little difference inpoverty among the population with
both men and women having similar poverty rates and a nearly equal share o f the poverty
population. Child dependency, on the other hand, does make a significant difference in the
likelihood o f poverty. Among persons living inhouseholds inwhich children make up over half
of the family, registeredpoverty rates are over 50 percent in2001. Yet, this population makes up
only 7.6 percent o f all poor households. By contrast, persons living in households with no
children have very low poverty rates o f less than 24 percent. But these individuals make up 30
percent o fthe poverty population.


        Family size is frequently recognized as an indicator o f poverty. The poverty rate for
persons inhouseholds with five members i s 40 percent. Persons inhouseholds with eight or more
members face a 70 percent rate o f poverty. But the facts are that over 70 percent o f the poor
population lives in smaller households - that i s with four or fewer individuals. In fact, such
households account for 80 percent o f all individuals inUkraine.


        Higher education has been identified as one o f the means to avoid poverty. And indeed
the poverty rate for college graduates is only 13 percent. Poverty rates for those who have not
gone beyond elementary school, by contrast, are nearly 45 percent. But these individuals are
likely to be very much older as educational attainment is generally higher among the middle to
lower age cohorts o f the population. Ifmany o f those with low education are persons with low
pensions, the situation can be remediedwith social assistance and will likely disappear over time.
But still, persons with low education make up only 14percent o fthe poverty population. Persons
with secondary school education (i.e. secondary school, high school, technical school, and trade
school) face poverty rates not much over the average but make up 7 0 percent o f the poverty
population.

        Poverty rates vary considerably by the socioeconomic status o f the individual - that i s his
or her primary activity as self reported (Table 6). The highest poverty rates reported are for the
unemployed - often a category ignored, as it i s not a traditional vulnerable grouping. Further, it
is often thought that the unemployed are actually working in the informal sector. But with
poverty rates o f 46 percent, the need for assistance appears substantial. In fact, this is one group
for which there has been a significant rise in poverty. Clearly, a reduction in unemployment
would constitute a significant measure to reduce the poverty rate. By contrast, business owners,
the self- employed, and employees have lower than average poverty rates. Nonetheless,
employees make up 31 percent o f the poverty population, as compared to the unemployed who
account for some 17 percent. Further, while pensioners face poverty at rates not far above other
groups, they account for nearly 36 percent o f the poverty population. Social pensioners, only a
small proportion o f that group, have a 41percent poverty rate.


        Insummary, certain groups can be identified inwhich the incidence ofpoverty is much
higher than the 30 percent average for the country as a whole. These groups include families
with many children, the unemployed, large households, and the less educated. But alleviating
poverty inthese groups would not reach a majority o f the population who are poor but cannot be
identified by easily observable characteristics. For these hard to identify groups, and indeed all
groups o f the population, growth will contribute to reduced poverty in the longer run as wages
improve and unemployment and underemployment declines.

                   ClearingDebt Obligationsto andfrom the Budget


      Debts to the budget: Debt obligations to the budget, including the on-lending portfolio and
called guarantees, have been assessed and a strategy to clear them i s under implementation. The
strategy includes verification o f each o f the budget's claims and determination o f a settlement
procedure. Special attention i s being given to agricultural sector debts derived from state loan
guarantees for imported equipment (US EXIM Bank debt). In this case, the plan envisages for
the debts to be auctioned to commercial banks, leasing companies and/or other qualified buyers.
The debt purchasers would then set about collecting and restructuring them through private
sector means. This is intended to reduce moral hazard in the sector (and provide at least some
comfort to the roughly 12 percent o f borrowers that paid their debts in full), while helping
solvent farms obtain access to equipment which in the past had been captured by non-paying
recipients o f these programs. Since the auction of state debts to private companies i s currently
not part of Ukraine's legislation, the Government is preparing such legislation, with a view to
completing the process by PAL III.20

      Debts from the budget: The Government program also includes a cleaning o f the debts

banks, and also to help clarify commercial bank's balance sheets for the bank regulator - the
from the budget t o the banking s ector ina n e ffort t o c lear past debts, strengthen c ommercial

NBU.This process is well under way. The NBUhas publisheda request for all banks holding
mature, non-securitized government debts to present their claims. A legal team inthe Ministry o f
Finance i s confirming the validity o f each claim, and a plan i s being drawn up to settle the debts
through government marketable securities. This includes a concrete timetable to handle overdue
andrestructured debt on the books ofthe statebanks (Le., State Savings Bank and EXIMBank).

                         ProgressinUkraine's Bidfor WTO Accession


        Greater integration into the world economy is an important element o f the Government's
strategy for encouraging growth and poverty reduction. Membership in the WTO reinforces
policy reforms that facilitate greater trade and investment. In 2000, after a two-year hiatus,
Ukraine resumed its campaign to join the WTO and embarked on an ambitious schedule o f
diplomatic negotiations and domestic regulatory reforms. To date it has concluded bilateral
protocols on market access with 14memberso fthe WTO Working Party, presented an ambitious
offer o f commitments in services trade liberalization, and introduced laws on intellectual
property rights protection and trade-related areas o f other domestic regulations. The Government
has committed to signing additional bilateral protocols on market access and intends to complete
these negotiations with 18 remaining WTO Working Party members in the near future.21These
protocols should help to lock in liberalization o f border barriers, maintain the political
momentum needed to reform trade-related domestic regulations, and facilitate engagement with
other countries on economic issues.

        Ukraine i s taking steps in the context o f PAL I1to harmonize its standards regime with
international standards by establishing a n independent accreditation agency, and adopting EU
rules goveming conformity assessment. Technical standards for industrial products can serve
many roles, from helping protect consumers and the environment to facilitating investment in
advanced technology industries and those requiring close coordination between suppliers and
producers. A market-oriented standards regime-where                       product standards are developed,
maintained and enforced in the private sector-works                   best to avoid their use as tools for
protectionism or rent-seeking. By the time o f PAL 111, the Government plans to advance the
transparency and market orientation o f its standards regime by increasing the Government's
capacity to disseminate information about technical regulations, reducing the number o f products
that require mandatory certification, and by reducing state control over the provision o f
conformity assessment services.

        Ukraine has eliminated the use o f minimum values in line with the W T O Customs
Valuation Agreement. The task now i s to streamline customs administration. Burdensome
customs procedures implicitly act as an import tariff, reducing the flow o f imports and raising
domestic prices. Unlike an explicit tax, however, they are not transparent and they increase
opportunities for corruption and rent-seeking. By the time o f PAL 111, the Government's
Program calls for improvements in custom's border practices which will lead to a substantial
reduction o f clearance time for importers and exporters.




  21 Ina July 2003 speech, Minister o fEconomy Valeriy Khoroshkovsky stated that Ukraine was negotiating
  protocols with Austria, Argentina, Bulgaria, Brazil, Ecuador, Estonia, Israel, Kyrgyzstan, Cuba, Lithuania,
  Moldova, Norway, Panama, Poland, Thailand, Turkey, Japan, Switzerland, and the United States. The
  Government signed a protocol with Bulgaria a few weeks later.

        The Government will pass laws on copyright and related rights, and draft remaining laws
necessary to implement protections in the TRIPS Agreement. Protecting intellectual property
rights (IPR) creates an important incentive for investment in industries that rely on new
knowledge and creativity, particularly when intellectual property rights laws are complemented
by other institutions such as venture capital markets and networks connecting inventors with
entrepreneurs.

        Integrating Ukraine into the world economy benefits the economy as a whole, but any
liberalization o f trade barriers creates both winners and losers. This makes it all the more
important that policies promoting liberalization are developed with input from producers and
consumers, importers and exporters, and that they are implemented in a transparent manner. In
line with its goal of joining the WTO, the Government has developed a public education
campaign to engage stakeholders inthe private sector and civil society.

                                                                                           Annex 6



                     Social and OccupationalPrivilegesinUkraine


        Current legislation in Ukraine envisages exemptions and privileges for people o f
particular social status or occupations. These privileges include free or reduced prices on public
transport, sanatoridresort holidays, housing and communal service privileges, purchases o f fuel
and other benefits. A Government report on special privileges indicates that over 21 million
people (roughly 43 percent o f the population) are eligible for some type o f privilege, and if fully
funded, the total cost to the budget would be 8 to 9 percent o f GDP. Most o f these privileges
were issued through un-fundedlegal mandates approved by populous parliaments in the years
following independence. Once established, benefits are politically difficult to remove, so in the
past, Ukrainian governments have ignored some o f the entitlements (e.g., eligibility for free cars
by disabled people), funded some o f them through the budget (e.g. some Chernobyl benefits),
and let the rest become an implicit tax on service providers (e.g., communal services and
transport). This has reduced the credibility o f the State, resulted in poor povertyheed-based
targeting o f social transfers, worsened the financial balance o f state-owned and private
enterprises, and in turn negatively impacted the selection, quality and sustainability o f service
provision inUkraine.

        Attempts to prepare the public for this transition have repeatedlyruninto strong political
opposition. Therefore, in 2000, the Government opted for an "immediate non-permanent                -
gradual permanent" approach inwhich a n article w as included inthe budget 1aws effectively
freezing the entitlements o f many categories o f recipients. The practice was also followed in
2001, leading to a 40 percent reduction in privilege recipients during these two years and a
reduction o f budget commitments (explicit and implicit) o f roughly UAH 17 billion. However, in
the lead-up to the 2002 parliamentary elections, the then parliament excluded such an article in
Budget 2002. Thus, effectively, reversing a PAL Iachievement and underscoring the need for
further steps toward apermanent solution.

                 Letterfrom the Ukrainian Government to the WorldBank
                                   on Policy Development

                                  Dear Mr.Wolfensohn,

The Cabinet o f Ministers o f Ukraine appreciates the opportunity to collaborate with the
World Bank. We would be grateful if the Bank would provide support for our strategy o f
economic reforms which i s coherent with the vision o f the President o f Ukraine on mid-
term development o f the country. We believe that support o f this strategy by the World
Bank is the driving force behind the recently observed acceleration o f economic
transformation processes inUkraine. Therefore, we seek your support and cooperation to
continue our partnership within the framework o f the second Programmatic Adjustment
Loan (PAL 11).

The first Programmatic Adjustment Loan (PAL I) a strong impact on the growth of
                                                      had
the Ukrainian economy and reduction o f poverty with substantial progress in the
following areas: 1) elimination o f pension and wage arrears in the public sector, 2)
improved business environment, 3) initiation o f the large-scale land reform and adoption
o f the Land Code and complementary legislation, 4) budget reform - increased
transparency o f the budget process and adoption o f the Budget Code, 5) increased
transparency in privatization o f large industrial enterprises, including Oblenergos, 6)
approval o f the new methodology for targeted social assistance.

We realize the necessity o f further reform consolidation with a focus on financial
discipline in the public sector, further improvement o f business environment and the
environment for foreign investments, secure conditions for the membership in WTO,
enforcement o f property rights in agriculture, poverty alleviation and introduction o f
more efficient social assistance along with further increase in privatization and budget
process transparency.

This letter presents the platform o f the Cabinet o f Ministers o f Ukraine on the future
institutional and structural reforms for the period o f the second Programmatic Adjustment
Loan. The contents o f this letter (for the period o f PAL 11) are consistent with the more
general reform strategy described in the Program o f Action o f the Cabinet o f Ministers o f
Ukraine, which outlines the priorities and major directions o f Ukraine's economic policy,
both internal and foreign, for 2002 - 2004. The long-term goals pursued by the
government are as follows:
    0   development o fhuman capital;
    0   development o f middle class, improvement in the living standards, reduction o f
        poverty;
    0   administrative reform, increased transparency in the public sector, its efficiency
        and accountability;

    0   consolidation o f the private ownership institution and development o f
        entrepreneurship and competition;
    0   protection o f humanrights and freedoms, security o f the person, society and state;
        strengthening country's defense capacity;
    0   Ukraine's integration into the global economic system, including through
        accession to the European Union and WTO.

To move forward inthe direction o f these goals the govemment i s determined to continue
consultations with the civil society, increasing its participation in public sector decision
making and evaluation o f public actions. These efforts will augment economic freedoms
and continue the liberalization o f t he Ukrainian economy and provide more economic
freedom to the regions.

Representatives o f the Cabinet o f Ministers o f Ukraine and o f the World Bank have
worked together to elaborate PAL I1activities corresponding to the priorities and tasks o f
the Cabinet o f Ministers for 2002-2004. The benchmarks indicating the expected progress
in implementation of the PAL I1 activities are briefly described in the Matrix of
Institutional and Policy Outcomes (enclosed). The suggested benchmarks make it
possible to assess the results o freform implementationand are grouped into five sections,
corresponding to the most important directions o f ongoing and planned institutional
transformations. These directions embrace financial discipline, regulatory framework,
property rights, public sector efficiency and accountability, and management o f social
and environmental risks. The Matrix also includes indicative benchmarks for P A L 111.
These benchmarks would be revised and updated as appropriate in accordance with the
execution o f PAL I1and continued development o f economy.

Implementation o f the Program o f Action requires financial assistance to secure
macroeconomic stability, primarily balanced budget, while carrying out reforms. This
financial assistance can be provided within the framework o f Programmatic Adjustment
Loan Program. Besides, to successfully implement its Program o f Action the Cabinet o f
Ministers o f Ukraine needs 1) technical assistance to carry out functional diagnostics o f
the core ministries, 2) timely technical assistance and analytical support, help with the
institutional capacity building and personnel training, and 3) advice on coordination o f
policies implementedby ministries and agencies. The Cabinet o f Ministers o f Ukraine i s
ready to contribute to the process and to provide all relevant resources we have available.
We hope for the support o f the World Bank through permanent consultations,
coordination of donors' technical assistance efforts and aid in building out institutional
capacity o f the government.

    1. REFORMSOFTHE PUBLICSECTORAND BUILDINGCONSENSUSFORREFORMS

To get the quick positive results o f the planned reforms the Government o f Ukraine
deems necessary, (a) to deepen involvement o f civil society into public decision making,
(b) to establish efficient cooperation with the Verkhovna Rada and secure its support of
the planned reforms, (c) to adjust the functions and structure o f the public administration
to the new role o f the government inthe market economy and (d) to balance the authority

o f the central and local governments. These changes will improve accountability in the
public sector and develop government capacity to formulate and implement reforms. To
increase effectiveness o f Ukraine's investment projects supported by international
financial organizations, the government plans to establish a specially authorized state
body, independent from the process o f implementing the projects, to exercise an
oversight hnction.

1.1DIALOG    WITH THE SOCIETY

The Cabinet of Ministers o f Ukraine (CoM) will further involve civil society in the
preparation and implementation o f government decisions envisaged by the C o M Program
of Action. W e acknowledge the growing need to strengthen participation o f civil society
inthe preparation, approval, andassessmentofpolicydecisions.

Future cooperation with the non-government organizations will focus on forecasting and
assessment o f the local budgets, monitoring changes inbusiness environment, evaluation
o f provisioning o f social assistance and other social services, monitoring govemment
effectiveness (e.g., intax administration and enforcement o f customs formalities).

Since February 2002 the Ministry o f Economy together with other governmental bodies
are implementing the "Dialog for Reforms" project financed through a grant o f the World
Bank. The key objective o f the project is to enhance institutional capacity o f the
Government o f Ukraine to communicate to the society. For this purpose the following
activities will be undertaken:
     0  Educate civil servants andNGO representatives inpolicy consultation;
     0  Develop standards and procedures for public hearings and other PR events to be
        usedby government agencies;
     0  Train civil servants on the fundamentals o f communication policy; and
     0  Develop recommendations         and introduce regulatory changes to secure
        participation o fthe society inthe decision making.

We deem important also to engage all project participants inthe discussion, development
and implementation o f steps aimed at poverty reduction. Major donors have expressed
interest incooperating and supporting government initiatives.

The government highly appreciates the above mentioned initiatives and has already
approved several pilot projects. These pilot projects will be implemented in Lviv,
Chernihiv and Donetsk regions and the respective project agenda have already been
discussed with the representatives o f local authorities.

The project measures to be implemented inthe nearest future are as follows.

     1. Continue implementation of the educational program on the budget issues. This
        will be implemented by the Ministry o f Finance through television programs.
        There will be 25 issues o f daily 15-minute films explaining different aspects o f
        budget preparation, structure, and execution; public hearings on draft Law o f

         Ukraine "On State Budget for 2004" will be held. TV specials have been aired on
         the 2004 budgetprocess.
     2. Conduct discussions o f most acute issues in the sphere o f poverty reduction with
         representatives o f local authorities, the non-government sector and journalists in
         oblasts. The project targets several aspects o f the Strategy for poverty reduction
         like pension reform, social exemptions, and corporate management reform, etc.
     3. Continue advisory and methodological assistance o f the "Dialog for Reforms"
         project consultants to the staff o f the Ministry o f Labor and Social Policy o f
         Ukraine in conducting studies and developing a communication strategy o f
         pension reform.
     4. Development o f a legal environment for NGOs. Work in this area will include
         investigation and improvement o f the current legislation that regulates the NGOs
         activity, and provision o f opportunity to these organizations to participate in
         development o f decision-making by government agencies.
     5. Institutional development o f structures responsible for elaboration o f policies o f
         civil society involvement. It i s planned to carry out analytical and consulting
         work, elaboration o f procedures, standards and mechanisms for involving civil
         society inthe policy-making process.


1.2. COOPERATIONWITHTHE VERKHOVNA RADA

The Verkhovna Rada o f the previous convocation adopted the Land Code, Civil Code,
and Budget Code. The Cabinet o f Ministers o f Ukraine i s determined to establish
productive dialogue with the Verkhovna Rada to (a) secure political support for the
government mid-term program and (b) establish joint responsibility o f legislative and
executive power for reform implementation. One o f the consistent legislative steps should
be adoption by the Verkhovna Rada o f the number o f tax laws protecting balance o f
interests o f the state, entrepreneurs and citizenry.

The Cabinet of Ministers o f Ukraine and Verkhovna Rada o f Ukraine proved to be
efficient in adopting important legislation pertaining to further development o f market
institutions, tax reform, strengthening o f the financial system, pension reform and other
areas. Among the legal acts adopted recently are the following: laws on corporate income
tax and personal income tax, mortgage law, law on mandatory pension insurance and law
on non-state pension funds.

Important laws pertaining to further improvement o fbusiness environment inUkraine are
to be considered by Verkhovna Rada o f Ukraine inthe nearest future. These are the draft
laws on joint stock companies, on telecommunications, revised version o f the law on
securities and stock market, and law on secured transactions with moveable assets, which
has already been submitted for consideration to the Verkhovna Rada. Many other
initiatives are also being considered bythe Verkhovna Rada o f Ukraine.

To fully implement these tasks we plan to do the following.
     0   Improve the coordinating mechanisms which allow to agree views o f the
         government and factions (groups) o f the Verkhovna Rada o fUkraine.

    0   Organize inter-agency groups to prepare draft laws and submit them for the
        perusal o f the Verkhovna Rada o f Ukraine. The groups should consist o f
        Verkhovna Rada members, representatives o f the central and local executive
        power bodies, representatives o f the President's Administration and o f the
        Secretariat o fthe Verkhovna Rada o fUkraine.
        Carry out regular meetings o f the government with Verkhovna Rada factions to
        jointly review and discuss the existing problematic issues.
    0   Envisage preparation o f concepts o f draft laws before submitting them to the
        Verkhovna Rada o f Ukraine for consideration inorder to ensure parliamentarians'
        clear understanding o f the essence and structure o f proposed laws. We view this
        as an efficient means o f promoting draft laws at the Verkhovna Rada o f Ukraine,
        as exemplified by preparation o f detailed concept documents for the draft law on
        debt restructuring (in energy) and by the work ongoing to prepare a White Paper
        on Intemal Financial C ontrol w hichw ould form the underpinning for the draft
        laws onbudget and financial control.

1.3. INCREASINGGOVERNMENT CAPACITY

The Cabinet o f Ministers will continue work on the second stage o f administrative reform
in Ukraine so as to assure a more balanced distribution o f powers among government
bodies that results in effective economic decisions and increased accountability o f the
public sector. In particular, our efforts will be concentrated on introducing strategic
planning inthe work o f public bodies. We will persist in search for optimal distribution
of mandates between c entral and 1oca1authorities. S uch development o f the executive
power system will be based on the principles o f openness o f government policies and
transparency o f procedures for making political decisions.

Over the past few years significant positive changes have taken place in the sphere o f
public administration and civil service reform. The authority, functions and structure o f
the Secretariat o f the Cabinet o f Ministers were revised, and the main focus o f its work
was reoriented towards analytical and coordinating activities. New standards have been
introduced for developing and adoption o f policy decisions. The provisional rules and
procedure o f the Cabinet o f Ministers o f Ukraine were approved and implemented,which
helped to better organize work on preparing draft regulatory documents and improving
their quality.

The government i s carrying out work on delegating powers to the lower-level
governments. Specifically, during 2002 and at the beginning o f 2003, powers were
delegated to the central and local bodies o f executive power conceming introduction o f
tariffs for certain kinds o f work (handling o f loads, electric communication services,
thermal energy production, etc), regulations, management o f state corporate rights,
carrying out certification work, and inother areas.

General methodological recommendations were prepared and approved for conducting
annual evaluation of civil servants performance. The general procedure for conducting
open competitive selection o f candidates was improved by developing and approving

general procedures for conducting exams for entry into vacant positions. It should be
noted that the planned measures provide for an increase in expenditures for training o f
civil servants.

To solidify and foster the afore-described positive changes the government will do the
following.
     0    Continue to develop the legal framework. Inparticular, it will promote adoption
     o f the Law "On the Cabinet o f Ministers o f Ukraine" and preparation o f the required
     complementary regulations.
     0    Implement the tasks defined inthe Strategy o f Civil Service Reform inUkraine.
     This strategy provides for (a) appointment t o positions o n a competitive basis by
     conducting exams and advancement to higher positions on the basis o f annual
     assessment o f civil servants' activity; (b) introducing a monitoring system for
     persons who were dismissed from the positions o f category 1-11civil servants and
     can be involved in the future in performing the state functions; and (c) increasing
     expenditures for training and introducing o f standards o f civil servants training.
     0    Improve regulatory framework for further development o f local self-government
     bodies; determine a list o f the administrative services to be provided by the local
     executive power bodies andbodies o f local self-govemance.
     0   Improve the functional diagnostics and assessment o f the efficiency o f work o f
     the core ministries and departments (agencies) with participation o f independent
     (Ukrainian and foreign) experts.
     0    Create an adequate system for assessing the public administration activity aimed
     at improving the distribution o f resources and improving the quality o f the public
     sector services to be provided to citizens.

1.4. NEW   CONDITIONS FORREGIONAL DEVELOPMENT

The major objective o f the state regional policy i s to build conditions for balanced
development o f Ukraine's regions, improved living standards and guaranteed social
standards for each Ukrainian citizen regardless o f the region o fhidher residence.

Regional policy rests on the principle o f balanced fiscal policy, which includes the
following:
     0  Distinction o fmandates o f central and local authorities (inparticular, those related
     to distribution o f budget resources) and defining their functions and structure
     accordingto the distribution o f mandates.
     0  Introduction o f unified standards for services provided by the state authorities as
     well as procedures for quality control.
      0 Clear definition o f inter-budgetary relations, including distribution o f revenues
      among the central and local budgets.
     0  Development o f system o f investments grants provision from the state budget to
     local budgets form implementation o fprojects related to state infrastructure.

Reforms o f central and local executive power bodies and corresponding distribution o f
mandates between them will be carried out according to the objectives o f administrative,

tax and budget reforms. As mandates o f the local bodies are expanding, we will also
revise functions and structure o f the central and local executive power bodies to avoid
overlapping.

Reform o f inter-budgetary relations will be further refined to reflect the provisions o f the
Budget Code, which clearly defines mandates o f the central and local budgets. The
government has elaborated a model o f developing local budgets on a formula basis that
was approved by the Resolution o f the Cabinet o f Ministers o f Ukraine in 2001.
Currently the working group consisting o f representatives o f the Ministry o f Finance and
of local fiscal bodies works to further refine the Budget Code and the current formula
determining inter-budgetary fiscal transfers.

The introduced systemo f transfers from the state budget to local budgets guarantees their
financial stability. In view o f this fact, the share o f transfers in the 2003 budget i s
maintained at the 2002 level (in 2003 this share exceeds 40%), taking into account
changes inthe revenue structure and inthe allocation o fmandates o f the local budgets.

Formula-basedtransfers for 2 003 assume an adjustment mechanism t o provide further
incentives to local budgets to increase their own revenues.

It is also planned to introduce a mechanism o f competitive-based allocation o f the public
investment resources throughout the regions as well as procedure o f budget equalization
for budgets o f oblast centers, rayon centers and small towns to provide state guaranteed
minimum social standards. The 2003 state budget provides for subvention to local
budgetsto implementinvestment projects inthe amount o f225 million hryvnias.

To regulate distribution o f the investment grants, the Ministryo f Economy and European
Integration jointly with the Ministry o f Finance developed a draft law on major rules o f
providing budget subventions from the state budget for implementation o f the investment
projects. Currently, this draft law i s being considered by the Verkhovna Rada o f Ukraine.
Distribution o f grants among regional investmentprojects will be based on the following
criteria: (a) readiness o f implementing agencies to absorb investment; (b) availability o f
the budget resources in the region in question; and (c) cost-benefit analysis and analysis
o f project c ost effectiveness. The 1aw will define the responsibility o f t he govemment
officials making decisions on subventions for investment projects. For investment
projects lasting several years the continuity approach will be applied. That is, investment
projects having duration o f several years and approved for funding should receive budget
subvention for the whole term o f its duration. Distribution o f investment project
subventions should be exclusively formula-based.

2. POVERTY, SOCIAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL PROBLEMS

The government believes that social problems, in particular alleviating poverty, ought to
receive the primary attention o f the state. We consider improved living standards o f the
poorest to be the best measure o f reform success. The government has already taken
measures to solve the problem o f budget arrears. All pensions and wages are being paid

on time. The government has started implementing pension and social protection reforms
by making efforts to better target social assistance, as well as to design and implement
reform o f the education and healthcare systems.

We will continue the efforts to mitigate social and environmental risks through (a)
improved efficiency in the use o f budget resources; (b) mobilization o f the additional
funds from private sources, and (c) reduction in costs o f public services by involving
NGOs and private businesses as service providers.

Ukrainian government, with the assistance o f the World Bank, prepared the Strategy o f
Poverty Reduction, which i s based on prior empirical research and includes the
following:
    e           improved targeting o f the social assistance to cover the most vulnerable
         groups o f population;
    e          reforms o f pension, social security system, healthcare and education
         systems;
    e           creation o f new workplaces and fostering o f the productive employment to
         raise the real income o f the poorest.

During the implementation o f PAL I1and PAL I11activities, the government will be
fulfilling tasks o fthe above-described Strategy o fPoverty Reduction.

2.1. SOCIALPROTECTIONOF THEPOOREST

The Cabinet o f Minister o f Ukraine will primarily help those, who are incapable o f
supporting themselves at least at the subsistence level (inparticular, the disabled, elderly
people, and homeless children). Completion o f this task requires quick and effective
actions. Given the shortage o f the state resources, our short-term activities will primarily
focus on improvingtargeting o f the social assistance and unitingsocial programs into the
single system.

The government expects to introduce a unified system o f targeted social assistance by the
end o f Programmatic Adjustment Loan. The system o f social care will be also gradually
transferred to the system o f social orders to allow for the diversification o f social care
services through contracts with NGOs and private sector. It is also planned to test
innovative mechanisms o f providing social care, in particular within the framework o f
Social Investment Fundinitiatedwith participation o f the World Bank.

The government has already developed a strategy aimed at replacing the current system
o f social privileges with targeted social assistance. This strategy will be implemented
gradually by creating a register o fpersons receiving privileges, establishing economically
substantiated norms o f consumption o f services, followed by introduction o f relevant
amendments to the legislation inthis sphere.

The government has already introduced mechanisms to provide the population with cash
subsidies to buy fuels and liquefied gas. During the P A L I1 period, the following
activities o f the targeted social assistance strategy are to be executed:
       0 development o f software supporting individualized accounting o f individuals
       entitled to privileges;
       0 creation o f an inventory o f individuals entitled to privileges according to the
       types o f privileges that they receive (a single register o f recipients o fprivileges and
       targeted social assistance will be created as part o f this process);
       0 calculation o f the norms for consumption o f the services to be subsidized by the
       state (like utility services, providing fuel to households, etc.);
       0 calculation of the norms for consumption o f the services for which the state will
       provide targeted social assistance to the low-income families (like utility services,
       communication and transport services, etc.) inlieu o fprivileges.

By PAL111, the Cabinet o f Ministers will initiate pilot projects probing mechanisms
allowing to replace the existing privileges on communication, city transport services and
those on purchase o f drugs by the targeted social assistance. Based on the outcomes o f
pilot projects, mechanisms will be developed to replace the named privileges by the
targeted cash assistance.

2.2. PENSIONREFORM

The Cabinet o f Ministers o f Ukraine has already solved the most urgent pensionproblem;
pension arrears were eliminated in September 2000. Since then, the government
continues to settle accounts with pensioners on time. A system o f personified record-
keeping and pension assignment was introduced. The pension awarding and payment
functions were assigned to the PensionFundof Ukraine.

However, the average real pension size i s still below the subsistence level because of
significant gap between revenues o f the Pension Fund and amount o f funds necessary to
maintain pensions at least at the subsistence level. Key reasons for this gap include the
existence o f a large number of pensioners relative to the number o f those who make
contributions to the Pension Fund, and the large share o f vocational pension incentives
and preferences related to the payment of mandatory state pension insurance
contributions. This exerts a negative influence on the revenues part o f the Pension fund.

To eliminate these problems it i s necessary to reform the current PAYGpension system
(towards relieving it from "non-intrinsic" payments and creating a mechanism whereby a
pension size will be determined by the amount o f the paid contributions and the insurance
period during which said contributions were paid). The PAYG system needs to be
complemented it with a second pillar mandatory funded pension system and a voluntary
private pension system. A first step inthat direction has been made with passing two core
pension laws (Law on Mandatory State Pension Insurance and Law on Voluntary Non-
State Pension Funds) by Verkhovna Rada in July 2003. During the second and third
PALS,the government will focus on implementing the reforms o f the PAYG pension
system and creating voluntary non-state system o f pension accumulations as stipulated in

the legislation.   The non-state pension system would be introduced in parallel with
reforming the PAYG system in order to complement the latter and establish a new
savings mechanism. Furthermore, introduction o f the non-state pension funds will allow
to transfer privileged pensions partially to the non-state system. The introduction o f the
second pillar o f the system appears rather complicated under conditions o fweak financial
infrastructure and insufficiently developed capital markets. It is thus regarded as the task
o f a longer-term perspective.

The Government o f Ukraine deems the following tasks o f the PAYG pension system
reform as those that merit support:
        0  introducing the procedure for calculating pensions according to the actual labor
       contribution and insurance period o f an individual, using the personified records
        system;
        0  introducing economic stimulation for retiring at an older age; and
        0  carrying out large-scale information-and-explanatory work            among the
       population concerning the mainprovisions o fpensionreform.

Creation o f efficient infrastructure o f the pension system will promote introduction o f a
second pillar on the basis o f individual pension accounts. This envisages creating o f
institutional components o f the functioning o f the pension insurance fully funded system,
including the following.
        0  Full introduction o f the personification system and creating o f automated
       reporting system concerning the status o f accumulatingpension accounts o f insured
       persons, taking into account the status o fpension assets;
       0   Developing the administrative systemto support the Accumulation Fund;
       0   Adoption of legislative acts required for functioning o f the pension insurance
       fully fundedsystem; and
        0  Holding tenders and concluding agreements with the assets management
       company, custodian and auditor o f the Accumulation Fund, etc.

The date o f second pillar system introduction depends on the progress in the reforms o f
PAYG system and achievement o f (a) financial balance o fthe PAYGtier; (b) sustainable
economic growth and solid financial position; (c) establishing o f effective institutions and
developing o f required regulatory framework for managing and supervising the
operations o f the second tier accumulation system; (d) development o f financial sector
and stable capital markets; and (e) gaining experience inthe process o f functioning o f the
non-state pension provision system. In addition to a systemic pension reform, the
Government intends to engage in a thorough reform o f the pension and broader social
insurance administration system. The first step in this reform, supported by PAL 111, will
be unification o f control over collection o f social insurance contributions, followed by
extending the unification effort to processes o f collection and reporting on social
insurance contributions.

2.3. HEALTHCAFE

Inadequate state funding, inefficient use o f resources, which i s related to imperfect
funding mechanisms and inadequacy o f the management system to the present-day
conditions, as well as overall reduction in household income led to the notable
deterioration in the quality o f life o f Ukrainians. To solve the current problems o f
healthcare industryone needs, first o f all, to revise the existing funding mechanisms and
network structure. This implies finding an optimal combination o f state and private
funding sources. The government plans to attract all interested parties to develop such a
short-term strategy for sector development, which would combine social and market
mechanisms o f sector financing.

To ensure the development o f health care system and improve quality o f services to the
population, the Government plans to accomplish the following tasks:


     0     to bring the life expectancy indicator closer to the level o f countries with the
     high index of human development, to stabilize the level of children's mortality
     duringthe first year o flife andto reduce maternalmortality;
     0     to continue reforms o f primary medical aid on the basis o f family medicine,
     first and foremost inthe rural areas;
     0     to implement a complex o f measures aimed at preventing and stabilizing the
     level o f infectious diseases, primarily socially dangerous diseases - TB and
     HIV/AIDS;
     0     to improve the systemo f providing urgent medical aid with the aim o f bringing
     it closer to the world standards and developing an institution o ffamily doctor;
     0     to revise and improve the state standards o f all types o f medical aid, the
     availability o f which must be a mandatory condition for reforming various
     components o f the healthprotection system;
     0     to improve the quality o f training o f medical personnel; and
     0     to improve mechanisms o fbudget financing o f the healthcare system.

Inorder to achieve these objectives, the governmentprogram seeksto develop financially
and economically sound health system through analysis o f various sources o f financing
and payment. Among different options o f financing, it considers state and local budgets,
mandatory social health insurance, voluntary health insurance, and private payments.

Duringthe last two years, positive results have been achieved towards improving health
care system. Among them are the following:

    0   National Health Sector strategy was adopted. In order to implement adopted
        national strategy, financial and economic analysis o f the draft health insurance
         law has been prepared and regional plans have been developed and approved for
         optimization o f the network o f rural health care establishments in three oblasts -
         Chernigivska, Kirovogradska and Kharkivska;

    0   Progress has been made in primary care reforms through establishing family
        medicine centers and creating a new university specialization which focuses on
        family medicine. About 1000 family doctors have been trained through the new
        university system and budget finds are being channeled to primary health care
        facilities to provide them with neededmaintenance, vehicles and equipment;
    0   To combat the spread o f TB and AIDS inUkraine, the government, (a) improved
        control o f public health risks through execution o f two pilots o f the T B DOTS
        method adopted to national conditions, and (b) adopted an AIDS prevention
        program for the years 2001-2003. Since then, detailed implementation plans have
        been developed for execution o f both strategies, and a US$60 million loan from
        the World Bank has been approved to help finance implementationcosts.




2.4. EDUCATION

Ukraine has always placed education among its top priorities. Since education i s the most
important component o f social and economic life o f a country and a prerequisite o f its
stable development, the general educational and national trends inthe sphere o f education
determine education as a key to overcoming poverty, a guarantee o f public peace and the
core of the state development strategy.

Recently, one has been observing growing demand for educational services, yet at the
same time there is deficit o f budget resources for education. This circumstance compels
to revise the present structure o f educational institutions and to orient them toward
modemrequirements for human c apital development. Inorder t o determine a strategy
and major directions o f further development o f education in Ukraine, the National
Doctrine for Education Development was approved in April 2002. The government also
approved measures to implement the National Doctrine for Education Development for
the 2002 -2004 period within a realistic financial envelope.

The Ministry o f Education and Science o f Ukraine jointly with the Academy o f
Pedagogical Sciences o f Ukraine developed the State Standard o f Primary Education
(currently, work i s being completed on the State Standard o f Basic and Complete
Secondary Education).      The 12-year general secondary education system has already
been introduced and starting from 2000 more budget resources has been directed to
finance this system.

One o f the determining factors ensuring the functioning o f the general secondary
education system i s the provision o f personnel for educational institutions. Inview o f the
fact that a number o f social issues have not been resolved and there are no proper
conditions for educational work, the problem o f outflow o f teaching staff from schools
remains acute; this particularly concerns the rural teachers. The major reason for this i s
insufficient material incentives to work and limitedbudget funding o f the sector.

Taking into account the real potentials o f budgets o f all levels, the government adopted a
number o f decisions in 2001-2002 to increase the level of labor remuneration o f
educational specialists. Inaddition, by the beginningo f the 2002-2003 academic (school)
year, arrears on salaries to educational specialists o f educational institutions that are
funded from the state and local budgetswere fully paid. However, certain measures are
yet to be implemented to improve labor remuneration, to raise salaries for teachers, to
adjust expenses in education sector to available resources and to combine efforts o f the
state and private sectors to increase efficiency o f the educational institutions.

To improve the situation in the education sector, the government needs to do the
following:
      a) raise the level o f labor remunerationo f educational specialists;
      b) improve the quality o fthe secondary education bymeans of:
         -  providing necessary methodological support to exert transition o f general
            education institutions to the new substance o f training, structure and 12-year
            term o f education;
         -  aid to the schools in rural areas within the framework o f comprehensive
            "Rural school" program by providing them with computers, textbooks and

         -  other training materials;
            adjusting the substance o f education to the needs o f the new secondary

         -  education system;
            introducing tenders on preparation o f textbooks for secondary and vocational

         -  schools;
            reforming the higher education system to make it correspondent to the 12-year

         -  secondary education system and to the needs o f the labor market;
            monitoring the quality o f education.

To fulfill these tasks the government will do the following:
            0   continue restructuring o f the network o f educational institutions o f all
            types t o make them correspondent t o the needs o f a n individual and t o the
            economic potential o f the state and regions by creating educational institutions
            o fnew type, comprehensive scientific, educational andproduction complexes;
            0   develop provision o f t arget state credits t o t alented graduates t o receive
            higher education; and
            0   expand list o fpay services, which can beprovided by the higherschools in
            order to broaden access o f citizens to higher education and reduce the burden
            on the State budget. At present, the main investors in education are the state,
            legal entities and individuals.

Pay services will also be introduced in the secondary education system for additionally
paid subjects, activities o f out-of-school educational institutions and advanced study o f
foreign languages.

2.6. ENVIRONMENT

Environmental problems in Ukraine are largely induced by the weak environmental
institutional and policy framework which fails to encourage adoption of environment-
protection technology and reducing the high energy and resource intensity o f the GDP.
The available natural resources inmost c ases are used ineffectively and there exists a
pressing need to build such structure o f incentive pertinent to environment protection that
i s consistent with the sustainable economic growth. The latter necessitates (a) developing
procedures obliging enterprises, who damage the environment, to cover the full cost o f
the damage and (b) increasingrevenue sources to cover costs o f pollution prevention and
environment protection, encouraging private capital inflow.

The government reviewed and analyzed the environmental public expenditure with the
support o f the World Bank. Capitalizing on this first step, the government aims to employ
the recommendations o f the Environmental Public Expenditure Review to increase the
efficiency o f public resources for environmental protection. Recommendations o f the
review will be taken as basis for the development o f new mechanisms to sustain public
funding inpriority areas. At the same time acknowledging the demand for environmental
financing,   the government will revamp the incentive system for private sector
investments in activities and projects generating environmental and economic
performance benefits.

Ukraine aims to gradually harmonize its legislation related to protection o f the
environment with that o f the European Union. The government will work further to
strengthen environmental policies, monitoring and enforcement o f environmental
regulations. The state system o f environment monitoring and natural resource
management will be improved. For this purpose eight selected enterprises will continue
experimental program o f environment monitoring and integrated pollution prevention
permits.

The tax base o f environmental charges will be expanded and the government will move
to a system o f indexation o f pollution charges on a yearly basis. Regulations on licensing
and issuingo fpermits inthe sphere of environmental protection will be improved .

The Fifth Pan-European conference "Environment for Europe" held in Kyiv in 2003,
determined the development priorities and prospects and goals for strengthening the
environmental management inEEC region and Ukraine is c ommitted t o implementing
the Conference's agreements and working for accomplishing common goals.


     3. ECONOMIC   GROWTH

3.1. MACROECONOMIC      CONDITIONS FOR FUTURE GROWTH

InUkraine, there was continued economic growth duringthe past three years. For 2000
real GDP growth rate was at 5.9%, in 2001 - 9,2%, and in 2002 - 4.8%. The favorable
environment for economic growth was created by long-term structural factors such as the
impact o f privatization and restructuring, fundamental structural changes, improved state
finance management, implementation o f sound monetary policy, and strengthened
payment discipline inthe energy sector, as well as the shift o fpart o fthe shadow economy
sector to the official sector, which took place under conditions o f restoration o f
macroeconomic environment and development o fmarketinstitutions.

The positives trends o f the past years continue in the current year. GDP growth during
January-September totaled 6.5%, industrial output for the same period was 15.2% which
points to sustainability o f the macroeconomic environment.

The highdynamics has been determined by favorable conditions at the external markets,
maintenance of high growth o f real incomes o f population and investments in fixed
capita1.

Growth rates of export and import o f goods in January-August (according to the State
Statistics Committee) have been 29.1% and 31.2% accordingly. This growth has resulted
from significant increase o fboth demand and world prices, and it has strengthened role o f
external demand inmaintenance o f economic growth.

 To stimulate domestic demand, the government pays particular attention to improving the
welfare o f the population: at the beginning o f the current year there was a new increase in
the size o f minimum wages and salaries, in the cash security and pensions for certain
categories o f servicemen. As a result, in January-August, 2003 real wages o f w orkers
grew by 15.2%, and real incomes o f the population grew by 4.2% against the respective
period o f 2002.

The basic principle o f activities o f the government and the National Bank of Ukraine as
regardsproviding conditions for increasing investment capacity o f the business sector is
encouraging investments.With this aim in view, the National Bank o f Ukraine continues
to implement measures to reform and consolidate the banking sector, to reduce the
discount and reserve requirements, carries out sound emission and monetary policies,

we have succeeded in achieving positive macroeconomic indicators - low level of
which make it possible to maintain financial stability. Due to the abovementioned factors

inflation (CPI for 9 months amounted to 3.3%), sustainable exchange rate o f hryvnia (as
o f end o f September exchange rate o f hryvnia to U S dollar was 5.33 UAHKJSD), and
further increase in volumes o f the country's reserves (as of October 1, 2003, the gross
international reserves amounted to US$ 6.7 billion). Growth o f volumes o f crediting for
January-August was 32.0%, real volumes o f investments inthe fixed capital increased by
27.5% (for the first half-year).

The government s timulates redistribution o f s avings accumulated inbanks inorder t o
promote financing the needs o f the business sector by implementing measures aimed at
restoring the financial health o f the real sector, including strengthening o f payment

discipline in the fuel and energy complex, improving the mechanism for removal o f
inefficient enterprises from the economic process and pursuing reasonable policies to
attract investments to the intemal market.

The govemment continues to pursue a policy o f abandoning mutual settlements in
repayment o f arrears to the budget, which improves the status o f state finances. In
January-September 2003, revenues to the general fund of the state budget were fulfilled
by 102.3% of the budget schedule. Just as at the beginningo f the last year, the budget
surplus is maintained (surplus o f the consolidated budget in January-September 2003
constituted 3.97 billion hryvnias, including 1.03 billion hryvnias of the general fund o f
the state budget), which allows the Ministry o f Finance to redeem and service the debts
without large borrowings on the intemal market. This, in its turn, results in decreased
value o fprivate sector borrowings.

To support further economic growth, the government and the National Bank o fUkraine
will do their best to better coordinate fiscal, monetary, exchange rate, and government
debt policies. To avoidmacroeconomic instability, we will continue to pursue balanced
budgetthroughbringinginorder government expenditures andimplementingtax reform,
including tax administrationreform. Higher efficiency o f government expenditureswill
be attained through pensionreform, streamlining socialprotection expenses, targeting
social assistance, and gradual transition to mixed forms of education and healthcare
fundingas suggestedinthe respective parts o fthis Letter. The legislative acts recognized
as such that lead to increased budget expenditures not supported with viable revenue
sources will be revised.



3.2. BUDGET    POLICY

Cabinet o f Ministers fully appreciates that consistent and prudent fiscal policy i s a
necessary prerequisite o f macroeconomic stability and of effective provision o f social
services. Former efforts directed on the reforms o f state finance system have already
brought intangible results such as the following.
    0    The practice o f disallowing mutual offsets with the budget continues. At present
         all budget revenues are collected exclusively incash.
    0   Pensions are paid on time, and wage arrears were liquidated. Inparticular, overall
        budget arrears decreased by4.6 billion hryvnia as against January 1, 2000 and
        constituted 1.3 billion hryvnia as o f June 1, 2003. Budget arrears on social
        payments were 4.5 billion hryvnias as o f July 1, 2003, i.e. reduced by 54.9%. As
.       of October 1, 2003 reduction o f social payments arrears with regard to January 1,
        2000 amounts to 66.3%.
    Both general and special budget funds are operated by the state treasury, as are funds
    of the budget organizations and special-purpose extra-budgetary funds.

    0   In 2002 the government jointly with the Verkhovna Rada prepared and
        implemented balanced state budget.22


The Cabinet of Ministers o f Ukraine i s committed to strengtheningthe internal financial
control framework, including establishment o f a modem internal audit function, within
the government. Accordingly, the Cabinet o f Ministers has instructedMinistry o f Finance
to establish a working group, assisted by international consultants, to prepare a strategy
paper on reforms in internal financial controls and internal audit and an implementation
plan including draft laws and regulations that would be necessary to implement the
chosen strategy. I t i s recognized that the reforms in this area should be guided by the
sections 28 and29 o f acquis communautaire o f the European Union.

We w illw ork to further increasethe transparency o f the budgetprocess and 1iquidate
hiddenbudget arrears. Specifically, it is envisaged to do the following:
      0   improve      the budget implementation procedures                    and    clearly     define
      responsibility for the use o fbudget funds;
      0    suspend the regulations providing privileges to civil servants not justified from
      poverty reductionperspective;
      0    enhance accountability and cash flow management in the budget sector due to
      introduction o fthe single treasury account;
      0    improve management o f internal and external state debt, specifically, strict
      rules on providing state guarantees will be established and observed; and
      0    strengthen internal financial controls and restructure current control and
      revision function with a view to establishing a modem internal audit function.


3.3. TAXPOLICY

The maintasks o fthe Ukrainian government midterm tax policy are as follows:
      0   to resolve the tax arrears problem;
      0   to reform the tax system by reducing tax rates and broadening the tax base
          through elimination o f tax exemptions;
      0   to modernize the tax administration system.

The government will continue to do everything in its power to reduce overdue liabilities
to the state budget. The government has succeeded in stopping tax arrears accumulation
from business as a group nation-wide. Inparticular, enterprises innon-energy sector as a
group have not had increased tax arrears since January 1, 2002, while energy enterprises
taken as a group have stopped the growth o f tax arrears since January 1, 2003. Financial
discipline has been achieved through the following measures: (a) selling debtors'
property o f state-owned companies in lieu o f tax arrears, (b) initiating bankruptcy
procedures against debtor businesses o f non-state form o f ownership; and (c) terminating

22 According to the Ukrainian budget classification, privatization revenues are counted as part o f budget
 revenues.

contracts with the top managers of state and municipal enterprises, which failed to pay
out arrears. Thus, active tax arrears in non-energy sector decreased from more than 2
billion hryvnia in 2002 to 1.8 billion hryvnia (or 0.8% o f GDP) as o f January 1, 2003.
The active tax arrears in the non-energy sector was reduced to 1.7 billion hryvnias (or
0.76% GDP) as of July 2003.

The problem of tax arrears in fuel and energy sector has proven especially difficult to
address and thus requires systemic solution as the major part o f the accumulated arrears i s
caused by the debts o f 100 strategic enterprises (mainly enterprises o f the fuel-and-energy
and o f the housing utilities sector). The govemment has been resolving the problem o f
tax arrears accumulation and debt reduction within the framework o f a comprehensive
strategy to bring the fuel and energy companies to financial solvency. While this cross
cutting strategy is being worked out, key parts o f it that have already been identifiedare
moving fonvard. Inparticular, (a) development and implementation o f a 1aw o n debt
restructuring which will inter alia set the stage for privatization o f remaining majority
state owned power distribution companies, and (b) implementation o f a short term planto
improve financial discipline in the energy sector (see further discussion o f this plan in
para. # below)

In parallel, Ukraine is reforming its tax system. The final goal of tax reform is the
following: establish parity o f the rights o f tax payers and state tax service agencies;
stability o f tax legislation; preventing o f the possibility o f frequent and sporadic changes
in the taxation laws and tax tariffs; reduction and equal distribution of the existing
excessive tax burden; expanding o f the tax base by eliminating tax privileges and tax
exemptions; strict compliance with the tax legislation, improvement o f its enforcement in
order to limit the scope of the shadow economy; and providing conditions for further
integration o fUkraine into the European Union.

At the end o f 2002 - beginning o f 2003, the Verkhovna Rada adopted a number o f tax
laws aimed at improving the status o f budget revenues by preventing the facts o f tax
evasion and improving tax administration.

The Law o f Ukraine "On Personal Income Tax," adopted by the Verkhovna Rada o f
Ukraine on May 22, 2003 provides for abolition o f the progressive taxation scale with
five personal income tax rates (10, 15, 20, 30, 40 %) and establishing o f the single tax
rate o f 15% (the single rate o f 13% will be established for the period starting from the
date when the law becomes effective until January 1, 2007), which will make it possible
to s implify the procedure o f t ax administering. T his 1aw also envisages e limination o f
occupational and sectoral privileges.

The Law "On Amendments to the Law o fUkraine On Enterprise Profit Tax" provides for
preventing tax evasion and eliminating sectoral tax privileges, while the EPT rate has
beenreduced to 25% to become effective since January 1,2004.

The government will propose for consideration by the Verkhovna Rada o f Ukraine
comprehensive draft law on making amendments to the Law o f Ukraine "On VAT",

which provides for liquidation o f privileges, including privileges cancelled by the
abovementioned law. At the same time, the draft Law o f Ukraine "On State Budget o f
Ukraine for 2004" intends to resolve the number o f problems related to VAT refund for
exported goods, suspend some tax privileges and implement transparent mechanism for
supporting agricultural producers.

The draft Law o f Ukraine "On Excise Tax" adopted by the Verkhovna Rada in the first
reading will create equal taxation conditions for domestic producers o fmain commodities
subject to the excise tax.

Adoption o f these laws and their consistent enforcement will make it possible to reduce
the tax burden and expand the tax base. At the same time, it should be noted that in
parallel with adoption of all the main tax laws the main element o f reform o f Ukraine's
tax system is the draft Tax Code, which requires further work after it was adopted by the
Verkhovna Rada in the second reading. This Tax Code is to become a basis for creating
inUkraine a stable tax system designed to ensure a sufficient volume of revenues to the
budgets o f all levels, efficient functioning o f the state economy, fair andjust approach to
taxation o f all categories o f taxpayers, and clear determination o f their rights and duties.




4. IMPROVEMENT OF THE BUSSINESENVIRONMENT

To support economic growth and generate employment opportunities, the government
will continue with efforts to further improve the business environment. These efforts
should lead to an increasing participation o f the private sector in the economy, strategic
partnerships with foreign investors and improvements in corporate govemance. The
government will focus on the following priorities: (1) improvement o f the regulatory
fkamework governing registration, licensing and inspections o f enterprises; (2)
streamlining and strengthening regulatory bodies; (3) continuation o f the large-scale
privatization; and (4) proper enforcement o f the bankruptcy procedures. Besides, the
government will continue its efforts to access the WTO.

4.1. REGULATORY FRAMEWORK: REGISTRATION, LICENSING AND INSPECTIONS

According to the results o f annual independent surveys carried out by IFC and USAID,
for the past several years Ukraine has shown remarkable progress inreducing barriers to
registration and development o f private sector enterprises. At present the registration fees
are quite low and registration period i s short - five days, normally, and three days, on an
accelerated basis. The number o f enterprise inspections by state bodies (including tax
authorities) has beenreducedto about 10 inspections per enterprise annually.

The government is committed to further gains. Thus, it seeks to introduce the "single
window" principle for enterprise post-registration and the issuance o f permits, and has
conducted a pilot project to test the proposed procedures. The government plans next to
develop necessary regulatory acts that allow introduction o f the "application principle" to

the issuance of permits, as well as other approvals and opinions needed to undertake
entrepreneurial activity.

The adopted Law o f Ukraine "On State Registration o f Legal Entities and Physical
Persons - Subjects o f Entrepreneurial Activity" will make it possible to simplify
procedures for enterprise registration and liquidation, to regulate procedures and establish
penalties for their violation, to introduce state register o f subjects o f economic activity,
and to ensure access to its information fund for all interested users.

Advances have also been made in the simplification o f licenses, and only one license is
needed to operate in various activities that require licenses. Also, procedures have been
established for the operation o f the licensing bodies, defining the validity terms for the
licenses, fees collected for issuing a license, and the list o f complementary documents
submitted together with license application. To further streamline licensing, the
govemment has presented the consideration o f the Verkhovna Rada revisions to the Law
of Ukraine "On Licensing o f Selected Economic Activities".

To evaluate the effectiveness o f these measures, the Cabinet o f Ministers of Ukraine will
continue to consult public opinion through surveys and examinations. In addition, the
government will encourage local administrations to create independent advisory groups
to conduct parallel control examinations o f the business environment and interference o f
the state into their activities.

4.2. REGULATORY BODIES

The Cabinet o f Ministers will continue with efforts to develop the regulatory frameworks
for communications,        energy sector, and non-banking financial institutions. The
development o f modem regulatory frameworks and institutions i s complementary with
the ongoing process o f privatization. Draft legislation to secure the independence of
energy sector regulatory body (National Commission on Energy Regulations - NERC)
and its adequate funding has been prepared and submitted to the consideration o f the
Verkhovna Rada. In addition, NERC will begin to establish quality o f service standards
for electricity and gas and monitoring procedures. InJuly 2003 Verkhovna Rada adopted
the law "On telecommunications'' laying the institutional ground for establishment o f a
financially and administratively independent telecom regulator. The independent body
regulating the activity o f non-bank financial institutions has been established and already
functioning.


4.3. PROPERTY RIGHTS: PRIVATIZATION, CORPORATE GOVERNANCE AND PROTECTION OF
PROPERTY RIGHTS

Privatization o f the large enterprises i s among the government's priority activities aimed
at raising economic efficiency, restoring national production and facilitating economic
growth. Privatized enterprises (especially those o f food and textile industries, and other
industriesmanufacturing consumer goods) havebeenthe fastest growing inthe economy.

Further privatization o f energy distribution companies will follow after the law on debt
restructuring is enacted and implemented. Six oblenergos were privatized through open
tenders in 2001 and proved to lead to better performance o f privatized companies vis-a-
vis the state-owned ones. The government intends to resume privatization in energy
sector and intemational advisor will be involved inthe tender process.

The Law o f Ukraine "On Privatization o f Open Joint Stock Company Ukrtelecom"
creates conditions for the sale to an industrial investor (through open trading) o f a
package o f shares in the amount o f not less than 25% o f the statutory capital o f OJSC
Ukrtelecom plus one share. Moreover, the plan for placing o f shares provides for the
possibility o f sale to an industrial investor o f at least 42.86% o f the company stock. In
addition, to ensure management control can be consolidated under a strategic investor,
the investor will be entitled to manage half o f the company stocks owned by the state.
These stocks together with the purchased ones would ensure management by the investor
of the controlling block o f shares o f the company. To facilitate sale o f the enterprise to a
strategic investor, the government hired an independent consulting consortium made up
of a group o f companies including Millennium Financial Services, Squire, and
SandersdzDempsey. In addition, we will improve and develop existing regulations
goveming operations in the telecommunications sector so that privatization will have
positive welfare effect for the Ukrainian economy as a whole.

The government recognizes that given the size and strategic importance o f the
abovementioned companies, large-scale privatization i s a challenging task. Hence, the
government will privatize these companies on an individual basis and stress transparency
inthe process. To ensure transparency inthe identification ofpotential investors and sale
of controlling blocks o f shares, we will continue inviting independent consultants (both
foreign and Ukrainian) on a competitive basis. In addition, the Privatization Advisory
Group (PAG) will continue to carry out its work. The Group consists o f representatives
of the government, intemational financial organizations, donors, and independent experts
and is authorized t o analyze privatizationprogress based onthe pre-determined s et o f
transparency criteria. During the PAL I1preparation period, the Group conducted a
meeting to which the Intemational Institute o f Privatization, Property Management and
Investments presented its Study o f Transparency o f Privatization Transactions in 2002.
Based on the study results, PAG reported improved transparency o f privatization
processes during 2002. The government intends to sell during 2003-2004 almost all state
packages o f shares o f open joint stock companies in the amount o f 25% and less o f the
authorized fund.

New approaches to privatization have been set forth in draft State Privatization Program
which i s now being developed. To compliment the Privatization Program and enhance
development o f Ukraine's corporate sector draft laws on joint stock companies and
securities and stock market will be finalized and submitted to Verkhovna Rada. The
Privatization Program envisages that all residual state shares below 50% will be sold in
expedient manner inorder to reduce the scope o f state-owned companies inthe economy.

Private sector development is limited by non-transparent corporate sector practices in
Ukraine. The government realizes the need to implement clear corporate governance
rules and enforce corporate transparency among more than 35,000 joint stock companies.
It intends to enforce that joint stock companies, which are publicly listed inthe first tier
o f official stock exchange, place their annual reports for 2003 prepared in compliance
with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) on web-site for open and free
access. Recently adopted Resolutions o f the State Securities and Stock Market
Commission aim at creating a centralized financial reporting database by the end o f 2004
and improving procedures o f corporate information disclosure to public. A decision will
be taken to ensure that companies whose shares and bonds are incirculation comply with
international accounting standards.

Along with privatization the government will make an effort to increase efficiency inthe
management o f enterprises remaining under the state ownership. During PAL I1
preparation, a study was carried out on the state enterprise management, incentives,
accounting and auditing practices and the results were publicized. The government is
also improving the quality and regularity o f the flow o f information from the SOEs to
better follow performance and exercise adequate governance on the side ofthe state.

Privatization o f land and protection o f landowner rights is an especially important issue
inthe context ofpropertyrightsreform. The pace and quality ofreforms insuchkey
areas as agriculture, residential construction, municipal services, and finance, are largely
influenced by transparency and precision in definitions o f land property rights. The
government has already achieved some progress in laying grounds for land market in
Ukraine, having adopted the basic legislative acts regulating land relations.

DuringPAL I1preparation, the government took a nimportant additional step towards
reforming land property relations - the draft Law o f Ukraine "On State Registration o f
Property Rights for Real Estate" was prepared and submitted to the Verkhovna Rada o f
Ukraine for consideration. Adoption o f this law will make it possible to solve the issue o f
creating in Ukraine the single system o f state registration o f ownership rights for land
plots and objects of immovable property, exercising relevant encumbrances and
limitations. Once adopted, the law will enact procedures for efficient registration o f land
and immovable property inone agency, which will also manage the state land cadastre. In
addition, the Government plans to improve the quality o f the issuance o f land titles to
farmers through regular checks o f the titles issues and registered as well as in the context
o f implementation o f the Rural Titling and Cadastre Development Project that has been
preparedjointly with the World Bank.

4.4. BANKRUPTCY:       STRENGTHENING FINANCIAL DISCIPLINE AND PROPERTY RIGHTS
PROTECTION

The government acknowledges the utmost significance o f enhancement o fproperty rights
and strengthening o f financial discipline in the economy as a whole. Elimination o f
budget arrears and arrears in the energy sector is a key step. Additionally, clear and
transparent bankruptcy procedures are crucial for soundness o f any economy and closure

o f ineffective enterprises i s a necessary prerequisite for functioning o f the competitive
economy. However, successful implementation o f bankruptcy procedures in an economy
suffering from substantial mutual debts i s a complicated issue. Besides, effective
introduction o f bankruptcy procedures demands fundamental institutional reforms, 1ike
the reform o f court system.

To resolve the above-referenced and other problems, the bankruptcy systeminUkraine i s
being reformed, taking into account present-day economic conditions and needs.
Powerkl instruments o f combating insolvency have been introduced, including,
specifically, pre-court reorganization and reorganization during the bankruptcy process,
concluding o f amicable arrangements, and other mechanisms. Liquidation o f a bankrupt
enterprise i s regarded as an exceptional measure for enterprises that cannot be
rehabilitated.

In order to ensure organizational support for the efficient enforcement of bankruptcy, a
number o f normative and legal acts were developed; a ramified system o f state agencies
on issues o f bankruptcy was formed; the self-supporting state "Agency on issues o f
bankruptcy" was established to provide services in case o f bankruptcy proceedings; a
system o f training was organized for arbitrage administrators (administrators o f estate,
administrators o f restructuring, administrators o f liquidation); and over 2 thousand
arbitrage administrators received licenses to carry out their activities.

Also, recently, procedures have begun to be introduced more frequently aimed at
restoring a debtor's solvency - sanation (reorganization),            amicable arrangements,
settlements with creditors.

The government is taking steps to further improve bankruptcy. Thus, inorder to solve the
issue of alienation o f the state property beyond the limits o f legislation on privatization,
preventing abuses and ensuring protection o f the state interests, the draft Law o f Ukraine
"On Amendments to Selected Laws o f Ukraine" ("On Restoring o f Debtor's Solvency,"
"On Execution Procedure," "On Procedure for Repayment o f Taxpayers' Liabilities to
Budgetsand State Special-Purpose Funds" and "On Collateral")" has beendeveloped.

Draft Law o f Ukraine "On Amendments to the Law o f Ukraine On Restoring Debtor's
Solvency" aimed at improving the activities o f arbitrage administrators (administrators
o f estate, administrators of restructuring, administrators o f liquidation) and strengthening
control over their activities is beingdeveloped.

Effectiveness of the new procedures will be tested on the large insolvent enterprises.
During PALIIpreparation, the government initiated bankruptcy procedures against 17
enterprises out of a list o f the 63 largest tax debtors to the budget (based on average
indicators for the January 1999 - May 2002 period). Bankruptcy on 10 additional large
tax debtors will be initiated duringPAL I1implementation.

Application o f clear and transparent bankruptcy procedures to banks is important for the
soundness o f the banking system and maintaining the required level o f trust o f population

towards banks and other financial institutions. In 2001, bankruptcy procedures were
initiated against "Ukrayina" bank, and in 2002 the government achieved considerable
progress in the process o f its liquidation. In particular, the payments to household
depositors o f the bank were completed.




4.5. ACCESSION THE WTO
                 TO

The government continues to reform the regulatory framework to bring it in conformity
with the norms andrequirements ofthe WTO.

Thus, the accreditation and certification functions that were performed by the State
Committee o f Ukraine for Standardization, Metrology, and Certification were separated
and the accreditation function has been transferred to the National Agency o f Ukraine for
accreditation created inJanuary 2002.

The Government has decided to boost the approval o f EU Directives and standards. 11
technical rules have been submitted for consideration by the Cabinet o f Ministers o f
Ukraine based on European "novel approach" directives. In addition, 1500 international
and European standards have been developed for implementation as voluntary Ukrainian
national standards. These rules and standards will be adopted prior to the provision o f a
second tranche. Throughout P A L I11implementation another 14 technical rules and laws
will be developed, including laws on the general product safety and on liability for
deficient products, and the number o f national standards harmonized with international
and European standards will reach 2000 (out of nearly 2500 standards that would make it
possible to fully harmonize the regime).

Legislative framework has been created in Ukraine in the sphere o f intellectual property
incompliance with WTO requirements, and effective infrastructure has been established
in order to ensure enforcement of legislative norms regarding protection of intellectual
property rights

The government will take additional steps to increase the transparency and market
orientation o f the technical standards regime. The Cabinet o f Ministers o f Ukraine
approved a resolution for public awareness campaign on Ukraine's accession to the WTO
and the corresponding web-site was created. The legal basis for an inquiry point has been
established. During P A L 111, it will have the capacity to disseminate notifications in
WTO languages of new technical regulations and standards o f interest to W T O members.
Furthermore, this inquiry point will be able to disseminate information about foreign
technical procedures and standards among corresponding Ukrainian business entities and
organizations. In order to strengthen market orientation o f this system, we will decrease
state control over conformity assessment (testing). In particular, we will encourage
adoption o f legislative documents and implementation o f regulatory acts necessary to

ensure possibility of delivering testing services in Ukraine by foreign conformity
assessment bodies.

The govemment also intends t o improve work o f customs service, which will support
reduction o f administrative expenditures and time necessary for importing and exporting
o f goods. Adoption o f the new Customs Code o f Ukraine at the end of 2002 gave a
noticeable impetus to improvement in the performance o f customs. On its side, the
Cabinet o f Ministers o f Ukraine has s ucceeded t o adopt during short period o f t ime a
number o f regulatory acts necessary for implementation o f this Code. This has resulted in
improved customs procedures, increased e ffectiveness o f customs service, and ensured
reduction o f trade costs.




5. STRUCTURAL REFORMSINSTRATEGIC SECTORS

To further advance structural reforms the Cabinet o f Ministers o f Ukraine i s determined
to focus on the key sectors -financial, energy, agriculture and telecommunications.

5.1 FINANCIALSECTOR

    The Ukrainian financial sector remains small relative to the size o f the economy and
provides limited access to finance for the fast growing economy, especially for such
segments o f the economic activity as micro entrepreneurship, SMEs, agriculture and
households. Geographical distribution o f finance i s also uneven and rural finance i s
insufficient. Moreover, lending i s predominantly short term and required collateral often
exceeds 150% o f the value o f the loan, even while leaving the creditor unsecured due to a
weak legislative framework for secured interest and cumbersome enforcement
procedures. Poor financial discipline o f the borrowers, lack o f credit history and high
credit risks result in very high interest rates and thus limited access to finance for
growing and new businesses. The sector o f non-bank financial institutions i s still
embryonic and accounts for less than 3% o f GDP. Limitedintermediatory capacity o f the
financial sector and      an unconducive environment for lending may restrain swift
development o f new businesses and undermine future economic growth.

    We intendto improve this situation byundertaking the following structural reforms.

a       Continue monitoring o f the overall performance and stability o f the financial
    sector and facilitate restructuring o f problem banks and liquidation o f insolvent banks
    without unjustified delays.      Specifically, according to the Law "On Banks and
    Banking", liquidation o f banks shall be completed within three years since the
    beginning o f bank's bankruptcy, including liquidation o f Bank "Ukrayina".           To
    achieve this target, the liquidator has completed payments to all the household
    depositors o f Bank "Ukrayina",     including insured deposits in the amount o f 500
    million hryvnia and additional amounts up to 50 thousand hryvnia as required by the
    law of Ukraine dated February 7,2002.

         Concerted efforts will be taken to improve financial and operational performance
     o f the State Savings bank to make it financially viable and compliant with the
     provisions o f the Ukrainian legislation and regulatory requirements. Inparticular, the
     government will provide significant support to the issues o f bank's capitalization,
     accountability o f the management o f the Savings Bank, and development o f
     mechanism for protection o f the rights o fthe bank's depositors.

         The legal, regulatory and supervisory framework governing operations on NBFIs
     will be further developed and improved. InDecember 2 002, the new, independent
     regulator for NBFIs was established by the Presidential Decree No. 1153/2002. The
     Chairman o f this new state agency created as a authority o f central executive power
    with the special status, was appointed on December 17, 2002. The law on state 2003
    budget included provisions for the initial funding o f the regulator. Further efforts will
    bemade in2003 and 2004 to enhance institutional capacity and full functioning o fthe
    NBFI regulator on the principles o f operational autonomy, decision making
     independence, adequate funding, operational efficiency and accountability.

         Reducing transaction costs o fbanks and other financial intermediaries by enacting
     sound legislation to protect creditors rights; eliminating redundant or obsolete
     regulations and procedures which detrimentally increase operating costs and thus
     result in expensive and high risk lending; introducing alternative dispute resolution
     mechanisms and creating a publicly accessible, comprehensive Registry o f
     Encumbrances which will allow to register the security interest for all types o f
     movable assets. The respective strategy for reform o f credit market has been designed
     and the draft Law "On Securing the Creditors Rights and Registration o f
     Encumbrances" has been passed in the Verkhovna Rada in the first reading. To
     expand the variety o f financial services and products as well as allow diversification
     o f banks' assets, the NBU together with the government and at support o f the
     Verkhovna Rada o f Ukraine was actively advocating development o f mortgage
     finance markets in Ukraine. As the result, in June 2003 the Law "On Mortgage" was
    passed and will come into force in January 2004. This law i s the result o f the joint
     effort o f various local and international stakeholders and meets the requirements o f
     good international practice.

The banking sector plays dominant role inthe financial sector: it accounts for more than
85% of the total financial assets and i s one o f the fastest growing sectors o f the economy.
Its loan portfolio increased by 59% or 5 1billion hryvnia during the period o f end 2001 -
April 2003. Total assets grew by 47% for the same period. The government and the
National Bank o f Ukraine ascertain the existing credit and market risks and understand
the possible consequences o f bank failures and their impact on the financial system,
welfare of households, and country's e conomic perfomance in general. Therefore, w e
will continue to monitor the resilience o f the sector and strengthen our regulatory
capacity with the aim o f reduction o f systemic risks and prevention o f banking crisis.
Specifically, the following measures have already been             undertaken. In particular,
changes were introduced to the NBUregulations to make the regulatory framework and

prudential supervision coherent with the provisions o f the new Law "On Banks and
Banking" (December 2000) and more compliant with Base1 core principles for banking
supervision. Moreover, additional steps have been taken to strengthen prudential
requirements:
     0   InMay 2003, the NBUincreased its regulatory requirement for capital adequacy
         from 8% to 10%; banks are expected to produce audited financial reports on the
         consolidated basis starting yearend 2002;
     0   The large exposure limit i s set at 25% o fbank's regulatory capital;
     0   Respective changes and limitations are introduced in the area o f credit and
         investment activities o f banks. Recent amendments were made in Regulation
         #368 and loan classification and provisioning requirements, including in the area
         o f classification and provisioning for loans, investment (securities) portfolio,
         accounts receivable and correspondent accounts. According to BCP, NBU has
         introduced requirement for accounting o f market risk inloan classification; and
     0   Following enactment o f the Law on Banks and Banking, NBU has introduced
         reporting requirements for disclosure o f information on essential participation.

Further improvements are expected in these and other areas o f banking regulation and
supervision to ensure full compliance with BCP. NBU will ensure that banks provide
their reports on the consolidated basis and comply with the solvency and capital
adequacy ratio calculated on the basis o f consolidated reporting. Moreover, respective
sanctions will be applied to the banks which don't comply with provisioning and capital
requirements, including recalculation o f fixed assets and other capital adjustments
requiredby the NBU.

Special attention w illbe paid t o enforcement o f insider 1ending 1imitations. NBU will
initiate changes to Article 52 o f the Law "On Banks and Banking" to allow identification
o f the real owners o f banks and timely disclosure o f this information as well as data on
banking and financial holding companies. To ensure banks compliance with the related
parties limits, NBUwill amend relevant prudential regulations and methodology for on-
site examination in the areas related to large and insider lending exposures (specifically
normatives H9 and H10). Banks will be required to comply with the new requirements on
a phase-in basis as agreed with the World Bank and sanctions will be applied to non-
compliant banks.

In order to increase transparency of the banking sector and reliability of banks audits,
NBUhas required that banks perform their audits according to ISA. InApril 2003, the
Governor o f the NBU announced its commitment to require that all banks produce ISA
compliant audit for yearend 2003. Respective procedures and regulatory requirements are
being developed in this respect. This includes changes to the Law "On Banks and
Banking" and the law on auditing, adoption o f the NBU regulation #387 which has
established Committee on Certification o f Banks' Auditors, NBUregulation # 388 setting
the rules for auditors' certification, and NBU regulation # 389 which establishes the
procedure o f submission by banks o f audit reports to the NBUaccording to the results o f
annual financial reporting checks.

5.2. ENERGY     SECTOR

The Cabinet of Ministers o f Ukraine will continue implementation o f the comprehensive
program for resolving structural and functional problems in the energy sector. Key
elements o f the Government reform agenda are financial solvency, better governance and
greater transparency in all energy sub-sectors.

Among reforms that are being implemented inthe power sector, the major ones pertain to
the following: (a) further strengthening o f financial discipline; (b) inventorying and
restructuring o f overdue accumulated arrears in the energy sector; (c) resumption o f the
privatization o f the remaining state-owned electricity distribution companies and
preparation o f the privatization o f four thermal generating companies in sync with
progress on sector debt resolution; and (d) development and implementation o f a
comprehensive energy sector financial solvency plan aimed at liquidating sector tax
arrears and improving economic and technical indicators o f the sector. To further
strengthen financial discipline, the Cabinet o f Ministers o f Ukraine intends to increase
cash collections from end consumers to be fully current by the end o f the PAL period,
and will regularly conduct monitoring and audit o f payments for the consumed energy at
all levels o f the wholesale electricity market. Impressive positive results were achieved in
raising the level o f settlements with end consumers. As reports show, for 9 months o f
2003, the general level o f payments for the consumed energy by end consumers was
constantly increasing, all payments being made in cash. To date, the accumulated level o f
cash payments for the electric power received by the end consumers for 9 months reached
93.5%. Ingas sector this level went up to 85% for the last 12months.

Inorder to improve financial discipline it is necessary to have a clear picture ofthe stock
o f overdue debts in the energy sector. According to our estimates, as of October 1, 2003,
the accumulated debts o f end consumers for electric power are equal to 10.491 billion
hryvnia. Individual liabilities to the energy distribution companies have already been
restructured for large solvent debtors. But, much remains to be done. Thus, during the
PAL I1period, the government plans to implement comprehensive measures to resolve
the problems o f arrears in order to improve the investment attractiveness o f the energy
companies. In particular, the government will (a) present to the consideration of the
Verkhovna Rada of a draft law to provide a timed framework for the solution of inter-
enterprise debts in the energy sector, and (b) take stock o f debts in the he1 and energy
sector. The government will ensure that state-owned enterprises inthe energy sector will
participate in the debt restructuring mechanisms established by the law. The draft also
provides for the creation of clearing center to resolve claims among parties. Arrears to
Naftogaz have already been inventoried and prepared for restructuring during PAL I1
period.

As these tasks are undertaken, the prospects o f further privatization become more
attractive. Continued and parallel efforts o f the government in the energy sector include
the development of a comprehensive action plan to assure financial solvency and that the

generation o f arrears i s stopped. The government will prepare such a plan during the
PAL I1period. The plan will include among other things, measures on tariffs, powers to
cut-off delinquent consumers, identification o f critical consumers that cannot be cut off
and mechanisms to pay for their consumption, and greater financial discipline inpublic
agencies with energy consumption. Implementation of this action plan will not only
assure t he financial v iability o f t he energy s ector, but w illalso improve the ability o f
energy companies to pay taxes on time and infull.

The government will develop separate, but coherent, strategies to improve performance
in electricity, gas, coal, and oil. The combination o f financial discipline, financial
viability, private sector involvement, and regulatory powers will combine to strengthen
Ukraine's energy security. In the gas sector, the government mid-term objective i s
increasing its efficiency, securing the proper role o f Ukraine in transporting large
volumes o f gas to Western European markets and attracting private funds for further
development o f the sector. Analysis o f the gas sector performance will be continued to
identify alternative ways o f sector restructuringand involvement o fthe private sector into
implementation o f government mid-term tasks. In this regard, Naftogaz has engaged a
reputable international management consulting firm, KPMG, to help Naftogaz prepare a
strategy. The KPMG strategic plan will assist in the elaboration o f an action plan for the
improved operational and financial performance o fNaftogaz.

Part o f that strategy will be to improve the governance, transparency, and performance o f
Naftogaz. On improving transparency, Naftogaz will start disclosing financial and other
relevant information in accordance with the standards established by international oil and
gas companies that are known to exhibit good practices. In addition, the government
looks forward to the completion o f the audit for 2001, which means elaboration o f an
action plan to address the recommendation o f the audit in terms o f improvement o f the
system o f financial management. A new audit for 2002 will be conducted according to
international standards. More importantly, however, Naftogaz will undertake a
comprehensive audit for 2004, which means that all necessary complementary
preparatory steps regarding the fair values o f assets, and the evaluation o f oil and gas
reserves will be undertaken.

Inthe coal sector, the government also looks forward to, (a) improvingthe financial and
economic performance o f the sector in order to reduce the drain on the budget and
preserve a viable core o f the industry; and (b) mitigating social and environment
consequences o fthe ongoing massive sector downsizing.

5.3. AGRICULTURE

Following the Decree o f the President "On Urgent Measures to Speed Up Reforms in
Agriculture" the kolkhozs were transformed into new ownership/organizational forms.
Some 6.8 million o f land certificates were distributed to eligible individuals. 19.7
thousand o f the new agricultural enterprises o f market type were registered based on
private property rights to the land and property. Starting from mid-2000 more than 3
million landtitle deeds were issued in exchange for land certificates. The land title deeds

confirm   the title to a certain land plot and are registered by the regional bodies o f
Derzhkomzem.

Priority direction o f the agricultural reform i s introduction and protection o f property
rights for land as a basis for development o f agricultural production and for securing
loans to agricultural enterprises. Specifically, a draft Law o f Ukraine for establishment o f
state land cadastre and a unified system o f registration for legal rights to real estate
ownership was submittedto the Verkhovna Rada at the end o f 2002, and a working group
was established to finalize the draft law. Adoption o f this law will make it possible to
complete development o f legislative framework for creation o f a unified system o f
registration o f legal rights to land plots and real estate ownership in a single agency, and
to move forward on implementation o f this system.

Inparallel, with the assistance of the World Bank, the quality of landtitle issuance was
verified based on sampling techniques. Based on the results o f this verification, it i s
planned to prepare and implement relevant recommendations on how to further improve
the quality o f this process.

The government will facilitate enactment o f the laws crucial for implementation o f the
Land Code and quick progress o f reforms in agriculture. Inparticular, these include, "On
Land Market", "On Delimitation o f Municipally Owned and State Owned Land" and "On
Land Assessment". At the same time, it should be noted that the Verkhovna Rada has
already adopted the Law o f Ukraine "On Mortgage", "On Land Management Activities"
and "On Land Protection",       based on provisions o f the new Land Code. Moreover, the
Cabinet o f Ministers has approved a number o f regulatory documents which set special
procedures for carrying out transactions with land.

5.4 TELECOMMUNICATIONS

The Cabinet of Ministers o f Ukraine admits the importance o f creating a competitive
environment in the telecommunications sector. As already discussed, the government
intends to privatize the joint stock company "Ukrtelecom", which i s a national operator
on the domestic telecom market.

A decision about the future transfer o f a controlling block o fproperty rights to apotential
strategic investor has already been approved by the Verkhovna Rada. Terms o f the
announcement o f a competition-based privatization tender depend on, a) the overall
situation on the world markets, b) the interest o f strategic investors, (c) tariff rebalancing,
and (d) quality o fprivatization process.

In order to create a competitive environment in the communications sector, an EU
compliant strategy in the communications sphere is being developed which will be
completed and published after bringing it in line with the recently adopted Law "On
Telecommunications.'' This Law constitutes a legal framework for an independent
regulatory authority inthe communications s ector. T his is v ery important, s ince it not

only ensures the efficacy o fthe privatization process, but also determines the potential for
further development o fthe telecommunications market inUkraine.

     6. RISKS

The Cabinet of Ministers i s firm in the determination to consistently implement reforms
outlined in this Letter and to speed up institutional changes leading to improved
economic performance o f Ukraine. However, there are risks that may arise during
implementation o fthis reformprogram. Inparticular, they are the following.
       0 The Verkhovna Rada may fail to enact laws crucial for reform implementation.
       To reduce the likelihood o f this risk the Cabinet o f Ministers o f Ukraine will
       constantly collaborate with the Rada as described insection 1.2 o f this Letter.


       0 There may be insufficient support o f the government program from the society.
       To reduce this risk, the Cabinet o f Ministers o f Ukraine will partner with the public
       as suggested above insection 1.1ofthis Letter.

    7. COORDINATIONAND MONITORINGOFPAL 11ACTIVITIES

Since the very beginning o f PAL program, the Cabinet o f Ministers continues to adhere
to the principle of transparency inthe decision making process and supports mechanisms
o f consultation with the public.

To control preparation o f PAL activities, the government created an inter-agency
coordination board coordinatingwork o f ministries and agencies inthe implementation o f
the program.

The Cabinet o f Ministers reconfirms its support and appreciation o f the result-oriented
approach to the P A L program. It i s planning to develop a monitoring mechanism for
achieving PAL outcomes through active participation o f civil society and through survey
techniques.

This Letter was preparedjointly with representatives o f the public, who participated in
activities o fthe workgroup responsible for elaboration o fthe Letter.

One can expect that the open mechanism o f interaction between the Cabinet o f Ministers
and society will help to successfully implement PAL I1activities.

According to the decision o f the Cabinet o f Ministers o f Ukraine, the Ministry o f
Economy i s appointed as the PAL program implementingbody.

                           Ukraine: PublicInformationNotice

On May 14, 2003, the Executive Board o f the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultationwith Ukraine.b

Background
Real GDP grew by over 4% percent in2002, marking the third year o f Ukraine's economic
expansion following the 1998/99 financial crisis. As in 2001, growth was supported by
robust consumer spending, reflecting large wage increases, but also by an increase in net
external demand. Consumer price inflation fell to near zero in2002, reflecting primarily the
good harvests in 2001/02 and the resulting sharp drop in food prices. L o w inflation was
also supported by a tightening o f fiscal policy and delays in increasing administered prices,
as well as by continued exchange rate stability and rapid remonetization. Inflation has,
however, picked up inlate 2002 and early 2003.

The current account surplus increased significantly in2002. The trade balance was boosted
by a sharp increase in exports of grain and oil products. Recently imposed anti-dumping
measures by some trading partners led to a reorientation o f metals exports to markets in
Asia. Current transfers were boosted by workers remittances and World War I1
compensation payments, while private sector portfolio outflows increased. Inlate 2002, the
government augmented its 2007 Eurobond series by about US$350 million on a net basis,
but due to large amortization payments, public external debt continued to decline. Gross
international reserves increased to 2% months o f imports o f goods and s ervices by end-
2002.

National Bank of Ukraine (NBU) interventions kept the hryvnia constant against the U.S.
dollar. Following the sharp exchange rate adjustment in the wake o f the 1998/99 financial
crisis, the real effective  exchange rate has remained broadly stable. The strong
improvement inUkraine's trade and services balance suggests that competitiveness remains
adequate, as reflected inUkraine's comparatively low wage level.

Monetary aggregates continued to grow rapidly in 2002, fuelled by large unsterilized net
foreign exchange purchases by the NBU. Inresponse to falling inflation in2002, the NBU
reduced the refinancing rate and lowered reserve requirements. Strong growth in money
demand, evidenced by the large balance o f payments surplus, reflected growing public

confidence   and the continued remonetization o f the economy. The monetary expansion
contributed to the continuation o f very rapid loan growth in the banking sector. Recent
Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) missions found that this has weakened
banking sector capitalization and contributed to increased credit risk. Interest rates
decreased, but lending rates and spreads still remained high. The share of nonperforming
loans remains also relatively high.There was no significant change indollarization in2002.
The consolidated budget turned from a cash deficit o f 1%percent of GDP in 2001 to a
surplus o f % percent o f GDP in2002. Revenues increased sharply, partly due to highwage
growth and improvements in tax administration. However, the stock o f Value Added Tax
(VAT) refund arrears increased further, reaching 1% percent o f GDP at end-2002. A
significant shortfall in privatization receipts and large wage and pension increases led to
significant cuts in non-wage central government spending. Tax arrears increased, mainly
reflecting noncompliance in the energy sector and the inability to collect installments for
tax arrears restructured under the 2001 tax amnesty. The single treasury account was fully
implemented and some tax privileges were eliminated. Unfunded social mandates were
reinstated at the beginning o f 2002, although eligibility criteria were recently tightened,
targeting improved, and administration strengthened.

Progress on other structural reforms was mixed in 2002. Ongoing land reforms continued
to support growth in the agricultural sector. However, the broader privatization process
slowed down, partly reflecting the lack o f any large sales to strategic investors. The
restructuring o f energy debts and the privatization o f the remaining state-owned electricity
distributors were delayed. Cash collections reportedly increased to about 85-90 percent for
gas and electricity, but the energy sector accumulated significant tax arrears in 2002. The
staff estimates that the quasi-fiscal deficit in the energy sector was about 2% percent of
GDP, as reflected inthe increase in arrears to suppliers and the tax authorities. Inaddition,
the coal sector receives budgetary subsidies o f about 1percent o f GDP annually. The stock
o f debts and arrears o f state-owned energy companies amounted to an estimated 12 percent
o f GDP.


Executive Board Assessment

Executive Directors noted Ukraine's strong macroeconomic performance in 2002, marked
by robust GDP growth, low inflation, improved extemal position, and a rapid decline in
public debt. Directors commended the authorities for their prudent demand management
policies, including tight fiscal policy, but regretted that the authorities did not seize the
opportunity to accelerate structural reforms. Going forward, they urged the authorities to
maintain sound macroeconomic policies and to revive and accelerate structural reforms.

Directors considered that Ukraine's near-term outlook remains favorable, with economic
growth in 2003 expected to remain solid and the balance o f payments position strong.
Nevertheless, the economy remains vulnerable to a number o f risks. Directors noted the
incipient inflationary risks, reflecting the recent high monetary growth, the large increases
inthe minimumwage andthe wage bill, andthe likelyreversalo fseveral temporary factors
that kept inflation low in 2002. In addition, a delayed global recovery or macroeconomic
policy slippages could undermine economic performance and weaken the banking sector.

Directors noted that the remonetization o f the economy has contributed to recent
performance, and prudent debt policies have strengthened Ukraine's financial position.
However, domestic confidence must be sustained to support the current stance o f monetary
and exchange rate policy. Overall, Directors considered that strong policies will therefore
remain essential to protect the economy from any potential shocks and guarantee medium-
term sustainability.

Directors stressed that an acceleration o f structural reform will be necessary to improve the
investment climate, create an enabling environment for the private sector, and increase
productivity to achieve sustained economic growth and reduce poverty over the long term.
They noted recent progress in land reform and small and medium-scale enterprise
development and privatization. Among the priority areas requiring clear definition and
further action are reforms o f the tax system and the social safety net, a strengthening o f the
financial sector, reform of the energy sector, and improvements in transparency and
governance-not     only in the public sector but also in the private sector where there is a
particular need for sound corporate governance.

Directors considered that the proposed fiscal stance for 2003 i s appropriate. They
nevertheless expressed concern about several fiscal issues that should be resolved as soon
as possible. These include the continued accumulation o f VAT refund arrears, which is
jeopardizing tax compliance, exports, and the overall perception o f the rule o f law if it is
not reversed. They were also concerned about the large increase in government spending,
which could rise further in 2004 on the basis o f the new minimum wage law. They
considered that tax reform remains a highpriority, but were concerned by the implications
for the fiscal stance of rate-reducing reforms, which could constrain the scope for
reforming the social sector. Directors suggested that further increases in public sector
wages should be limited as much as possible, carefully phased, and linked to employment
rationalization, with the aim o fmaintaining a low fiscal deficit in2004.

Directors urged that, as part o f the planned tax reforms, rate reductions should be linked
with a broadening o f the tax base and elimination o f tax exemptions. They welcomed
recent changes to the profit tax as a step in the right direction. Directors urged the
authorities to work with parliament on further reforms, including the elimination o f tax
preferences under the VAT. In addition, they stressed the importance o f providing a stable
tax environment, which will need to involve greater accountability o f the tax authorities
and the rapid elimination o fthe stock o f VAT refund arrears.

Directors endorsed the primary focus o f monetary policy on keeping inflation low, and
commended the authorities for reducing inflation in 2002. Going forward, they urged the
authorities to monitor price trends closely, and to be ready to tighten monetary policy if
needed to keep inflation low. They supported greater central bank independence. Directors
agreed with the view that the hryvnia remains competitive. They urged the authorities to
move towards greater exchange rate flexibility to absorb shifts in either direction in money
demand and the balance of payments. They supported the authorities' intention to move
toward a more explicit inflation targeting regime over the longer term, with the further
development o f financial markets and a more predictable monetary transmission

mechanism.

Directors urgedthe authorities to implementthe main recommendations o f the,recent FSAP
missions to strengthen the banking system. High real interest rates and the still large share
of nonperforming loans are indications that credit risk remains pervasive and calls into
question the sustainability o f the recent rapid growth inbank credit. Directors endorsed the
importance o f proceeding with the strengthening o f the financial position o f a major bank
without further delay. Directors expressed concern about the M u ' s new long-term lending
facility, which may distort the credit market, limit the flexibility o f monetary policy, and
raise governance issues. They urged the NBU to focus its efforts on more fundamental
banking issues, including improving bankingsupervision, raising capital ratios, and moving
to close banks that do not meet prudential requirements. Directors welcomed recent steps to
bringUkraine's anti-money laundering legislation inline with Financial Action Task Force
recommendations, and urgedthe authorities to move swiftly to its full implementation.

Directors stressed the importance o f enhancing transparency, strengthening governance,
and creating a level playing field for all economic agents. They welcomed the authorities'
intention to accelerate the privatization process and urged that it be transparent and
competitive.

Directors cautioned that large quasi-fiscal deficits and debts in the energy sector,
manifested inthe continued accumulation o f tax and supplier arrears, constitute significant
risks to fiscal policy and call for ensuring hard budget constraints. Addressing these
problems will require greater transparency and accountability, especially with respect to the
state-owned gas monopoly, Naftogaz.

Directors supported the authorities' goal o fjoining the World Trade Organizationnext year.
They considered that the resulting progressive trade liberalization should help to strengthen
Ukraine's economy and underpinits further integration into the world economy.
Directors welcomed the recent improvements in economic statistics, and Ukraine's
subscription to the Special Data Dissemination Standard-the      first among the countries of
the Commonwealth of Independent States.

Directors commended the constructive dialogue between the Fund and the authorities
aimed at reaching agreement in the near future on a program under a precautionary
arrangementwith the Fund. A strengthening o f structural reforms, with broad ownership,
and policies to preserve macroeconomic stability will be an essential part o f such a
program.

Directors encouraged the authorities to continue to include collective action clauses intheir
future sovereign debt issuances.

 Under Article IV o f the IMF'sArticles o f Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members,
usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and
discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the
staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board. At the conclusion o f
the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman o f the Board, summarizes the views of Executive
Directors, and this summary i s transmitted to the country's authorities. This PIN summarizes the views o f
the Executive Board as expressed during the Executive Board discussion based on the staff report.
 More recent official estimates indicate that growth was 4.8%

   UKRAINE -IMF RELATIONS AND STAFF ASSESSMENT ECONOMICDEVELOPMENTS
                                                          OF


Ukraine'snear-termmacroeconomic outlookremainsbroadly favorable.Economic growth
has been strongthis year (seetable), despitethe poor harvest,and is expectedto be robust in
2004. Inflationhas increased,but remains in singledigits.The current accountsurplushas
remained large, and internationalreserveshaverisen rapidly.The centralbank has
maintained its defacto fixed exchangerate regime againstthe U.S. dollar, and the real
effectiveexchangerate has depreciatedmodestlyover the last 12months.

Macroeconomic stabilityhas been supportedby a prudent fiscal stance.The consolidated
budget is projectedto be broadlyin balancethis year. The draft2004 budget submittedto
parliament proposes a budget deficit of 11/2-2percent of GDP, but public debtratios would
still decline.

However, the veryhigh rates of money andcreditgrowthseen in recent years have
significantlyincreasedbanks' exposureto creditrisk. The shareof nonperformingloans is
high, and credit risk is worsened byextensiveforeigncurrency-denominatedlending.The
authorities are strengtheningprudentialregulations,includingthroughan increasein the
minimum capital adequacyratio, in line with IMF recommendations.

More generally,the sustainabilityof the currenteconomicexpansionwill depend on reforms
in key structuralareas.Progresshas been made with the approvalof new pension legislation
and reforms of the personal and corporateincome taxes.However, the tax environment
remains distortedby governanceproblems,VAT exemptions,and VATrefund arrears,which
jeopardizetax compliance,the outlookfor exports,and the overallperception of therule of
law. The energy sectorremains subjectto quasi-fiscaldeficitsand large debts, while reforms
have been slow, especiallyin the gas sector.

Discussionsbetween Fundstaff and the authoritieson a precautionarystand-byarrangement
are continuing.Preliminaryunderstandingson an economicprogram werereached in the
summer of 2003, but delaysin implementingprior actionshave so far preventedIMF Board
consideration.In particular,VATrefund arrearshave increasedrather than decreasedso far
this year, and the authoritieshavenot yet implementedmeasures to prevent a further
accumulationof arrears.Moreover,the agreedeliminationof key sectoralVAT exemptions
has been delayedby disagreementsbetweenthe governmentand parliament,which has
triggered two presidentialvetoes of the relevantlegislation.Substantialprogress in these
areas would be neededbefore Fund staff could recommendapprovalof a stand-by
arrangement,in line with the IMF's ExecutiveBoard assessmentat the time of the
conclusionof the 2003 Article IV consultation.

The authoritieshave not yet officiallycommunicatedto the IMF whether they intendto effect
earlyrepurchases fromthe IMF, asrecentlyproposedby the centralbank.
