objectives are to\n            rehabilitate NIOC's iron ore mining operations and\n            reestablish its financial viability. Beneficiated ore output\n            would be increased from 2.3 to 3.25 million long tons per\n            year, and infrastructure facilities would be improved and\n            equipment would be installed to reduce operating costs. The\n            project would improve the railroad to the port at Monrovia,\n            repair the St. Paul River railway bridge, and provide\n            additional mining and miscellaneous support equipment;\n            management and technical assistance to execute the project\n            and improve the Company's operations would also be\n            provided. The project would benefit about 2,000 workers\n            directly and some 16-18,000 people indirectly."}, "docdt": "1981-12-31T00:00:00Z"}
