The\n            project would improve the railroad to the port at Monrovia,\n            repair the St. Paul River railway bridge, and provide\n            additional mining and miscellaneous support equipment;\n            management and technical assistance to execute the project\n            and improve the Company's operations would also be\n            provided. The project would benefit about 2,000 workers\n            directly and some 16-18,000 people indirectly."}, "docdt": "1981-12-31T00:00:00Z"}
