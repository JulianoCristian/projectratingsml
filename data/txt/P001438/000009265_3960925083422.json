The Bank assisted\n            NIOC in all aspects of project preparation, including\n            technical aspects, securing of financing, restructuring of\n            the company and management arrangements. The Bank played a\n            key role in securing the financing package. The working\n            capital requirements of US$15 million was financed by\n            commercial banks. However, due to the highly risky situation\n            of NIOC and complexity of trust and insurance arrangements\n            it took about one year to secure this financing .Major\n            lessons learned include: (i) when preparing rehabilitation\n            projects and making an initial assessment of the\n            projects' financial and economic viability, provisions\n            should be made for possible further deterioration during the\n            period between preparation and start of implementation. (ii)\n            A corollary to lesson one is that rehabilitation of a\n            neglected capital stock is not only costly but costs are\n            difficult to estimate. Therefore, when making provisions for\n            asset renewals of a deteriorated capital stock careful\n            assumptions should be applied. Preparation of such programs\n            has to start early in the project cycle because they are\n            politically sensitive and require time to be agreed upon and\n            to be implemented."}, "docdt": "1987-03-09T00:00:00Z"}
