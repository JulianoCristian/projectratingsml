country's creditworthiness. The main areas covered\n            by the Government's program are: (i) strengthening the\n            public sector's financial position and restructuring\n            the social security system; (ii) improving public investment\n            programming and implementation; (iii) taking measures to\n            improve commercial bank and corporate finances; and (iv)\n            promoting export growth through export incentives and import\n            tariff reform. The foreign exchange provided under the loan\n            will be used to finance essential imports, excluding luxury\n            goods and military items."}, "docdt": "1987-05-18T00:00:00Z"}
