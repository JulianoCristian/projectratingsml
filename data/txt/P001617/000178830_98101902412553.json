"The proposed project would be the first\n            in the fertilizer sub-sector and be co-financed with IFAD.\n            It is designed to increase the productivity of the\n            smallholder by ensuring the reliable and timely availability\n            of fertilizer throughout Malawi. Specifically, the project\n            would help the Government realize this objective by: (a)\n            improving the Agricultural Development and Marketing\n            Corporation's (ADMARC) procedures for procuring and\n            distributing fertilizer; (b) establishing a fertilizer\n            revolving fund; (c) strengthening the institutional capacity\n            of the Ministry of Agriculture (MOA) and ADMARC; and (d)\n            setting in motion a process to bring about productive reform\n            of relevant sector policies. MOA would have overall\n            responsibility for project implementation. About 400,000\n            farm families would benefit from the project. The project\n            would also enable MOA to monitor and evaluate data on\n            fertilizer use and crop responses in order to develop\n            specific recommendations for individual crops, locations and\n            categories of farmers."}, "docdt": "1983-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
