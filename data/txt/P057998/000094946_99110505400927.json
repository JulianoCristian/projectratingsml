Reform and\n            Capacity Building Project in Cape Verde, will continue the\n            reform process, towards enabling private sector development.\n            The project is consistent with the Country Assistance\n            Strategy, in that it will assist towards macroeconomic\n            management capacity, and develop effective procedures for\n            public finance management to ensure a balanced budget. The\n            components thus include: 1) strengthening of macroeconomic\n            and public finance management, and expansion of legal and\n            regulatory reforms. The component will provide technical\n            assistance, training, and equipment, to foster statistical\n            planning and public finance control, and, to develop new\n            legal codes, and network courts; 2) preparation of a\n            strategic Public Administration Reform Action Plan, to\n            improve governance and institutional development, through\n            improved accountable public administration practices. A\n            study tour on government structures, and practices, in\n            comparable countries will be made available, and, technical\n            assistance for pilot reforms of the Ministry of Finance, and\n            the Ministry of Justice, will be provided."}, "docdt": "1999-10-26T00:00:00Z"}
