Reform\n            and Capacity Building Project for Cape Verde are as follows:\n            the outcome was satisfactory, the sustainability was\n            unlikely, the institutional development impact was modest,\n            the Bank performance was satisfactory and the borrower\n            performance was unsatisfactory. The lessons learned indicate\n            that while Cape Verde has shown better implementation\n            effectiveness than many other African countries, there is a\n            limit to how much more can be delivered with the existing\n            capacity. The Bank should therefore guard against\n            overestimating the borrower's capacity to implement.\n            Specifically, project designs should be simple. The\n            components should reflect only the highest priorities of the\n            government and not lump together all desirable public sector\n            issues to be resolved in one project in a country where\n            implementation capacity is limited. Ensuring ownership and\n            commitment of the borrower is a recurring theme in Bank\n            projects. It remains very difficult to ascertain ownership\n            and commitment beyond the desire of most borrowers to obtain\n            needed funds for projects. The relatively better job\n            conditions offered by the PIU in comparison to the public\n            sector made its staffing vulnerable to political\n            intervention. When implementing a Public Sector Reform\n            Project that may be politically sensitive and can have\n            adverse social implications for public service employees,\n            special attention should be paid to the timing of\n            implementation of the project in relation to the political\n            electoral cycles of the country. For such a project, a\n            significant period of implementation should not coincide\n            with the election period."}, "docdt": "2003-05-30T00:00:00Z"}
