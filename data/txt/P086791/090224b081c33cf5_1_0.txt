                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Bangladesh Reaching Out of School Children (ROSC) project has been implemented in country's 90 poorest upazilas (sub-districts with highest poverty rates and lowest enrolment
                         rates) to bring disadvantaged children back to school. These are the children who had missed out schooling at the right age or had been forced to drop out, mainly because of
                         poverty. Since 2005, the project has brought back 839,417 out-of-school children in 23,695 Learning Centers. More than half of beneficiaries are girls. The project blends formal

                         education with non-formal means of delivery to the young learners, providing them with an opportunity to complete grade five and transition to secondary education. It complements
                         the Government’s efforts under the Primary Education Development Program 3 (PEDP-3).

                         ROSC funding consisted of IDA's original Grant Financing of US$51 million in 2004, Additional Financing Credit of US$35 million approved in 2010, along with US$6 million Trust

                         Fund Co-financing from the Swiss Development Cooperation and the Bangladesh Government funding of US$5 million. The project provides grants to Learning Centers (LCs) and
                         stipend allowances to students. LCs are established and operated by communities through Center Management Committees, with support from government (upazila education
                         offices) and Education service and resource providers (NGOs).

                         The project has achieved its development objective with the following achievements in key performance indicators (KPIs): (a) 839,417 out-of-school children reached (against an end
                         line target of 750,000 for 2013); (b) 2.9 million student-years (against a target of 2.9 mil target, ‘student-years’ measures cumulative number of years students stay in schools and
                         receive project benefits); and (c) percentage of students reaching expected competency level in Bangla and Mathematics based on teacher assessment has reached 80% (against
                         target of 65%); (d) average student attendance rate of 90% (against target of 75%); (e) average grade completion rate of 90% (against target of 85%); (f) average teacher attendance
                         rate of 90% (against target of 90%); and (f) availability of textbooks (of the National Curriculum and Textbooks Board) for 99% of eligible students. The implementation progress is
                         commendable in view of satisfactory completion of planned activities on school level service delivery.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         This Project is closing in June 2013. A follow-on operation ROSC II financed by an IDA Credit of US$130 million - approved in October 2012 and made effective in January 2013 -
                         has started its implementation in 148 upazilas of the country. Based on recommendation of the project’s evaluation by Implementation, Monitoring and Evaluation Division (IMED),
                         the Government has decided to expand the ROSC approach in 100 new upazilas under ROSC-II project and adopt ROSC model in the rest of the country in rural areas in the Second
                         Chance Education Program under PEDP-3.
