                         Implementation Status Overview
                         To scale up the impact of a well-performing project, GOB and IDA renewed a joint commitment through Additional Financing of US$35 million to help all the current ROSC students
                         with an opportunity to complete the primary cycle and also enroll an additional 250,000 out-of-school children in 30 new upazilas. The original ROSC project has already enabled
                         enrollment of over 500,000 out-of-school children in 60 upazilas (sub-districts) with high incidence of poverty and low enrollment.

                         The major emphasis, in light of the additional financing, has been to ensure timely establishment and operationalization of the new Learning Centers in additional upazilas, and to
                         renew focus on education quality in existing learning centers. Reasonable progress has been made in both of these focus areas in the past 6 months.
