Out-of-School\n            Children Project for Bangladesh were as follows: outcomes\n            were satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was\n            negligible to low, the Bank performance was satisfactory,\n            and the Borrower performance was also satisfactory. Some\n            lessons learned included: changing approaches to service\n            delivery, putting communities which have long remained\n            disempowered at the center of the whole intervention, is\n            difficult to implement in any country setting, and\n            especially so in the context of Bangladesh. Analysis of the\n            political economy of vulnerable populations will help to\n            mitigate risks of such a proposed innovation agenda.\n            Monitoring all activities taking place simultaneously at\n            ground level is impossible; even more so when such\n            activities take place in the remotest and the most\n            disadvantaged areas of the country. The monitoring framework\n            needs to involve various stakeholders for monitoring at the\n            local level and procedures for cross-checking feedback from\n            multiple sources and resolution of data discrepancies. To\n            offset risk of inflating student numbers, it is\n            indispensable to have a mechanism that uniquely identifies\n            each student in the project and is coupled with the\n            Monitoring Information System (MIS). Mainstreaming select\n            survey instruments into the overall monitoring arrangements\n            and obtaining necessary information of other cross-sectoral\n            household surveys is necessary to ensure informed decision making."}, "docdt": "2013-12-23T00:00:00Z"}
