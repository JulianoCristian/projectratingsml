                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The Government of Bangladesh, with support from the World Bank, is implementing the ROSC project in 90 of the poorest upazilas to bring disadvantaged children back to school.
                         These are the children who had missed out schooling at the right age or had been forced to drop out, mainly because of poverty. These disadvantaged children, in upazilas with high
                         poverty and low enrollment rates, can now appear for the Grade 5 terminal examinations and transition to secondary education. Since 2005, the project has so far brought back more

                         The project blends formal education with non-formal means of delivery to the young learners, providing them with an opportunity to complete grade five and transition to secondary
                         education. IDA's original Grant Financing of US$51 million since 2004 and Additional Credit Financing of US$35 million since 2010 support the provision of grants to LCs and

                         Education service and resource providers (NGOs).

                         The project is on track to achieve its development objective with substantial progress in meeting key performance indicators. The implementation progress is commendable in view of
                         satisfactory completion of planned activities on school level service delivery.
