                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The Gambia Emergency Agriculture Production Project (EAPP) was approved on December 29, 2009 and became effective on March 01, 2010. The project is scheduled to close on
                         December 31, 2011. Overall the project has achieved more than the indicators targets such as quantity of seeds delivered, area in hectares cultivated, number of beneficiaries and
                         targeted production output. All mitigation measures agreed have been implemented. The rehabilitation of village storage facilities and seed multiplication centers has been launched
                         and should be completed by project closing. The Project unit has conducted the required visibility activities in close collaboration with local medias and full involvement of the EC
                         delegation in Banjul.
