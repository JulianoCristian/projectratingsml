The closing date for the GEAPP will be\n            extended from August 31, 2011 until December 31, 2011. This\n            trust Fund grant of US$ 7.5 million to the Republic of The\n            Gambia (Recipient) was made available by the European Union\n            Food Crisis Rapid Respond Facility Trust Fund under the\n            Global Food Crisis Response Program (the grant), of which\n            US$ 3.7 million remains undisbursed. The Grant became\n            effective on March 1, 2010. Such overall project objectives\n            remain unchanged and continue to be considered achievable as\n            progress in project implementation remains satisfactory. The\n            performance of the project coordination unit is also\n            satisfactory. Furthermore, there has been no suspension of\n            disbursement for this grant and there are no overdue audit\n            reports and interim financial reports. The extension is\n            necessary to provide the recipient with adequate\n            implementation time to complete all project activities and\n            the achievement of the project's objectives, including\n            the full rehabilitation of the 35 village seed storage\n            facilities and three seed multiplication centers envisaged\n            in the project."}, "docdt": "2011-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
